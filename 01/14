The literature shows that this kind of\nenvironments require enormous efforts to systematically explore large chunks of\nthe state space. Learned state representations can help here to improve the\nsearch by providing semantic context and build a structure on top of the raw\nobservations. In this work we introduce a novel time-myopic state\nrepresentation that clusters temporal close states together while providing a\ntime prediction capability between them. By adapting this model to the\nGo-Explore paradigm (Ecoffet et al., 2021b), we demonstrate the first learned\nstate representation that reliably estimates novelty instead of using the\nhand-crafted representation heuristic.

The idea is to run a changepoint\ndetection algorithm, and then re-use the same data to perform a test for a\nchange near each of the detected changes. By defining the p-value for the test\nappropriately, so that it is conditional on the information used to choose the\ntest, this approach will produce valid p-values. We show how to improve the\npower of these procedures by conditioning on less information. This gives rise\nto an ideal selective p-value that is intractable but can be approximated by\nMonte Carlo. We show that for any Monte Carlo sample size, this procedure\nproduces valid p-values, and empirically that noticeable increase in power is\npossible with only very modest Monte Carlo sample sizes. Our procedure is easy\nto implement given existing post-selection inference methods, as we just need\nto generate perturbations of the data set and re-apply the post-selection\nmethod to each of these.

Notably,\nwe use existing taxonomies of faults to build a set of mutation operators\nrelevant to RL and use a simple heuristic to generate test cases for RL. This\nallows us to compare different mutation killing definitions based on existing\napproaches, as well as to analyze the behavior of the obtained mutation\noperators and their potential combinations called Higher Order Mutation(s)\n(HOM). We show that the design choice of the mutation killing definition can\naffect whether or not a mutation is killed as well as the generated test cases.\nMoreover, we found that even with a relatively small number of test cases and\noperators we manage to generate HOM with interesting properties which can\nenhance testing capability in RL systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 16:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

Following much research, there are now almost matching\nupper and lower bounds for the trade-off needed between the number of samples\nand the space complexity of the algorithm, when the data streams are\nadversarial. However, in the case where the data stream is given in a random\norder, or is stochastic, only weaker lower bounds exist. In this work we close\nthis gap, up to logarithmic factors.\n  In order to do so we consider the needle problem, which is a natural hard\nproblem for frequency estimation studied in (Andoni et al. 2008, Crouch et al.\n2016). Here, the goal is to distinguish between two distributions over data\nstreams with $t$ samples. The first is uniform over a large enough domain. The\nsecond is a planted model; a secret ''needle'' is uniformly chosen, and then\neach element in the stream equals the needle with probability $p$, and\notherwise is uniformly chosen from the domain. It is simple to design streaming\nalgorithms that distinguish the distributions using space $s \\approx 1/(p^2\nt)$. It was unclear if this is tight, as the existing lower bounds are weaker.\nWe close this gap and show that the trade-off is near optimal, up to a\nlogarithmic factor.\n  Our proof builds and extends classical connections between streaming\nalgorithms and communication complexity, concretely multi-party unique\nset-disjointness. We introduce two new ingredients that allow us to prove sharp\nbounds. The first is a lower bound for an asymmetric version of multi-party\nunique set-disjointness, where players receive input sets of different sizes,\nand where the communication of each player is normalized relative to their\ninput length. The second is a combinatorial technique that allows to sample\nneedles in the planted model by first sampling intervals, and then sampling a\nuniform needle in each interval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 16:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

Our primary contribution is methodological; we introduce and evaluate\ntwo non-parametric methods to produce a summary statistic for character\ndistinctiveness that can be usefully applied and compared across languages and\ntimes. Our first method is based on bootstrap distances between 3-gram\nprobability distributions, the second (reminiscent of 'unmasking' techniques)\non word keyness curves. Both methods are validated and explored by applying\nthem to a reasonably large corpus (a subset of DraCor): we analyse 3301\ncharacters drawn from 2324 works, covering five centuries and four languages\n(French, German, Russian, and the works of Shakespeare). Both methods appear\nuseful; the 3-gram method is statistically more powerful but the word keyness\nmethod offers rich interpretability. Both methods are able to capture\nphonological differences such as accent or dialect, as well as broad\ndifferences in topic and lexical richness. Based on exploratory analysis, we\nfind that smaller characters tend to be more distinctive, and that women are\ncross-linguistically more distinctive than men, with this latter finding\ncarefully interrogated using multiple regression. This greater distinctiveness\nstems from a historical tendency for female characters to be restricted to an\n'internal narrative domain' covering mainly direct discourse and\nfamily/romantic themes.

Here we\npresent a study of local symmetry breaking of the lattice structure in the\nlayered dichalcogenide material 1T-TaS$_{2}$ using x-ray pair-distribution\nfunction measurements.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating an\nempirical distribution in a setting with two challenging features. First, the\nalgorithm does not directly observe the data; instead, it only asks a limited\nnumber of threshold queries about each sample. Second, the data are not assumed\nto be independent and identically distributed; instead, we allow for an\narbitrary process generating the samples, including an adaptive adversary.\nThese considerations are relevant, for example, when modeling a seller\nexperimenting with posted prices to estimate the distribution of consumers'\nwillingness to pay for a product: offering a price and observing a consumer's\npurchase decision is equivalent to asking a single threshold query about their\nvalue, and the distribution of consumers' values may be non-stationary over\ntime, as early adopters may differ markedly from late adopters.\n  Our main result quantifies, to within a constant factor, the sample\ncomplexity of estimating the empirical CDF of a sequence of elements of $[n]$,\nup to $\\varepsilon$ additive error, using one threshold query per sample. The\ncomplexity depends only logarithmically on $n$, and our result can be\ninterpreted as extending the existing logarithmic-complexity results for noisy\nbinary search to the more challenging setting where noise is non-stochastic.\nAlong the way to designing our algorithm, we consider a more general model in\nwhich the algorithm is allowed to make a limited number of simultaneous\nthreshold queries on each sample. We solve this problem using Blackwell's\nApproachability Theorem and the exponential weights method. As a side result of\nindependent interest, we characterize the minimum number of simultaneous\nthreshold queries required by deterministic CDF estimation algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 18:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

Insofar as neutron diffraction and\nRaman spectroscopy experiments are concern, four structures are well\ncharacterized with three transitions: Pnma to Imma [563 K] to R-3c [673 K] to\nPm-3m [1173 K]. In contrast, thermoanalytical methods showed multiple\nsingularities corresponding to at-least three more structural transitions at\naround 830 K, 900 K, and 1030 K. In account of these conflicting experimental\nfindings, we computed free energy phase diagram for BaCeO3 employing crystal\nstructure data mining in conjunction with first principles electronic structure\nand phonon lattice dynamics.

At any temperature, two alternate tetragonal\nphases (P42/nmc and I4/mcm) are also found to be 20 to 30 meV less favored than\nthe Pnma. While the calculated stability order of the predicted polymorphs is\nin acceptable agreement with the results of neutron diffraction, the\ntransitions observed in thermoanalytical studies could be ascribed to the\ndevelopment of four novel phases (Cmcm, P4/mbm, P42/nmc, and I4/mcm) at\nintermediate temperatures.

We analytically solve the one-dimensional advection equation and derive\nan explicit expression that describes the depletion of carbonaceous material in\nsolids under the influence of radial and vertical transport. We find both\ndepletion mechanisms individually fail to reproduce Solar System abundances\nunder typical conditions. While radial transport only marginally restricts\nphotodecomposition, it is the inefficient vertical transport that limits carbon\ndepletion under these conditions. We show explicitly that an increase in the\nvertical mixing efficiency, and/or an increase in the directly irradiated disk\nvolume, favors carbon depletion. Thermal decomposition requires a hot inner\ndisk (> 500 K) beyond 3 AU to deplete the formation region of Earth and\nchondrites. We find FU Ori-type outbursts to produce these conditions such that\nmoderately refractory compounds are depleted. However, such outbursts likely do\nnot deplete the most refractory carbonaceous compounds beyond the innermost\ndisk region. Hence, the refractory carbon abundance at 1 AU typically does not\nreach terrestrial levels. Nevertheless, under specific conditions, we find\nphotolysis and pyrolysis combined to reproduce Solar System abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 18:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

The ZX-calculus is sound for qubit quantum mechanics. Hence,\nequality of diagrams under ZX-equivalent transformations lifts to an equality\nof corresponding equations over matrices. Conversely, in 2014 Backens proved\ncompleteness, establishing that any derivation done in stabilizer quantum\nmechanics with matrices can be derived graphically using the ZX-calculus. A\ngraphical rewrite system that is both confluent and also terminates uniquely is\ncalled canonical: Applying alternate sequences of rewrites to the same initial\ndiagram, a rewrite system is confluent whenever all resulting diagrams can be\nmanipulated to establish graphical equivalence. Here we show that a reduced\nZX-rewrite system is already confluent in the Heisenberg picture for stabilizer\nquantum mechanics. Moreover, any application of a subset of ZX-rewrites\nterminates uniquely and irrespective of the order of term rewrites in the\nHeisenberg picture for stabilizer quantum mechanics. The ZX-system is hence\nHeisenberg-canonical for stabiliser quantum mechanics.

The\n$R_{\\rm{eff}}$ of galaxies in the PAH-band are slightly smaller ($\\sim$10\\%)\nthan those in F160W for galaxies with $\\rm{M_*\\gtrsim10^{9.5}~M_\\odot}$ at\n$z\\leq1.2$, but the PAH-band and F160W have a similar fractions of light within\n1 kpc. In contrast, the $R_{\\rm{eff}}$ of galaxies in the NUV-band are larger,\nwith lower fractions of light within 1 kpc compared to F160W for galaxies at\n$z\\leq1.2$. Using the MIRI data to estimate the $\\rm{SFR_{\\rm{IR}}}$ surface\ndensity, we find the correlation between the $\\rm{SFR_{\\rm{IR}}}$ surface\ndensity and stellar mass has a steeper slope than that of the\n$\\rm{SFR_{\\rm{UV}}}$ surface density and stellar mass, suggesting more massive\ngalaxies having increasing amounts of obscured fraction of star formation in\ntheir inner regions. This paper demonstrates how the high-angular resolution\ndata from JWST/MIRI can reveal new information about the morphology of\nobscured-star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 19:03:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 21:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Despite the fast developments of multi-fidelity fusion\ntechniques, most existing methods require particular data structures and do not\nscale well to high-dimensional output. To resolve these issues, we generalize\nthe classic autoregression (AR), which is wildly used due to its simplicity,\nrobustness, accuracy, and tractability, and propose generalized autoregression\n(GAR) using tensor formulation and latent features. GAR can deal with arbitrary\ndimensional outputs and arbitrary multifidelity data structure to satisfy the\ndemand of multi-fidelity fusion for complex problems; it admits a fully\ntractable likelihood and posterior requiring no approximate inference and\nscales well to high-dimensional problems.

The impact of the wake on the aerodynamics and loads of\nthe rear wing segment is then studied, with a spectral analysis of its lift and\nsurface pressure oscillations. Finally, the influence of the position and the\nincidence angle of the rear wing segment are investigated. For the considered\nflow conditions, 2D buffet is present on the front wing segment. During the\ndownstream movement of the shock, the amount of separation reaches its minimum\nand small vortices are present in the wake.

We expect that the\nenvisioned framework will contribute to the design of more reproducible and\ntrustworthy workflows for diverse scientific applications, and ultimately,\naccelerate scientific discoveries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 21:24:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 22:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

To bridge this research gap, this\nstudy investigates in a wind tunnel the effects of tree-to-canyon foliage cover\nand relative height (0.32-1.1 times canyon height), mimicking growth of trees,\non conditions in street canyons during moderate and extreme heat. The results\nreveal that trees may affect canyon-wide ventilation and heat removal in two\ndifferent scenarios. First, when canyons are in isothermal conditions, medium\nand large trees, that fill half the canyon height or reach slightly above the\ncanyon, decelerate the shear layer and weaken the vortical flow, as a result\nreducing the canyon-wide ventilation. Second, in extreme heat conditions,\nmedium and large trees trap heat at the pedestrian level due to the blockage of\nair entrainment and the suppression of upward buoyancy-driven flow from the\nground surface. An air temperature rise that corresponds to 1.5 degree Celsius\nin a full-scale urban setting is observed in measurements. These observations\nsuggest that urban trees' foliage cover must be managed for a canyon's optimal\nventilation and heat removal during nighttime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 21:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Dual energy\nradiography systems enable a rough elemental analysis of cargo containers due\nto the $Z$-dependence of photon attenuation, allowing for improved material\ndetection. This work studies the theoretical capabilities for atomic number\ndiscrimination using dual energy systems by considering three case studies:\ndual energy $\\{6, 4\\}$ MeV bremsstrahlung beams, dual energy $\\{10, 6\\}$ MeV\nbremsstrahlung beams, and dual energy $\\{10, 4\\}$ MeV bremsstrahlung beams.\nResults of this analysis show that two different materials can sometimes\nproduce identical measurements due to competition between photoelectric\nabsorption and pair production, leading to a fundamental ambiguity when\ndifferentiating between materials of vastly different atomic numbers. This\nnon-uniqueness property is present at low area densities and at high-$Z$.\nFurthermore, this analysis suggests that atomic number discrimination becomes\nsignificantly more challenging as atomic number increases. The dual energy\n$\\{10, 4\\}$ MeV bremsstrahlung case study showed significantly improved atomic\nnumber discrimination capabilities compared to the dual energy $\\{10, 6\\}$ MeV\nand $\\{6, 4\\}$ MeV case studies due to the increased prevalence of pair\nproduction in the high energy beam when compared to the low energy beam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 22:56:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 16:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

In the present work, we use resonantly enhanced deep-UV\nsecond harmonic generation spectroscopy to measure the Gibbs free energy of\nadsorption of both carbonate ($CO_3^{2-}$) and bicarbonate $(HCO_3^-)$ anions\nto the air-water interface. Contrasting the predictions of classical\nelectrostatic theory, and in support of our previous findings from X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy, we find that carbonate anions do indeed exhibit\nmuch stronger surface affinity than do the bicarbonate anions.

In this work, we\npropose a dynamic memory management strategy that is optimized for the\nincremental phases and different object classes. We call our method reinforced\nmemory management (RMM), leveraging reinforcement learning. RMM training is not\nnaturally compatible with CIL as the past, and future data are strictly\nnon-accessible during the incremental phases. We solve this by training the\npolicy function of RMM on pseudo CIL tasks, e.g., the tasks built on the data\nof the 0-th phase, and then applying it to target tasks. RMM propagates two\nlevels of actions: Level-1 determines how to split the memory between old and\nnew classes, and Level-2 allocates memory for each specific class. In essence,\nit is an optimizable and general method for memory management that can be used\nin any replaying-based CIL method.

A\ngame-theoretic model is developed to characterize the intimate interactions\nbetween the ride-hailing platform, the transit agency, and multiclass\npassengers with distinct income levels. An algorithm is proposed to compute the\nNash equilibrium of the game and conduct an ex-post evaluation of the\nperformance of the obtained solution.

However, in low dimensional settings, a severe spectral bias occurs\nthat obstructs convergence to high frequency components entirely. In order to\novercome this limitation, one can encode the inputs using a high frequency\nsinusoidal encoding.

The results of the\nstudy are used to propose a potential mitigation strategy based on ventilation\nthermal control to reduce the risk of airborne transmission in these types of\nenclosed indoor spaces. Our findings demonstrate that as the ventilation rate\n(Qv) increases, the efficiency of removing airborne particles (Ep) initially\nincreases rapidly, reaches a plateau (Ep,c) at a critical ventilation rate\n(Qc), and subsequently increases at a slower rate beyond Qc. The Qc for\nlow-ceiling rooms is lower compared to high-ceiling rooms due to the increased\ninteraction between the thermal plume generated by the occupants or infectors\nand the ventilation. Further analysis of the flow and temperature fields\nreveals that Ep is closely linked to the thermal stratification fields, as\ncharacterized by the thermal interface height, the height of the temperature\nisosurface, and temperature gradient. The simulations also indicate that the\nlocation of infector relative to ventilation inlet/outlet affects Qc and Ep,c\nwith higher Qc and lower Ep,c observed when infector is in a corner due to\npotential formation of a local hot spot of high infection risk when infector is\nnear the ventilation inlet.

First we highlight a special structure in the pristine solar\nwind, termed a low Mach-number boundary layer (LMBL). An increased Alfv\\'en\nradius and suppressed SBs are observed within an LMBL. A probable source on the\nSun for an LMBL is the peripheral region inside a coronal hole with rapidly\ndiverging open fields. The sub-Alfv\\'enic wind detected by PSP is an LMBL flow\nby nature. The similar origin and similar properties of the sub-Alfv\\'enic\nintervals favor a wrinkled surface for the morphology of the Alfv\\'enic\ntransition. We find that a larger deflection angle tends to be associated with\na higher Alfv\\'en Mach number. The magnetic deflections have an origin well\nbelow the Alfv\\'en critical point, and deflection angles larger than\n$90^{\\circ}$ seem to occur only when $M_{\\rm A} \\gtrsim 2$. The velocity\nenhancement in units of the local Alfv\\'en speed generally increases with the\ndeflection angle, which is explained by a simple model. A nonlinearly evolved,\nsaturated state is revealed for SBs, where the local Alfv\\'en speed is roughly\nan upper bound for the velocity enhancement. In the context of these results,\nthe most promising theory on the origin of SBs is the model of expanding waves\nand turbulence, and the patchy distribution of SBs is attributed to modulation\nby reductions in the Alfv\\'en Mach number. Finally, a picture on the generation\nand evolution of SBs is created based on the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2023 06:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Traditional approaches to\nlearning a set of graphs heavily rely on hand-crafted features, such as\nsubstructures. But while these methods benefit from good interpretability, they\noften suffer from computational bottlenecks as they cannot skirt the graph\nisomorphism problem. Conversely, deep learning has helped graph-level learning\nadapt to the growing scale of graphs by extracting features automatically and\nencoding graphs into low-dimensional representations. As a result, these deep\ngraph learning methods have been responsible for many successes. Yet, there is\nno comprehensive survey that reviews graph-level learning starting with\ntraditional learning and moving through to the deep learning approaches. This\narticle fills this gap and frames the representative algorithms into a\nsystematic taxonomy covering traditional learning, graph-level deep neural\nnetworks, graph-level graph neural networks, and graph pooling.

To support data backup, popular industrial IMKVSes\nperiodically take a point-in-time snapshot of the in-memory data with the\nsystem call fork. However, this mechanism can result in latency spikes for\nqueries arriving during the snapshot period because fork leads the engine into\nthe kernel mode in which the engine is out-of-service for queries. In contrast\nto existing research focusing on optimizing snapshot algorithms, we optimize\nthe fork operation to address the latency spikes problem from the operating\nsystem (OS) level, while keeping the data persistent mechanism in IMKVSes\nunchanged. Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth study to reveal the\nimpact of the fork operation as well as the optimization techniques on query\nlatency. Based on findings in the study, we propose Async-fork to offload the\nwork of copying the page table from the engine (the parent process) to the\nchild process as copying the page table dominates the execution time of fork.\nTo keep data consistent between the parent and the child, we design the\nproactive synchronization strategy.

The early auditory analysis considers\nspectrogram-based representation whereas cortex-based analysis includes\nextraction of temporal modulations from the spectrogram. This temporal\nmodulation representation of spectrogram is called modulation spectral feature\n(MSF). As the constant-Q transform (CQT) provides higher resolution at emotion\nsalient low-frequency regions of speech, we find that CQT-based spectrogram,\ntogether with its temporal modulations, provides a representation enriched with\nemotion-specific information.

Our approach is inspired by\nrecent developments in algorithm unrolling using deep neural networks (NNs),\nand relies on two distinct sub-networks. The first sub-network estimates the\nregularization parameter-map from the input data. The second sub-network\nunrolls $T$ iterations of an iterative algorithm which approximately solves the\ncorresponding TV-minimization problem incorporating the previously estimated\nregularization parameter-map. The overall network is trained end-to-end in a\nsupervised learning fashion using pairs of clean-corrupted data but crucially\nwithout the need of having access to labels for the optimal regularization\nparameter-maps.

This highlights that the Mott transition is\ntied to the CDW structural distortion, although earlier studies have shown that\nthe collapse of Mott and CDW phases are decoupled from each other.\nInterestingly, as the suppressed order starts to recover, a long-lived\nmetastable phase emerges before the material recovers to the ground state. Our\nresults demonstrate that it is the CDW lattice order that drives the material\ninto this metastable phase, which is indeed a commensurate CDW-Mott insulating\nphase but with a smaller CDW amplitude. Moreover, we find that the long-lived\nstate emerges only under strong photoexcitation and has no evidence when the\nphotoexcitation strength is weak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2023 11:28:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 12:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Since both the\nsyllable and its acoustic correlate, i.e., the speech envelope, have a\npreferred range of rhythmicity between 4 and 8 Hz, it is hypothesized that\ntheta-band neural oscillations play a major role in extracting syllables based\non the envelope. A literature survey, however, reveals inconsistent evidence\nabout the relationship between speech envelope and syllables, and the current\nstudy revisits this question by analyzing large speech corpora. It is shown\nthat the center frequency of speech envelope, characterized by the modulation\nspectrum, reliably correlates with the rate of syllables only when the analysis\nis pooled over minutes of speech recordings. In contrast, in the time domain, a\ncomponent of the speech envelope is reliably phase-locked to syllable onsets.\nBased on a speaker-independent model, the timing of syllable onsets explains\nabout 24% variance of the speech envelope.

Due to the effects of\ngravity on three spacecrafts, it is hard to maintain the equality of the arm\nlength, so the time-delay interferometry (TDI) method is needed to cancel out\nthe laser frequency noise for space-based GW detectors. By considering the\nfirst-generation TDI combination, we employ the Fisher information matrix to\nstudy the accuracy of sky localizations for future space-based GW detectors and\ntheir combined network. The main difference between future space-based GW\ndetectors includes the time-changing orientation of the detector plane, the arm\nlength, the orbital period of spacecrafts and the noise curve. We study the\neffects of these factors on the accuracy of source localization at different\nfrequencies. We find that the amplitude modulation caused by the rotation of\nthe detector plane can help LISA and Taiji not only to improve the accuracy of\nsource localization but also to enlarge the sky coverage at frequencies below 1\nmHz. As the frequency of monochromatic GWs increases, the Doppler modulation\nbecomes dominate and the equatorial pattern appears in the sky map.

This is very\nadequate when the experimental protocol assumes that both GT and HTR text lines\nare the same, which allows edit distances to be independently computed to each\ngiven line. Driven by recent advances in pattern recognition, HTR systems\nincreasingly face the end-to-end page-level transcription of a document, where\nthe precision of locating the different text lines and their corresponding\nreading order (RO) play a key role. In such a case, the standard metrics do not\ntake into account the inconsistencies that might appear. In this paper, the\nproblem of evaluating HTR systems at the page level is introduced in detail.

The randomized arcade processes can thus be\ninterpreted as a generalization of anticipative stochastic bridges. The\nfiltrations generated by these processes are utilized to construct a class of\nmartingales which interpolate between the given target random variables. These\nso-called filtered arcade martingales (FAMs) are almost-sure solutions to the\nmartingale interpolation problem and reveal an underlying stochastic filtering\nstructure. In the special case of nearly-Markov randomized arcade processes,\nthe dynamics of FAMs are informed through Bayesian updating.

Here we demonstrate that even in a\nMARL setting where agents share a common global state in addition to their\nlocal states evolving conditionally independently (thus introducing a\ncorrelation between the state transition processes of individual agents), the\nMFC can still be applied as a good approximation tool.

Standard examples of such features are found in the mean velocity\nprofiles of turbulent flow in channels, pipes or boundary layers. The aim of\nthis review article is to expound the essence of some elementary theoretical\nefforts in this regard. Possibly the best known of them, and certainly the\nsimplest, is the argument (obtained independently) by Izakson (1937) and\nMillikan (1939). They showed that if an inner scaling and an outer scaling for\nthe profile are valid near the wall and near the center of the flow (or the\nedge of the boundary layer), respectively, and if there is an overlap region\nwhere both scalings are valid, then the profile must be logarithmic in that\ncommon region. That theoretical justification has been used and expanded upon\nby innumerable authors for over 60 years, and at the present time is still\nrightly enjoying popularity.\n  Although background discussions of several related topics are included in the\npresent article, for example the classical ideas of Prandtl and von Karman, the\nmain foci will be on (i) a careful examination of the Izakson-Millikan\nargument, together with a presentation of a better mathematical justification\nfor its conclusion; and (ii) a detailed clarification of a newer approach to\ngaining theoretical understanding of the mean velocity and Reynolds stress\nprofiles based on the search for scaling patches.\n  The two approaches share common goals, they are both heavily involved with\nscaling concepts, and many results are similar, but the logical trains of\nthought are entirely different.

Recently,\nreinforcement learning in financial markets (FinRL) has emerged as a promising\ndirection to train agents for making profitable investment decisions. However,\nthe evaluation of most FinRL methods only focuses on profit-related measures\nand ignores many critical axes, which are far from satisfactory for financial\npractitioners to deploy these methods into real-world financial markets.\nTherefore, we introduce PRUDEX-Compass, which has 6 axes, i.e., Profitability,\nRisk-control, Universality, Diversity, rEliability, and eXplainability, with a\ntotal of 17 measures for a systematic evaluation. Specifically, i) we propose\nAlphaMix+ as a strong FinRL baseline, which leverages mixture-of-experts (MoE)\nand risk-sensitive approaches to make diversified risk-aware investment\ndecisions, ii) we evaluate 8 FinRL methods in 4 long-term real-world datasets\nof influential financial markets to demonstrate the usage of our\nPRUDEX-Compass, iii) PRUDEX-Compass together with 4 real-world datasets,\nstandard implementation of 8 FinRL methods and a portfolio management\nenvironment is released as public resources to facilitate the design and\ncomparison of new FinRL methods. We hope that PRUDEX-Compass can not only shed\nlight on future FinRL research to prevent untrustworthy results from stagnating\nFinRL into successful industry deployment but also provide a new challenging\nalgorithm evaluation scenario for the reinforcement learning (RL) community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2023 06:39:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 20:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

The study is performed in the context of sensor\nand IoT networks with ultra low complexity wireless transceivers. The paper\nintroduces the use of RL and Multi Armed Bandit (MAB), a specific type of RL,\nfor Medium Access Control (MAC) under different network and traffic conditions.\nIt then introduces a novel learning based protocol synthesis framework that\naddresses specific difficulties and limitations in medium access for both\nrandom access and time slotted networks. The mechanism does not rely on carrier\nsensing, network time-synchronization, collision detection, and other low level\ncomplex operations, thus making it ideal for ultra simple transceiver hardware\nused in resource constrained sensor and IoT networks. Additionally, the ability\nof independent protocol learning by the nodes makes the system robust and\nadaptive to the changes in network and traffic conditions. It is shown that the\nnodes can be trained to learn to avoid collisions, and to achieve network\nthroughputs that are comparable to ALOHA based access protocols in sensor and\nIoT networks with simplest transceiver hardware. It is also shown that using\nRL, it is feasible to synthesize access protocols that can sustain network\nthroughput at high traffic loads, which is not feasible in the ALOHA-based\nsystems. The ability of the system to provide throughput fairness under network\nand traffic heterogeneities are also experimentally demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2023 03:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

The developed protocol has two primary\ncomponents: a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based slot allocation mechanism for\ncollision free transmission, and a Decentralized Defragmented Slot Backshift\n(DDSB) operation for improving bandwidth usage efficiency. The proposed\nframework is decentralized in that each node finds its transmission schedule\nindependently without the control of any centralized arbitrator. The developed\nmechanism is suitable for networks with or without time synchronization, thus,\nmaking it suitable for low-complexity wireless transceivers for wireless sensor\nand IoT nodes. This framework is able to manage the trade-off between learning\nconvergence time and bandwidth. In addition, it allows the nodes to adapt to\ntopological changes while maintaining efficient bandwidth usage. The developed\nlogic is tested for both fully-connected and arbitrary mesh networks with\nextensive simulation experiments. It is shown how the nodes can learn to select\ncollision-free transmission slots using MAB. Moreover, the nodes learn to\nself-adjust their transmission schedules using a novel DDSB framework in order\nto reduce bandwidth usage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2023 03:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}
