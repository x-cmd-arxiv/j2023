But\nspecifying goals and restrictions for AI behavior is difficult. Similar to how\nparties to a legal contract cannot foresee every potential \"if-then\"\ncontingency of their future relationship, we cannot specify desired AI behavior\nfor all circumstances. Legal standards facilitate robust communication of\ninherently vague and underspecified goals. Instructions (in the case of\nlanguage models, \"prompts\") that employ legal standards will allow AI agents to\ndevelop shared understandings of the spirit of a directive that generalize\nexpectations regarding acceptable actions to take in unspecified states of the\nworld. Standards have built-in context that is lacking from other goal\nspecification languages, such as plain language and programming languages.\nThrough an empirical study on thousands of evaluation labels we constructed\nfrom U.S. court opinions, we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) are\nbeginning to exhibit an \"understanding\" of one of the most relevant legal\nstandards for AI agents: fiduciary obligations. Performance comparisons across\nmodels suggest that, as LLMs continue to exhibit improved core capabilities,\ntheir legal standards understanding will also continue to improve. OpenAI's\nlatest LLM has 78% accuracy on our data, their previous release has 73%\naccuracy, and a model from their 2020 GPT-3 paper has 27% accuracy (worse than\nrandom). Our research is an initial step toward a framework for evaluating AI\nunderstanding of legal standards more broadly, and for conducting reinforcement\nlearning with legal feedback (RLLF).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 16:03:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 18:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

More precisely,\nconditioned on the field $Y$, the extremal functional shows exactly how the\nextremal clustering of the (conditional) stochastic volatility field is given\nin terms of the extremal clustering of the regularly varying field $Z$ and the\nrealization of $Y$.\n  Secondly, we construct two different cluster counting processes on a fixed,\nfull-dimensional set with boundary of Lebesgue measure zero: By means of a\ncoordinate-dependent upscaling of subsets, we systematically count the number\nof relevant clusters with an extreme observation. We show that both cluster\nprocesses converge to a Poisson point process with intensity given in terms of\nthe extremal functional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 16:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

We consider the problem of federated image\nclassification and study the performance and privacy challenges with existing\nfederated SSL (FSSL) approaches. Firstly, we note that even state-of-the-art\nFSSL algorithms can trivially compromise client privacy and other real-world\nconstraints such as client statelessness and communication cost. Secondly, we\nobserve that it is challenging to integrate EMA (Exponential Moving Average)\nupdates into the federated setting, which comes at a trade-off between\nperformance and communication cost.

While the toward and\naway regions contain the fragmentation products of the near-side and away-side\njets, respectively, the transverse region is dominated by particles from the\nUnderlying Event (UE). The relative transverse activity classifier, $R_{\\rm T}\n= N_{\\rm T} / \\langle N_{\\rm T} \\rangle$, is used to group events according to\ntheir UE activity, where $N_{\\rm T}$ is the measured charged-particle\nmultiplicity per event in the transverse region and $\\langle N_{\\rm T} \\rangle$\nis the mean value over all the analysed events.

However, it is generally not known how to compute such quantities, since\nthe quantum channel coherent information is not additive for all channels,\nimplying that it must be maximized over an unbounded number of channel uses.\nThis leads to the phenomenon known as superadditivity, which refers to the fact\nthat the regularized coherent information of $n$ channel uses exceeds one-shot\ncoherent information. In this article, we study how the gain in quantum\ncapacity of qudit depolarizing channels relates to the dimension of the systems\nconsidered. We make use of an argument based on the no-cloning bound in order\nto proof that the possible superadditive effects decrease as a function of the\ndimension for such family of channels. In addition, we prove that the capacity\nof the qudit depolarizing channel coincides with the coherent information when\n$d\\rightarrow\\infty$. We also discuss the private classical capacity and obain\nsimilar results. We conclude that when high dimensional qudits experiencing\ndepolarizing noise are considered, the coherent information of the channel is\nnot only an achievable rate but essentially the maximum possible rate for any\nquantum block code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 16:54:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 16:01:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 13:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Different ``flavours'' of freestream turbulence, in which the turbulence\nintensity and integral length scale are independently varied, are subjected to\nthe cylinder. The time-averaged spreading of the near wake is decoupled into\nthe growth through entrainment and the envelope of the spatial extent of the\ninstantaneous wake due to wake ``meandering'', induced by the presence of\nlarge-scale coherent structures, i.e. the von Karman vortex street. Unlike for\nthe far field of a turbulent wake, examined by Kankanwadi and Buxton (2020), it\nis shown that freestream turbulence enhances the entrainment rate into the wake\nin comparison to a non-turbulent background. Both the turbulence intensity and\nthe integral length scale of the background turbulence are important in this\nregard, contrasting to the far wake where only the turbulence intensity is\nimportant. Additionally, wake meandering is enhanced by the presence of\nbackground turbulence, and here the integral length scale is the dominant\nparameter. Combining these findings yields the oft-reported result that\nbackground turbulence enhances the time-averaged near-wake growth rate. The\ninfluence of wake meandering is isolated by conducting similar experiments in\nwhich a splitter plate is mounted to the rear face of the cylinder, thereby\neliminating the von Karman vortex street. These results show that when\nlarge-scale vortices aren't present within the turbulent wake then freestream\nturbulence actually suppresses the entrainment rate, relative to a\nnon-turbulent background, in results that mirror Kankanwadi and Buxton (2020).\nWe therefore postulate that freestream turbulence has the effect to enhance\nlarge-scale entrainment via engulfment, but suppress entrainment via\nsmall-scale nibbling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 17:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

While elementary particles have been posited to\nexplain DM, compact astrophysical objects such as black holes formed in the\nearly universe offer a theoretically appealing alternate route. Here, we\nconstrain the fraction of DM that can be made up of primordial black holes\n(PBHs) with masses $M \\gtrsim 0.01 M_\\odot$, using the Type Ia supernova Hubble\ndiagram. Utilizing the Dyer-Roeder distance relation, where the homogeneous\nmatter fraction is parameterized with $\\eta$, we find a maximum fractional\namount of DM in compact objects ($f_p$) of 0.50 at 95\\% confidence level\n(C.L.), in the flat $\\Lambda$CDM model and 0.49 when marginalising over a\nconstant dark energy equation of state. These limits do not change when\nmarginalising over cosmic curvature, demonstrating the robustness to the\ncosmological model. When allowing for the prior on $\\eta$ to include $\\eta >\n1$, we derive $f_p < 0.32$ at 95$\\%$ C.L., showing that the prior assumption of\n$\\eta \\leq 1$ gives a conservative upper limit on $f_p$.

We find that only scenario\n(4) reproduces the observed structure and location of Mercury's dust ring.\nHowever, the lifetimes of Mercury's co-orbitals (<20 Ma) preclude the\nprimordial origin of the co-orbiting source population due to dynamical\ninstability and meteoroid bombardment, demanding a recent event feeding the\nobserved dust ring.\n  We find that an impact on Mercury can eject debris into the co-orbital\nresonance.

Today, projection-based methods leverage 2D CNNs but\nrecent advances in computer vision show that vision transformers (ViTs) have\nachieved state-of-the-art results in many image-based benchmarks.

In this paper, we focus on learning the score field that is associated\nwith the time evolution according to a physics operator in the presence of\nnatural non-deterministic physical processes like diffusion. A decisive\ndifference to previous methods is that the SDE underlying our approach\ntransforms the state of a physical system to another state at a later time. For\nthat purpose, we replace the drift of the underlying SDE formulation with a\ndifferentiable simulator or a neural network approximation of the physics. We\npropose different training strategies based on the so-called probability flow\nODE to fit a training set of simulation trajectories and discuss their relation\nto the score matching objective.

When cooling is slow relative to free fall, the gas is\nhot (roughly virial temperature) whereas the gas is cold (T~10^4 K) when\ncooling is rapid. (2) Gas inflows and outflows play crucial roles, as does the\ncosmological environment. Large-scale structure collimates cold streams and\nprovides angular momentum. Satellite galaxies contribute to the CGM through\nwinds and gas stripping. (3) In multiphase gas, the hot and cold phases\ncontinuously exchange mass, energy and momentum. The interaction between\nturbulent mixing and radiative cooling is critical. A broad spectrum of cold\ngas structures, going down to sub-pc scales, arises from fragmentation,\ncoagulation, and condensation onto gas clouds. (4) Magnetic fields, thermal\nconduction and cosmic rays can substantially modify how the cold and hot phases\ninteract, although microphysical uncertainties are presently large.

While\ntheir microscopic origin is still the subject of intense studies, ordered\narrays of quantum emitters are routinely fabricated using static\nstrain-gradients, which are used to drive excitons toward localized regions of\nthe 2D crystals where quantum-light-emission takes place. However, the\npossibility of using strain in a dynamic fashion to control the appearance of\nindividual quantum emitters has never been explored so far. In this work, we\ntackle this challenge by introducing a novel hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric\ndevice in which WSe2 monolayers are integrated onto piezoelectric pillars\ndelivering both static and dynamic strains. Static strains are first used to\ninduce the formation of quantum emitters, whose emission shows photon\nanti-bunching. Their excitonic population and emission energy are then\nreversibly controlled via the application of a voltage to the piezoelectric\npillar. Numerical simulations combined with drift-diffusion equations show that\nthese effects are due to a strain-induced modification of the\nconfining-potential landscape, which in turn leads to a net redistribution of\nexcitons among the different quantum emitters.

The associated Hamiltonian is\nthird-order, and admits infinitely many vacuum solutions. These vacuum\nsolutions can be pieced together to generate a multiverse. This is done for\nthose FLRW spaces with k>0. So when time, t, is less than zero we have a\nuniverse in which the t=constant spaces are 3-spheres with constant curvature\nk. As time passes through zero the underlying 4-space splits into an infinity\nof spaces (branches) with metric tensors that describe piecewise de Sitter\nspaces until some cutoff time, which will, in general, be different for\ndifferent branches.

However, many other relevant\napplications of DL, especially at the edge, are based on time-series processing\nand require models with unique features, for which NAS is less explored. This\nwork focuses in particular on Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), a\nconvolutional model for time-series processing that has recently emerged as a\npromising alternative to more complex recurrent architectures. We propose the\nfirst NAS tool that explicitly targets the optimization of the most peculiar\narchitectural parameters of TCNs, namely dilation, receptive-field and number\nof features in each layer. The proposed approach searches for networks that\noffer good trade-offs between accuracy and number of parameters/operations,\nenabling an efficient deployment on embedded platforms. We test the proposed\nNAS on four real-world, edge-relevant tasks, involving audio and bio-signals.\nResults show that, starting from a single seed network, our method is capable\nof obtaining a rich collection of Pareto optimal architectures, among which we\nobtain models with the same accuracy as the seed, and 15.9-152x fewer\nparameters. Compared to three state-of-the-art NAS tools, ProxylessNAS,\nMorphNet and FBNetV2, our method explores a larger search space for TCNs (up to\n10^12x) and obtains superior solutions, while requiring low GPU memory and\nsearch time. We deploy our NAS outputs on two distinct edge devices, the\nmulticore GreenWaves Technology GAP8 IoT processor and the single-core\nSTMicroelectronics STM32H7 microcontroller. With respect to the\nstate-of-the-art hand-tuned models, we reduce latency and energy of up to 5.5x\nand 3.8x on the two targets respectively, without any accuracy loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 19:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

Tantalum, like niobium, has\nproven utility as the primary superconducting layer within highly coherent\nqubits. But, unlike Nb, high temperatures are typically used to stabilize the\ndesirable body-centered-cubic phase, alpha-Ta, during thin film deposition. It\nhas long been known that a thin Nb layer permits the room-temperature\nnucleation of alpha-Ta, although neither an epitaxial process nor few-photon\nmicrowave loss measurements have been reported for Nb-nucleated Ta films prior\nto this study. We compare resonators patterned from Ta films grown at high\ntemperature (500 {\\deg}C) and films nucleated at room temperature, in order to\nunderstand the impact of crystalline order on quantum coherence. In both cases,\nfilms grew with Al2O3 (001) || Ta (110) indicating that the epitaxial\norientation is independent of temperature and is preserved across the Nb/Ta\ninterface. We use conventional low-power spectroscopy to measure two level\nsystem (TLS) loss, as well as an electric-field bias technique to measure the\neffective dipole moments of TLS in the surfaces of resonators. In our\nmeasurements, Nb-nucleated Ta resonators had greater loss tangent (1.5 +/- 0.1\nx 10^-5) than non-nucleated (5 +/- 1 x 10^-6) in approximate proportion to\ndefect densities as characterized by X-ray diffraction (0.27 {\\deg} vs 0.18\n{\\deg} [110] reflection width) and electron microscopy (30 nm vs 70 nm domain\nsize). The dependence of the loss tangent on domain size indicates that the\ndevelopment of more ordered Ta films is likely to lead to improvements in qubit\ncoherence times. Moreover, low-temperature alpha-Ta epitaxy may enable the\ngrowth of new, microstate-free heterostructures which would not withstand high\ntemperature processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 20:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

Excitonic 2D semiconductors present a unique\nopportunity in this regard given their large and tunable optical constants near\nthe excitonic resonances.

In Swift, errors are represented by values of types\nthat conform to the Error protocol.

Optional returns are used to\nrepresent the absence of a value, but when an operation fails, it's often\nuseful to understand what caused the failure so that code can respond\naccordingly.

To\nimprove the efficacy of shepherding in complex environments with obstacles and\ndispersed sheep, this paper proposes a planning-assisted context-sensitive\nautonomous shepherding framework with collision avoidance abilities. The\nproposed approach models the swarm shepherding problem as a single Travelling\nSalesperson Problem (TSP), with two sheepdogs\\textquoteright\\ modes:\nno-interaction and interaction. An adaptive switching approach is integrated\ninto the framework to guide real-time path planning for avoiding collisions\nwith static and dynamic obstacles; the latter representing moving sheep swarms.\nWe then propose an overarching hierarchical mission planning system, which is\nmade of three sub-systems: a clustering approach to group and distinguish sheep\nsub-swarms, an Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm as a TSP solver for\ndetermining the optimal herding sequence of the sub-swarms, and an online path\nplanner for calculating optimal paths for both sheepdogs and sheep. The\nexperiments on various environments, both with and without obstacles,\nobjectively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed shepherding framework\nand planning approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 00:18:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 23:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

In order to\nstudy the stability of switchbacks, we suppose the small-scale current sheets\ntherein are generated by magnetic braiding, and they should work to stabilize\nthe switchbacks. With more than one thousand switchbacks identified with PSP\nobservations in seven encounters, we find many more current sheets inside than\noutside switchbacks, indicating that these microstructures should work to\nstabilize the S-shaped structures of switchbacks. Additionally, we study the\nhelium variations to trace the switchbacks to their origins. We find both\nhelium-rich and helium-poor populations in switchbacks, implying that the\nswitchbacks could originate from both closed and open magnetic field regions in\nthe Sun. Moreover, we observe that the alpha-proton differential speeds also\nshow complex variations as compared to the local Alfv\\'en speed. The joint\ndistributions of both parameters show that low helium abundance together with\nlow differential speed is the dominant state in switchbacks.

We find that radial advection\nis actually a heating mechanism in the inflow due to compression, and the\nenergy balance in the inflow is maintained by cooling via radiation and\nvertical ($\\theta$-direction) advection, which transports entropy upwards to be\nradiated closer to the surface or carried away by the outflow. As a result,\nless photons are advected inwards and more photons are released from the\nsurface, so that the mean advective factor is smaller and the emergent flux is\nlarger than those predicted by the slim disc model.

A GCN takes as\ninput an arbitrarily structured graph and executes a series of layers which\nexploit the graph's structure to calculate their output features. One recent\ntrend in GCNs is the use of deep network architectures. As opposed to the\ntraditional GCNs which only span around two to five layers deep, modern GCNs\nnow incorporate tens to hundreds of layers with the help of residual\nconnections. From such deep GCNs, we find an important characteristic that they\nexhibit very high intermediate feature sparsity. We observe that with deep\nlayers and residual connections, the number of zeros in the intermediate\nfeatures sharply increases. This reveals a new opportunity for accelerators to\nexploit in GCN executions that was previously not present.\n  In this paper, we propose SGCN, a fast and energy-efficient GCN accelerator\nwhich fully exploits the sparse intermediate features of modern GCNs. SGCN\nsuggests several techniques to achieve significantly higher performance and\nenergy efficiency than the existing accelerators. First, SGCN employs a\nGCN-friendly feature compression format. We focus on reducing the off-chip\nmemory traffic, which often is the bottleneck for GCN executions. Second, we\npropose microarchitectures for seamlessly handling the compressed feature\nformat. Third, to better handle locality in the existence of the varying\nsparsity, SGCN employs sparsity-aware cooperation. Sparsity-aware cooperation\ncreates a pattern that exhibits multiple reuse windows, such that the cache can\ncapture diverse sizes of working sets and therefore adapt to the varying level\nof sparsity. We show that SGCN achieves 1.71x speedup and 43.9% higher energy\nefficiency compared to the existing accelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 02:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

One of\nthe optimal way to store and transmit data in the form of lossless compression\nis Huffman coding, which compresses the data into a variable length binary\nstream. Similarly, in order to protect the privacy of such big data,\ndifferential privacy is being used nowadays, which perturbs the data on the\nbasis of privacy budget and sensitivity. Nevertheless, traditional differential\nprivacy mechanisms provide privacy guarantees. However, on the other hand,\nreal-time data cannot be dealt as an ordinary set of records, because it\nusually has certain underlying patterns and cycles, which can be used for\nforming a link to a specific individuals private information that can lead to\nsevere privacy leakages (e.g., analysing smart metering data can lead to\nclassification of individuals daily routine).

VR-based applications are highly interactive, and one of\nthe most important performance metrics for these applications is the\nmotion-to-photon-delay (MPD). MPD is the delay from the users head movement to\nthe time at which the image gets updated on the VR screen. Since the human\nvisual system can even detect an error of a few pixels (very spatially\nsensitive), the MPD should be as small as possible. Popular VR vendors use the\nGPU-accelerated Asynchronous Time Warp (ATW) algorithm to reduce the MPD. ATW\nreduces the MPD if and only if the warping operation finishes just before the\ndisplay refreshes. However, due to the competition between applications for the\nshared GPU, the GPU-accelerated ATW algorithm suffers from an unpredictable ATW\nlatency, making it challenging to find the ideal time instance for starting the\ntime warp and ensuring that it completes with the least amount of lag relative\nto the screen refresh. Hence, the state-of-the-art is to use a separate\nhardware unit for the time warping operation. Our approach, PredATW, uses an\nML-based predictor to predict the ATW latency for a VR application, and then\nschedule it as late as possible. This is the first work to do so. Our predictor\nachieves an error of 0.77 ms across several popular VR applications for\npredicting the ATW latency.

We then apply classical\nconcepts from information theory, notably concepts for rate-distortion theory,\nto develop closed form expressions for the cost of communicating these logical\nstatements. We additionally provide a theory of linear codes for implementing\nthese communication systems that produces systems that are asymptotically\nbit-cost optimal in some settings. It is our belief that the scope for\nimproving beyond our limited exploration is vast, including treating more\nsophisticated logical systems such as first order logic, studying different\ntypes of communication constraints and creating practical algorithms for\nattaining the Shannon limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 05:34:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

However, very limited\nstudies characterize pedestrian crossing behavior based on specific behavioral\nmechanisms, as those mechanisms underpinning pedestrian road behavior are not\nyet clear. Here, we reinterpret pedestrian crossing behavior based on a\ndeconstructed crossing decision process at uncontrolled intersections with\ncontinuous traffic. Notably, we explain and model pedestrian crossing behavior\nas they wait for crossing opportunities, optimizing crossing decisions by\ncomparing the visual collision risk of approaching vehicles around them. A\ncollision risk-based crossing initiation model is proposed to characterize the\ntime-dynamic nature of pedestrian crossing decisions. A simulation tool is\nestablished to reproduce pedestrian behavior by employing the proposed model\nand a social force model. Two datasets collected in a CAVE-based immersive\npedestrian simulator are applied to calibrate and validate the model.

Moreover, the collision risk-based crossing initiation model\naccurately captures the timing of pedestrian crossing initiations within each\ngap.

However, as the rate of data ingestion queries increases,\nexisting protocols have exhibited degraded performance since concurrent updates\nneed to acquire lock to update the latest versions. To reduce the load on\nsystem on data ingestion queries, we focus on the theory of version order; we\ncan test that a write is an old and unnecessary version by using version order\nof data items. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol extension method,\nscheduling space expander (SSE). SSE adds another control flow to conventional\nprotocols to omit updates on data ingestion queries. It generates an erasing\nversion order, which assumes that a transaction processes outdated unnecessary\nversions. SSE also tests the correctness of this version order efficiently and\nindependently from conventional protocols.

Still, they are susceptible against imperceptible\nadversarial perturbations. The most effective solution for this problem is\nadversarial training that trains the model with adversarially perturbed samples\ninstead of original ones. Various methods have been developed over recent years\nto improve adversarial training such as data augmentation or modifying training\nattacks. In this work, we examine the same problem from a new data-centric\nperspective. For this purpose, we first demonstrate that the existing\nmodel-based methods can be equivalent to applying smaller perturbation or\noptimization weights to the hard training examples. By using this finding, we\npropose detecting and removing these hard samples directly from the training\nprocedure rather than applying complicated algorithms to mitigate their\neffects. For detection, we use maximum softmax probability as an effective\nmethod in out-of-distribution detection since we can consider the hard samples\nas the out-of-distribution samples for the whole data distribution.

Although frequency tuning is the primary\nmeans by which a swimmer selects its speed, there is no consensus on the\nmechanisms involved.

We introduce\nan extension of the method to the exponential family of distributions using the\nLaplace approximation to the likelihood. Although the Laplace approximation is\nsuccessful with all Gaussian-type prior distributions in providing a\nclosed-form expression of the marginal likelihood, there is no broad consensus\non the best prior distribution to be used for nonparametric regression via\nmodel selection. We observe that the classical unit information prior\ndistribution for variable selection may not be suitable for nonparametric\nregression using basis expansions. Instead, our study reveals that mixtures of\ng-priors are more suitable. A large family of mixtures of g-priors is\nconsidered for a detailed examination of how various mixture priors perform in\nestimating generalized additive models. Furthermore, we compare several priors\nof knots for model selection-based spline approaches to determine the most\npractically effective scheme. The model selection-based estimation methods are\nalso compared with other Bayesian approaches to function estimation. Extensive\nsimulation studies demonstrate the validity of the model selection-based\napproaches.

Empirical models\nbased on self-exciting point-processes continue to provide an important tool\nfor analyzing seismicity, given the epistemic uncertainty associated with\nphysical models. In particular, the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS)\nmodel acts as a reference model for studying seismicity catalogs. The\ntraditional ETAS model uses simple parametric definitions for the background\nrate of triggering-independent seismicity. This reduces the effectiveness of\nthe basic ETAS model in modelling the temporally complex seismicity patterns\nseen in seismic swarms that are dominated by aseismic tectonic processes such\nas fluid injection rather than aftershock triggering. In order to robustly\ncapture time-varying seismicity rates, we introduce a deep Gaussian process\nformulation for the background rate as an extension to ETAS. Gaussian processes\n(GPs) are a robust non-parametric model for function spaces with covariance\nstructure. By conditioning the lengthscale structure of a GP with another GP,\nwe have a deep-GP: a probabilistic, hierarchical model that automatically tunes\nits structure to match data constraints.

Although prior works have\nemployed the IRS to enhance the system performance under various setups, the\nfundamental capacity limits of an IRS aided multi-antenna multi-user system\nhave not yet been characterized. Motivated by this, we investigate an IRS aided\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel by considering the\ncapacity-achieving dirty paper coding (DPC) scheme and dynamic beamforming\nconfigurations. We first propose a bisection based framework to characterize\nits capacity region by optimally solving the sum-rate maximization problem\nunder a set of rate constraints, which is also applicable to characterize the\nachievable rate region with the zero-forcing (ZF) scheme. Interestingly, it is\nrigorously proved that dynamic beamforming is able to enlarge the achievable\nrate region of ZF if the IRS phase-shifts cannot achieve fully orthogonal\nchannels, whereas the attained gains become marginal due to the reduction of\nthe channel correlations induced by smartly adjusting the IRS phase-shifts. The\nresult implies that employing the IRS is able to reduce the demand for\nimplementing dynamic beamforming. Finally, we analytically prove that the\nsum-rate achieved by the IRS aided ZF is capable of approaching that of the IRS\naided DPC with a sufficiently large IRS in practice. Simulation results shed\nlight on the impact of the IRS on transceiver designs and validate our\ntheoretical findings, which provide useful guidelines to practical systems by\nindicating that replacing sophisticated schemes with easy-implementation\nschemes would only result in slight performance loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 11:15:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 07:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

It\ninfluences the comfort and time efficiency of the ride. Despite a vast\ncollection of studies working towards improving motion comfort in self-driving\ncars, little attention has been paid to the performance of human drivers as a\nbaseline. In this paper, we present an experimental study conducted on a public\nroad using an instrumented vehicle to investigate how human drivers balance\ncomfort and time efficiency. The human driving data is compared with two\noptimization-based motion planners that we developed in the past. In situations\nwhen there is no difference in travel times, human drivers incurred an average\nof 23.5% more energy in the longitudinal and lateral acceleration signals than\nthe motion planner that minimizes accelerations. In terms of frequency-weighted\nacceleration energy, an indicator correlated with the incidence of motion\nsickness, the average performance deficiency rises to 70.2%. Frequency-domain\nanalysis reveals that human drivers exhibit more longitudinal oscillations in\nthe frequency range of 0.2-1 Hz and more lateral oscillations in the frequency\nrange of up to 0.2 Hz.

Global taint tracking, in particular, can spot\nvulnerabilities arising from complicated data flow across multiple functions.\nHowever, precisely identifying which flows are problematic is challenging, and\nsometimes depends on factors beyond the reach of pure program analysis, such as\nconventions and informal knowledge. For example, learning that a parameter\n\"name\" of an API function \"locale\" ends up in a file path is surprising and\npotentially problematic. In contrast, it would be completely unsurprising to\nfind that a parameter \"command\" passed to an API function \"execaCommand\" is\neventually interpreted as part of an operating-system command. This paper\npresents Fluffy, a bimodal taint analysis that combines static analysis, which\nreasons about data flow, with machine learning, which probabilistically\ndetermines which flows are potentially problematic. The key idea is to let\nmachine learning models predict from natural language information involved in a\ntaint flow, such as API names, whether the flow is expected or unexpected, and\nto inform developers only about the latter. We present a general framework and\ninstantiate it with four learned models, which offer different trade-offs\nbetween the need to annotate training data and the accuracy of predictions. We\nimplement Fluffy on top of the CodeQL analysis framework and apply it to 250K\nJavaScript projects.

Henkin synthesis has wide-ranging applications, including\nverification of partial circuits, controller synthesis, and circuit\nrealizability.\n  This work proposes a data-driven approach for Henkin synthesis called\nManthan3. On an extensive evaluation of over 563 instances arising from past\nDQBF solving competitions, we demonstrate that Manthan3 is competitive with\nstate-of-the-art tools. Furthermore, Manthan3 could synthesize Henkin functions\nfor 26 benchmarks for which none of the state-of-the-art techniques could\nsynthesize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 12:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

Ants are the paradigmatic model system for\nsuch experiments but their lack of individually distinguishing visual features\nand their high colony densities make it extremely difficult to perform reliable\ntracking automatically.

In this paper, we propose\na data-driven multi-object tracker that, for the first time, employs domain\nadaptation to achieve the required generalisation. This approach is built upon\na joint-detection-and-tracking framework that is extended by a set of domain\ndiscriminator modules integrating an adversarial training strategy in addition\nto the tracking loss. In addition to this novel domain-adaptive tracking\nframework, we present a new dataset and a benchmark for the ant tracking\nproblem.

To characterize both the\n$n$ and the $V$ field of a fragmenting filament, we mapped NGC2024. 13CO, C18O,\nand H13CO+ trace the filament seen in the $N_{H_2}$ data. The radial profile\nfrom the $N_{H_2}$ data shows $D_{HP}$~0.081 pc, which is similar to the\nHerschel findings. The $D_{HP}$ from 13CO and C18O are broader, while the\n$D_{HP}$ from H13CO+ is narrower, than $D_{HP}$ from Herschel. These results\nsuggest that 13CO and C18O trace only the outer part of the filament and H13CO+\nonly the inner part. The H13CO+ $V_{centroid}$ map reveals $V$ gradients along\nboth filament axis, as well as $V$ oscillations with a period $\\lambda$~0.2 pc\nalong the major axis. Comparison between the $V$ and the $n$ distribution shows\na tentative $\\lambda$/4 shift in H13CO+ or C18O. This $\\lambda$/4 shift is not\nsimultaneously observed for all cores in any single tracer but is tentatively\nseen in either H13CO+ or C18O. We produced a toy model taking into account a\ntransverse $V$ gradient, a longitudinal $V$ gradient, and a longitudinal\noscillation mode caused by fragmentation. Examination of synthetic data shows\nthat the oscillation component produces an oscillation pattern in the velocity\nstructure function (VSF) of the model. The H13CO+ VSF shows an oscillation\npattern, suggesting that our observations are partly tracing core-forming\nmotions and fragmentation. We also found that the mean $M_{core}$ corresponds\nto the effective $M_{BE}$ in the filament.

To further complement the literature, we\ninvestigate in this paper adversarial training as another possible solution to\nthis robustness issue. Our comparison includes the two main families of\nBERT-based neural retrievers, i.e. dense and sparse, with and without\ndistillation techniques. We then demonstrate that one of the most simple\nadversarial training techniques -- the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) -- can\nimprove first stage rankers robustness and effectiveness. In particular, FGSM\nincreases models performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain\ndistributions, and also on queries with typos, for multiple neural retrievers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 13:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

Since noisy and reverberant speech mixtures\ncan have different duration, a batching strategy is required to handle variable\nsize inputs during training, in particular for state-of-the-art end-to-end\nsystems. Such strategies usually strive for a compromise between zero-padding\nand data randomization, and can be combined with a dynamic batch size for a\nmore consistent amount of data in each batch. However, the effect of these\nstrategies on resource utilization and more importantly network performance is\nnot well documented. This paper systematically investigates the effect of\ndifferent batching strategies and batch sizes on the training statistics and\nspeech enhancement performance of a Conv-TasNet, evaluated in both matched and\nmismatched conditions.

Hence, text circuits are a\nlean structure for the `actual substance of text', that is, the inner-workings\nof meanings within text across several layers of expressiveness (cf. words,\nsentences, text), and may capture that what is truly universal beneath grammar.\nThe elimination of grammatical bureaucracy also explains why DisCoCirc: (8)\napplies beyond language, e.g. to spatial, visual and other cognitive modes.\nWhile humans could not verbally communicate in terms of text circuits, machines\ncan.\n  We first define a `hybrid grammar' for a fragment of English, i.e. a\npurpose-built, minimal grammatical formalism needed to obtain text circuits. We\nthen detail a translation process such that all text generated by this grammar\nyields a text circuit. Conversely, for any text circuit obtained by freely\ncomposing the generators, there exists a text (with hybrid grammar) that gives\nrise to it. Hence: (9) text circuits are generative for text.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 13:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

Deep\nneural networks remain brittle and susceptible to many changes in the image\nthat do not cause humans to misclassify images. Part of this different behavior\nmay be explained by the type of features humans and deep neural networks use in\nvision tasks.

Over the last two years, some attempts have been made for\nintroducing adversarial-based UDA methods in the context of MLIC. However,\nthese methods which rely on an additional discriminator subnet present two\nshortcomings. First, the learning of domain-invariant features may harm their\ntask-specific discriminative power, since the classification and discrimination\ntasks are decoupled. Moreover, the use of an additional discriminator usually\ninduces an increase of the network size.

We aim to characterize the magnetic field and stellar activity of\nthe early, moderately active, M dwarf Gl205 in the optical and nIR domains. We\nobtained high-precision quasi-simultaneous spectra in the optical and nIR with\nthe SOPHIE spectrograph and SPIRou spectropolarimeter between 2019 and 2022. We\ncomputed the RVs from both instruments and the SPIRou Stokes V profiles. We\nused ZDI to map the large-scale magnetic field over the time span of the\nobservations. We studied the temporal behavior of optical and nIR RVs and\nactivity indicators with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and a quasi-periodic GP\nregression. In the nIR, we studied the equivalent width of Al I, Ti I, K I, Fe\nI, and He I. We modeled the activity-induced RV jitter using a\nmulti-dimensional GP regression with activity indicators as ancillary time\nseries. The optical and nIR RVs have similar scatter but nIR shows a more\ncomplex temporal evolution. We observe an evolution of the magnetic field\ntopology from a poloidal dipolar field in 2019 to a dominantly toroidal field\nin 2022. We measured a stellar rotation period of Prot=34.4$\\pm$0.5 d in the\nlongitudinal magnetic field. Using ZDI we measure the amount of latitudinal\ndifferential rotation (DR) shearing the stellar surface yielding rotation\nperiods of Peq=32.0$\\pm$1.8 d at the stellar equator and Ppol=45.5$\\pm$0.3 d at\nthe poles. We observed inconsistencies in the activity indicators'\nperiodicities that could be explained by these DR values.

In fact, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)\nhave recently emerged to enable spectrum sharing while enhancing the\nincumbents' quality-of-service (QoS). Nonetheless, co-existence over mmWave\nbands remains persistently challenging due to their unfavorable propagation\ncharacteristics. Hence, initiating mmWave spectrum sharing requires the RIS to\nfurther assist in improving the QoS over mmWave bands without jeopardizing\nspectrum sharing demands. In this paper, a novel simultaneous transmitting and\nreflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-aided solution to enable mmWave spectrum sharing is\nproposed. In particular, the transmitting and reflecting abilities of the\nSTAR-RIS are leveraged to tackle the mmWave spectrum sharing and QoS\nrequirements separately. The STAR-RIS-enabled spectrum sharing problem between\na primary network (e.g. a radar transmit-receive pair) and a secondary network\nis formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the downlink\nsum-rate over a secondary multiple-input-single-output (MISO) network, while\nlimiting interference over a primary network. Moreover, the STAR-RIS response\ncoefficients and beamforming matrix in the secondary network are jointly\noptimized. To solve this non-convex problem, an alternating iterative algorithm\nis employed, where the STAR-RIS response coefficients and beamforming matrix\nare obtained using the successive convex approximation method.

Recent research has proposed and\nimplemented algorithms that assign refugees and asylum seekers to geographic\nlocations in a manner that maximizes the average employment across all arriving\nrefugees. While these algorithms can have substantial overall positive impact,\nusing data from two industry collaborators we show that the impact of these\nalgorithms can vary widely across key subgroups based on country of origin,\nage, or educational background.

Selective assumptions, made to reduce\ncomputational costs, have limited most previous studies to steady-state\ninvestigations. Here, we combine two-phase laminar flow, heat transfer, and\nevaporation in a finite-element simulation to examine the failure of\nLeidenfrost vapor layers during cooling. During periods of quiescence, the\ngeometry of the vapor layer agrees well with steady-state lubrication theory.\nIn the simulations, we report the local temperature of the solid at failure,\n$T_-$, which provides a lower bound for recent experimental work using the same\ngeometric and material conditions. Surprisingly, we find that inertial forces,\nwhich are typically ignored in theoretical treatments of the vapor layer, are\nresponsible for initiating the instability leading to failure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 15:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

To demonstrate accurate measurement of corneal elastic moduli in\nvivo with non-contact and non-invasive optical coherence elastography. Methods.\nElastic properties (in-plane Young's modulus E and both in-plane, u, and\nout-of-plane, G, shear moduli) of rabbit cornea were quantified in vivo using\nnon-contact dynamic Acoustic micro-Tapping Optical Coherence Elastography\n(AuT-OCE). The IOP-dependence of measured mechanical properties was explored in\nextracted whole globes following in vivo measurement. A nearly-incompressible\ntransverse isotropic (NITI) model was used to reconstruct moduli from AuT-OCE\ndata. Independently, cornea elastic moduli were also measured ex vivo with\ntraditional, destructive mechanical tests (tensile extensometry and shear\nrheometry). Results. Our study demonstrates strong anisotropy of corneal\nelasticity in rabbits. The in-plane Young's modulus, computer as E=3u, was in\nthe range of 20-44 MPa, whereas the out-of-plane shear modulus was in the range\nof 34-261 kPa. Both pressure-dependent ex vivo OCE and destructive mechanical\ntests performed on the same samples within an hour of euthanasia strongly\nsupport the results of AuT-OCE measurements. Conclusions. Non-contact AuT-OCE\ncan non-invasively quantify cornea anisotropic elastic properties in vivo.\nTranslational Relevance. As OCT is broadly accepted in Ophthalmology, these\nresults suggest the potential for rapid translation of AuT-OCE into clinical\npractice. In addition, AuT-OCE can likely improve diagnostic criteria of\nectatic corneal diseases, leading to early diagnosis, reduced complications,\ncustomized surgical treatment, and personalized biomechanical models of the\neye.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 15:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

If we understand all biochemical mechanisms of cancer\ncells, we can directly calculate how the cancer cell population behaves.\nInversely, just from the cell count data, we can use population dynamics to\ninfer the mechanisms. Cancer cells emerge from certain genetic mutations, which\naffect the expression of other genes through gene regulation. Therefore,\nknowledge of gene regulation can help with cancer prevention and treatment.\nDevelopmental biology studies acquisition and maintenance of normal cellular\nfunction, which is inspiring to cancer biology in the opposite direction.\nBesides, cancer cells implanted into an embryo can differentiate into normal\ntissues, which provides a possible approach of curing cancer. This review\nillustrates the role of mathematics in these three fields: what mathematical\nmodels are used, what data analysis tools are applied, and what mathematical\ntheorems need to be proved. We hope that applied mathematicians and even pure\nmathematicians can find meaningful mathematical problems related to cancer\nbiology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 18:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

Recent research has shown\nthat appropriate reliance is the key to achieving complementary team\nperformance in AI-assisted decision making. This paper addresses an\nunder-explored problem of whether the Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) among people\ncan hinder their appropriate reliance on AI systems. DKE is a metacognitive\nbias due to which less-competent individuals overestimate their own skill and\nperformance. Through an empirical study (N = 249), we explored the impact of\nDKE on human reliance on an AI system, and whether such effects can be\nmitigated using a tutorial intervention that reveals the fallibility of AI\nadvice, and exploiting logic units-based explanations to improve user\nunderstanding of AI advice. We found that participants who overestimate their\nperformance tend to exhibit under-reliance on AI systems, which hinders optimal\nteam performance. Logic units-based explanations did not help users in either\nimproving the calibration of their competence or facilitating appropriate\nreliance. While the tutorial intervention was highly effective in helping users\ncalibrate their self-assessment and facilitating appropriate reliance among\nparticipants with overestimated self-assessment, we found that it can\npotentially hurt the appropriate reliance of participants with underestimated\nself-assessment. Our work has broad implications on the design of methods to\ntackle user cognitive biases while facilitating appropriate reliance on AI\nsystems.

Recently, rtfMRI studies have\nobserved that regulation of a target brain region is accompanied by\nconnectivity changes beyond the target region. Therefore, the aim of present\nstudy is to investigate the use of connectivity between amygdala and prefrontal\nregions as the target of neurofeedback training in healthy individuals and\nsubjects with a life-time history of major depressive disorder (MDD) performing\nan emotion regulation task. Method: Ten remitted MDD subjects and twelve\nhealthy controls (HC) performed an emotion regulation task in 4 runs of\nrtfMRI-nf training followed by one transfer run without neurofeedback conducted\nin a single session. The functional connectivity between amygdala and\nprefrontal cortex was presented as a feedback bar concurrent with the emotion\nregulation task. Participants' emotional state was measured by the Positive and\nNegative Affect Schedule (PANAS) prior to and following the rtfMRI-nf.\nPsychological assessments were used to determine subjects' history of\ndepression. Results: Participants with a history of MDD showed a trend of\ndecreasing functional connectivity across the four rtfMRI-nf runs, and there\nwas a marginally significant interaction between the MDD history and number of\ntraining runs. The HC group showed a significant increase of frontal cortex\nactivation between the second and third neurofeedback runs.

The combination of the five satellites provides a time period of 28\nyr from 1994 to 2022.

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a promising\nparadigm to address this challenge. Most recent bipartite graph SSL methods are\nbased on contrastive learning which learns embeddings by discriminating\npositive and negative node pairs. Contrastive learning usually requires a large\nnumber of negative node pairs, which could lead to computational burden and\nsemantic errors. In this paper, we introduce a novel synergistic representation\nlearning model (STERLING) to learn node embeddings without negative node pairs.\nSTERLING preserves the unique synergies in bipartite graphs. The local and\nglobal synergies are captured by maximizing the similarity of the inter-type\nand intra-type positive node pairs, and maximizing the mutual information of\nco-clusters respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that STERLING could\npreserve the synergies in the embedding space. Extensive empirical evaluation\non various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of\nSTERLING for extracting node embeddings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 03:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}
