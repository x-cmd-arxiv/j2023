Typically, these representation learning\napproaches embed the networks into a low-dimensional space in which the role of\neach individual can be characterized in terms of their latent position. A major\ncurrent concern in social networks is the emergence of polarization and filter\nbubbles promoting a mindset of \"us-versus-them\" that may be defined by extreme\npositions believed to ultimately lead to political violence and the erosion of\ndemocracy. Such polarized networks are typically characterized in terms of\nsigned links reflecting likes and dislikes. We propose the latent Signed\nrelational Latent dIstance Model (SLIM) utilizing for the first time the\nSkellam distribution as a likelihood function for signed networks and extend\nthe modeling to the characterization of distinct extreme positions by\nconstraining the embedding space to polytopes. On four real social signed\nnetworks of polarization, we demonstrate that the model extracts\nlow-dimensional characterizations that well predict friendships and animosity\nwhile providing interpretable visualizations defined by extreme positions when\nendowing the model with an embedding space restricted to polytopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 16:01:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2023 14:26:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 14:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

However, FL is\nvulnerable to poisoning attacks such as backdoor attacks. Consequently, a\nvariety of defenses have recently been proposed, which have primarily utilized\nintermediary states of the global model (i.e., logits) or distance of the local\nmodels (i.e., L2-norm) from the global model to detect malicious backdoors.\nHowever, as these approaches directly operate on client updates, their\neffectiveness depends on factors such as clients' data distribution or the\nadversary's attack strategies. In this paper, we introduce a novel and more\ngeneric backdoor defense framework, called BayBFed, which proposes to utilize\nprobability distributions over client updates to detect malicious updates in\nFL: it computes a probabilistic measure over the clients' updates to keep track\nof any adjustments made in the updates, and uses a novel detection algorithm\nthat can leverage this probabilistic measure to efficiently detect and filter\nout malicious updates. Thus, it overcomes the shortcomings of previous\napproaches that arise due to the direct usage of client updates; as our\nprobabilistic measure will include all aspects of the local client training\nstrategies. BayBFed utilizes two Bayesian Non-Parametric extensions: (i) a\nHierarchical Beta-Bernoulli process to draw a probabilistic measure given the\nclients' updates, and (ii) an adaptation of the Chinese Restaurant Process\n(CRP), referred by us as CRP-Jensen, which leverages this probabilistic measure\nto detect and filter out malicious updates. We extensively evaluate our defense\napproach on five benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, Reddit, IoT intrusion detection,\nMNIST, and FMNIST, and show that it can effectively detect and eliminate\nmalicious updates in FL without deteriorating the benign performance of the\nglobal model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 16:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

Current entity matching benchmarks usually represent\nsingle points in the space along such dimensions or they provide for the\nevaluation of matching methods along a single dimension, for instance the\namount of training data. This paper presents WDC Products, an entity matching\nbenchmark which provides for the systematic evaluation of matching systems\nalong combinations of three dimensions while relying on real-word data. The\nthree dimensions are (i) amount of corner-cases (ii) generalization to unseen\nentities, and (iii) development set size. Generalization to unseen entities is\na dimension not covered by any of the existing benchmarks yet but is crucial\nfor evaluating the robustness of entity matching systems. WDC Products is based\non heterogeneous product data from thousands of e-shops which mark-up products\noffers using schema.org annotations. Instead of learning how to match entity\npairs, entity matching can also be formulated as a multi-class classification\ntask that requires the matcher to recognize individual entities.

While our RF+clust approach obtains more accurate performance prediction\nfor several problems, its predictive power crucially depends on the chosen\nsimilarity threshold as well as on the feature portfolio for which the cosine\nsimilarity is measured, thereby opening a new angle for feature selection in a\nzero-shot learning setting, as LOPO is termed in machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 16:14:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 09:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

In this context, software refactoring is a crucial activity\nwithin development life-cycles where requirements and functionalities rapidly\nevolve. One main challenge is that the improvement of distinctive quality\nattributes may require contrasting refactoring actions on software, as for\ntrade-off between performance and reliability (or other non-functional\nattributes). In such cases, multi-objective optimization can provide the\ndesigner with a wider view on these trade-offs and, consequently, can lead to\nidentify suitable refactoring actions that take into account independent or\neven competing objectives. In this paper, we present an approach that exploits\nNSGA-II as the genetic algorithm to search optimal Pareto frontiers for\nsoftware refactoring while considering many objectives. We consider performance\nand reliability variations of a model alternative with respect to an initial\nmodel, the amount of performance antipatterns detected on the model\nalternative, and the architectural distance, which quantifies the effort to\nobtain a model alternative from the initial one. We applied our approach on two\ncase studies: a Train Ticket Booking Service, and CoCoME. We observed that our\napproach is able to improve performance (by up to 42\\%) while preserving or\neven improving the reliability (by up to 32\\%) of generated model alternatives.\nWe also observed that there exists an order of preference of refactoring\nactions among model alternatives. We can state that performance antipatterns\nconfirmed their ability to improve performance of a subject model in the\ncontext of many-objective optimization. In addition, the metric that we adopted\nfor the architectural distance seems to be suitable for estimating the\nrefactoring effort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 16:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

Exploiting the advantages of this method is today of\ncritical importance for Nb3Sn-based accelerator magnets, whose production\nrequires the preservation of tight stress targets in the superconducting coils\nto limit the effects of the strain sensitivity and brittleness of the\nconductor. The present manuscript reports on the results of an experimental\ncampaign focused on the optimization of the bladders and keys assembly process\nin the MQXFB quadrupoles. These 7.2 m long magnets shall be among the first\nNb3Sn cryomagnets to be installed in a particle accelerator as a part of the\nHigh Luminosity upgrade of the LHC. One of the main practical implications of\nthe bladders technique, especially important when applied to long magnets like\nMQXFB, is that to insert the loading keys, the opening of a certain clearance\nin the support structure is required. The procedure used so far for MQXF\nmagnets involved an overstress in the coils during bladder inflation. The work\npresented here shows that such an overshoot can be eliminated thanks to\nadditional bladders properly positioned in the structure. This optimized method\nwas validated in a short model magnet and in a full-length mechanical model,\nbecoming the new baseline for the series production at CERN.

Breaking down system behavior into mutually exclusive modes\nand discrete transitions between modes is a commonly used strategy to reduce\nimplementation complexity and promote code readability. However, such\ncapabilities often come in the form of self-contained domain specific languages\nor language-specific frameworks. The work in this paper aims to bring the\nadvantages of modal models to mainstream programming languages, by following\nthe polyglot coordination approach of Lingua Franca (LF), in which verbatim\ntarget code (e.g., C, C++, Python, Typescript, or Rust) is encapsulated in\ncomposable reactive components called reactors. Reactors can form a dataflow\nnetwork, are triggered by timed as well as sporadic events, execute\nconcurrently, and can be distributed across nodes on a network.\n  With modal models in LF, we introduce a lean extension to the concept of\nreactors that enables the coordination of reactive tasks based on modes of\noperation. The implementation of modal reactors outlined in this paper\ngeneralizes to any LF-supported language with only modest modifications to the\ngeneric runtime system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 17:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

These attacks fall\nunder the category of Electronic Warfare (EW), a continuously growing area in\nboth attack and defense of the electromagnetic spectrum, with one subcategory\nbeing electronic attacks. Jamming attacks fall under this specific subcategory\nof EW as they comprise adversarial signals that attempt to disrupt, deny,\ndegrade, destroy, or deceive legitimate signals in the electromagnetic\nspectrum. While jamming is not going away, recent research advances have\nstarted to get the upper hand against these attacks by leveraging new methods\nand techniques, such as machine learning.

As the model sizes grow, the\nperformance gap between English and other languages with fewer compute and data\nresources increases even further. Consequently, more resource-efficient\ntraining methods are needed to bridge the gap for languages with fewer\nresources available. To address this problem, we introduce a cross-lingual and\nprogressive transfer learning approach, called CLP-Transfer, that transfers\nmodels from a source language, for which pretrained models are publicly\navailable, like English, to a new target language. As opposed to prior work,\nwhich focused on the cross-lingual transfer between two languages, we extend\nthe transfer to the model size. Given a pretrained model in a source language,\nwe aim for a same-sized model in a target language. Instead of training a model\nfrom scratch, we exploit a smaller model that is in the target language but\nrequires much fewer resources. Both small and source models are then used to\ninitialize the token embeddings of the larger model based on the overlapping\nvocabulary of the source and target language.

Here, we combine these ideas in a single\nmodeled scenario designed to simultaneously reproduce the formation of all four\nterrestrial planets and the modern orbits of the giant planets in broad\nstrokes. By evaluating our Mercury analogs' core mass fractions, masses, and\norbital offsets from Venus, we favor a scenario where Mercury forms through a\nseries of violent erosive collisions between a number of ~Mercury-mass embryos\nin the inner part of the terrestrial disk. We also compare cases where the gas\ngiants begin the simulation locked in a compact 3:2 resonant configuration to a\nmore relaxed 2:1 orientation and find the former to be more successful. In 2:1\ncases, the entire Mercury-forming region is often depleted due to strong\nsweeping secular resonances that also tend to overly excite the orbits of Earth\nand Venus as they grow. While our model is quite successful at replicating\nMercury's massive core and dynamically isolated orbit, the planets' low mass\nremains extremely challenging to match. Finally, we discuss the merits and\ndrawbacks of alternative evolutionary scenarios and initial disk conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

To enable model-space exploration, fast and accurate predictions are\ncritical. In this paper, we show that the performance of such simulations can\nbe further improved with time-stepping schemes that use input from cosmological\nperturbation theory. Specifically, we introduce a class of time-stepping\nschemes derived by matching the particle trajectories in a single\nleapfrog/Verlet drift-kick-drift step to those predicted by Lagrangian\nperturbation theory (LPT). As a corollary, these schemes exactly yield the\nanalytic Zel'dovich solution in 1D in the pre-shell-crossing regime (i.e.\nbefore particle trajectories cross). One representative of this class is the\npopular FastPM scheme by Feng et al. 2016, which we take as our baseline.

We derive that the effect of finite\nentanglement on a Kibble-Zurek process is captured by a dimensionless scaling\nfunction of the ratio of two length scales, one determined dynamically and one\nby the entanglement restriction. Numerically we confirm first that dynamics at\nfinite bond dimension $\\chi$ is independent of the algorithm chosen, then\nobtain scaling collapses for sweeps in the transverse field Ising model and the\n3-state Potts model.

A prevalent approach consists in\ncontrasting data points and noise points within a classification task: this\nrequires a good noise distribution which is notoriously hard to specify. While\na comprehensive theory is missing, it is widely assumed that the optimal noise\ndistribution should in practice be made equal to the data distribution, as in\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We here empirically and theoretically\nchallenge this assumption. We turn to Noise-Contrastive Estimation (NCE) which\ngrounds this self-supervised task as an estimation problem of an energy-based\nmodel of the data. This ties the optimality of the noise distribution to the\nsample efficiency of the estimator, which is rigorously defined as its\nasymptotic variance, or mean-squared error. In the special case where the\nnormalization constant only is unknown, we show that NCE recovers a family of\nImportance Sampling estimators for which the optimal noise is indeed equal to\nthe data distribution. However, in the general case where the energy is also\nunknown, we prove that the optimal noise density is the data density multiplied\nby a correction term based on the Fisher score. In particular, the optimal\nnoise distribution is different from the data distribution, and is even from a\ndifferent family.

For a linear collider, the energy transfer efficiency from the drive\nbeam to the wake and from the wake to the trailing beam must be large, while\nthe emittance and energy spread of the trailing bunch must be preserved. One\nway to simultaneously achieve this when accelerating electrons is to use\nlongitudinally shaped bunches and nonlinear wakes. In the linear regime, there\nis an analytical formalism to obtain the optimal shapes. In the nonlinear\nregime, however, the optimal shape of the driver to maximize the energy\ntransfer efficiency cannot be precisely obtained because currently no theory\ndescribes the wake structure and excitation process for all degrees of\nnonlinearity. In addition, the ion channel radius is not well defined at the\nfront of the wake where the plasma electrons are not fully blown out by the\ndrive beam. We present results using a novel optimization method to effectively\ndetermine a current profile for the drive and trailing beam in PWFA that\nprovides low energy spread, low emittance, and high acceleration efficiency. We\nparameterize the longitudinal beam current profile as a piecewise-linear\nfunction and define optimization objectives. For the trailing beam, the\nalgorithm converges quickly to a nearly inverse trapezoidal trailing beam\ncurrent profile similar to that predicted by the ultrarelativistic limit of the\nnonlinear wakefield theory.

The geometry is a\nsolution of the Einstein equations which is sourced by an exotic matter with\nmaximally negative radial pressure. The frozen star geometry was previously\npresented in singular coordinates for which $-g_{tt}$ and $g^{rr}$ vanish in\nthe bulk and connect smoothly to the Schwarzschild exterior. Additionally, the\ngeometry was mildly singular in the center of the star. Here, we present\nregular coordinates for the entirety of the frozen star. Each zero in the\nmetric is replaced with a small, dimensionless parameter $\\varepsilon$; the\nsame parameter in both $-g_{tt}$ and $g^{rr}$ so as to maintain maximally\nnegative radial pressure. We also regularize the geometry, energy density and\npressure in the center of the star in a smooth way. Our initial analysis uses\nSchwarzschild-like coordinates and applies the Killing equations to show that\nan infalling, point-like object will move very slowly, effectively sticking to\nthe surface of the star and never coming out. If one nevertheless follows the\ntrajectory of the object into the interior of the star, it moves along an\nalmost-radial trajectory until it comes within a small distance from the star's\ncenter. Once there, if the object has any amount of angular momentum at all, it\nwill be reflected outwards by a potential barrier onto a different\nalmost-radial trajectory. Finally, using Kruskal-like coordinates, we consider\nthe causal structure of the regularized frozen star and discuss its\n$\\varepsilon\\to 0$ limit, for which the geometry degenerates and becomes\neffectively two dimensional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 20:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

The problem of lack of differentiability of property tensors at the\nsharp phase interfaces is circumvented by making use of diffuse interface\nformulation. Periodic boundary conditions are incorporated strictly, through\nthe introduction of an input-transfer layer (Fourier feature mapping), in which\nthe sine and cosine of the inner product of position vectors and reciprocal\nlattice vectors are considered. This, together with the absence of Dirichlet\nboundary conditions, results in a lossless boundary condition application.

In certain field monitoring\nenvironments, significant phase deviations can arise far from isocenter due to\nthe finite extent of the gradient and/or main magnet. This can degrade the\naccuracy of field dynamics when field probes are placed near or outside the\ndiameter spherical volume of the gradient coils and/or main magnet, leading to\ncorrupted image quality. The objective of this work was to develop a correction\nalgorithm that reduces errors from highly nonlinear phase variations at distant\nfield probes in field dynamic fits. Methods: The algorithm is split into three\ncomponents. Component one fits phase coefficients one spatial order at a time,\nwhile the second implements a weighted least squares solution based on probe\ndistance. After initial fitting, component three calculates phase residuals and\nremoves the phase for distant probes before re-fitting. Two healthy volunteers\nwere scanned on a head-only 7T MRI using diffusion-weighted single-shot spiral\nand EPI sequences and field monitoring was performed. Images were reconstructed\nwith and without phase coefficient correction and compared qualitatively.\nResults: The algorithm was able to correct corrupted field dynamics, resulting\nin image quality improvements. Significant artefact reduction was observed when\ncorrecting higher order fits, especially for diffusion weighted images.\nStepwise fitting provided the most correction benefit, which was marginally\nimproved when adding weighted least squares and phase residual corrections.\nConclusion: The proposed algorithm can mitigate effects of phase errors in\nfield monitoring, providing improved reliability of field dynamic\ncharacterization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 21:28:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

This framework addresses the problem of\nestimating tissue-specific thermodynamics in real-time, which would enable\naccurate prediction of thermal damage impact to the tissue and damage-conscious\nplanning of electrosurgical procedures. Our approach provides basic\nthermodynamic information such as thermal diffusivity, and also allows for\nobtaining the thermal relaxation time and a model of the heat source, yielding\nin real-time a controlled hyperbolic thermodynamics model. The latter accounts\nfor the finite thermal propagation time necessary for modeling of the\nelectrosurgical action, in which the probe motion speed often surpasses the\nspeed of thermal propagation in the tissue operated on. Our approach relies\nsolely on thermographer feedback and a knowledge of the power level and\nposition of the electrosurgical pencil, imposing only very minor adjustments to\nnormal electrosurgery to obtain a high-fidelity model of the tissue-probe\ninteraction. Our method is minimally invasive and can be performed in situ. We\napply our method first to simulated data based on porcine muscle tissue to\nverify its accuracy and then to in vivo liver tissue, and compare the results\nwith those from the literature. This comparison shows that parameterizing the\nMaxwell--Cattaneo model through the framework proposed yields a noticeably\nhigher fidelity real-time adaptable representation of the thermodynamic tissue\nresponse to the electrosurgical impact than currently available. A discussion\non the differences between the live and the dead tissue thermodynamics is also\nprovided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 21:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Machine learning (ML) methods use this data to make high-level\ndecisions with minimal human intervention. Data-driven predictive maintenance\n(PDM) is a crucial ML-based I-IoT application to find an optimal maintenance\nschedule for industrial assets. The performance of these ML methods can\nseriously be threatened by adversarial attacks where an adversary crafts\nperturbed data and sends it to the ML model to deteriorate its prediction\nperformance. The models should be able to stay robust against these attacks\nwhere robustness is measured by how much perturbation in input data affects\nmodel performance. Hence, there is a need for effective defense mechanisms that\ncan protect these models against adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose\na double defense mechanism to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks in I-IoT\nenvironments. We first detect if there is an adversarial attack on a given\nsample using novelty detection algorithms. Then, based on the outcome of our\nalgorithm, marking an instance as attack or normal, we select adversarial\nretraining or standard training to provide a secondary defense layer. If there\nis an attack, adversarial retraining provides a more robust model, while we\napply standard training for regular samples. Since we may not know if an attack\nwill take place, our adaptive mechanism allows us to consider irregular changes\nin data. The results show that our double defense strategy is highly efficient\nwhere we can improve model robustness by up to 64.6% and 52% compared to\nstandard and adversarial retraining, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 22:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Interestingly, this latter peculiar behavior of\nradial profiles is not affected by the choice of the $f(R)$ functional form.\nThe numerical solution of time-dependent perturbations exhibits a non-diverging\nprofile. This work suggests that investigations about local inhomogeneities in\nthe late Universe may allow us to discriminate if the present cosmic\nacceleration is caused by a cosmological constant term or a modified gravity\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 00:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Nevertheless, they still make mistakes\nfrom time to time. For a model deployed in an industrial environment, fixing\nthese mistakes quickly and robustly is vital to improve user experiences.\nPrevious works formalize such problems as Model Editing (ME) and mostly focus\non fixing one mistake. However, the one-mistake-fixing scenario is not an\naccurate abstraction of the real-world challenge. In the deployment of AI\nservices, there are ever-emerging mistakes, and the same mistake may recur if\nnot corrected in time. Thus a preferable solution is to rectify the mistakes as\nsoon as they appear nonstop. Therefore, we extend the existing ME into\nSequential Model Editing (SME) to help develop more practical editing methods.\nOur study shows that most current ME methods could yield unsatisfying results\nin this scenario. We then introduce Transformer-Patcher, a novel model editor\nthat can shift the behavior of transformer-based models by simply adding and\ntraining a few neurons in the last Feed-Forward Network layer.

We briefly discuss several methods used for the\npurpose while focusing primarily on the use of supernovae type 1a, quasars, and\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as cosmological probes for determining cosmological\ndistances. Supernovae type Ia (SNeIa) are considered the best standard candles\nsince their intrinsic luminosity can be determined precisely from their light\ncurves. However, they have only been observed up to about redshift $z=2.3$,\nmostly at $z<1.5$. Quasars are the brightest non-transient cosmic sources in\nthe Universe. They have been observed up to $z=7.5$. Certain types of quasars\ncan be calibrated well enough for their use as standard candles but with a\nhigher degree of uncertainty in their intrinsic luminosity than the SNeIa. GRBs\nare even brighter than quasars, observed up to $z=9.4$. Their radiation lasts\nfrom 10s of milliseconds to several minutes and, in rare cases, for a few\nhours. However, they are even more challenging to calibrate as standard candles\nthan quasars. What if the standard candles' intrinsic luminosities are affected\nwhen the coupling constants become dynamic?

The conic inclusion $\\Phi (x,\\xi) \\in -\n\\mathcal{K}$ represents an abstract system of inequalities, and $\\xi$ is a\nrandom vector. We propose a regularization by applying the Moreau envelope to\nthe scalarization of the function $\\Phi$. In this paper, we demonstrate, under\nmild assumptions, the smoothness of such a regularization and that it satisfies\na type of variational convergence to the original probability function.\nConsequently, when considering an appropriately structured problem involving\nprobabilistic constraints, we can thus entail the convergence of the minimizers\nof the regularized approximate problems to the minimizers of the original\nproblem. Finally, we illustrate our results with examples and applications in\nthe field of (nonsmooth) joint, semidefinite and probust chance constrained\noptimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 04:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Aimed at\nimproving the effectiveness of the cache by mitigating the irregular data\naccesses, prior studies often employ the vertex tiling techniques used in\ntraditional graph processing applications. While being effective at enhancing\nthe cache efficiency, those approaches are often sensitive to the tiling\nconfigurations where the optimal setting heavily depends on target input\ndatasets. Furthermore, the existing solutions require manual tuning through\ntrial-and-error or rely on sub-optimal analytical models.\n  In this paper, we propose Slice-and-Forge (SnF), an efficient hardware\naccelerator for GCNs which greatly improves the effectiveness of the limited\non-chip cache. SnF chooses a tiling strategy named feature slicing that splits\nthe features into vertical slices and processes them in the outermost loop of\nthe execution.

However, numerous recent works indicate that fine-tuning suffers from\nthe instability problem, i.e., tuning the same model under the same setting\nresults in significantly different performance. Many recent works have proposed\ndifferent methods to solve this problem, but there is no theoretical\nunderstanding of why and how these methods work. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel theoretical stability analysis of fine-tuning that focuses on two\ncommonly used settings, namely, full fine-tuning and head tuning. We define the\nstability under each setting and prove the corresponding stability bounds. The\ntheoretical bounds explain why and how several existing methods can stabilize\nthe fine-tuning procedure. In addition to being able to explain most of the\nobserved empirical discoveries, our proposed theoretical analysis framework can\nalso help in the design of effective and provable methods. Based on our theory,\nwe propose three novel strategies to stabilize the fine-tuning procedure,\nnamely, Maximal Margin Regularizer (MMR), Multi-Head Loss (MHLoss), and Self\nUnsupervised Re-Training (SURT). We extensively evaluate our proposed\napproaches on 11 widely used real-world benchmark datasets, as well as hundreds\nof synthetic classification datasets. The experiment results show that our\nproposed methods significantly stabilize the fine-tuning procedure and also\ncorroborate our theoretical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 05:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

However, existing KV\nstores on DM employ a semi-disaggregated design that stores KV pairs on DM but\nmanages metadata with monolithic metadata servers, hence still suffering from\nlow resource efficiency on metadata servers. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes FUSEE, a FUlly memory-diSaggrEgated KV StorE that brings\ndisaggregation to metadata management. FUSEE replicates metadata, i.e., the\nindex and memory management information, on memory nodes, manages them directly\non the client side, and handles complex failures under the DM architecture. To\nscalably replicate the index on clients, FUSEE proposes a client-centric\nreplication protocol that allows clients to concurrently access and modify the\nreplicated index. To efficiently manage disaggregated memory, FUSEE adopts a\ntwo-level memory management scheme that splits the memory management duty among\nclients and memory nodes. Finally, to handle the metadata corruption under\nclient failures, FUSEE leverages an embedded operation log scheme to repair\nmetadata with low log maintenance overhead. We evaluate FUSEE with both micro\nand YCSB hybrid benchmarks. The experimental results show that FUSEE\noutperforms the state-of-the-art KV stores on DM by up to 4.5 times with less\nresource consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 06:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Recently, an information-theoretic\nsecurity proof of this protocol has been established in [npj Quant. Inf. 5, 87\n(2019)] assuming the infinitely large number of emitted pulses. To implement\nthe DPS protocol in a real-life world, it is indispensable to analyze the\nsecurity with the finite number of emitted pulses.

In\ndoing so, Azuma's inequality is often employed, but unfortunately we show that\nin the case of the DPS protocol, this results in a substantially low key rate.\nThis low key rate is due to a loose estimation of the sum of probabilities\nregarding three-photon emission whose probability of occurrence is very small.\nThe main contribution of our work is to show that this obstacle can be overcome\nby exploiting the recently found novel concentration inequality, Kato's\ninequality.

Scaling relationships for characteristic time among laboratory and\nrepresentative storage formation conditions are found upon assumption that\nfree-phase CO2 transport during injection is dominated by convection. The\nimplication is that an hour in the FluidFlower (large-scale visual model)\nscales to hundreds of years of elapsed time in the storage formation. The\nscaling criteria permit extrapolation of the effects of changes in parameters\nand operating conditions. Interphase mass transfer allows CO2 to saturate the\nbrine phase and such mass transfer is a significant nonequilibrium phenomenon.\nSignificant mixing of CO2 dissolved into formation brine with original brine is\nfound experimentally and is also predicted. The magnitude of onset time for\ndownward migrating fingers containing CO2 is typically only a fraction of the\nduration of CO2 injection and in general agreement with theoretical analysis in\nthe literature. Predictions for onset time of convective mixing at\nrepresentative storage formation conditions likewise teach that the onset time\nfor viscous fingering is significantly less than the duration of CO2 injection\nin some cases. The implications of this observation include that mixing of CO2\nwith brine and the subsequent settling due to gravity are relatively rapid and\ncoincide with the period of active CO2 injection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 08:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Growing concerns for privacy and security have motivated the\ndevelopment of data-free techniques, at the expanse of accuracy. In this paper,\nwe identity the uniformity of the quantization operator as a limitation of\nexisting approaches, and propose a data-free non-uniform method. More\nspecifically, we argue that to be readily usable without dedicated hardware and\nimplementation, non-uniform quantization shall not change the nature of the\nmathematical operations performed by the DNN.

We\ninstead investigate the situation in which a feature vector represents an\nunordered pair of documents, the value of a feature represents the absolute\ndifference in the relative frequencies (or increasing functions thereof) of the\nfeature in the two documents, and the class label indicates whether the two\ndocuments are from the same author or not.

We used a low-loss, quasi-single spatial mode waveguide optical\nparametric amplifier, a superconducting transition edge sensor, and a\nphase-locked pulsed homodyne measurement system to observe negative values of\nthe Wigner function without loss correction up to three-photon subtraction.\nThese results can be extended to the generation of more complicated\nnon-Gaussian states and are a key technology in the pursuit of high-speed\noptical quantum computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 09:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Data augmentation, which is\neffective at preventing overfitting in standard training, has been observed by\nmany previous works to be ineffective in mitigating overfitting in adversarial\ntraining. This work proves that, contrary to previous findings, data\naugmentation alone can significantly boost accuracy and robustness in\nadversarial training. We find that the hardness and the diversity of data\naugmentation are important factors in combating robust overfitting. In general,\ndiversity can improve both accuracy and robustness, while hardness can boost\nrobustness at the cost of accuracy within a certain limit and degrade them both\nover that limit. To mitigate robust overfitting, we first propose a new crop\ntransformation, Cropshift, which has improved diversity compared to the\nconventional one (Padcrop). We then propose a new data augmentation scheme,\nbased on Cropshift, with much improved diversity and well-balanced hardness.\nEmpirically, our augmentation method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy and\nrobustness for data augmentations in adversarial training.

This allows for\nboth testing existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms against a\nchallenging task, and advancing our knowledge of a complex, turbulent physical\nsystem that has been a major topic of research for over two centuries, and\nremains, even today, the subject of many unanswered questions. The control is\napplied in the form of blowing and suction at the wall, while the observable\nstate is configurable, allowing to choose different variables such as velocity\nand pressure, in different locations of the domain. Given the complex nonlinear\nnature of turbulent flows, the control strategies proposed so far in the\nliterature are physically grounded, but too simple. DRL, by contrast, enables\nleveraging the high-dimensional data that can be sampled from flow simulations\nto design advanced control strategies. In an effort to establish a benchmark\nfor testing data-driven control strategies, we compare opposition control, a\nstate-of-the-art turbulence-control strategy from the literature, and a\ncommonly-used DRL algorithm, deep deterministic policy gradient. Our results\nshow that DRL leads to 43% and 46% drag reduction in a minimal and a larger\nchannel (at a friction Reynolds number of 180), respectively, outperforming the\nclassical opposition control by around 20 percentage points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 09:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 11:43:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 13:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

It reduces\nvariance, often leading to improved prediction accuracy. However, it also\ninevitably introduces bias, which may harm two other measures of predictive\nperformance: calibration and coverage of confidence intervals. Much of the\ncriticism stems from the usage of standard shrinkage methods, such as lasso and\nridge with a single, cross-validated penalty. Our aim is to show that readily\navailable alternatives can strongly improve predictive performance, in terms of\naccuracy, calibration or coverage. For linear regression, we use small sample\nsplits of a large, fairly typical epidemiological data set to illustrate this.\nWe show that usage of differential ridge penalties for covariate groups may\nenhance prediction accuracy, while calibration and coverage benefit from\nadditional shrinkage of the penalties. In the logistic setting, we apply an\nexternal simulation to demonstrate that local shrinkage improves calibration\nwith respect to global shrinkage, while providing better prediction accuracy\nthan other solutions, like Firth's correction. The benefits of the alternative\nshrinkage methods are easily accessible via example implementations using\n\\texttt{mgcv} and \\texttt{r-stan}, including the estimation of multiple\npenalties.

In this\nwork we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our\nobservations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 <~ M <~ 309\nM_sun, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of\nfragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface\ndensity of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The\nminimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a\ndynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence\nof non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and\ngravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize\nthemselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete\nfrom their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that\nthe support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in\nspecific star-forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 10:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

As the disorder strength increases, the Born series\nconverges to another SCBA solution with the finite density of states within the\nmagnetization induced gap. Further increase of the disorder strength leads to a\ndivergence of the Born series, showing the limits of the applicability of the\nBorn approximation. We find that the convergence properties of this Born series\nare closely related to the properties of the logistic map, which is known as a\nprototypical model of chaos. We also calculate the longitudinal and Hall\nconductivities within the Kubo formulas at zero temperature with the vertex\ncorrections for the velocity operator. Vertex corrections are important for\ndescribing transport properties in the strong disorder regime. In the case of\nstrong disorder, the longitudinal conductivity is weakly dependent on the\ndisorder strength, while the Hall conductivity decreases with increasing\ndisorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 11:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

User studies show that\nend-users can understand and formulate queries in ASQ-IT, and that using ASQ-IT\nassists users in identifying faulty agent behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 11:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

A\nprominent group of primal heuristics are diving heuristics. They iteratively\nmodify and resolve linear programs to conduct a depth-first search from any\nnode in the search tree. Existing divers rely on generic decision rules that\nfail to exploit structural commonality between similar problem instances that\noften arise in practice. Therefore, we propose L2Dive to learn specific diving\nheuristics with graph neural networks: We train generative models to predict\nvariable assignments and leverage the duality of linear programs to make diving\ndecisions based on the model's predictions. L2Dive is fully integrated into the\nopen-source solver SCIP. We find that L2Dive outperforms standard divers to\nfind better feasible solutions on a range of combinatorial optimization\nproblems.

Recent advances in machine learning have constructed highly flexible\npoint process models using neural networks to improve upon existing parametric\nmodels. We investigate whether these flexible point process models can be\napplied to short-term seismicity forecasting by extending an existing temporal\nneural model to the magnitude domain and we show how this model can forecast\nearthquakes above a target magnitude threshold. We first demonstrate that the\nneural model can fit synthetic ETAS data, however, requiring less computational\ntime because it is not dependent on the full history of the sequence. By\nartificially emulating short-term aftershock incompleteness in the synthetic\ndataset, we find that the neural model outperforms ETAS.

Constructing multiple forecasting experiments using\nthe Visso, Norcia and Campotosto earthquakes to partition training and testing\ndata, we target M3+ events. We find both models perform similarly at previously\nexplored thresholds (e.g., above M3), but lowering the threshold to M1.2\nreduces the performance of ETAS unlike the neural model.

In particular, we derive the distribution of the prior coefficient of\ndetermination. Placing a beta prior distribution on this measure induces a\ngeneralized beta prime prior distribution on the global variance of the linear\npredictor in the model.

Although neural operators\nexhibit generalization capacities for learning an entire PDE family\nsimultaneously, they become less accurate and explainable while learning\nlong-term behaviours of non-linear PDE families. In this paper, we propose\nKoopman neural operator (KNO), a new neural operator, to overcome these\nchallenges. With the same objective of learning an infinite-dimensional mapping\nbetween Banach spaces that serves as the solution operator of target PDE\nfamily, our approach differs from existing models by formulating a non-linear\ndynamic system of equation solution. By approximating the Koopman operator, an\ninfinite-dimensional linear operator governing all possible observations of the\ndynamic system, to act on the flow mapping of dynamic system, we can\nequivalently learn the solution of an entire non-linear PDE family by solving\nsimple linear prediction problems. In zero-shot prediction and long-term\nprediction experiments on representative PDEs (e.g., the Navier-Stokes\nequation), KNO exhibits notable advantages in breaking the tradeoff between\naccuracy and efficiency (e.g., model size) while previous state-of-the-art\nmodels are limited. These results suggest that more efficient PDE solvers can\nbe developed by the joint efforts from physics and machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 14:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

However, their\nunrestricted range of motion does not capture the restricted motion range and\nbond directionality that is typical of real molecules.\n  In this work, we create flexible colloidal molecules with an in situ\ncontrollable motion range and bond directionality by assembling spherical\nparticles onto cubes functionalized with complementary surface-mobile DNA. We\nassemble colloidal molecules with different coordination number of spheres by\nvarying the size ratio and find that they feature a constrained range of motion\nabove a critical size ratio. Using theory and simulations, we show that the\nparticle shape together with the multivalent bonds create an effective\nfree-energy landscape for the motion of the sphere on the surface of the cube.\nWe quantify the confinement of the spheres on the surface of the cube and the\nprobability to change facet. We find that temperature can be used as an extra\ncontrol parameter to switch in situ between full and constrained flexibility of\nthese colloidal molecules.

Traditional Hoare logics prove properties of\nindividual program executions (so-called trace properties, such as functional\ncorrectness). On the one hand, Hoare logic has been generalized to prove\nproperties of multiple executions of a program (so-called hyperproperties, such\nas determinism or non-interference). These program logics prove the absence of\n(bad combinations of) executions. On the other hand, program logics similar to\nHoare logic have been proposed to disprove program properties (e.g.,\nIncorrectness Logic), by proving the existence of (bad combinations of)\nexecutions. All of these logics have in common that they specify program\nproperties using assertions over a fixed number of states, for instance, a\nsingle pre- and post-state for functional properties or pairs of pre- and\npost-states for non-interference. In this paper, we present Hyper Hoare Logic,\na generalization of Hoare logic that lifts assertions to properties of\narbitrary sets of states. The resulting logic is simple yet expressive: its\njudgments can express arbitrary trace- and hyperproperties over the terminating\nexecutions of a program. By allowing assertions to reason about sets of states,\nHyper Hoare Logic can reason about both the absence and the existence of\n(combinations of) executions, and, thereby, supports both proving and\ndisproving program (hyper-)properties within the same logic. In fact, we prove\nthat Hyper Hoare Logic subsumes the properties handled by numerous existing\ncorrectness and incorrectness logics, and can express hyperproperties that no\nexisting Hoare logic can.

Most existing works assume that the examples in the training data\nare high-quality and focus on strengthening the fitting ability of BBR loss. If\nwe blindly strengthen BBR on low-quality examples, it will jeopardize\nlocalization performance. Focal-EIoU v1 was proposed to solve this problem, but\ndue to its static focusing mechanism (FM), the potential of non-monotonic FM\nwas not fully exploited. Based on this idea, we propose an IoU-based loss with\na dynamic non-monotonic FM named Wise-IoU (WIoU). The dynamic non-monotonic FM\nuses the outlier degree instead of IoU to evaluate the quality of anchor boxes\nand provides a wise gradient gain allocation strategy. This strategy reduces\nthe competitiveness of high-quality anchor boxes while also reducing the\nharmful gradient generated by low-quality examples. This allows WIoU to focus\non ordinary-quality anchor boxes and improve the detector's overall\nperformance.

Safely\nsharing such data while protecting privacy is however challenging.\nAnonymization allows data to be shared while minimizing privacy risks, but\ntraditional anonymization techniques have been repeatedly shown to provide\nlimited protection against re-identification attacks in practice. Among modern\nanonymization techniques, synthetic data generation (SDG) has emerged as a\npotential solution to find a good tradeoff between privacy and statistical\nutility. Synthetic data is typically generated using algorithms that learn the\nstatistical distribution of the original records, to then generate \"artificial\"\nrecords that are structurally and statistically similar to the original ones.\nYet, the fact that synthetic records are \"artificial\" does not, per se,\nguarantee that privacy is protected. In this work, we systematically evaluate\nthe tradeoffs between protecting privacy and preserving statistical utility for\na wide range of synthetic data generation algorithms. Modeling privacy as\nprotection against attribute inference attacks (AIAs), we extend and adapt\nlinear reconstruction attacks, which have not been previously studied in the\ncontext of synthetic data. While prior work suggests that AIAs may be effective\nonly on few outlier records, we show they can be very effective even on\nrandomly selected records. We evaluate attacks on synthetic datasets ranging\nfrom 10^3 to 10^6 records, showing that even for the same generative model, the\nattack effectiveness can drastically increase when a larger number of synthetic\nrecords is generated. Overall, our findings prove that synthetic data is\nsubject to privacy-utility tradeoffs just like other anonymization techniques:\nwhen good utility is preserved, attribute inference can be a risk for many data\nsubjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 14:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Due to\nits inherent nature, agile methodologies involve stakeholders with a wide range\nof expertise and require interaction between them, relying on collaboration and\ncustomer involvement. Hence, agile methodologies encourage collaboration\nbetween all team members so that more efficient and effective processes are\nmaintained. Generating requirements can be challenging, as it requires the\nparticipation of multiple stakeholders who describe various aspects of the\nproject and possess a shared understanding of essential concepts. One simple\nmethod for capturing requirements using natural language is through user\nstories, which document the agreed-upon properties of a project. Stakeholders\ntry to strive for completeness while generating user stories, but the final\nuser story set may still be flawed. To address this issue, we propose SCOUT:\nSupporting Completeness of User Story Sets, which employs a natural language\nprocessing pipeline to extract key concepts from user stories and construct a\nknowledge graph by connecting related terms. The knowledge graph and different\nheuristics are then utilized to enhance the quality and completeness of the\nuser story sets by generating suggestions for the stakeholders. We perform a\nuser study to evaluate SCOUT and demonstrate its performance in constructing\nuser stories. The quantitative and qualitative results indicate that SCOUT\nsignificantly enhance the quality and completeness of the user story sets. Our\ncontribution is threefold.

Evidently, the\nmain problem for the agent is to learn a map from a very high-dimensional space\n(which represents its environment) to a very low-dimensional space (which\nrepresents its actions). The high-to-low dimensional map implies that most of\nthe information about the environment is irrelevant for the actions to be\ntaken, and only a small fraction of information is relevant. In this paper we\nargue that the relevant information need not be learned by brute force (which\nis the standard approach), but can be identified from the intrinsic symmetries\nof the system.

In this work\nwe aim to approximate a nonlinear model with a linear one and correct the\nresulting approximation error. We develop a sequential method that iteratively\nsolves a linear inverse problem and updates the approximation error by\nevaluating it at the new solution. This treatment convexifies the problem and\nallows us to benefit from established convex optimization methods. We\nseparately consider cases where the approximation is fixed over iterations and\nwhere the approximation is adaptive. In the fixed case we show theoretically\nunder what assumptions the sequence converges. In the adaptive case,\nparticularly considering the special case of approximation by first-order\nTaylor expansion, we show that with certain assumptions the sequence converges\nto a critical point of the original nonconvex functional.

More concretely, given a\nstudent's buggy program, our goal is to generate feedback comprising a fixed\nprogram along with a natural language explanation describing the errors/fixes,\ninspired by how a human tutor would give feedback. While using LLMs is\npromising, the critical challenge is to ensure high precision in the generated\nfeedback, which is imperative before deploying such technology in classrooms.\nThe main research question we study is: Can we develop LLMs-based feedback\ngeneration techniques with a tunable precision parameter, giving educators\nquality control over the feedback that students receive? To this end, we\nintroduce PyFiXV, our technique to generate high-precision feedback powered by\nCodex. The key idea behind PyFiXV is to use a novel run-time validation\nmechanism to decide whether the generated feedback is suitable for sharing with\nthe student; notably, this validation mechanism also provides a precision knob\nto educators. We perform an extensive evaluation using two real-world datasets\nof Python programs with syntax errors and show the efficacy of PyFiXV in\ngenerating high-precision feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 13:00:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 11:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

Common approaches in the literature tend to train\ndetectors requiring inside-of-distribution (in-distribution, or IoD) and OoD\nvalidation samples, and/or implement confidence metrics that are often abstract\nand therefore difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose to use existing\nwork from the field of explainable AI, namely the PARTICUL pattern\nidentification algorithm, in order to build more interpretable and robust OoD\ndetectors for visual classifiers. Crucially, this approach does not require to\nretrain the classifier and is tuned directly to the IoD dataset, making it\napplicable to domains where OoD does not have a clear definition. Moreover,\npattern identification allows us to provide images from the IoD dataset as\nreference points to better explain the confidence scores. We demonstrates that\nthe detection capabilities of this approach are on par with existing methods\nthrough an extensive benchmark across four datasets and two definitions of OoD.\nIn particular, we introduce a new benchmark based on perturbations of the IoD\ndataset which provides a known and quantifiable evaluation of the discrepancy\nbetween the IoD and OoD datasets that serves as a reference value for the\ncomparison between various OoD detection methods. Our experiments show that the\nrobustness of all metrics under test does not solely depend on the nature of\nthe IoD dataset or the OoD definition, but also on the architecture of the\nclassifier, which stresses the need for thorough experimentations for future\nwork on OoD detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 15:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

However,\nthe current IEC bifacial measurement standard (IEC 60904-1-2) does not provide\na pathway to account for the critical effects of spectral or broadband albedo\non the rear-side irradiance, with in-lab characterization of bifacial devices\nlimited by overestimation of rear incident irradiance, neglecting spectral\nalbedo effects on the rear, or both. As a result, prior reports have limited\napplicability to the diverse landscapes of bifacial photovoltaic deployments.\nIn this paper, we identify a general bifacial illumination method which\naccounts for spectral albedo while representing realistic system operating\nconditions, referred to as the scaled rear irradiance (SRI) method. We describe\nhow the SRI method extends the IEC standard, facilitating indoor testing of\ncell or module performance under varied albedo with standard solar simulator\nset-ups.

As a result of the\nproven capabilities of DL, a large amount of work has been presented and\nstudied in almost every field. Since 2012, when the convolution neural networks\nhave been reintroduced in the context of \\textit{ImagNet} competition, DL\ncontinued to achieve superior performance in many challenging tasks and\nproblems. Wireless communications, in general, and medium access control (MAC)\ntechniques, in particular, were among the fields that were heavily affected by\nthis improvement. MAC protocols play a critical role in defining the\nperformance of wireless communication systems. At the same time, the community\nlacks a comprehensive survey that collects, analyses, and categorizes the\nrecent work in ML-inspired MAC techniques. In this work, we fill this gap by\nsurveying a long line of work in this era. We solidify the impact of machine\nlearning on wireless MAC protocols. We provide a comprehensive background to\nthe widely adopted MAC techniques, their design issues, and their taxonomy, in\nconnection with the famous application domains.
