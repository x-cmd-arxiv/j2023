This consists of a free, non-interacting brickwork quantum\ncircuit, in which chaos and ergodicity is induced by an impurity interaction,\ni.e., an entangling two-qudit gate, placed at the system's boundary. We compute\nboth the conventional bipartite entanglement entropy with respect to a\nconnected subsystem including the impurity interaction for initial product\nstates as well as the so-called operator entanglement entropy of initial local\noperators. Thereby we provide exact results in a particular scaling limit of\nboth time and system size going to infinity for either very small or very large\nsubsystems. We show that different classes of impurity interactions lead to\nvery distinct entanglement dynamics. For impurity gates preserving a local\nproduct state forming the bulk of the initial state, entanglement entropies of\nstates show persistent spikes with period set by the system size and suppressed\nentanglement in between, contrary to the expected linear growth in ergodic\nsystems.

If the non-linear vector field contribution is absent, the\ngravitational maximum mass and the sound velocity at high densities are the\ngreatest. However, it also gives the smallest speed of sound at densities below\nthree times saturation density.

To\novercome this, we propose a novel Japanese sentence representation framework,\nJCSE (derived from ``Contrastive learning of Sentence Embeddings for\nJapanese''), that creates training data by generating sentences and\nsynthesizing them with sentences available in a target domain. Specifically, a\npre-trained data generator is finetuned to a target domain using our collected\ncorpus. It is then used to generate contradictory sentence pairs that are used\nin contrastive learning for adapting a Japanese language model to a specific\ntask in the target domain.\n  Another problem of Japanese sentence representation learning is the\ndifficulty of evaluating existing embedding methods due to the lack of\nbenchmark datasets. Thus, we establish a comprehensive Japanese Semantic\nTextual Similarity (STS) benchmark on which various embedding models are\nevaluated. Based on this benchmark result, multiple embedding methods are\nchosen and compared with JCSE on two domain-specific tasks, STS in a clinical\ndomain and information retrieval in an educational domain. The results show\nthat JCSE achieves significant performance improvement surpassing direct\ntransfer and other training strategies.

Without a specification of relevant details of the\nenvironment, the evolution of a reduced density matrix is therefore typically\nunpredictable, even if the dynamics are deterministic. With this in mind, we\ninvestigate a two level open quantum system using a framework of quantum state\ndiffusion. We consider the pseudorandom evolution of its reduced density matrix\nwhen subjected to an environment-driven process of continuous quantum\nmeasurement of a system observable, using dynamics that asymptotically send the\nsystem to an eigenstate. The unpredictability is characterised by a stochastic\nentropy production, the average of which corresponds to an increase in the\nsubjective uncertainty of the quantum state adopted by the system and\nenvironment, given the underspecified dynamics. This differs from a change in\nvon Neumann entropy, and can continue indefinitely as the system is guided\ntowards an eigenstate. As one would expect, the simultaneous measurement of two\nnon-commuting observables within the same framework does not send the system to\nan eigenstate. Instead, the probability density function describing the reduced\ndensity matrix of the system becomes stationary over a continuum of pure\nstates, a situation characterised by zero further stochastic entropy\nproduction. Transitions between such stationary states, brought about by\nchanges in the relative strengths of the two measurement processes, give rise\nto finite positive mean stochastic entropy production. The framework\ninvestigated can offer useful perspectives on both the dynamics and\nirreversible thermodynamics of measurement in quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 17:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

In the presence of an external magnetic\nfield, ALPs produce: (i) photon-ALP oscillations, (ii) the change of the\npolarization state of photons. The former effect has many consequences in the\nastrophysical contest, such as the modification of the transparency of the\nUniverse and the alteration of the astrophysical spectra. We address here the\nlatter effect by analyzing how the photon degree of linear polarization and the\npolarization angle get modified by photon-ALP interaction in the case where\nphotons are generated at the jet base of some BL Lacs (a blazar class): OJ 287,\nBL Lacertae, Markarian 501 and 1ES 0229+200, by considering both a leptonic and\nhadronic emission mechanism.

It also accounts for critical biological effects, such as the maternal\ntransmission of Wolbachia through infected females and cytoplasmic\nincompatibility, which effectively sterilizes uninfected females when they mate\nwith infected males. We derived and interpreted dimensionless numbers,\nincluding the basic reproductive number and next-generation numbers. The\nproposed system presents backward bifurcation, which indicates a threshold\ninfection that needs to be exceeded to establish a stable Wolbachia infection.\nThe sensitivity analysis ranks the relative importance of the epidemiological\nparameters at the baseline. We simulate different intervention scenarios,\nincluding pre-release mitigation using larviciding and thermal fogging before\nthe release, multiple releases of infected populations, and different release\ntiming. Our simulations show that the most efficient approach to establishing\nWolbachia is to release all the infected mosquitoes immediately after the\npre-release mitigation process. Also, the model predicts that it is more\nefficient to release during the dry season than the wet season.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 18:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

So that we can verify our\npredictions using large-scale free-fermion numerics, we restrict ourselves to\nparity-symmetric measurements. To describe their averaged effect analytically\nwe use a replica approach, and we show that the defect arising in the replica\ntheory is an irrelevant perturbation to the Ising CFT. Strikingly, the\nasymptotic scaling of averaged correlations and entanglement entropy are\ntherefore unchanged relative to the ground state. In contrast, the defect\ngenerated by postselecting on the most likely measurement outcomes is exactly\nmarginal. We then find that the exponent governing post-measurement order\nparameter correlations, as well as the ''effective central charge'' governing\nthe scaling of entanglement entropy, vary continuously with the density of\nmeasurements in space. Our work establishes new connections between the effects\nof measurements on many-body quantum states and of physical defects on\nlow-energy equilibrium properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 19:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

With effective\npermeability of 0.1-1.0 mD, the existence of channels in a cement annulus with\napertures of 10-300 micrometer constitutes a major threat. Squeeze cement is\ntypically difficult to repair channels-leakage with small apertures; hence, a\nlow-viscosity sealer that can be inserted into these channels while producing a\nlong-term resilient seal is sought. A novel application using nano-silica\nsealants could be the key to seal these channels. In the construction and\nsealing of hydrocarbon wells, cementing is a critical phase. Cement is prone to\ncracking during the life cycle of a well because of the changes in downhole\nconditions. The usage of micro-sized cross-linked nano-silica gel as a sealant\nmaterial to minimize damaged cement sheaths is investigated in this study.\nFluid leakage through channels in the cement was investigated using an\nexperimental system. With a diameter of 0.05 inches, the impact of the cement\nchannel size was explored. The sealing efficiency increased from 86 percent to\n95 percent when the nano-silica concentration of the sealing gel increased from\n13 percent to 25 percent. This demonstrates that the concentration of\nnano-silica in the sealing gel affects the gel's ability to seal against fluid\nflow.

Consequently, it was confirmed that the\nsimulation began with the periodic oscillation of the condensate, which\nattenuated and maintained a stable rotation with slanted elliptical shapes;\nhowever, the surface was excited to be unstable and generated ripples, which\ngrew into vortices and then penetrated the inside the condensate, forming a\nlattice. We confirmed that each branch point of the phase of wavefunctions\ncorresponds to each vortex. These results demonstrate our approach at a certain\ndegree of accuracy. In conclusion, we successfully developed a new SPH scheme\nfor the simulations of vortex lattice formation in rotating BECs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 20:28:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2023 15:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

However, optimizing VNF deployment for highly complex\nnetworks remains a challenge. Alternatively, reinforcement learning (RL) based\napproaches have been proposed to optimize this task, especially to employ a\nscaling action-based method which can deploy VNFs within less computational\ntime.

For applications involving glycerol, care must be taken to\navoid exposure to humidity, since its viscosity decreases quickly as water is\nabsorbed. We report experimental measurements of the viscosity of glycerol in a\nparallel-plate rheometer where the outer interface is exposed to atmosphere.\nThe measurements decrease with time as water is absorbed from the atmosphere\nand transported throughout the glycerol via diffusion and advection. Measured\nviscosities drop faster at higher relative humidities, confirming the role of\nhygroscopicity on the transient viscosities. The rate of viscosity decrease\nshows a non-monotonic relationship with the rheometer gap height. This behavior\nis explained by considering the transition from diffusion-dominated transport\nin the narrow gap regime to the large gap regime where transport is dominated\nby inertia-driven secondary flows. Numerical simulations of the water\nabsorption and transport confirm this non-monotonic behavior. The experimental\nviscosity measurements show unexpectedly fast decreases at very small gap\nheights, violating the parallel-plate, axisymmetric model. We propose that this\ndrop-off may be due to misalignment in the rheometer that becomes\nnon-negligible for small gaps. Theoretical considerations show that secondary\nflows in a misaligned rheometer dominate the typical secondary inertial flows\nin parallel-plate rheometers at small gaps. Finally, simulations in a\nmisaligned parallel-plate system demonstrate the same sharp drop-off in\nviscosity measurements at small gap heights.

The preparation of dense fiber-reinforced\nSilicon-Carbon (SiC) composites was considered as a representative of CVI\nmethodology, where methyl-trichlorosilane (MTS) was used as both the silicon\nand carbon donor for the silicon carbide matrix.

The concentration of MTS at the surface of the\npreform fibers was calculated using the adopted BSM.

However, it\nis challenging to design an optical instrument to achieve all of these\nproperties simultaneously. Existing techniques for large-FOV microscopic\nimaging and for 3D image measurement typically require many sequential image\nsnapshots, thus compromising speed and throughput. Here, we present 3D-RAPID, a\ncomputational microscope based on a synchronized array of 54 cameras that can\ncapture high-speed 3D topographic videos over a 135-cm^2 area, achieving up to\n230 frames per second at throughputs exceeding 5 gigapixels (GPs) per second.\n3D-RAPID features a 3D reconstruction algorithm that, for each synchronized\ntemporal snapshot, simultaneously fuses all 54 images seamlessly into a\nglobally-consistent composite that includes a coregistered 3D height map.

The governing equations are discretized in\nconservation form. The nonlinear convective terms of the equations, as well as\nthe viscous stress tensor and the heat flux, are discretized on the dual mesh\nat the aid of an explicit local ADER finite volume scheme, while the implicit\npressure terms are discretized at the aid of a continuous $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$\nfinite element method on the nodes of the primal mesh.

Employing 2D\nCartesian-rectilinear subsampling schemes is a conventional approach for\naccelerated acquisitions; however, this often results in imprecise\nreconstructions, even with the use of Deep Learning (DL), especially at high\nacceleration factors. Non-rectilinear or non-Cartesian trajectories can be\nimplemented in MRI scanners as alternative subsampling options. This work\ninvestigates the impact of the $k$-space subsampling scheme on the quality of\nreconstructed accelerated MRI measurements produced by trained DL models.\n  Methods: The Recurrent Variational Network (RecurrentVarNet) was used as the\nDL-based MRI-reconstruction architecture. Cartesian, fully-sampled multi-coil\n$k$-space measurements from three datasets were retrospectively subsampled with\ndifferent accelerations using eight distinct subsampling schemes: four\nCartesian-rectilinear, two Cartesian non-rectilinear, and two non-Cartesian.\nExperiments were conducted in two frameworks: scheme-specific, where a distinct\nmodel was trained and evaluated for each dataset-subsampling scheme pair, and\nmulti-scheme, where for each dataset a single model was trained on data\nrandomly subsampled by any of the eight schemes and evaluated on data\nsubsampled by all schemes.\n  Results: In both frameworks, RecurrentVarNets trained and evaluated on\nnon-rectilinearly subsampled data demonstrated superior performance,\nparticularly for high accelerations.

In practise, many systems for which Turing patterning\nis important are not homogeneous with ideal boundary conditions. In\nheterogeneous systems with stable steady states, the steady states are also\nnecessarily heterogeneous which is problematic for applying the classical\nanalysis. Whilst there has been some work done to extend Turing analysis to\nsome heterogeneous systems, for many systems it is still difficult to determine\nif a stable patterned state is driven purely by system heterogeneity or if a\nTuring instability is playing a role. In this work, we try to define a\nframework which uses numerical continuation to map heterogeneous RD systems\nonto a sensible nearby homogeneous system. This framework may be used for\ndiscussing the role of Turing instabilities in establishing patterns in\nheterogeneous RD systems. We study the Schnakenberg and Gierer-Meinhardt models\nwith spatially heterogeneous production as test problems. It is shown that for\nsufficiently large system heterogeneity (large amplitude spatial variations in\nmorphogen production) it is possible that Turing-patterned and base states\nbecome coincident and therefore impossible to distinguish. Other exotic\nbehaviour is also shown to be possible. We also study a novel scenario in which\nmorphogen is produced locally at levels that could support Turing patterning\nbut on intervals/patches which are on the scale of classical critical domain\nlengths. Without classical domain boundaries, Turing patterns are allowed to\nbleed through; an effect noted by other authors. In this case, this phenomena\neffectively changes the critical domain length. Indeed, we even note that this\nphenomena may also effectively couple local patches together and drive\ninstability in this way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 00:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

More importantly, averaging\nresults over short subsequences achieves periodic exactness on a much larger\nspace of multivariate polynomials of quadratic total degree. This framework is\ndevised by first considering stochastic blocked mean-field quadratures, which\nmay be useful in other contexts.

However, this approach\nlacks a reliable method to determine the initial filter conditions and assumes\nthat the distribution of states remains Gaussian. This study presents an\nalternative, data-driven method to track the states and parameters of neural\nmass models (NMMs) from EEG recordings using deep learning techniques,\nspecifically an LSTM neural network.\n  Approach\n  An LSTM filter was trained on simulated EEG data generated by a neural mass\nmodel using a wide range of parameters. With an appropriately customised loss\nfunction, the LSTM filter can learn the behaviour of NMMs. As a result, it can\noutput the state vector and parameters of NMMs given observation data as the\ninput.\n  Main Results\n  Test results using simulated data yielded correlations with R squared of\naround 0.99 and verified that the method is robust to noise and can be more\naccurate than a nonlinear Kalman filter when the initial conditions of the\nKalman filter are not accurate.

This approach has no need to specify the initial state vector and\nparameters, which is very difficult to do in practice because many of the\nvariables being estimated cannot be measured directly in physiological\nexperiments.

However, it can be challenging\nto capture the inherent structure of the target features accurately due to the\nlack of supervised information on the target domain. By analyzing the\nclustering performance of the target features, we show that they still contain\ncore features related to discriminative attributes but lack the collation of\nsemantic information. Inspired by this insight, we present Chaos to Order\n(CtO), a novel approach for SFDA that strives to constrain semantic credibility\nand propagate label information among target subpopulations. CtO divides the\ntarget data into inner and outlier samples based on the adaptive threshold of\nthe learning state, customizing the learning strategy to fit the data\nproperties best. Specifically, inner samples are utilized for learning\nintra-class structure thanks to their relatively well-clustered properties. The\nlow-density outlier samples are regularized by input consistency to achieve\nhigh accuracy with respect to the ground truth labels. In CtO, by employing\ndifferent learning strategies to propagate the labels from the inner local to\noutlier instances, it clusters the global samples from chaos to order. We\nfurther adaptively regulate the neighborhood affinity of the inner samples to\nconstrain the local semantic credibility. In theoretical and empirical\nanalyses, we demonstrate that our algorithm not only propagates from inner to\noutlier but also prevents local clustering from forming spurious clusters.\nEmpirical evidence demonstrates that CtO outperforms the state of the arts on\nthree public benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 03:39:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 09:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

As the temperature is raised,\nthese spin clusters become more numerous, and it is found that eventually their\nboundaries undergo a percolation transition when about 13\\% of spins are\nminority. Boundary percolation differs from the more commonly studied site and\nlink percolation, although it is related to an unusual type of site percolation\nthat includes next to nearest neighbor relationships. Because the Ising model\ncan be reformulated in terms of the domain boundaries alone, there is reason to\nbelieve boundary percolation should be relevant here. A symmetry-breaking order\nparameter is found in the dual theory, the 3D gauge Ising model. It is seen to\nundergo a phase transition at a coupling close to that predicted by duality\nfrom the boundary percolation. This transition lies in the disordered phase of\nthe gauge theory and has the nature of a spin-glass transition.

The third\nenergy cumulant fits well to the expected non-infinite critical behavior in a\nmanner consistent with both the predicted exponent and critical point,\nindicating a true thermal phase transition.

The objective is formulated theoretically as the expected returns\ndiscounted over the time horizon. One of the major policy gradient biases is\nthe state distribution shift: the state distribution used to estimate the\ngradients differs from the theoretical formulation in that it does not take\ninto account the discount factor. Existing discussion of the influence of this\nbias was limited to the tabular and softmax cases in the literature. Therefore,\nin this paper, we extend it to the DRL setting where the policy is\nparameterized and demonstrate how this bias can lead to suboptimal policies\ntheoretically. We then discuss why the empirically inaccurate implementations\nwith shifted state distribution can still be effective. We show that, despite\nsuch state distribution shift, the policy gradient estimation bias can be\nreduced in the following three ways: 1) a small learning rate; 2) an\nadaptive-learning-rate-based optimizer; and 3) KL regularization. Specifically,\nwe show that a smaller learning rate, or, an adaptive learning rate, such as\nthat used by Adam and RSMProp optimizers, makes the policy optimization robust\nto the bias. We further draw connections between optimizers and the\noptimization regularization to show that both the KL and the reverse KL\nregularization can significantly rectify this bias. Moreover, we provide\nextensive experiments on continuous control tasks to support our analysis.

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we verify the\nsupercritical nature of dusty plasmas and reveal the existence of a dynamical\nliquid-like to gas-like crossover which perfectly matches the salient features\nof the Frenkel line in classical supercritical fluids. We present several\ndiagnostics to locate this dynamical crossover spanning from local atomic\nconnectivity, shear relaxation dynamics, velocity autocorrelation function,\nheat capacity, and various transport properties. All these different criteria\nwell agree with each other and are able to successfully locate the Frenkel line\nin both 2D and 3D dusty plasmas.

Existing methods edit the attributes of the output image\nsuch as orientation or color scheme by varying the latent code along certain\ndirections. However, these methods usually require additional human annotations\nfor each pretrained model, and they mostly focus on editing global attributes.\nIn this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to improve the spatial\nsteerability of GANs without searching for steerable directions in the latent\nspace or requiring extra annotations. Specifically, we design randomly sampled\nGaussian heatmaps to be encoded into the intermediate layers of generative\nmodels as spatial inductive bias. Along with training the GAN model from\nscratch, these heatmaps are being aligned with the emerging attention of the\nGAN's discriminator in a self-supervised learning manner. During inference,\nhuman users can intuitively interact with the spatial heatmaps to edit the\noutput image, such as varying the scene layout or moving objects in the scene.\nExtensive experiments show that the proposed method not only enables spatial\nediting over human faces, animal faces, outdoor scenes, and complicated indoor\nscenes, but also brings improvement in synthesis quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 07:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

Since the appropriate\ndiagonal preconditioners that accelerate the convergence of P-PDS vary greatly\ndepending on the structure of the target optimization problem, a design method\nof diagonal preconditioners for PPDS has been proposed to determine them\nautomatically from the problem structure. However, the existing method has two\nlimitations: it requires direct access to all elements of the matrices\nrepresenting the linear operators involved in the target optimization problem,\nand it is element-wise preconditioning, which makes certain types of proximity\noperators impossible to compute analytically. To overcome these limitations, we\nestablish an Operator-norm-based design method of Variable-wise Diagonal\nPreconditioning (OVDP).

A stability analysis of solutions based on the Bogoliubov\nequations for fluctuations show that persistent instabilities are localized at\nsharp boundaries, and are predicated by the relation of the mean density change\nacross the boundary to the value of the derivative of the density at the edge.\nWe examine the scattering of a wavepacket by a barrier potential and show that\nat any instant the scattered states are well described by the stationary\nsolutions we obtain, indicating applications of our results and methods to\nnonlinear scattering problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 09:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

However, individual DOs generally tend to inject larger DP noises\nfor stronger privacy provisions (which entails severe degradation of model\nutility), while the curator (i.e., aggregation server) aims to minimize the\noverall effect of added random noises for satisfactory model performance. To\naddress this conflicting goal, we propose a novel dynamic privacy pricing\n(DyPP) game which allows DOs to sell individual privacy (by lowering the scale\nof locally added DP noise) for differentiated economic compensations (offered\nby the curator), thereby enhancing FL model utility. Considering\nmulti-dimensional information asymmetry among players (e.g., DO's data\ndistribution and privacy preference, and curator's maximum affordable payment)\nas well as their varying private information in distinct FL tasks, it is hard\nto directly attain the Nash equilibrium of the mixed-strategy DyPP game.\nAlternatively, we devise a fast reinforcement learning algorithm with two\nlayers to quickly learn the optimal mixed noise-saving strategy of DOs and the\noptimal mixed pricing strategy of the curator without prior knowledge of\nplayers' private information.

In recent years, the overall\nincidence and mortality rate of pneumonia regardless of the utilization of\neffective vaccines and compelling antibiotics has escalated. Thus, pneumonia\nremains a disease that needs spry prevention and treatment. The widespread\nprevalence of pneumonia has caused the research community to come up with a\nframework that helps detect, diagnose and analyze diseases accurately and\npromptly. One of the major hurdles faced by the Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nresearch community is the lack of publicly available datasets for chest\ndiseases, including pneumonia . Secondly, few of the available datasets are\nhighly imbalanced (normal examples are over sampled, while samples with ailment\nare in severe minority) making the problem even more challenging.

The ARs produced several major eruptive flares while their\nphotospheric magnetic field exhibited primarily flux decay in AR11890 and\nprimarily flux emergence in AR11618.

Despite such\nincoherence, the eruptions occurred at times of net helicity peaks that were\nco-temporal with peaks in the free magnetic energy. The losses associated with\nthe eruptive flares in the normalized free magnetic energy were in the range\n10-60%. For the helicity, changes ranged from 25% to the removal of the entire\nexcess helicity of the prevailing sign, leading a roughly zero net helicity,\nbut with significant equal and opposite budgets of both helicity senses. The\nremoval of the slowly varying background component of the free energy and\nhelicity timeseries revealed that all eruption-related peaks of both quantities\nexceeded the 2$\\sigma$ levels of their detrended timeseries.

However, learning an accurate model can be difficult since the policy\nis continually updated and the induced distribution over visited states used\nfor model learning shifts accordingly. Prior methods alleviate this issue by\nquantifying the uncertainty of model-generated samples. However, these methods\nonly quantify the uncertainty passively after the samples were generated,\nrather than foreseeing the uncertainty before model trajectories fall into\nthose highly uncertain regions. The resulting low-quality samples can induce\nunstable learning targets and hinder the optimization of the policy.

Although the exact\nphysical mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unclear, it is generally\nassumed to be unique to the transonic regime. This assumption is shown to be\nincorrect here by performing large-eddy simulations of flow over a NACA0012\nprofile for a wide range of flow conditions. At zero incidence and sufficiently\nhigh freestream Mach numbers, M, transonic buffet occurs with shock waves\npresent in the flow. However, self-sustained oscillations that occur at similar\nfrequencies are observed at lower M for which shock waves are absent and the\nentire flow field remains subsonic at all times. At higher incidences, the\noscillations are sustained at progressively lower M. Oscillations were observed\nfor M as low as 0.3, where compressibility effects are small. A spectral proper\northogonal decomposition shows that the spatial structure of these oscillations\n(i.e., mode shapes) are essentially the same for all cases. These results\nindicate that buffet on aerofoils does not necessarily require the presence of\nshock waves. Furthermore, the trend seen with increasing incidence angles\nsuggests that transonic buffet on aerofoils and low-frequency oscillations\nreported in the incompressible regime (Zaman et al., 1989, J. Fluid Mech., vol.\n202, pp. 403--442) have similar origins. Thus, models which rely specifically\non shock waves to explain transonic buffet are incorrect. These insights could\nbe useful in understanding the origins of ``transonic\" buffet and reformulating\nmitigation strategies by shifting the focus away from shock waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 10:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

To ensure that such interconnected models can be\napplied for the purpose of simulation and/or control, a reduced-order model for\nthe interconnected dynamics is needed. In the scope of this paper, we pursue\nthis goal by subsystem reduction to warrant modularity of the reduction\napproach. Clearly, by reducing the complexity of the subsystem models, not only\nthe accuracy of the subsystem models is affected, but, consequently, also the\naccuracy of the interconnected model. It is typically difficult to predict a\npriori how the interconnected model accuracy is affected precisely by the\nsubsystem reduction. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a\ntop-down approach which enables the translation of given accuracy requirements\nof the interconnected system model to accuracy requirements at subsystem model\nlevel, by using mathematical tools from robust performance analysis. This\nallows for the independent reduction of subsystem models while guaranteeing the\ndesired accuracy of the interconnected model.

Therefore, here we\npropose a fast and accurate machine learning and reduced order modelling\nframework, based on finite element simulations, to assist practitioners in the\nplanning and interventional stages. It consists of a first classification step\nto determine a priori whether a simulation will be successful (good conformity\nbetween stent and vessel) or not from a clinical perspective, followed by a\nregression step that provides an approximated solution of the deployed stent\nconfiguration. The latter is achieved using a non-intrusive reduced order\nmodelling scheme that combines the proper orthogonal decomposition algorithm\nand Gaussian process regression.

In\nthis regard, emerging RRAMs have attracted considerable interest for their\nunique qualities like low power consumption, high integration potential,\ndurability, and CMOS compatibility. Using RRAMs to imitate the more analog\nstorage behavior of brain synapses is also a promising strategy for further\nimproving memory density and power efficiency. However, RRAM devices display\nstrong stochastic behavior, together with relaxation effects, making it more\nchallenging to precisely control their multi-level storage capability.

Typically, equilibria of games are analyzed in vitro, under the\nassumption that players cannot arbitrarily commit to strategies. However,\nequilibria thus obtained do not hold in general in vivo, when games are\ndeployed on a blockchain. Being able to deploy side contracts changes\nfundamental game-theoretic assumptions by inducing a meta-game wherein agents\nstrategize to deploy the best contracts. Not taking side contracts into account\nthus fails to capture an important aspect of deploying smart contracts in\npractice. A game that remains secure when the players can deploy side contracts\nis said to be side contract resilient. We demonstrate the non-triviality of\nside contract resilience by analyzing two smart contracts for decentralized\ncommerce. These contracts have the same intended functionality, but we show\nthat only one is side contract resilient.

Existing methods typically\ncontain two steps: choosing or learning a mobility representation and applying\na clustering algorithm to the representation. However, these methods rely on\nstrict visiting orders in trajectories and cannot take advantage of multiple\ntypes of mobility representations. This paper proposes a novel mobility\nclustering method for mobility behavior detection. First, the proposed method\ncontains a permutation-equivalent operation to handle sub-trajectories that\nmight have different visiting orders but similar impacts on mobility behaviors.\nSecond, the proposed method utilizes a variational autoencoder architecture to\nsimultaneously perform clustering in both latent and original spaces. Also, in\norder to handle the bias of a single latent space, our clustering assignment\nprediction considers multiple learned latent spaces at different epochs. This\nway, the proposed method produces accurate results and can provide reliability\nestimates of each trajectory's cluster assignment. The experiment shows that\nthe proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art methods in mobility behavior\ndetection from trajectories with better accuracy and more interpretability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 12:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become\nparticularly popular in such applications, promising to cover large areas at\nhigh speeds. Moreover, with the increasing maturity of onboard UAV perception,\nresearch focus has been shifting toward higher-level reasoning for single- and\nmulti-robot missions. However, autonomous navigation and exploration of\npreviously unknown large spaces still constitutes an open challenge, especially\nwhen the environment is cluttered and exhibits large and frequent occlusions\ndue to high obstacle density, as is the case of forests. Moreover, the problem\nof long-distance wireless communication in such scenes can become a limiting\nfactor, especially when automating the navigation of a UAV swarm. In this\nspirit, this work proposes an exploration strategy that enables UAVs, both\nindividually and in small swarms, to quickly explore complex scenes in a\ndecentralized fashion. By providing the decision-making capabilities to each\nUAV to switch between different execution modes, the proposed strategy strikes\na great balance between cautious exploration of yet completely unknown regions\nand more aggressive exploration of smaller areas of unknown space. This results\nin full coverage of forest areas of variable density, consistently faster than\nthe state of the art. Demonstrating successful deployment with a single UAV as\nwell as a swarm of up to three UAVs, this work sets out the basic principles\nfor multi-root exploration of cluttered scenes, with up to 65% speed up in the\nsingle UAV case and 40% increase in explored area for the same mission time in\nmulti-UAV setups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 12:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

While current\nerror-correcting strategies focus on correcting errors in quantum states or\nquantum gates, these fine-grained error-correction methods can incur\nsignificant overhead for quantum algorithms of increasing complexity. We\npresent a first step in achieving error correction at the level of quantum\nalgorithms by combining a unified perspective on modern quantum algorithms via\nquantum signal processing (QSP). An error model of under- or over-rotation of\nthe signal processing operator parameterized by $\\epsilon < 1$ is introduced.\nIt is shown that while Pauli $Z$-errors are not recoverable without additional\nresources, Pauli $X$ and $Y$ errors can be arbitrarily suppressed by coherently\nappending a noisy `recovery QSP.' Furthermore, it is found that a recovery QSP\nof length $O(2^k c^{k^2} d)$ is sufficient to correct any length-$d$ QSP with\n$c$ unique phases to $k^{th}$-order in error $\\epsilon$. Allowing an additional\nassumption, a lower bound of $\\Omega(cd)$ is shown, which is tight for $k = 1$,\non the length of the recovery sequence.

Unfortunately,\nchallenges related to the growth and characterization of doping and p-n\njunction formation in nanowire devices (along axial or radial axis) have\nsignificantly impeded their development. The problems are further amplified if\na p-n junction has to be implemented radially. Therefore, even though radial\njunction devices are expected to be on par with their axial junction\ncounterparts, there are minimal reports on high-performance radial junction\nnanowire optoelectronic devices. This paper summarizes our recent results on\nthe simulation and fabrication of radial junction nanowire solar cells and\nphotodetectors, which have shown unprecedented performance and clearly\ndemonstrate the importance of radial junction for optoelectronic applications.\nOur simulation results show that the proposed radial junction device is both\noptically and electrically optimal for solar cell and photodetector\napplications, especially if the absorber quality is extremely low. The radial\njunction nanowire solar cells could achieve a 17.2% efficiency, whereas the\nunbiased radial junction photodetector could show sensitivity down to a single\nphoton level using an absorber with a lifetime of less than 50 ps. In\ncomparison, the axial junction planar device made using same substrate as\nabsorber showed less than 1% solar cell efficiency and almost no photodetection\nat 0 V. This study is conclusive experimental proof of the superiority of\nradial junction nanowire devices over their thin film or axial junction\ncounterparts, especially when absorber lifetime is extremely low. The proposed\ndevice holds huge promise for III-V based photovoltaics and photodetectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 13:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

The IC spectra generated in the Klein-Nishina regime is\nsofter and has a smaller flux level compared to the synchrotron spectra\nproduced by the same electrons. The detection of afterglow emission from nearby\nGRB 190819A in the very high energy (VHE) domain with H.E.S.S. has revealed an\nunexpected feature: the slope of the VHE spectrum matches well the slope of the\nX-ray spectra, despite expectations that for the IC production process, the\nimpact of the Klein-Nishina effect should be strong.

However, some discrepancies remain in empirical research focusing on\nsuch biofeedback (BF) regarding their efficacy, and the mechanisms underlying\nthe effects of these wearables remains unclear. Moreover, the influence of\nindividual traits on the efficiency of BF has been marginally studied, while it\nhas been shown that personality could impact both stress and its regulation.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the outcome of interactions with these\ntechnologies from a psycho-physiological standpoint, but also to explore\nwhether personality may influence its efficiency when other interaction devices\nare present.

We evidence using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy\n(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), that this competitive\nselfseparation also exists in co-sputtered Zr-Cr thin films with Cr contents of\n~84-86 at.%, corresponding to the transition between the amorphous and\ncrystalline compositions, and in the Zr-V system. Then, to assess the\nsturdiness of this phenomenon, its existence and geometrical characteristics\nare evaluated when varying the film composition and the deposition rate. The\nvariation of geometrical features, such as the crystalline cone angle, the size\nand density of crystallites, is discussed. Is it shown that a variation in the\ndeposition rate changes the nucleation and growth kinetics of the crystallites.\nThe surface coverage by the crystalline phase at a given thickness is also\ncalculated for each deposition rate. Moreover, comparison is made between\nZr-Cr, Zr-V, Zr-Mo and Zr-W dual-phase thin films to compare their nucleation\nand growth kinetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 14:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

In particular, we hypothesize that the similarity of an\nAV's driving style compared to the end-user's driving style will have a major\nimpact on end-user's willingness to use the AV. To investigate the impact of\ndriving style on user acceptance, we 1) develop a data-driven approach to\npersonalize driving style and 2) demonstrate that personalization significantly\nimpacts attitudes towards AVs. Our approach learns a high-level model that\ntunes low-level controllers to ensure safe and personalized control of the AV.\nThe key to our approach is learning an informative, personalized embedding that\nrepresents a user's driving style. Our framework is capable of calibrating the\nlevel of aggression so as to optimize driving style based upon driver\npreference. Across two human subject studies (n = 54), we first demonstrate our\napproach mimics the driving styles of end-users and can tune attributes of\nstyle (e.g., aggressiveness). Second, we investigate the factors (e.g., trust,\npersonality etc.) that impact homophily, i.e. an individual's preference for a\ndriving style similar to their own.

Traditionally,\nthey are based on directed acyclic graphs that capture dependencies between\nrandom variables. However, directed cycles can naturally arise when\ncross-dependencies between random variables exist, e.g., for modeling feedback\nloops. Existing methods to deal with such cross-dependencies usually rely on\nreductions to BNs without cycles. These approaches are fragile to generalize,\nsince their justifications are intermingled with additional knowledge about the\napplication context. In this paper, we present a foundational study regarding\nsemantics for cyclic BNs that are generic and conservatively extend the\ncycle-free setting. First, we propose constraint-based semantics that specify\nrequirements for full joint distributions over a BN to be consistent with the\nlocal conditional probabilities and independencies. Second, two kinds of limit\nsemantics that formalize infinite unfolding approaches are introduced and shown\nto be computable by a Markov chain construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 14:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

Particle-accelerating colliding-wind binaries (PACWBs) are systems\nthat are formed by two massive and hot stars and produce nonthermal (NT)\nradiation. The key elements of these systems are fast winds and the shocks that\nthey create when they collide. Binaries with nonaccreting young pulsars have\nalso been detected as NT emitters, again as a consequence of the wind-wind\ninteraction. Black holes (BHs) might produce NT radiation by this mechanism if\nthey accrete at super-Eddington rates. In such cases, the disk is expected to\nlaunch a radiation-driven wind, and if this wind has an equatorial component,\nit can collide with the companion star yielding a PACWB. These systems are\nsupercritical colliding wind binaries (SCWBs).\n  Aims. We aim to characterize the particle acceleration and NT radiation\nproduced by the collision of winds in binary systems composed of a\nsuperaccreting BH and an early-type star.\n  Methods. We estimated the terminal velocity of the disk-driven wind by\ncalculating the spatial distribution of the radiation fields and their effect\non disk particles. We then found the location of the wind collision region and\ncalculated the timescales of energy gain and losses of relativistic particles\nundergoing diffusive acceleration.

Prior works on mobility\nestimation either focus on a single city or lack the ability to model the\nspatio-temporal dependencies across cities and time periods. To address these\nissues, we make the first attempt to tackle the cross-city human mobility\nestimation problem through a deep meta-generative framework.

In general, because the rank values directly\ndetermine the model complexity and model accuracy, proper selection of\nlayer-wise rank is very critical and desired. To date, though many low-rank\ncompression approaches, either selecting the ranks in a manual or automatic\nway, have been proposed, they suffer from costly manual trials or unsatisfied\ncompression performance. In addition, all of the existing works are not\ndesigned in a hardware-aware way, limiting the practical performance of the\ncompressed models on real-world hardware platforms.\n  To address these challenges, in this paper we propose HALOC, a hardware-aware\nautomatic low-rank compression framework.

Such PICs could offer superior scalability for complex\nfunctionalities and volume production, as well as improved stability and\nreliability over time. However, there are two major issues preventing the\nrealization of such envisioned PICs: the high phase noise of semiconductor\nlasers, and the difficulty of integrating optical isolators directly on chip.\nPICs are still considered as inferior solutions in optical systems such as\nmicrowave synthesizers, optical gyroscopes and atomic clocks, despite their\nadvantages in size, weight, power consumption and cost (SWaPC). Here, we\nchallenge this convention by introducing three-dimensional (3D) integration in\nsilicon photonics that results in ultra-low-noise, isolator-free PICs. Through\nmultiple monolithic and heterogeneous processing sequences, direct on-chip\nintegration of III-V gain and ultra-low-loss (ULL) silicon nitride (SiN)\nwaveguides with optical loss around 0.5 dB/m are demonstrated. Consequently,\nthe demonstrated PIC enters a new regime, such that an integrated ultra-high-Q\ncavity reduces the laser noise close to that of fiber lasers. Moreover, the\ncavity acts as an effective block for any downstream on-chip or off-chip\nreflection-induced destabilization, thus eliminating the need for optical\nisolators. We further showcase isolator-free, widely-tunable, low-noise,\nheterodyne microwave generation using two ultra-low-noise lasers on the same\nsilicon chip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 16:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

The\ntheory is fully-coupled with electrodeposition impacting mechanical\ndeformation, stress generation and damage of the host. Conversely,\nelectrodeposition kinetics are affected by mechanical stresses via a\nthermodynamically-consistent, physically motivated driving force that\ndistinguishes chemical, electrical and mechanical contributions.

Using two fine-grained datasets\n(CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars), we first show that such methods do not\ncorrectly identify the regions of interest inside of the images, and therefore\ndo not reflect the model behaviour. Secondly, using a deletion metric, we\ndemonstrate quantitatively that saliency methods such as Smoothgrads or PRP\nprovide more faithful image patches. We also propose a new relevance metric\nbased on the segmentation of the object provided in some datasets (e.g.\nCUB-200-2011) and show that the imprecise patch visualisations generated by\nProtoPNet and ProtoTree can create a false sense of bias that can be mitigated\nby the use of more faithful methods.

Here we consider deformations from circular to elliptic cross\nsections. Solution of this problem in steady flow is fairly straightforward.\nThe focus in the present paper is on pulsatile flow where the change from\ncircular to elliptic cross sections is associated with a transition in the\ncharacter of the equations governing the flow from Bessel to Mathieu equations.\nThe study of this problem has been hampered in the past because of difficulties\ninvolved in the solution of the governing equations. In the present study we\ndescribe methods we have used to overcome some of these difficulties and\npresent a comprehensive set of results based on these methods. In particular,\nvessel deformation is examined under two different conditions relevant to blood\nflow regulation: (i) keeping cross sectional area constant and (ii) keeping\ncross sectional circumference constant. The results provide an important\ncontext for the mechanism of neurovascular control of blood flow under the\npathological conditions of vessel deformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 21:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

However, most of these neural networks are large and inefficient\nmaking it a barrier for deployment in practical wireless systems that require\nlow-latency and low memory footprints for individual network functions. To\nmitigate these limitations, we propose accelerated and compressed efficient\nneural networks for massive MIMO CSI feedback. Specifically, we have thoroughly\ninvestigated the adoption of network pruning, post-training dynamic range\nquantization, and weight clustering to optimize CSI feedback compression for\nmassive MIMO systems. Furthermore, we have deployed the proposed model\ncompression techniques on commodity hardware and demonstrated that in order to\nachieve inference gains, specialized libraries that accelerate computations for\nsparse neural networks are required. Our findings indicate that there is\nremarkable value in applying these model compression techniques and the\nproposed joint pruning and quantization approach reduced model size by 86.5%\nand inference time by 76.2% with minimal impact to model accuracy. These\ncompression methods are crucial to pave the way for practical adoption and\ndeployments of deep learning-based techniques in commercial wireless systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 12:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}
