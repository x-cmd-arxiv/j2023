String\ntheory is usually formulated in the worldsheet formalism, which describes a\nsingle string (first-quantization). While this approach is intuitive and could\nbe pushed far due to the exceptional properties of two-dimensional theories, it\nbecomes cumbersome for some questions or even fails at a more fundamental\nlevel. These motivations have led to the development of SFT, a description of\nstring theory using the field theory formalism (second-quantization). As a\nfield theory, SFT provides a rigorous and constructive formulation of string\ntheory.\n  The main objective is to construct the closed bosonic SFT and to explain how\nto assess the consistency of string theory with it. The accent is put on\nproviding the reader with the foundations, conceptual understanding and\nintuition of what SFT is. After reading this book, they should be able to study\nthe applications from the literature.\n  The book is organized in two parts. The first part reviews the topics of the\nworldsheet theory that are necessary to build SFT (worldsheet path integral,\nCFT and BRST quantization). The second part starts by introducing general\nconcepts of SFT from the BRST quantization. Then, it introduces off-shell\nstring amplitudes before providing a Feynman diagrams interpretation from which\nthe building blocks of SFT are extracted. After constructing the closed SFT, it\nis used to outline the proofs of several important consistency properties, such\nas background independence, unitarity and crossing symmetry.

Identifying a molecule that is chemically stable over\nthe temperature range of a planetary atmosphere can help establish a\n``baseline'' to disentangle the various potential causes of limb asymmetries\nobserved in other species. We identify CO as an ideal molecule, given its\nstability over nearly the entirety of the ultra-hot Jupiter temperature range.\nFurthermore, we find that if limb asymmetry is due to morning terminator\nclouds, blueshifts for a number of species should decrease during transit.\nFinally, by comparing our forward models to Kesseli et al. (2022), we\ndemonstrate that binning high-resolution spectra into two phase bins provides a\ndesirable trade-off between maintaining signal to noise and resolving\nasymmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 16:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

To better predict these\neffects with low computational costs, we develop data-driven emulators of the\n`local' or `internal' turbine thrust coefficient $C_T^*$ as a function of\nturbine layout. We train the model using a multi-fidelity Gaussian Process (GP)\nregression with a combination of low (engineering wake model) and high-fidelity\n(Large-Eddy Simulations) simulations of farms with different layouts and wind\ndirections. A large set of low-fidelity data speeds up the learning process and\nthe high-fidelity data ensures a high accuracy.

This data is then\npassed to a ground vehicle that constructs a map of the road verge and uses a\ntrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify pieces of litter. After\nthe pieces of litter are identified on the map of the road verge, the ground\nrobot navigates to each piece of trash, re-evaluates the area, and performs a\n\"greedy pickup\" procedure.

Unfortunately, convection-dominated problems generally have a\nslowly decaying Kolmogorov n-width, which makes obtaining an accurate ROM built\nsolely from training data very challenging. The accuracy of a ROM can be\nimproved through enrichment with HDM solutions; however, due to the large\ncomputational expense of HDM evaluations for complex problems, they can only be\nused parsimoniously to obtain relevant computational savings. In this work, we\nexploit the local spatial and temporal coherence often exhibited by these\nproblems to derive an accurate, cost-efficient approach that repeatedly\ncombines HDM and ROM evaluations without a separate training phase. Our\napproach obtains solutions at a given time step by either fully solving the HDM\nor by combining partial HDM and ROM solves. A dynamic sampling procedure\nidentifies regions that require the HDM solution for global accuracy and the\nreminder of the flow is reconstructed using the ROM.

Most studies of this model have been performed\nassuming a maximally symmetric geometry for the 5D bulk, in which it has been\nshown that the theory reduces to various types of Galileon. In contrast, the\ngeneral case for the geometry of the bulk provides a different covariantization\nof the Galileon model than the covariant Galileon: the DBI-Galileon.

Distinct from prior works which exploit\nsparsity in appropriate domains in order to solve the resulting ill-posed\nproblem, this paper explores the role of binary priors in super-resolution,\nwhere the spike (or source) amplitudes are assumed to be binary-valued. Our\nstudy is inspired by the problem of neural spike deconvolution, but also\napplies to other applications such as symbol detection in hybrid millimeter\nwave communication systems. This paper makes several theoretical and\nalgorithmic contributions to enable binary super-resolution with very few\nmeasurements. Our results show that binary constraints offer much stronger\nidentifiability guarantees than sparsity, allowing us to operate in \"extreme\ncompression\" regimes, where the number of measurements can be significantly\nsmaller than the sparsity level of the spikes. To ensure exact recovery in this\n\"extreme compression\" regime, it becomes necessary to design algorithms that\nexactly enforce binary constraints without relaxation. In order to overcome the\nensuing computational challenges, we consider a first order auto-regressive\nfilter (which appears in neural spike deconvolution), and exploit its special\nstructure.

In this\npaper, we extended the non-hydrostatic wave-flow model SWASH with additional\nterms that account for the influence of a depth-uniform ambient current on the\nwave dynamics, in which the current field can be taken from an external source\n(e.g., from observations or a circulation model). We verified the model ability\nby comparing predictions to results from linear theory, laboratory experiments\nand a spectral wave model that accounts for wave interference effects.

Furthermore, the model captured\nthe wave dynamics in the presence of strong opposing currents. This includes\nreflections of relatively small amplitude waves at the theoretical blocking\npoint, and transmission of breaking waves beyond the theoretical blocking point\nfor larger wave amplitudes.

Most of the current work on graph adversarial\nattacks aims at lowering the overall prediction accuracy, but we argue that the\nresulting abnormal model performance may catch attention easily and invite\nquick counterattack. Moreover, attacks through modification of existing graph\ndata may be hard to conduct if good security protocols are implemented. In this\nwork, we consider an easier attack harder to be noticed, through adversarially\npatching the graph with new nodes and edges. The attack is universal: it\ntargets a single node each time and flips its connection to the same set of\npatch nodes. The attack is unnoticeable: it does not modify the predictions of\nnodes other than the target. We develop an algorithm, named GUAP, that achieves\nhigh attack success rate but meanwhile preserves the prediction accuracy. GUAP\nis fast to train by employing a sampling strategy. We demonstrate that a 5%\nsampling in each epoch yields 20x speedup in training, with only a slight\ndegradation in attack performance. Additionally, we show that the adversarial\npatch trained with the graph convolutional network transfers well to other\nGNNs, such as the graph attention network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 18:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

In the passive setting, these advantages\nare realized by leveraging correlation between the received signals at\ndifferent sensors. This has led to the belief that sparse arrays require a\nlarge number of temporal measurements to reliably estimate parameters of\ninterest from these correlations, and therefore they may not be preferred in\nthe sample-starved regime. In this paper, we debunk this myth by performing a\nrigorous non-asymptotic analysis of the Coarray ESPRIT algorithm. This\nseemingly counter-intuitive result is a consequence of the scaling of the\nsingular value of the coarray manifold, which compensates for the potentially\nlarge covariance estimation error in the limited snapshot regime. Specifically,\nwe show that for a nested array operating in the regime of fewer sources than\nsensors ($S=O(1)$), it is possible to bound the matching distance error between\nthe estimated and true directions of arrival (DOAs) by an arbitrarily small\nquantity ($\\epsilon$) with high probability, provided (i) the number of\ntemporal snapshots ($L$) scales only logarithmically with the number of sensors\n($P$), i.e. $L=\\Omega(\\ln(P)/\\epsilon^2)$, and (ii) a suitable separation\ncondition is satisfied. Our results also formally prove the well-known\nempirical resolution benefits of sparse arrays, by establishing that the\nminimum separation between sources can be $\\Omega(1/P^2)$, as opposed to\nseparation $\\Omega(1/P)$ required by a ULA with the same number of sensors. Our\nsample complexity expression reveals the dependence on other key model\nparameters such as SNR and the dynamic range of the source powers. This enables\nus to establish the superior noise-resilience of nested arrays both\ntheoretically and empirically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 18:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

However, many DP algorithms have to fill in large DP tables,\nrepresented by two-dimensional arrays, which causes at least quadratic running\ntimes and space usages. This has led to the development of improved algorithms\nfor special cases when the DPs satisfy additional properties like, e.g., the\nMonge property or total monotonicity.\n  In this paper, we consider a new condition which assumes (among some other\ntechnical assumptions) that the rows of the DP table are monotone. Under this\nassumption, we introduce a novel data structure for computing\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate DP solutions in near-linear time and space in the\nstatic setting, and with polylogarithmic update times when the DP entries\nchange dynamically. To the best of our knowledge, our new condition is\nincomparable to previous conditions and is the first which allows to derive\ndynamic algorithms based on existing DPs. Instead of using two-dimensional\narrays to store the DP tables, we store the rows of the DP tables using\nmonotone piecewise constant functions.

One of the most popular skew normal distributions, due to its\nintuitive appeal, is the Azzalini's skew normal distribution. However, due to\nthe nature of the distribution it suffers from serious inferential problems.\nInterestingly, the Bayesian approach has been shown to mitigate these issues.\nRecently, another skew normal distribution, the Geometric skew normal\ndistribution, which is structurally different from Azzalini's skew normal\ndistribution, has been proposed as an alternative for modelling skewed data.\nDespite the interest in skew normal distributions, a limited number of articles\ndeal with comparing the performance of different skew distributions, especially\nin the Bayesian context. To address this gap, the article attempts to compare\nthese two skew normal distributions in the Bayesian paradigm for modelling data\nwith varied skewness. The posterior estimates of the parameters of the\ngeometric skew normal distribution are obtained using a hybrid Gibbs-Metropolis\nalgorithm and the posterior predictive fit to the data is also obtained.\nSimilarly, for the Azzalini's skew normal distribution, the posterior\npredictive fit are derived using a Gibbs sampling algorithm. To compare the\nperformance, Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the posterior predictive\ndistribution and original data is utilised to measure the goodness of fit for\nboth the models. An assortment of real and simulated data sets, with a wide\nrange of skewness, are analyzed using both the models and the advantages as\nwell as disadvantages of the two models are also discussed. Finally, a much\nfaster Variational Bayes method for approximating the posterior distribution of\nthe geometric skew normal model is proposed and its performance is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 18:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

Most previous work on sequential recommendation that uses\nside information models item IDs and side information separately, which may\nfail to fully model the relation between the items and their side information.\nMoreover, in real-world systems, not all values of item feature fields are\navailable.

To address the limitation of sequential\nrecommenders with side information, we define a way to fuse side information\nand alleviate the problem of missing side information by proposing a unified\ntask, namely the missing information imputation (MII), which randomly masks\nsome feature fields in a given sequence of items, including item IDs, and then\nforces a predictive model to recover them. By considering the next item as a\nmissing feature field, sequential recommendation can be formulated as a special\ncase of MII. We propose a sequential recommendation model, called missing\ninformation imputation recommender (MIIR), that builds on the idea of MII and\nsimultaneously imputes missing item feature values and predicts the next item.\nWe devise a dense fusion self-attention (DFSA) mechanism for MIIR to capture\nall pairwise relations between items and their side information.

Such problems are\ninstances of the little noncommutative Grothendieck problem (LNCG), a natural\ngeneralization of quadratic combinatorial optimization where, instead of binary\ndecision variables, one optimizes over orthogonal matrices. In this work, we\nestablish an embedding of this class of LNCG problems over the orthogonal group\nonto a quantum Hamiltonian. This embedding is accomplished by identifying\northogonal matrices with their double cover (Pin and Spin group) elements,\nwhich we represent as quantum states. We connect this construction to the\ntheory of free fermions, which provides a physical interpretation of the\nderived LNCG Hamiltonian as a two-body interacting-fermion model due to the\nquadratic nature of the problem. Determining extremal states of this\nHamiltonian provides an outer approximation to the original problem, analogous\nto classical relaxations of the problem via semidefinite programming. When\noptimizing over the special orthogonal group, our quantum relaxation naturally\nobeys additional, powerful constraints based on the convex hull of rotation\nmatrices. The classical size of this convex-hull representation is exponential\nin matrix dimension, whereas the quantum representation requires only a linear\nnumber of qubits. Finally, to project the relaxed solution into the feasible\nspace, we employ rounding procedures which return orthogonal matrices from\nappropriate measurements of the quantum state. Through numerical experiments we\nprovide evidence that this quantum relaxation can produce high-quality\napproximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

Yet, its theoretical\nfundament is only starting to emerge with major dependencies still to be\nuncovered.\n  AIMS: A temperature or radius dependence is usually not included in\ndescriptions for the mass loss of classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars, despite\nbeing crucial for other hot star wind domains. We thus aim to determine whether\nsuch a dependency will also be necessary for a comprehensive description of\nmass loss in the cWR regime.\n  METHODS: Sequences of dynamically consistent atmosphere models were\ncalculated with the hydrodynamic branch of the PoWR code along the temperature\ndomain, using different choices for luminosity, mass, and surface abundances.\nFor the first time, we allowed nonmonotonic velocity fields when solving the\nequation of motion. The resulting velocity structures were then interpolated\nfor the comoving-frame radiative transfer, ensuring that the main wind\ncharacteristics were preserved.\n  RESULTS: We find a strong dependence of the mass-loss rate with the\ntemperature of the critical/sonic point which mainly reflects the different\nradii and resulting gravitational accelerations. Moreover, we obtain a relation\nbetween the observed effective temperature and the transformed mass-loss rate\nwhich seems to be largely independent of the underlying stellar parameters. The\nrelation shifts for different clumping factors in the outer wind. Below a\ncharacteristic value of -4.5, the slope of this relation changes and the winds\nbecome transparent for He II ionizing photons.\n  CONCLUSIONS: The mass loss of cWR stars is a high-dimensional problem but\nalso shows inherent scalings which can be used to obtain an approximation of\nthe observed effective temperature.

Classification of time-series images, particularly with\nrecursive methods, is of increasing interest in the current literature.\nNevertheless, existing recursive approaches typically require large amounts of\ntraining data. This paper introduces a recursive classification framework that\nprovides high accuracy while requiring low computational cost and minimal\nsupervision. The proposed approach transforms a static classifier into a\nrecursive one using a probabilistic framework that is robust to non-informative\nimage variations. A water mapping and a land cover experiment are conducted\nanalyzing Sentinel-2 satellite data covering two areas in the United States.\nThe performance of three static classification algorithms and their recursive\nversions is compared, including a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Logistic\nRegression (LR) and Spectral Index Classifiers (SICs).

Two state-of-the-art deep learning-based\nclassifiers are also used as benchmark models.

Existing solutions almost exclusively assume each user utility\nfunction is known and concave. This paper seeks to answer the following\nquestion: how to allocate resources when utility functions are unknown, even to\nthe users? This answer has become increasingly important in the next-generation\nAI-aware communication networks where the user utilities are complex and their\nclosed-forms are hard to obtain. In this paper, we provide a new solution using\na distributed and data-driven bilevel optimization approach, where the lower\nlevel is a distributed network utility maximization (NUM) algorithm with\nconcave surrogate utility functions, and the upper level is a data-driven\nlearning algorithm to find the best surrogate utility functions that maximize\nthe sum of true network utility.

When\nthe manifolds are assumed to be linear subspaces, many methods succeed using\nlow-rank and sparse priors, which have been studied extensively over the past\ntwo decades. Unfortunately, most real-world datasets can not be well\napproximated by linear subspaces. On the other hand, several works have\nproposed to identify the manifolds by learning a feature map such that the data\ntransformed by the map lie in a union of linear subspaces, even though the\noriginal data are from non-linear manifolds.

The effects of\nirradiation-induced defects, such as a/2 111 and a 100 type loops and\ncomposition fluctuations representative of phase separation in irradiated\nFeCrAl alloys, are investigated separately as well as superposed together in\nsimulations. We explore the effects of defects on the stress-strain behavior,\nspecifically yield strength and hardening response, of FeCrAl nanopillars. Our\nsimulations confirm the widely accepted fact that irradiated alloys exhibit a\nstress-strain response with higher yield strength and hardening as compared to\nhomogeneous alloys. However, our DDD calculations reveal an atypical\nsuperposition of the hardening contributions due to composition inhomogeneity\nand irradiation loops wherein hardening due composition inhomogeneity\ncounteracts hardening due to irradiation loops at small scales. As a result, we\nobserve that the yield strength in irradiated alloys, after taking into\nconsideration the effects of both composition inhomogeneity and irradiation\nloops, is smaller than the yield strength of the alloys with only irradiation\nloops and is approximately same for the alloy with composition inhomogeneity\nalone. We identify this destructive interference in the superposition in our\nparallel TEM in situ tensile tests on unirradiated, ion irradiated, and neutron\nirradiated C35M FeCrAl alloy as well.

The figure consists of numerous\nauto-generated substructures with an inherent hierarchy of far more smalls than\nlarges. Through these substructures, the structural beauty of an image (L) can\nbe computed by the multiplication of the number of substructures (S) and their\ninherent hierarchy (H). This definition implies that the more substructures,\nthe more living or more structurally beautiful, and the higher hierarchy of the\nsubstructures, the more living or more structurally beautiful.

In this paper we develop a recursive approach, which derives all\nsubstructures of an image (instead of its figure) and continues the deriving\nprocess for those decomposable substructures until none of them are\ndecomposable. All of the substructures derived at different iterations (or\nrecursive levels) together constitute a living structure; hence the notion of\nliving images. We applied the recursive approach to a set of images and found\nthat (1) the number of substructures of an image is far lower (3 percent on\naverage) than the number of pixels and the centroids of the substructures can\neffectively capture the skeleton or saliency of the image; (2) all the images\nhave the recursive levels more than three, indicating that they are indeed\nliving images; (3) no more than 2 percent of the substructures are\ndecomposable; (4) structural beauty can be measured by the recursively defined\nsubstructures, as well as their decomposable subsets.

Several strategies (e.g.,\nAdapters, prefix tuning, BitFit, and LoRA) have been proposed. However, their\ndesigns are hand-crafted separately, and it remains unclear whether certain\ndesign patterns exist for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Thus, we present a\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning design paradigm and discover design patterns\nthat are applicable to different experimental settings. Instead of focusing on\ndesigning another individual tuning strategy, we introduce parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning design spaces that parameterize tuning structures and tuning\nstrategies. Specifically, any design space is characterized by four components:\nlayer grouping, trainable parameter allocation, tunable groups, and strategy\nassignment. Starting from an initial design space, we progressively refine the\nspace based on the model quality of each design choice and make greedy\nselection at each stage over these four components. We discover the following\ndesign patterns: (i) group layers in a spindle pattern; (ii) allocate the\nnumber of trainable parameters to layers uniformly; (iii) tune all the groups;\n(iv) assign proper tuning strategies to different groups. These design patterns\nresult in new parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. We show experimentally\nthat these methods consistently and significantly outperform investigated\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies across different backbone models and\ndifferent tasks in natural language processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 21:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

In fact, measurements in the distribution system are often noisy,\ncorrupted, and unavailable. To address these issues, we propose the Deep\nStatistical Solver for Distribution System State Estimation (DSS$^2$), a deep\nlearning model based on graph neural networks (GNNs) that accounts for the\nnetwork structure of the distribution system and for the physical governing\npower flow equations. DSS$^2$ leverages hypergraphs to represent the\nheterogeneous components of the distribution systems and updates their latent\nrepresentations via a node-centric message-passing scheme.

The proposed\nmethod assigns a measure of importance to different set of features used in the\ncategorization, hence making the results more explainable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 22:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

During the process,\ndata sharing is often involved to allow the third-party modelers to perform\nspecific time series data mining (TSDM) tasks based on the need of data owner.\nThe high resolution of TS brings new challenges in protecting privacy. While\nmeaningful information in high-resolution TS shifts from concrete point values\nto local shape-based segments, numerous research have found that long\nshape-based patterns could contain more sensitive information and may\npotentially be extracted and misused by a malicious third party. However, the\nprivacy issue for TS patterns is surprisingly seldom explored in\nprivacy-preserving literature. In this work, we consider a new\nprivacy-preserving problem: preventing malicious inference on long shape-based\npatterns while preserving short segment information for the utility task\nperformance. To mitigate the challenge, we investigate an alternative approach\nby sharing Matrix Profile (MP), which is a non-linear transformation of\noriginal data and a versatile data structure that supports many data mining\ntasks. We found that while MP can prevent concrete shape leakage, the canonical\ncorrelation in MP index can still reveal the location of sensitive long\npattern. Based on this observation, we design two attacks named Location Attack\nand Entropy Attack to extract the pattern location from MP. To further protect\nMP from these two attacks, we propose a Privacy-Aware Matrix Profile (PMP) via\nperturbing the local correlation and breaking the canonical correlation in MP\nindex vector. We evaluate our proposed PMP against baseline noise-adding\nmethods through quantitative analysis and real-world case studies to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 22:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

The monitoring of forest health is,\ntherefore, indispensable for the long-term conservation of forests and their\nsustainable management. In this regard, evaluating the amount and quality of\ndead wood is of utmost interest as they are favorable indicators of\nbiodiversity. Apparently, remote sensing-based techniques have proven to be\nmore efficient and sustainable with unprecedented accuracy in forest inventory.\nHowever, the application of these techniques is still in its infancy with\nrespect to dead wood mapping. This study investigates for the first time the\nautomatic classification of individual coniferous trees into five decay stages\n(live, declining, dead, loose bark, and clean) from combined airborne laser\nscanning data and color infrared images using Machine Learning methods. First,\nCIR colorized point clouds are created by fusing the ALS point clouds and the\ncolor infrared images. Then, with the colorized point cloud, individual tree\nsegmentation is conducted using a semi-automatic approach, which are further\nprojected onto four orthogonal planes displaying the side views of the trees in\n2D. Finally, the classification is conducted on the multispectral point clouds\nand projected images using the three Machine Learning algorithms.

Using a\ndifference-in-difference strategy comparing municipalities that historically\nhad FARC presence and those with presence of a similar, smaller guerrilla\ngroup, the ELN, before and after the start of a unilateral ceasefire by the\nFARC, I establish three sets of results. First, violence indicators\nsignificantly and sizably decreased in historically FARC municipalities.\nSecond, despite this large reduction in violence, I find precisely-estimated\nnull effects across a variety of economic indicators, suggesting no effect of\nthe peace agreement on economic activity. Furthermore, I use a sharp\ndiscontinuity in eligibility to the government's flagship business and job\ncreation program for conflict-affected areas to evaluate the policy's impact,\nalso finding precisely-estimated null effects on the same economic indicators.\nThird, I present evidence that suggests the reason why historically FARC\nmunicipalities could not reap the economic benefits from the reduction in\nviolence is a lack of state capacity, caused both by their low initial levels\nof state capacity and the lack of state entry post-ceasefire.

The low current magnitude and\ndiverse characteristics of HIFs make them difficult to be detected by\nover-current relays. Recently, data-driven methods based on machine learning\nmodels are gaining popularity in HIF detection due to their capability to learn\ncomplex patterns from data. Most machine learning-based detection methods adopt\nsupervised learning techniques to distinguish HIFs from normal load conditions\nby performing classifications, which rely on a large amount of data collected\nduring HIF. However, measurements of HIF are difficult to acquire in the real\nworld. As a result, the reliability and generalization of the classification\nmethods are limited when the load profiles and faults are not present in the\ntraining data. Consequently, this paper proposes an unsupervised HIF detection\nframework using the autoencoder and principal component analysis-based\nmonitoring techniques. The proposed fault detection method detects the HIF by\nmonitoring the changes in correlation structure within the current waveforms\nthat are different from the normal loads. The performance of the proposed HIF\ndetection method is tested using real data collected from a 4.16 kV\ndistribution system and compared with results from a commercially available\nsolution for HIF detection. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms the commercially available HIF detection technique while\nmaintaining high security by not falsely detecting during load conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 01:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

Purpose : In this study we setup an experimental station for small\nanimal proton Flash irradiation in a clinical machine. The dose monitoring\nsystem is able to provide real-time irradiation dose and irradiation time\nstructure.\n  Methods : The dose monitoring system includes homebrewed transmission\nionization chamber (TIC), plastic scintillator based beam position monitor, and\nPoor Man Faraday Cup (FC). Both TIC and FC are equipped with a homebrewed fast\nreading current integral electronics device. The imaging guidance system\ncomprises a moveable CT, laser, as well as attaching a bead on the body surface\nof the mouse can accurately guide the testing small animal in position.\n  Results : The dose monitoring system can provide the time structure of\ndelivered dose rate within 1 ms time resolution. Experimental testing results\nshow that the highest dose in one pulse of 230 MeV proton that can be delivered\nto the target is about 20 Gy during 199 ms pulse period at 100 Gy/s dose rate.\n  Conclusion : A proton research irradiation platform dedicated for studying\nsmall animal Flash biological effects has been established at Chang Gung\nMemorial Hospital.

It is of particular importance, especially in the light mass region,\nto verify the structure change when $\\Lambda$ particle(s) is added to normal\nnuclei. The ground state of $^{8}$Be has been know to have a well-developed\n$\\alpha$--$\\alpha$ cluster structure, whereasn$^{12}$C has a mixed structure of\nthree $\\alpha$ clusters and $jj$-coupling shell model, where $\\alpha$ clusters\nare partially broken. Adding $\\Lambda$ particle(s) could induce the structure\nchange. We compare the Be and C cases. Using the antisymmetrized quasi-cluster\nmodel (AQCM), the $\\alpha$-cluster states and $jj$-coupling shell-model states\nof $^8$Be and $^{12}$C are prepared on the same footing, and we add $\\Lambda$\nparticles.

On the\nother hand, in the Be case, although the $\\Lambda$ particle(s) shrinks the\n$\\alpha$--$\\alpha$ distance, the breaking effect of the cluster structure is\nrather limited. The spin-orbit interaction is the driving force of breaking the\n$\\alpha$ clusters, and whether the glue-like effect of $\\Lambda$ particle(s)\nattracts the cluster inside the range of this interaction is crucial. In\n$^{14}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}$C, the breaking of $\\alpha$ clusters in $^{12}$C is\nmuch enhanced by the addition of the $\\Lambda$ particles than the case of free\n$^{12}$C.

In this paper, we propose a new approach called Feature Recovery\nTransformer (FRT) to address the two challenges simultaneously, which mainly\nconsists of visibility graph matching and feature recovery transformer.

Prior methods typically generate frame-level or clip-level object\ninstances first and then associate them by either additional tracking heads or\ncomplex instance matching algorithms. This explicit instance association\napproach increases system complexity and fails to fully exploit temporal cues\nin videos. In this paper, we design a simple, fast and yet effective\nquery-based framework for online VIS. Relying on an instance query and proposal\npropagation mechanism with several specially developed components, this\nframework can perform accurate instance association implicitly. Specifically,\nwe generate frame-level object instances based on a set of instance\nquery-proposal pairs propagated from previous frames. This instance\nquery-proposal pair is learned to bind with one specific object across frames\nthrough conscientiously developed strategies. When using such a pair to predict\nan object instance on the current frame, not only the generated instance is\nautomatically associated with its precursors on previous frames, but the model\ngets a good prior for predicting the same object. In this way, we naturally\nachieve implicit instance association in parallel with segmentation and\nelegantly take advantage of temporal clues in videos. To show the effectiveness\nof our method InsPro, we evaluate it on two popular VIS benchmarks, i.e.,\nYouTube-VIS 2019 and YouTube-VIS 2021. Without bells-and-whistles, our InsPro\nwith ResNet-50 backbone achieves 43.2 AP and 37.6 AP on these two benchmarks\nrespectively, outperforming all other online VIS methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 02:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

Quantum paraelectric insulators -- materials which are nearly\nferroelectric -- are particularly promising candidate systems for this purpose\nsince they have strongly fluctuating collective modes which directly couple to\nthe electric field. In this work we explore this possibility in a system\ncomprised of a quantum paraelectric sandwiched between two high-quality metal\nmirrors, realizing a Fabry-Perot type cavity. By developing a full multimode,\ncontinuum description we are able to study the effect of the cavity in a\nspatially resolved way for a variety of system sizes and temperatures.\nSurprisingly, we find that once a continuum of transverse modes are included\nthe cavity ends up suppressing ferroelectric correlations. This effect arises\nfrom the screening out of transverse photons at the cavity boundaries and as a\nresult is confined to the surface of the paraelectric sample. We also explore\nthe temperature dependence of this effect and find it vanishes at high\ntemperatures, indicating it is a purely quantum mechanical effect. We connect\nour result to calculations of Casimir and Van der Waals forces, which we argue\nare closely related to the dipolar fluctuations in the quantum paraelectric.\nOur results are based on a general formalism and are expected to be widely\napplicable, paving the way towards studies of the quantum electrodynamics of\nheterostructures featuring multiple materials and phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 02:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

Their\napplications in policing, traffic management, and documenting public spaces are\nincreasingly common. Despite the often-discussed biases in the algorithms'\ntraining and unequally borne benefits, almost all applications similarly reduce\nurban experiences to simplistic, reductive, and mechanistic measures. There is\na lack of context, depth, and specificity in these practices that enables\nsemantic knowledge or analysis within urban contexts, especially within the\ncontext of using and occupying urban space. This paper will critique existing\nuses of artificial intelligence and computer vision in urban practices to\npropose a new framework for understanding people, action, and public space.\n  This paper revisits Geertz's use of thick descriptions in generating\ninterpretive theories of culture and activity and uses this lens to establish a\nframework to evaluate the varied uses of computer vision technologies that\nweigh meaning. We discuss how the framework's positioning may differ (and\nconflict) between different users of the technology. This paper also discusses\nthe current use and training of deep learning algorithms and how this process\nlimits semantic learning and proposes three potential methodologies for gaining\na more contextually specific, urban-semantic, description of urban space\nrelevant to urbanists.\n  This paper contributes to the critical conversations regarding the\nproliferation of artificial intelligence by challenging the current\napplications of these technologies in the urban environment by highlighting\ntheir failures within this context while also proposing an evolution of these\nalgorithms that may ultimately make them sensitive and useful within this\nspatial and cultural milieu.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 03:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

Upon observing that a large variance of the gradient estimator in SGLD\nessentially increases the temperature of the stationary distribution, we\npropose expediting tempering schemes for SGLD by directly estimating the bias\ncaused by the stochastic gradient estimator. This simple idea enables us to\nsimulate high-temperature chains at a negligible computational cost (compared\nto that of the low-temperature chain) while preserving the convergence to the\ntarget distribution. Our method is fundamentally different from the recently\nproposed m-reSGLD (multi-variance replica exchange SGLD) method in that the\nlatter suffers from the low accuracy of the gradient estimator (e.g., the chain\ncan fail to converge to the target) while our method benefits from it. Further,\nwe derive a swapping rate that can be easily evaluated, providing another\nsignificant improvement over m-reSGLD. To theoretically demonstrate the\nadvantage of our method, we develop convergence bounds in Wasserstein\ndistances.

Inspired by these advances, this article\nintroduces sparse regression LDPC codes and their decoding.

In certain settings, SPARCs\nare known to achieve capacity; yet, their performance suffers at finite block\nlengths.

Efficient decoding for such a code can be achieved\nusing AMP with a denoiser that performs belief propagation on the factor graph\nof the outer LDPC code.

Experiments on 8 AMR datasets from a\nreal-world large-scale AMR simulation demonstrate that TAC+ can improve the\ncompression ratio by up to 4.9X under the same data distortion, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art method.

Using these two types of nucleation tests we obtain for our\nmodel material surprisingly tight two-sided bounds on the elastic binodal\nwithout directly computing the quasiconvex envelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 04:45:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 22:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Firstly, a ConvLSTM-PAN\nmodel structure is designed to capture suspicious small moving objects, in\nwhich the Convolutional Long and Short Time Memory (ConvLSTM) network\naggregated the Spatio-temporal features of the adjacent multi-frame small\nmoving object and the Path Aggregation Network (PAN) located the suspicious\nsmall moving objects. Then, an object tracking algorithm is used to track\nsuspicious small objects and calculate their Motion Range (MR). At the same\ntime, the size of the MR of the suspicious small moving object is adjusted\nadaptively according to its speed of movement (specifically, if the object\nmoves slowly, its MR will be expanded according to the speed of the object to\nensure the necessary environmental information of the object). Adaptive\nSpatio-temporal Cubes (ASt-Cubes) of the small moving objects are generated to\nensure that the SNR of the moving objects is improved, and the necessary\nenvironmental information is retained adaptively.

We assess the effect of stellar rotation on neutrino-driven convection\nand SASI when neutrino heating is taken into account. Rotation affects the\nfrequency of the mode m=2 detectable with gravitational waves (GW). We use a\nlinear stability analysis in the equatorial plane between the PNS and the\nstationary shock and consider a large range of specific angular momenta,\nneutrino luminosities and mass accretion rates. The nature of the dominant\ninstability depends on the convection parameter chi and the rotation rate.\nConvective modes with chi>=5 are hampered by differential rotation. At smaller\nchi, however, mixed SASI-convective modes with a large angular scale m=1,2,3\nbenefit from rotation and become dominant for relatively low rotation rates at\nwhich centrifugal effects are small. For rotation rates >0.3 Keplerian rotation\nat the PNS surface (KPNS), the growth rate of the dominant mode depends weakly\non neutrino heating which highlights a new instability regime. Its frequency is\nsurprisingly independent of the heating rate, with a strong prograde spiral m=2\ndominating over a large parameter range, favourable to the production of GW. A\nsimple linear relation exists between the dominant oscillation frequency and\nthe specific angular momentum. Three regimes are distinguished. For rotation\nrates <0.1KPNS, differential rotation has a quadratic effect on equatorial\npurely convective modes and a linear destabilizing effect on SASI. Intermediate\nrotation rates (0.1 to 0.3KPNS) lead to the emergence of mixed\nSASI/convection/rotation modes involving large angular scales. Finally, strong\nrotation erases the influence of buoyancy on the instability. This allows for a\nreduction of the parameter space, which is valuable for GW analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 08:59:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 09:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

A conspicuous puzzle is the\nobservation of two shallow boron defects with rather distinct axial\norientations as found by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron\nnuclear double resonance (ENDOR) data. This feature is not observed in material\ndoped with other group-III elements. Another open issue involves conflicting\nconclusions from photoluminescence and EPR studies of a deeper boron center,\nwhich has been linked to rather distinct models, either based on substitutional\nor vacancy-related boron defects.

An\nHWP can also be used to measure circular polarization (CP) through its optical\nleakage from CP to linear polarization. The CP of the CMB is predicted to be\nproduced by interactions in the Universe, such as interactions with supernova\nremnants of population III stars. Thus, the observation of the CP of CMB is a\nnew tool for searching for population III stars. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthe improved measurement of the leakage coefficient using the transmission\nspectrum measurement of an actual HWP in the laboratory. We measured the\ntransmittance of linearly polarized light through the HWP used in the\n\\textsc{Polarbear} experiment in the frequency range of\n\\SIrange{120}{160}{GHz}. We evaluate properties of the HWP by fitting the data\nwith a physical model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We then\nestimate the band-averaged CP leakage coefficient using the physical model. We\nfind that the leakage coefficient strongly depends on the spectra of CP\nsources. We thus calculate the maximum rate of leakage from CP to linear\npolarization as $0.133 \\pm 0.009$ in the Rayleigh--Jeans spectrum. The nonzero\nvalue shows that \\textsc{Polarbear} would have sensitivity to the CP.\nAdditionally, because we use the bandpass of detectors installed in the\ntelescope to calculate the band-averaged values, we also consider systematic\neffects in the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 09:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

However, it remains elusive under what application scenarios and in\nwhat ways transistors can benefit from the incorporation of ion-based\nmemristive effects. Here, we introduce a new type of transistor named 'mempolar\ntransistor' to the transistor family.

We quantify the effect on the\nobserved MS scatter from (1) photometric redshift uncertainties (which are\nminor) and (2) fitting only rest-frame ultraviolet to near-infrared\nobservations (which are severe). At fixed redshift and $M_*$, we find that the\nintrinsic MS scatter for our sample of galaxies is 1.4 to 2.6 times larger than\nthe measurement uncertainty. The average intrinsic MS scatter has decreased by\n0.1 dex from $z=0.5$ to $\\sim2.0$. At low-$z$, the trend between the intrinsic\nMS scatter and $M_*$ follows a functional form similar to an inverse stellar\nmass-halo mass relation (SMHM; $M_*$/$M_{\\rm halo}$ vs $M_*$), with a minimum\nin intrinsic MS scatter at log($M_*/M_{\\odot})\\sim10.25$ and larger scatter at\nboth lower and higher $M_*$; while this distribution becomes flatter for\nhigh-$z$. The SMHM is thought to be a consequence of feedback effects and this\nsimilarity may suggest a link between galaxy feedback and the intrinsic MS\nscatter. These results favor a slight evolution in the intrinsic MS scatter\nwith both redshift and mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 10:25:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 05:08:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 04:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

This work proposes a power-efficient IF-TEM\nADC architecture and demonstrates sub-Nyquist sampling and FRI signal recovery.\nUsing an IF-TEM, we implement in hardware the first sub-Nyquist time-based\nsampler. We offer a feasible approach for accurately estimating the FRI\nparameters from IF-TEM data. The suggested hardware and reconstruction approach\nretrieves FRI parameters with an error of up to -25dB while operating at rates\napproximately 10 times lower than the Nyquist rate, paving the way to low-power\nADC architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 11:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

To overcome this problem, we develop\na sparse global self-attention (SparseGSA) module to select the most useful\nsimilarity values so that the most useful global features can be better\nutilized for the high-resolution image reconstruction. We develop a hybrid\ndynamic-Transformer block(HDTB) that integrates the MHDLSA and SparseGSA for\nboth local and global feature exploration. To ease the network training, we\nformulate the HDTBs into a residual hybrid dynamic-Transformer group (RHDTG).\nBy embedding the RHDTGs into an end-to-end trainable network, we show that our\nproposed method has fewer network parameters and lower computational costs\nwhile achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art ones in terms\nof accuracy.

The coronal jet erupted from the\nsouth polar coronal hole, and was observed with high spatial and temporal\nresolution by both instruments. This enabled identification of the different\nstages of a breakout reconnection process producing the observed jet.

A Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis using the SDO/AIA\nobservations revealed a very weak jet signal, indicating that the erupting\nmaterial was likely much cooler than the coronal passbands used to derive the\nDEM.

However, the conventional RISs require that the WDs have to be located\nin the half-plane of the reflection space, which restricts their potential\nbenefits. To address this issue, the novel family of simultaneously\ntransmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) is\nconsidered in AirComp systems to improve the computation accuracy across a wide\ncoverage area. To minimize the computation mean-squared-error (MSE) in STAR-RIS\nassisted AirComp systems, we propose a joint beamforming design for optimizing\nboth the transmit power at the WDs, as well as the passive reflect and transmit\nbeamforming matrices at the STAR-RIS, and the receive beamforming vector at the\nfusion center (FC).

In this paper, we investigate four different astrophysical\nscenarios as possible progenitors for GRB 211211A: a binary neutron-star\nmerger, a black-hole--neutron-star merger, a core-collapse supernova, and an\nr-process enriched core collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star (a\ncollapsar). We perform a large set of Bayesian multi-wavelength analyses based\non different models and priors to investigate which astrophysical scenarios and\nprocesses might have been related to GRB 211211A. Our analysis supports\nprevious studies in which the presence of an additional component, likely\nrelated to $r$-process nucleosynthesis, is required to explain the observed\nlight curves of GRB 211211A, as it can not solely be explained as a GRB\nafterglow. Fixing the distance to about $350~\\rm Mpc$, i.e., the distance of\nthe possible host galaxy SDSS J140910.47+275320.8, we find a statistical\npreference for the binary neutron-star merger scenario and estimate the\ncomponent masses to be $1.55^{+0.54}_{-0.42} M_{\\odot}$ and\n$1.34^{+0.25}_{-0.40} M_{\\odot}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 12:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

Quantum\nbenchmarking methods provide key information on noise properties for quantum\nprocessor calibration, quantum error mitigation, and quantum error correction.\nHowever, current benchmarking methods, such as randomized benchmarking or its\nvariants, can only evaluate the performance of some particular subsets of\nquantum gates. Moreover, due to the randomization inherent in these protocols,\nthe figure of merit they actually measure is not the fidelity of individual\ntarget gate but the average of the fidelities of some random circuit cycles\nincorporating the target. To overcome these limits, we propose channel spectrum\nbenchmarking (CSB), a method to infer the noise properties of the target\nquantum process, such as process fidelity, from the eigenvalues of its noisy\nquantum channel. The noisy eigenvalues can be estimated by the circuits of\ncontrol-free phase estimation in a state-preparation and measurement\nerror-resilient manner.

Ontology is also\ndescribed using conceptual modeling (CM) that defines fundamental concepts of\nreality. CM is one of the central activities in computer science, especially as\nit is mainly used in software engineering as an intermediate artifact for\nsystem construction. To achieve such a goal, we propose Stoic CM (SCM) as a\ndescription of what a system must do functionally with minimal ambiguity. As a\ncase study, we apply SCM to investigate the ontology of BPMN (business process\nmodeling notation). Such an undertaking would demonstrate SCM notions and\nsimultaneously may offer a viable ontological foundation for BPMN. SCM defines\nthe being of things and actions in reality based on Stoic notions of existence\nand subsistence. It has two levels of specification: (1) a subsistence static\nmodel where things and actions subsist and (2) an existence dynamic model where\nthings and actions exist in time. From the Stoic ontological point of view,\nwhile a thing existing has a clear denotation, subsistence indicates the thing\nis being there, but it is inactive (does not participate in an event). We apply\nSCM to BPMN processes that involve buying a new car with many notions, such as\nactivity, task, event, and message.

To this end, we propose an efficient\nTransformerbased model, named Conformer, which differentiates itself from\nexisting methods for LTTF in three aspects: (i) an encoder-decoder architecture\nincorporating a linear complexity without sacrificing information utilization\nis proposed on top of sliding-window attention and Stationary and Instant\nRecurrent Network (SIRN); (ii) a module derived from the normalizing flow is\ndevised to further improve the information utilization by inferring the outputs\nwith the latent variables in SIRN directly; (iii) the inter-series correlation\nand temporal dynamics in time-series data are modeled explicitly to fuel the\ndownstream self-attention mechanism.

Moreover, our method enables arbitrary style transfer:\ntransferring images to styles unseen in training. This is useful for medical\nimaging, where images are acquired using different protocols and different\nscanner models, resulting in a variety of styles that data may need to be\ntransferred between.

To help interpret\nthe polarized signal, we produced synthetic maps of light scattering by dust,\nthrough 3D radiative transfer simulations with the RADMC3D code.\n  Results. The degree of linear polarization (DoLP) observed by ZIMPOL spreads\nacross several optical filters. We infer that it primarily probes dust located\njust outside of the point spread function, and in or near the plane of the sky,\nwith a total optical depth close to unity in the line of sight, representing\nonly a fraction of the total circumstellar dust. The maximum DoLP ranges from\n0.03-0.38 depending on the source, fractions that can be reproduced by our 3D\npilot models for grains composed of common dust species. The spatial structure\nof the DoLP shows a diverse set of shapes. Only for three sources do we note a\ncorrelation between the ALMA CO and SiO lines, which trace the gas density, and\nthe DoLP, which traces the dust.\n  Conclusion. The clumpiness of the DoLP and the lack of a consistent\ncorrelation between the gas and the dust location show that, in the inner\ncircumstellar environment (CSE), dust formation occurs at very specific sites.\nThis has potential consequences for the derived mass-loss rates and dust-to-gas\nratio in the inner region of the CSE.

In SMMAE, we train an independent exploration policy for each\nagent to maximize their own visited state space. Each agent learns an\nadjustable exploration probability based on the stability of the joint team\npolicy. The experiments on highly cooperative tasks in StarCraft II\nmicromanagement benchmark (SMAC) demonstrate that SMMAE can explore\ntask-related states more efficiently, accomplish coordinated behaviours and\nboost the learning performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 14:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

The\nmomentum convection operator is of finite volume type, and its almost second\norder expression is derived by a MUSCL-like technique. The latter is of\nalgebraic type, in the sense that the limitation procedure does not invoke any\nslope reconstruction, and is independent from the geometry of the cells. The\nderived discrete convection operator applies both to constant or variable\ndensity flows, and may thus be implemented in a scheme for incompressible or\ncompressible flows.

The c-qubit is\ncoupled to a spin-$1/2$ Ising model with local Ising interactions and tunable\nc-qubit-spin coupling. Each spin becomes next-nearest neighbor to all others\nthrough the c-qubit, which mediates effective all-to-all interactions. As the\ninteraction with the c-spin increases, we find a surprising transition from\nsuper-ballistic scrambling and information growth to continuously restricted\nsub-ballistic entanglement and operator growth. This slow growth occurs on\nintermediate timescales that extend exponentially with increasing coupling and\nsystem size, indicative of logarithmic entanglement growth. We find that in the\nslow-scrambling regime, the c-qubit Ising interaction allows commuting\noperators to grow support on all sites rapidly, while operators orthogonal to\nthe interaction become echoed out. This projects local operators to lie in a\nrestricted subspace and prevents extensive operator entanglement growth. We\nprovide exact dynamics of small systems working with non-equilibrium, effective\ninfinite temperature states, and additionally contribute analytic early-time\nexpansions that support the observed rapid scrambling to quantum Zeno-like\ncrossover.

The accounting system on blockchain is an ideal archetype\nfor realizing Web 3.0 decentralized identity: users can create their accounts\nwithout registering with a central agent. Such an identity system is endowed\nwith anonymity property: nobody knows the account's owner because the\nrelationship between an account and the owner is invisible. Thus, user privacy\nis well protected even though the account's data is public. However, a\ndisadvantage of such complete anonymity is that users can create multiple\naccounts without authentication to obfuscate their activities on the\nblockchain. In particular, the current anonymous blockchain account system\ncannot accurately register the social relationships and interactions between\nreal human users, given the amorphous mappings between users and blockchain\nidentities. Mistrust can be a major hurdle to the large-scale deployment of Web\n3.0. This work proposes ZKBID, a zero-knowledge blockchain-account-based Web\n3.0 decentralized identity scheme, to overcome endemic mistrust in blockchain\naccount systems. ZKBID links souls (blockchain accounts) to humans (users) in a\none-to-one manner to truly reflect the societal relationships and interactions\nbetween humans on the blockchain. With ZKBID, the users are accountable for\ntheir accounts anonymously, preserving privacy. ZKBID authenticates users using\nface match and then maps authenticated users to accounts. Zero-knowledge proofs\nencode the face match results, and user-account mappings employ linkable ring\nsignatures to preserve anonymity.

This is the case of certain types of\ndecoherence-driven many-body systems supporting dissipative phase transitions,\nwhich might be helpful for sensing. Boundary time crystals are exotic\ndissipative phases of matter in which the time-translational symmetry is\nbroken, and long-lasting oscillations emerge in open quantum systems at the\nthermodynamic limit. We show that the transition from a symmetry unbroken into\na boundary time crystal phase, described by a second-order transition, reveals\nquantum-enhanced sensitivity quantified through quantum Fisher information. We\nhave also determined the critical exponents of the system and established their\nrelationship.

The $N_f\\geq2$ baryons can be described by the\nskyrmion in the large $N_c$ limit and there is a robust topology change in the\nskyrmion matter approach to dense nuclear matter. The hidden scale and local\nflavor symmetries which are sources introducing the lightest scalar meson --\ndilaton -- and lowest lying vector mesons into to nonlinear chiral effective\ntheory are seen to play important roles in understanding the nuclear force. We\nreview in this paper the generalized nuclear effective theory (G$n$EFT), which\napplicable to nuclear matter from low density to the compact star density,\nconstructed with the robust conclusion from the topology approach to dense\nmatter and emergent scale and hidden local flavor symmetries. The topology\nchange at density larger than two times saturation density $n_0$ encoded in the\nparameters of the effective field theory is interpreted as the hadron-quark\ncontinuity in the sense of Cheshire Cat Principle. A novel feature predicted in\nthis theory that has not been found before is the precocious appearance of the\nconformal sound velocity in the cores of massive stars, although the trace of\nthe energy-momentum tensor of the system is not zero. That is, in contrast to\nthe usual picture, the cores of massive stars are composed of quasiparticles of\nfractional baryon charges, neither baryons nor deconfined quarks. Hidden scale\nand local flavor symmetries emerge and give rise a resolution of the\nlongstanding $g_A$ quench problem in nuclei transition. To illustrate the\nrationality of the GnEFT, we finally confront the generalized effective field\ntheory to the global properties of neutron star and the data from gravitational\nwave detections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 15:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

Most\nexisting techniques, known as Virtual Try-On methods, deal with this task by\nfirst selecting an example image of the desired apparel and then transferring\nthe clothing onto the target person. Conversely, in this paper, we consider\nediting fashion images with text descriptions. Such an approach has several\nadvantages over example-based virtual try-on techniques, e.g.: (i) it does not\nrequire an image of the target fashion item, and (ii) it allows the expression\nof a wide variety of visual concepts through the use of natural language.\nExisting image-editing methods that work with language inputs are heavily\nconstrained by their requirement for training sets with rich attribute\nannotations or they are only able to handle simple text descriptions. We\naddress these constraints by proposing a novel text-conditioned editing model,\ncalled FICE (Fashion Image CLIP Editing), capable of handling a wide variety of\ndiverse text descriptions to guide the editing procedure. Specifically with\nFICE, we augment the common GAN inversion process by including semantic,\npose-related, and image-level constraints when generating images. We leverage\nthe capabilities of the CLIP model to enforce the semantics, due to its\nimpressive image-text association capabilities. We furthermore propose a\nlatent-code regularization technique that provides the means to better control\nthe fidelity of the synthesized images. We validate FICE through rigorous\nexperiments on a combination of VITON images and Fashion-Gen text descriptions\nand in comparison with several state-of-the-art text-conditioned image editing\napproaches.

We attribute this to the four times larger ground state dipole moment of\nY11 versus Y6, which improves the long range NFA out-of-plane ordering. Since\nTTA converts a fraction of the non-emissive triplet states into bright singlet\nstates, it has the potential to reduce non-radiative voltage losses. Through a\nkinetic analysis of the recombination processes under 1-Sun illumination, we\nprovide a framework for determining the conditions under which TTA may improve\nOSC performance.

It is the target of the DART and\nHERA space missions. The primary body, Didymos, rotates close to the spin at\nwhich it is expected to shed mass. The secondary body, Dimorphos, is a 140\nmeters moon that orbits the primary body in about 12 hours. Here we investigate\nthe possible origin of Dimorphos. Using 1D models of ring/satellite\ninteractions, we study the evolution of material lost from Didymos' surface and\ndeposited as a ring at its equator. We find that due to viscous spreading, the\nring spreads outside the Didymos' Roche limit forming moonlets. A fraction of\nthe mass will form Dimorphos and a set of objects near the Roche limit, while\nmost of the ring's mass falls back on Didymos. To match the properties of\ntoday's Dimorphos, the total mass that must be deposited in the ring is about\n25% of Didymos' mass. It is possible that a fraction of the material travelled\nseveral times between the ring and the surface of Didymos. The models produce\nan orbit similar to that observed for a Didymos tidal parameter k2/Q<1e-5. If\nthe ring deposition timescale is long (>100 yr) (so the material flux is small)\nDimorphos could be irregularly shaped as it forms from the collision of\nsimilar-sized satellitesimals. However, the top-shape of Didymos is expected to\nbe achieved due to a fast spin-up of the asteroid, which would result in a\nshort deposition timescale (<yr). In that case, the satellite would form from\nprogressively accreting material at the Roche Limit, resulting in an\nellipsoidal Dimorphos constructed of small pieces with sizes of the order of\nmeters, which is apparently in agreement with the recent images of Dimorphos\nobtained by DART mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 15:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

We start with some popular and\nwell-known papers that we have in hand about each topic we want to cover and we\nhave tracked the \"backward citations\" (papers that are cited by the set of\npapers we knew beforehand) and the \"forward citations\" (newer papers that cite\nthe set of papers we knew beforehand). In order to organize the different\nmethods, we present the diverse approaches to ATS guided by the mechanisms they\nuse to generate a summary. Besides presenting the methods, we also present an\nextensive review of the datasets available for summarization tasks and the\nmethods used to evaluate the quality of the summaries. Finally, we present an\nempirical exploration of these methods using the CNN Corpus dataset that\nprovides golden summaries for extractive and abstractive methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 19:20:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 18:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

Standard clinical practices rely on\npolysomnography for sleep assessment; however, it is intrusive, performed in\nunfamiliar environments and requires trained personnel. Progress has been made\non less invasive sensor technologies, such as actigraphy, but clinical\nvalidation raises concerns over their reliability and precision. Additionally,\nthe field lacks a widely acceptable algorithm, with proposed approaches ranging\nfrom raw signal or feature thresholding to data-hungry classification models,\nmany of which are unfamiliar to medical staff. This paper proposes an online\nBayesian probabilistic framework for objective (in)activity detection and\nsegmentation based on clinically meaningful joint kinematics, measured by a\ncustom-made wearable sensor. Intuitive three-dimensional visualisations of\nkinematic timeseries were accomplished through dimension reduction based\npreprocessing, offering out-of-the-box framework explainability potentially\nuseful for clinical monitoring and diagnosis. The proposed framework attained\nup to 99.2\\% $F_1$-score and 0.96 Pearson's correlation coefficient in,\nrespectively, the posture change detection and inactivity segmentation tasks.\nThe work paves the way for a reliable home-based analysis of movements during\nsleep which would serve patient-centred longitudinal care plans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 16:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

At the higher temperatures (T>2300$^\\circ$C,\napproximately) the soot particles are represented mainly by multi-shell carbon\nnano-onions. The height and the width of the pyramids is strongly dependent on\nthe temperature of the resistive heating, diminishing from 5-10mkm at\nT=1800$^\\circ$C to 1mkm at 2300-2400$^\\circ$C. Quasi-hexagonal arrays of the\nmicropyramids are organized in the convex ``craters'' on the surface of the\nmicrotubes, which grow with the time of the thermal treatment. The pyramids are\npointing always normally to the surface of the craters, except at the\nboundaries between the craters, where the normal direction is not well defined.\nThe pyramids are soft and can be easy destroyed by touching them, but can be\nhardened by heating them in the oxygen-free atmosphere. The pyramids are\nobserved only on the exterior surface of the microtubes, but not on their inner\nsurface. This suggests that the thermophoretic force generated by a strong\ntemperature gradient near the external surface of the tubes may be the cause of\nthe micropyramids formation. Electrostatic charging of the soot nanoparticles\ndue to thermionic emission may also be relevant to this phenomenon. The\nmicropyramids can function as field emission point sources, as demonstrated\nwith the use of a micro-nanoprobing station, mounted in a scanning electron\nmicroscope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 15:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

Among\nother strengths, Python's dynamic nature and its straightforward linking to\nnative code have made it the de-facto language for many research areas such as\nArtificial Intelligence. This flexibility, however, makes static analysis very\nhard. While creating a sound, or a soundy, analysis for Python remains an open\nproblem, we present in this work Serenity, a framework for static analysis of\nPython that turns out to be sufficient for some tasks. The Serenity framework\nexploits two basic mechanisms: (a) reliance on dynamic dispatch at the core of\nlanguage translation, and (b) extreme abstraction of libraries, to generate an\nabstraction of the code. We demonstrate the efficiency and usefulness of\nSerenity's analysis in two applications: code completion and automated machine\nlearning. In these two applications, we demonstrate that such analysis has a\nstrong signal, and can be leveraged to establish state-of-the-art performance,\ncomparable to neural models and dynamic analysis respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 02:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

It seems like the Madelung equations\nrequire a rotational invariance symmetry to properly account for quantum\nvortices, and that Madelung equations are not fully determining the dynamics.\nThe relation between Schrodinger's equations and Madelung equations are often\ndebated with the observation that no clear understanding exists for why the\nadditional rotational discretisation condition is required. Here I explain it\nas an additional gauge symmetry that speaks in favour of the recent idea that\nquantum is gauge (Q=G). Indeed, this additional symmetry seems to emerge as a\ngauge symmetry condition that needs to be incorporated in the Madelung\nequations in order to properly describe quantum mechanics.

We propose a simple model which gives rise to an Ohm's\nlaw with vanishing quantum effects in its thermodynamic limit (with respect to\nlength scales).

We compute the current observable at each site of the\nprotein-ligand lattice and demonstrate how the local microscopic charge\ntransport behavior generates the macroscopic current.
