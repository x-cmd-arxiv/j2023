While consumers have become accustomed to a degree of data harvesting\non the web, the real-time nature of data sharing in the metaverse indicates\nthat privacy concerns are likely to be even more prevalent in the new \"Web\n3.0.\" Research into VR privacy has demonstrated that a plethora of sensitive\npersonal information is observable by various would-be adversaries from just a\nfew minutes of telemetry data. On the other hand, we have yet to see VR\nparallels for many privacy-preserving tools aimed at mitigating threats on\nconventional platforms. This paper aims to systematize knowledge on the\nlandscape of VR privacy threats and countermeasures by proposing a\ncomprehensive taxonomy of data attributes, protections, and adversaries based\non the study of 68 collected publications. We complement our qualitative\ndiscussion with a statistical analysis of the risk associated with various data\nsources inherent to VR in consideration of the known attacks and defenses. By\nfocusing on highlighting the clear outstanding opportunities, we hope to\nmotivate and guide further research into this increasingly important field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2023 16:02:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 15:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Unfortunately,\neven with this non-equidistance an unfavorable non-radiative process persists\nin Landau-quantized graphene, and so far no cyclotron emission from Dirac\nfermions has been reported. One way to eliminate this last non-radiative\nprocess is to sufficiently modify the dispersion of the Landau levels by\nopening a small gap in the linear band structure. A proven example of such\ngapped graphene-like materials are HgTe quantum wells close to the topological\nphase transition.

One particular\nquestion of interest is the identification of physical effects inside\nall-solid-state batteries and their quantitative influence on the performance\nof the entire battery cell. Simulation models can contribute to answering the\naforementioned question by systematical studies, e.g. enabling or disabling\ncertain physical effects. Especially the influence of space-charge layers\n(SCLs) is heavily discussed in the scientific community. So far, the different\nlength scales of SCLs and the microstructure of a battery cell made a spatial\ndiscretization of realistic microstructures with resolved SCLs infeasible.\nHowever, thermodynamically consistent continuum models which are applied to\nsimplified geometries are already established in the literature.

Direct numerical simulation (DNS) to accurately capture the\nspatio-temporal variation of ion concentration and current flux remains\nchallenging due to the (a) small critical dimension of the electric double\nlayer (EDL), (b) stiff coupling, large advective effects, and steep gradients\nclose to boundaries, and (c) complex geometries exhibited by electrochemical\ndevices.\n  In the current study, we address these challenges by presenting a direct\nnumerical simulation framework that incorporates: (a) a variational multiscale\n(VMS) treatment, (b) a block-iterative strategy in conjunction with\nsemi-implicit (for NS) and implicit (for PNP) time integrators, and (c) octree\nbased adaptive mesh refinement.

From a\nmathematical viewpoint, one key challenge with this theory for two component\nsystems is that stable spatial patterns can typically only occur from a\nspatially uniform state when a slowly diffusing \"activator\" species reacts with\na much faster diffusing \"inhibitor\" species. However, from a modeling\nperspective, this large diffusivity ratio requirement for pattern formation is\noften unrealistic in biological settings since different molecules tend to\ndiffuse with similar rates in extracellular spaces. As a result, one key\nlong-standing question is how to robustly obtain pattern formation in the\nbiologically realistic case where the time scales for diffusion of the\ninteracting species are comparable. For a coupled 1-D bulk-compartment\ntheoretical model, we investigate the emergence of spatial patterns for the\nscenario where two bulk diffusing species with comparable diffusivities are\ncoupled to nonlinear reactions that occur only in localized \"compartments\",\nsuch as on the boundaries of a 1-D domain. The exchange between the bulk medium\nand the spatially localized compartments is modeled by a Robin boundary\ncondition with certain binding rates. As regulated by these binding rates, we\nshow for various specific nonlinearities that our 1-D coupled PDE-ODE model\nadmits symmetry-breaking bifurcations, leading to linearly stable asymmetric\nsteady-state patterns, even when the bulk diffusing species have equal\ndiffusivities. Depending on the form of the nonlinear kinetics, oscillatory\ninstabilities can also be triggered.

Going beyond the traditional behaviors-in-time perspective,\ntime-in-behaviors perspective enables empirical examination of online behaviors\nfrom multiple units of analysis (e.g., discrete behaviors, behavioral sessions,\nand behavioral trajectories) and from multiple dimensions (e.g., duration,\norder, transition, rhythm). The paper shows the potentials of the\ntime-in-behaviors perspective with several empirical cases and proposes future\ndirections in explicating the concept of time in computational social science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 01:53:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 02:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

Here we propose a scheme for\nenantio-conversion of chiral mixtures via optical pumping based on a four-level\nmodel of chiral molecules composed of two chiral ground states and two achiral\nexcited states, in which there exists a tunneling interaction between the\nchiral states. By eliminating one of the achiral excited states in the case of\nlarge detuning and well designing the detuning and coupling strengths of the\nelectromagnetic fields, the induced indirect tunneling interaction between the\nchiral ground states can be cancelled with the direct tunneling interaction,\nand the induced indirect interaction between the left-handed chiral state and\nthe remained achiral excited state can be cancelled with the direct one between\nthem. Hence, the left-handed ground state is unchanged and the right-handed one\ncan be excited to an achiral excited state, i.e., establishing\nchiral-state-selective excitations. By numerically calculating the populations\nof two chiral ground states, we find that the high enantiomeric excess can be\nachieved with almost only the left-handed ground state being populated.

For\nexample, the subphrase ``he stole the mobile phone'' can be an extractive\nrationale for the prediction of ``Theft''.

However, the\ncomposition of AGN jets and bubbles remains uncertain; they could be thermally\ndominated, or dominated by cosmic-ray proton (CRp), cosmic-ray electron (CRe),\nor magnetic energy. In this work, we investigate the evolution and feedback\neffects of CRp and CRe dominated jets by conducting 3D magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations of AGN jet-inflated bubbles in the intracluster medium using the\nFLASH code. We present the evolution of their energies, dynamics and heating,\nand model their expected cavity-power versus radio-luminosity relation ($P_{\\rm\ncav}-L_R$). We find that bubbles inflated by CRe dominated jets follow a very\nsimilar dynamical evolution to CRp dominated bubbles even though CRe within\nbubbles suffer significantly stronger synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling.\nThis is because, as CRe lose their energy, the jet-inflated bubbles quickly\nbecome thermally dominated within $\\sim 30$ Myr. Their total energy stops\ndecreasing with CR energy and evolves similarly to CRp dominated bubbles. The\nability of CRe and CRp dominated bubbles to heat the intracluster medium is\nalso comparable; the cold gas formed via local thermal instabilities is well\nsuppressed in both cases. The CRp and CRe bubbles follow different evolutionary\ntrajectories on the $P_{\\rm cav}-L_R$ plane, but the values are broadly\nconsistent with observed ranges for FRI sources.

In order to probe the statistical properties\nof the post-shock turbulent region, we use $384 \\times 512 \\times 384$ tracers\nto track its evolution through the Lagrangian framework, thus providing a\nhigh-fidelity analysis of the shocked medium. Our simulations indicate that the\ngrowth of the magnetic field, which accompanies the near-Saffman kinetic energy\ndecay ($E_{\\textrm{kin}} \\propto t^{-1.15})$ without turbulence driving,\nexhibits slightly different characteristics as compared to periodic box\nsimulations. Seemingly no distinct phases exist in its evolution, because the\nshock passage and time to observe the magnetic field amplification during the\nturbulence decay are very short ($\\sim\\!0.3$ of a turbulent turnover time).\nYet, the growth rate is still consistent with those expected for compressive\n(curl-free) turbulence driving in subsonic, compressible turbulence.\nPhenomenological understanding of the dynamics of the magnetic and velocity\nfields are also elucidated via Lagrangian frequency spectra, which are\nconsistent with the expected inertial range scalings in the Eulerian-Lagrangian\nbridge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 07:47:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 13:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

However, due to the sparse characteristics\nof point clouds, it is non-trivial to apply a standard transformer on sparse\npoints. In this paper, we present Dynamic Sparse Voxel Transformer (DSVT), a\nsingle-stride window-based voxel Transformer backbone for outdoor 3D\nperception. In order to efficiently process sparse points in parallel, we\npropose Dynamic Sparse Window Attention, which partitions a series of local\nregions in each window according to its sparsity and then computes the features\nof all regions in a fully parallel manner. To allow the cross-set connection,\nwe design a rotated set partitioning strategy that alternates between two\npartitioning configurations in consecutive self-attention layers. To support\neffective downsampling and better encode geometric information, we also propose\nan attention-style 3D pooling module on sparse points, which is powerful and\ndeployment-friendly without utilizing any customized CUDA operations.

Methods: We use open-access data from\nthe 2016 Physionet/CinC Challenge, the 2022 George Moody Challenge, and from\nthe lung sound database HF_V1. We first train specialist single-task models\nusing foreground ground truth (GT) labels from different auscultation databases\nto identify background sound events in the respective lung and heart\nauscultation databases. The pseudo-labels generated in this way were combined\nwith the ground truth labels in a new training iteration, such that a new model\nwas subsequently trained to detect foreground and background signals. Benchmark\ntests ensured that the newly trained model could detect both, lung, and heart\nsound events in different auscultation sites without regressing on the original\ntask.

To address this challenge, two estimators called OPSC\nand OSAP-CBAM-CNN are proposed in this paper. The computational complexity of\nthe traditional DOA algorithm is first considered to be reduced by dividing the\ntotal set of antennas into multiple overlapped subarrays uniformly, each\nsubarray crosses each other proportionally and performs DOA estimation to\ngenerate coarse angles, and all angles are coherently combined to get the\nbetter estimation, the final DOA estimation can given by maximum likelihood\nalternating projection(ML-AP) in a very small range, which has a better\nperformance than the direct partitioning of subarrays. To further reduce the\ncomplexity of traditional estimation algorithms, deep neural networks(DNN) are\nutilized to offline train the relationship between the received signal\ncovariance matrix and the estimated angles. Due to the high complexity of the\ntraining network based on large-scale arrays, in the OSAP-CBAM-CNN method, the\ncomplex network is divided into several smaller networks based on the\noverlapped subarray to give rough DOA estimations, followed by coherent\ncombining and AP algorithm to get the final DOA estimation. Simulation results\nshow that as the number of antennas goes to large-scale, the proposed methods\ncan achieve a remarkable complexity reduction over conventional ML-AP\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 13:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

The photon transport is a typical\nmultiscale process governed by the nonlinear radiative transfer equations\n(RTE). The flow regime of photon transport varies from the ballistic regime to\nthe diffusive regime with respect to optical depth and photon frequency. The\nUGKP method is an asymptotic preserving (AP) scheme and a regime adaptive\nscheme. The teleportation error is significantly reduced, and the computational\nefficiency is remarkably improved in the diffusive regime. Distinguished from\nthe standard multigroup treatment, the proposed UGKP method solves the\nfrequency space in a non-discretized way. Therefore the Rosseland diffusion\nsystem can be precisely preserved in the optically thick regime. Taking\nadvantage of the local integral solution of RTE, the distribution of the\nemitted photon can be constructed from its macroscopic moments. The Monte Carlo\nparticles in the UGKP method need only be tracked before their first collision\nevents, and a re-sampling process is performed to close the photon distribution\nfor each time step. The large computational cost of excessive scattering events\ncan be saved, especially in the optically thick regime. The proposed UGKP\nmethod is implicit and removes the light speed constraint on the time step. The\nparticle tracking approach combining the implicit formulation makes the\nproposed UGKP method an efficient solution algorithm for frequency-dependent\nradiative transfer problems. We demonstrate with numerical examples the\ncapability of the proposed multi-frequency UGKP method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 15:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

We propose a new method based on the wave optics\neffect of the microlensing field embedded in SLGW data. The microlensing\ndiffraction/interference fringes can produce frequency-dependent random\nfluctuations in the waveform. To pin down the microlensing induced stochastic\nfeatures in the waveform, we utilize both the template-independent method,\n\\texttt{cWB}, and the template-dependent method, \\texttt{Bilby}, to reconstruct\nthe waveform with and without microlensing imprints. The mismatching degree of\nthese two waveforms can be treated as an indicator of SLGW events.

Existing methods are mainly\nbased on ordinal regression and particularly focus on modeling the ordinal\nmapping from the feature representation of the input to the ordinal label\nspace. However, the manifold of the resultant feature representations does not\nmaintain the intrinsic ordinal relations of interest, which hinders the\neffectiveness of the image ordinal estimation. Therefore, this paper proposes\nlearning intrinsic Consistent Ordinal REpresentations (CORE) from ordinal\nrelations residing in groundtruth labels while encouraging the feature\nrepresentations to embody the ordinal low-dimensional manifold. First, we\ndevelop an ordinal totally ordered set (toset) distribution (OTD), which can\n(i) model the label embeddings to inherit ordinal information and measure\ndistances between ordered labels of samples in a neighborhood, and (ii) model\nthe feature embeddings to infer numerical magnitude with unknown ordinal\ninformation among the features of different samples. Second, through OTD, we\nconvert the feature representations and labels into the same embedding space\nfor better alignment, and then compute the Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence\nbetween the ordinal labels and feature representations to endow the latent\nspace with consistent ordinal relations. Third, we optimize the KL divergence\nthrough ordinal prototype-constrained convex programming with dual\ndecomposition; our theoretical analysis shows that we can obtain the optimal\nsolutions via gradient backpropagation. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed CORE can accurately construct an ordinal latent\nspace and significantly enhance existing deep ordinal regression methods to\nachieve better results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 15:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

The phenomenon is associated with a large-amplitude\nperiodic motion of the compression shock coupled with large-scale flow\nseparation and intermittent re-attachment. Due to the resulting large-scale\nvariation of the global flow topology, also the turbulent wake of the airfoil\nor wing is severely affected, and so are any aerodynamic devices downstream on\nwhich the wake impinges. To analyze and understand the turbulent structures and\ndynamics of the wake, we performed a comprehensive experimental study of the\nnear wake of the supercritical OAT15A airfoil in transonic buffet conditions at\na chord Reynolds number of 2 mio. Velocity field measurements reveal severe\nglobal influences of the buffet mode on both the surface-bound flow field on\nthe suction side of the airfoil and the wake. The flow is intermittently\nstrongly separated, with a significant momentum deficit that extends far into\nthe wake. The buffet motion induces severe disturbances and variations of the\nturbulent flow, as shown on the basis of phase-averaged turbulent quantities in\nterms of Reynolds shear stress and RMS-values. The spectral nature of\ndownstream-convecting fluctuations and turbulent structures are analyzed using\nhigh-speed focusing schlieren sequences.

This method leverages the\nfact that different test data samples may not require the same amount of\ncomputation for a correct prediction. By allowing early exiting from full\nlayers of DNN inference for some test examples, we can reduce latency and\nimprove throughput of edge inference while preserving performance. Although\nthere have been numerous studies on designing specialized DNN architectures for\ntraining early-exit enabled DNN models, most of the existing work employ\nhand-tuned or manual rule-based early exit policies. In this study, we\nintroduce a novel multi-exit DNN inference framework, coined as EENet, which\nleverages multi-objective learning to optimize the early exit policy for a\ntrained multi-exit DNN under a given inference budget. This paper makes two\nnovel contributions.

Second, we train a lightweight, budget-driven, multi-objective neural\nnetwork over validation predictions to learn the exit assignment scheduling for\nquery examples at test time. The EENet early exit scheduler optimizes both the\ndistribution of test samples to different exits and the selection of the exit\nutility thresholds such that the given inference budget is satisfied while the\nperformance metric is maximized.

We use our\nnew diffraction integral that describes how a spherical electromagnetic wave is\nmodified by the static gravitational field of an extended body, represented by\nseries of multipole moments characterizing its interior mass distribution.\nDominated by the solar quadrupole moment, these deviations from spherical\nsymmetry significantly perturb the image that is projected by the Sun into its\nfocal region, especially at solar equatorial latitudes. To study the optical\nproperties of the quadrupole SGL, we develop an approximate solution for the\npoint spread function of such an extended lens. We also derive semi-analytical\nexpressions to estimate signal levels from extended targets. With these tools,\nwe study the impact of solar oblateness on imaging with the SGL. Given the\nsmall value of the solar quadrupole moment, the majority of the signal photons\narriving from an extended target still appear within the image area projected\nby the monopole lens. However, these photons are scrambled, thus reducing the\nachievable signal-to-noise ratio during image recovery process (i.e.,\ndeconvolution). We also evaluate the spectral sensitivity for high-resolution\nremote sensing of exoplanets with the extended SGL. We assess the impact on\nimage quality and demonstrate that despite the adverse effects of the\nquadrupole moment, the SGL remains uniquely capable of delivering\nhigh-resolution imaging and spectroscopy of faint, small and distant targets,\nnotably terrestrial exoplanets within ~30--100 parsec from us.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 05:29:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 16:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 18:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

A common strategy to identify fraudulent claims\nis looking for inconsistencies in the supporting evidence. However, this is a\nlaborious and cognitively heavy task for human experts as insurance claims\ntypically come with a plethora of data from different modalities (e.g. images,\ntext and metadata). To overcome this challenge, the research community has\nfocused on multimodal machine learning frameworks that can efficiently reason\nthrough multiple data sources. Despite recent advances in multimodal learning,\nthese frameworks still suffer from (i) challenges of joint-training caused by\nthe different characteristics of different modalities and (ii) overfitting\ntendencies due to high model complexity. In this work, we address these\nchallenges by introducing a multimodal reasoning framework, AutoFraudNet\n(Automobile Insurance Fraud Detection Network), for detecting fraudulent\nauto-insurance claims. AutoFraudNet utilizes a cascaded slow fusion framework\nand state-of-the-art fusion block, BLOCK Tucker, to alleviate the challenges of\njoint-training. Furthermore, it incorporates a light-weight architectural\ndesign along with additional losses to prevent overfitting. Through extensive\nexperiments conducted on a real-world dataset, we demonstrate: (i) the merits\nof multimodal approaches, when compared to unimodal and bimodal methods, and\n(ii) the effectiveness of AutoFraudNet in fusing various modalities to boost\nperformance (over 3\\% in PR AUC).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 13:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

PINNs\nare DL models penalized by enforcing the law of physics; in particular, the law\nof physics is embedded in DL models.

This paper addresses the question of the crew\nautonomy: as the distances increase, the communication delays and constraints\ntend to prevent the astronauts from being monitored and supported by a real\ntime ground control. Eventually, future planetary missions will necessarily\nrequire a form of astronaut self-scheduling. We study the usage of a computer\ndecision-support tool by a crew of analog astronauts, during a Mars simulation\nmission conducted at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS, Mars Society) in\nUtah.

It allows the crew members\n(i) to visually model their scientific objectives and constraints, (ii) to\ncompute near-optimal operational schedules while taking uncertainty into\naccount, (iii) to monitor the execution of past and current activities, and\n(iv) to modify scientific objectives/constraints w.r.t. unforeseen events and\nopportunistic science.
