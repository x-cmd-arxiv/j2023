The emergence of this rigidity can be described\nthrough a mean field approach; nonetheless, fundamental understanding of how\nrigidity varies in gels of different attraction strengths is lacking. Moreover,\nrecovering an accurate gelation phase diagram based on the system's variables\nhave been an extremely challenging task. Understanding the nature of these\nfractal clusters, and how rigidity emerges from their connections is key to\ncontrolling and designing gels with desirable properties.

A simple mass-spring model then is\nused to recover quantitatively the elasticity of colloidal gels from these\ncluster networks. Interrogating the resilience of these gel networks show that\nthe elasticity of a gel (a dynamic property) is directly correlated to its\ncluster network's resilience (a static measure).

We implement a tidal resurfacing model with two\nstages: dynamics modeling of the entire body to determine time-varying\naccelerations and surface slope profiles felt by each surface patch during the\n6-h-long closest encounter, and DEM modeling to track motions of surface grains\nin localized patches. The surface slope profiles and measured grain motions are\ncombined to statistically extrapolate the 'expected' percentage of resurfaced\narea. Using the tidal resurfacing model, we present surface maps showing the\ntotal expected resurfacing on Apophis given 3 representative encounter\norientations. Our simulation results indicate that tidal resurfacing, limited\nto certain localized regions, will likely occur half an hour before perigee and\non the scale of 1 per cent of Apophis's entire surface area. Our models\nindicate that the most likely locations to detect tidal resurfacing are:\ninitially high-sloped regions (> 30 deg) regardless of the encounter\norientation of Apophis, and mid-sloped regions (15 - 30 deg) that experience a\nsignificant positive slope variation (> 0.5 deg), which is mainly controlled by\nthe encounter orientation. Expected data from ground-based observations of the\n2029 flyby will help us better constrain the targeted locations likely to\nexperience tidal resurfacing. We thus expect to find evidence supporting tidal\nresurfacing via further analysis of post-encounter surface images or albedo\nchanges at the expected resurfaced areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 17:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

The thermo-optic (TO) effect - the\nrefractive index variation with temperature (dn/dT), is one of the common\nmechanisms used for tunable optical devices, including integrated optical\ncomponents, metasurfaces and nano-antennas. However, when a static and fixed\noperation is required, i.e., temperature invariant performance - this effect\nbecomes a drawback and may lead to undesirable behavior through drifting of the\nresonance frequency, amplitude, or phase, as the operating temperature varies\nover time. In this work, we present a systematic approach to mitigate thermally\ninduced optical fluctuations in nanophotonic devices. By using hybrid\nsubwavelength resonators composed from two materials with opposite TO\ndispersions (dn/dT<0 and dn/dT>0), we are able to compensate for TO shifts and\nengineer meta-atoms and metasurfaces with zero effective TO coefficient\n(dn/dT~0). We demonstrate temperature invariant resonant frequency, amplitude,\nand phase response in meta-atoms and metasurfaces operating across a wide\ntemperature range and broad spectral band. Our results highlight a path towards\ntemperature invariant nanophotonics, which can provide constant and stable\noptical response across a wide range of temperatures and be applied to a\nplethora of optoelectronic devices.

Using\nmultiwavelength observations, their origin can be traced back to the\ninteraction with eruptions and jets. We present two different case studies as\nobservational evidence in support of 2.5D MHD numerical experiments that show\nthat the LAOs in the filament channels can be initiated by solar jets. In the\ntwo studied events, we can identify a quadrupolar configuration with an X-point\nat the top of the parasitic region suggestive of a classical null-point. A\nreconnection flow emanates from this structure leading to a jet that propagates\nalong the filament channel. In both cases we can identify the quiescent and\neruptive phases of the jet. The triggered LAOs have periods of around 70-80\nminutes and are damped after a few oscillations. The minimum magnetic field\nintensity inferred with seismology for the filament turns out to be around 30\nGauss. We conclude that the two case studies are consistent with the recent\nnumerical model of Luna and Moreno-Insertis (2021), in which the LAOs are\ninitiated by jets. The relationship between the onset of the jet and filament\noscillations is straight-forward for the first case and less for the second\ncase. In the second event, although there is some evidence, we cannot rule out\nother possibilities such as activity unrelated to the null-point or changes in\nthe magnetic structure of the filament. Both jets are associated with very weak\nflares which did not launch any EUV wave. Therefore the role of EUV waves for\ntriggering the filament oscillations can be eliminated for these two case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 17:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

The designs of pin\nfins, therefore, have seen significant research in the past.

The pin-fin shape is defined using featurized (parametrized)\npiecewise cubic splines in 2D. The complexity of the shape is dependent on the\nnumber of splines used for the analysis. From a method development perspective,\nthe study is performed using three splines. Owing to this piece-wise modeling,\na unique pin fin design is defined using five features. After specifying the\ndesign, a computational fluid dynamics-based model is developed that computes\nthe pressure drop during the flow. Bayesian optimization is carried out on a\nGaussian processes-based surrogate to obtain an optimal combination of pin-fin\nfeatures to minimize the pressure drop. The results show that the optimization\ntends to approach an aerodynamic design leading to low pressure drop\ncorroborating with the existing knowledge. Furthermore, multiple iterations of\noptimizations are conducted with varying degree of input data. The results\nreveal that a convergence to similar optimal design is achieved with a minimum\nof just twenty five initial design-of-experiments data points for the\nsurrogate. Sensitivity analysis shows that the distance between the rows of the\npin fins is the most dominant feature influencing the pressure drop.

Pixel-wise annotation sometimes requires expert's\nknowledge and time which is laborious and costly to obtain. In this paper, we\npresent a consistency based semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach that can\nhelp mitigate this challenge by exploiting a large amount of unlabelled data\nfor model training thus alleviating the need for a large annotated dataset.\nHowever, SSL models might also be susceptible to changing context and features\nperturbations exhibiting poor generalisation due to the limited training data.\nWe propose an SSL method that learns robust features from both labelled and\nunlabelled images by enforcing consistency against varying contexts and feature\nperturbations. The proposed method incorporates context-aware consistency by\ncontrasting pairs of overlapping images in a pixel-wise manner from changing\ncontexts resulting in robust and context invariant features. We show that\ncross-consistency training makes the encoder features invariant to different\nperturbations and improves the prediction confidence.

We find that\ncurrent data may already constrain the amplitudes of primordial curvature\nperturbations in a new region of parameter space, but this conclusion is\nstrongly sensitive to yet undetermined details about the internal structures of\nthese ultradense halos.

The simulated particle trajectories and MSD\ncalculations reveal that the steady state response of a confined harmonic\nparticle to the magnetic field show interesting features due to the complex\ninterplay of underlying physical processes such as elastic dissipation and\nactive fluctuations in the medium.

The temperature of the CME\ncore is of the order of million-degree kelvin, indicating that it is not\nassociated with a prominence. Further, we estimate the electron density of this\nCME core using K-Cor polarized brightness (pB) data and found it decreasing by\na factor of ~ 3.6 as the core evolves. An interesting finding is that the\ntemperature of the CME core remains almost constant despite expected adiabatic\ncooling due to the expansion of the CME core, which suggests that the CME core\nplasma must be heated as it propagates. We conclude that the expansion of this\nCME core behaves more like an isothermal than an adiabatic process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 18:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

We have previously shown that magnetic fields play a crucial\nrole in major mergers between disc galaxies; in hydrodynamic simulations of\nsuch mergers, the Auriga model produces compact remnants with a distinctive bar\nand ring morphology. In contrast, in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations,\nremnants form radially-extended discs with prominent spiral arm structure. In\nthis paper, we analyse a series of cosmological \"zoom-in\" simulations of major\nmergers and identify exactly $\\textit{how}$ magnetic fields are able to alter\nthe outcome of the merger. We find that magnetic fields modify the transport of\nangular momentum, systematically hastening the merger progress. The impact of\nthis altered transport depends on the orientation of the field, with a\npredominantly azimuthal (non-azimuthal) orientation providing support against\ncollapse (increasing the central baryonic concentration). Both effects act to\nsuppress an otherwise existent bar-instability, which in turn leads to a\nfundamentally different morphology and manifestation of feedback. We note, in\nparticular, that stellar feedback is substantially less influential in MHD\nsimulations, which allows for the later accretion of higher angular momentum\ngas and the subsequent rapid radial growth of the remnant disc. A corollary of\nthe increased baryonic concentration in MHD simulations is that black holes are\nable to grow twice as large, although this turns out to have little impact on\nthe remnant's development. Our results show that galaxy evolution cannot be\nmodelled correctly without including magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

Strong lenses are a biased subset of the general population of\ngalaxies.\n  Aims. The goal of this work is to quantify how lens galaxies and lensed\nsources differ from their parent distribution, namely the strong lensing bias.\n  Methods. We first studied how the strong lensing cross-section varies as a\nfunction of lens and source properties. Then, we simulated strong lensing\nsurveys with data similar to that expected for Euclid and measured the strong\nlensing bias in different scenarios. We focused particularly on two quantities:\nthe stellar population synthesis mismatch parameter, $\\alpha_{sps}$, defined as\nthe ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy and the stellar mass\nobtained from photometry, and the central dark matter mass at fixed stellar\nmass and size.\n  Results. Strong lens galaxies are biased towards larger stellar masses,\nsmaller half-mass radii and larger dark matter masses. The amplitude of the\nbias depends on the intrinsic scatter in the mass-related parameters of the\ngalaxy population and on the completeness in Einstein radius of the lens\nsample. For values of the scatter that are consistent with observed scaling\nrelations and a minimum detectable Einstein radius of $0.5''$, the strong\nlensing bias in $\\alpha_{sps}$ is $10\\%$, while that in the central dark matter\nmass is $5\\%$. The bias has little dependence on the properties of the source\npopulation: samples of galaxy-galaxy lenses and galaxy-quasar lenses that probe\nthe same Einstein radius distribution are biased in a very similar way.\nQuadruply imaged quasar lenses, however, are biased towards higher ellipticity\ngalaxies.\n  Conclusions. Given current uncertainties, strong lensing observations can be\nused directly to improve our current knowledge of the inner structure of\ngalaxies, without the need to correct for selection effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 19:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

To evaluate the performance of $\\textit{SpinQ}$ on\nthis novel architecture, we compiled a broad set of well-defined quantum\ncircuits and performed an in-depth analysis based on multiple metrics such as\ngate overhead, depth overhead, and estimated success probability, which in turn\nallowed us to create unique mapping and architectural insights. Finally, we\npropose novel mapping technique improvements for the crossbar architecture that\ncould increase algorithm success rates and potentially inspire further research\non quantum circuit mapping techniques for other scalable spin-qubit\narchitectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 19:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

The proposed algorithm iteratively updates a population of particles\naccording to a consensus dynamics inspired by social interactions among\nindividuals. The consensus point is computed taking into account the past\npositions of all particles. While sharing features with the popular Particle\nSwarm Optimization (PSO) method, the exploratory behavior is fundamentally\ndifferent and allows better control over the convergence of the particle\nsystem. We discuss some implementation aspects which lead to an increased\nefficiency while preserving the success rate in the optimization process. In\nparticular, we show how employing a random selection strategy to discard\nparticles during the computation improves the overall performance. Several\nbenchmark problems and applications to image segmentation and Neural Networks\ntraining are used to validate and test the proposed method. A theoretical\nanalysis allows to recover convergence guarantees under mild assumptions on the\nobjective function. This is done by first approximating the particles evolution\nwith a continuous-in-time dynamics, and then by taking the mean-field limit of\nsuch dynamics.

In this method, the processes that generate oscillations in\nfinancial signals are modelled as scaled, shifted, and isolated events that\nproduce ripples of various frequencies across a sea of noise as opposed to a\nsimple sinusoidal or mixed frequency oscillation or an impulse. This allows one\nto directly estimate the wavelet parameters derived only from the generating\nfunctions, rejecting spurious perturbations driven by noise or extraneous\nfactors. Financial signals may then be reconstructed based on a finite set of\ngenerators localized in time and frequency. This method offers a marked\nadvantage compared to traditional econometric tools because it directly targets\nthe generators of oscillations. Furthermore, the choice of the Morse wavelet\nallows for wide latitude in capturing a broad set of diverse generators. In\nthis work, the basic mathematical principles underlying element analysis are\npresented, and the method is applied to the study of variance in financial\ndata, where the advantages of element analysis over traditional wavelet\ntechniques is demonstrated.

The model organism for studying flagellate\nmotility, C. reinhardtii (CR), employs synchronous, breast-stroke-like\nflagellar beating to swim, and it modulates the beating amplitudes\ndifferentially to steer. This strategy hinges on both inherent flagellar\nasymmetries (e.g. different response to chemical messengers) and such\nasymmetries being effectively coordinated in the synchronous beating. In CR,\nthe synchrony of beating is known to be supported by a mechanical connection\nbetween flagella, however, how flagellar asymmetries persist in the synchrony\nremains elusive. For example, it has been speculated for decades that one\nflagellum leads the beating, as its dynamic properties (i.e. frequency,\nwaveform, etc.) appear to be copied by the other one. In this study, we combine\nexperiments, computations, and modeling efforts to elucidate the roles played\nby each flagellum in synchronous beating. With a non-invasive technique to\nselectively load each flagellum, we show that the coordinated beating\nessentially responds to only load exerted on the cis flagellum; and that such\nasymmetry in response derives from a unilateral coupling between the two\nflagella. Our results highlight a distinct role for each flagellum in\ncoordination and have implication for biflagellates tactic behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 20:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

Morphing into arbitrary\nsurfaces on demand requires a device with a sufficiently large number of\nactuators and an inverse control strategy that can calculate the actuator\nstimulation necessary to achieve a target surface. The programmability of a\nmorphing surface can be improved by increasing the number of independent\nactuators, but this increases the complexity of the control system. Thus,\ndeveloping compact and efficient control interfaces and control algorithms is a\ncrucial knowledge gap for the adoption of morphing surfaces in broad\napplications. In this work, we describe a passively addressed robotic morphing\nsurface (PARMS) composed of matrix-arranged ionic actuators.

Matrix addressing allows the control of independent actuators using\nonly 2N control inputs, which is significantly lower than control inputs\nrequired for traditional direct addressing.

We provide\nconcrete evidence of this differential suppression & enhancement of relevant\nfeatures on both controlled datasets and real-world images, and report\nsubstantial gains on many real-world debiasing benchmarks (11.4% relative gain\non Imagenet-A; 3.2% on BAR, etc). Crucially, we do not depend on prior\nknowledge of spurious attributes or features, and in fact outperform many\nbaselines that explicitly incorporate such information. We believe that our\nfeature sieve work opens up exciting new research directions in automated\nadversarial feature extraction and representation learning for deep networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 21:11:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 11:06:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 16:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

It is\nespecially important to adhere to pre-approved terminology and adapt to\ncorrected translations in domain-specific projects. Machine translation (MT)\nhas achieved significant progress in the area of domain adaptation. However,\nreal-time adaptation remains challenging. Large-scale language models (LLMs)\nhave recently shown interesting capabilities of in-context learning, where they\nlearn to replicate certain input-output text generation patterns, without\nfurther fine-tuning. By feeding an LLM at inference time with a prompt that\nconsists of a list of translation pairs, it can then simulate the domain and\nstyle characteristics. This work aims to investigate how we can utilize\nin-context learning to improve real-time adaptive MT. Our extensive experiments\nshow promising results at translation time. For example, LLMs can adapt to a\nset of in-domain sentence pairs and/or terminology while translating a new\nsentence. We observe that the translation quality with few-shot in-context\nlearning can surpass that of strong encoder-decoder MT systems, especially for\nhigh-resource languages.

Two competing solutions to this problem have been proposed:\nuncertainty-aware training and evidential neural networks (ENNs). In this\npaper, we perform an investigation into the improvements to model calibration\nthat can be achieved by each of these approaches individually, and their\ncombination. We perform experiments on two classification tasks: a simpler\nMNIST digit classification task and a more complex and realistic medical\nimaging artefact detection task using Phase Contrast Cardiac Magnetic Resonance\nimages. The experimental results demonstrate that model calibration can suffer\nwhen the task becomes challenging enough to require a higher-capacity model.\nHowever, in our complex artefact detection task, we saw an improvement in\ncalibration for both a low and higher-capacity model when implementing both the\nENN and uncertainty-aware training together, indicating that this approach can\noffer a promising way to improve calibration in such settings.

Therefore, optimization over\nthe Pareto (or efficient) set has been an active area of research. Although\nthere is a wealth of literature involving finite dimensional optimization\nproblems in this area, there is a lack of problem formulation and numerical\nmethods for optimal control problems, except for the convex case.

Existing hardness-aware CL methods typically treat negative\ninstances that are most similar to the anchor instance as hard negatives, which\nhelps improve the CL performance, especially on image data. However, this\napproach often fails to identify the hard negatives but leads to many false\nnegatives on graph data. This is mainly due to that the learned graph\nrepresentations are not sufficiently discriminative due to over-smooth\nrepresentations and/or non-i.i.d. issues in graph data. To tackle this problem,\nthis paper proposes a novel approach that builds a discriminative model on\ncollective affinity information (i.e, two sets of pairwise affinities between\nthe negative instances and the anchor instance) to mine hard negatives in GCL.\nIn particular, the proposed approach evaluates how confident/uncertain the\ndiscriminative model is about the affinity of each negative instance to an\nanchor instance to determine its hardness weight relative to the anchor\ninstance. This uncertainty information is then incorporated into existing GCL\nloss functions via a weighting term to enhance their performance. The enhanced\nGCL is theoretically grounded that the resulting GCL loss is equivalent to a\ntriplet loss with an adaptive margin being exponentially proportional to the\nlearned uncertainty of each negative instance. Extensive experiments on 10\ngraph datasets show that our approach i) consistently enhances different\nstate-of-the-art GCL methods in both graph and node classification tasks, and\nii) significantly improves their robustness against adversarial attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

With the rapid development of convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), road scene analysis can usually achieve satisfactory\nresults in the source domain. However, guaranteeing good generalization to\ndifferent target domain scenarios remains a significant challenge. Recently,\nsemi-supervised learning and active learning have been proposed to alleviate\nthis problem. Semisupervised learning can improve model accuracy with massive\nunlabeled data, but some pseudo labels containing noise would be generated with\nlimited or imbalanced training data. And there will be suboptimal models if\nhuman guidance is absent. Active learning can select more effective data to\nintervene, while the model accuracy can not be improved because the massive\nunlabeled data are not used. And the probability of querying sub-optimal\nsamples will increase when the domain difference is too large, increasing\nannotation cost. This paper proposes an iterative loop method combining active\nand semisupervised learning for domain adaptive semantic segmentation. The\nmethod first uses semi-supervised to learn massive unlabeled data to improve\nmodel accuracy and provide more accurate selection models for active learning.\nSecondly, combined with the predictive uncertainty sample selection strategy of\nactive learning, manual intervention is used to correct the pseudo-labels.\nFinally, flexible iterative loops achieve the best performance with minimal\nlabeling cost.

Here, we show that such\nbehavior emerges from a simple model of a damped ripening foam, for\nsufficiently weak damping. In particular, we observe intermittent avalanchey\ndynamics, bubble super-diffusion, and power-law rheology that vary as the\ndamping factor is changed. In the limit of weak damping, the dynamics are\ndetermined by the tortuous low-lying portions of the energy landscape, as\ndescribed in a recent study. For strong damping the viscous stresses cause the\nsystem configuration to evolve along higher energy paths, washing out\nsmall-scale tortuosity and producing motion with an increasingly ballistic\ncharacter. Using a microrheological approach, the linear viscoelastic response\nof the model can be efficiently calculated. This resembles the power-law\nrheology expected for soft glassy mechanics, but unexpectedly, is only weakly\nsensitive to the damping parameter. Lastly, we study the reported memory effect\nin foams after large perturbations and find that the timescale of the memory\ngoes to zero as the damping parameter vanishes, suggesting that the effect is\ndue to viscous stress relaxation rather than slow structural changes stabilized\nby the energy landscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 04:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

This\nfeature enables advertisers to simply provide high-level constraints and goals\nto an automated agent, which optimizes their auction bids on their behalf. In\nthis paper, we examine the effect of different auctions on the incentives of\nadvertisers to report their constraints to the auto-bidder intermediaries. More\nprecisely, we study whether canonical auctions such as first price auction\n(FPA) and second price auction (SPA) are auto-bidding incentive compatible\n(AIC): whether an advertiser can gain by misreporting their constraints to the\nautobidder.\n  We consider value-maximizing advertisers in two important settings: when they\nhave a budget constraint and when they have a target cost-per-acquisition\nconstraint. The main result of our work is that for both settings, FPA and SPA\nare not AIC. This contrasts with FPA being AIC when auto-bidders are\nconstrained to bid using a (sub-optimal) uniform bidding policy. We further\nextend our main result and show that any (possibly randomized) auction that is\ntruthful (in the classic profit-maximizing sense), scalar invariant and\nsymmetric is not AIC. Finally, to complement our findings, we provide\nsufficient market conditions for FPA and SPA to become AIC for two advertisers.\nThese conditions require advertisers' valuations to be well-aligned.

However, real-world\nscreening mammogram datasets commonly have a subset that is fully annotated and\nanother subset that is weakly annotated with just the global classification\n(i.e., without lesion localisation). Given the large size of such datasets,\nresearchers usually face a dilemma with the weakly annotated subset: to not use\nit or to fully annotate it. The first option will reduce detection accuracy\nbecause it does not use the whole dataset, and the second option is too\nexpensive given that the annotation needs to be done by expert radiologists. In\nthis paper, we propose a middle-ground solution for the dilemma, which is to\nformulate the training as a weakly- and semi-supervised learning problem that\nwe refer to as malignant breast lesion detection with incomplete annotations.\nTo address this problem, our new method comprises two stages, namely: 1)\npre-training a multi-view mammogram classifier with weak supervision from the\nwhole dataset, and 2) extending the trained classifier to become a multi-view\ndetector that is trained with semi-supervised student-teacher learning, where\nthe training set contains fully and weakly-annotated mammograms.

However, the hand-designed operators usually cause inferior HF\nmaps (e.g., distorted or structurally missing) due to the diverse appearance of\ncomplex depth maps. Moreover, the direct concatenation often results in weak\nguidance because not all image features have a positive effect on the HF maps.\nIn this paper, we develop a recurrent structure attention guided (RSAG)\nframework, consisting of two important parts. First, we introduce a deep\ncontrastive network with multi-scale filters for adaptive frequency-domain\nseparation, which adopts contrastive networks from large filters to small ones\nto calculate the pixel contrasts for adaptive high-quality HF predictions.\nSecond, instead of the coarse concatenation guidance, we propose a recurrent\nstructure attention block, which iteratively utilizes the latest depth\nestimation and the image features to jointly select clear patterns and\nboundaries, aiming at providing refined guidance for accurate depth recovery.\nIn addition, we fuse the features of HF maps to enhance the edge structures in\nthe decomposed LF maps.

Dust\naccumulates at the outer edge of the common gas gap, which behaves as a dust\ntrap, where the local dust concentration is significantly enhanced by the\nplanets outward motion. Concurrently, an expanding cavity forms in the dust\ndistribution inside the planets orbits, because dust does not filter through\nthe common gaseous gap and grain depletion in the region continues via inward\ndrifting. There is no cavity in the gas distribution because gas can filter\nthrough the gap, although ongoing gas accretion on the planets can reduce the\ngas density in the inner disc. Such behaviour was demonstrated by means of\nsimulations neglecting the effects of dust diffusion due to turbulence and of\ndust backreaction on the gas. Both effects may alter the formation of the dust\npeak at the gap outer edge and of the inner dust cavity, by letting grains\nfilter through the dust trap. We performed high resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations of the coupled evolution of gas and dust species, the latter\ntreated as pressureless fluids, in the presence of two giant planets. We show\nthat diffusion and backreaction can change some morphological aspects of the\ndust distribution but do not alter some main features, such as the outer peak\nand the expanding inner cavity. These findings are confirmed for different\nparametrizations of gas viscosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 09:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Even, if we know how an aberrant\noptical path deviates from the original design, the corresponding PSF is often\nhard to calculate, as the phase and amplitude modifications need to be modelled\nin detail. Accurate PSF models need to account for the vector nature of the\nelectric fields in particular for high numerical apertures. Compared to the\ncomputation of a commonly used scalar PSF model, the vectorial model is\ncomputationally more expensive, yet more accurate. State-of-the-art scalar and\nvector PSF models exist, but they all have their pros and cons.

In particular, representing cortical folding patterns as\ngraphs of sulcal basins-termed sulcal graphs-enables to formalize the task as a\ngraph-matching problem. In this paper, we propose to address the problem of\nsulcal graph matching directly at the population level using multi-graph\nmatching techniques.

Counter values are updated by adding the\nrespective transition labels. A configuration in this system consists of a\nstate and k counter values.

The coverability problem asks whether one can traverse the\nk-VASS from the initial configuration to a configuration with at least the\ncounter values of the target.\n  In a well-established line of work on k-VASS, coverability in 2-VASS is\nalready PSPACE-hard when the integer updates are encoded in binary.

It is a common method used by hackers to identify\nvulnerabilities in a network or system. By determining which ports are open, an\nattacker can identify which services and applications are running on a device\nand potentially exploit any known vulnerabilities in those services.\nConsequently, it is important to detect port scanning because it is often the\nfirst step in a cyber attack. By identifying port scanning attempts,\ncybersecurity professionals can take proactive measures to protect the systems\nand networks before an attacker has a chance to exploit any vulnerabilities.\nAgainst this background, researchers have worked for over a decade to develop\nrobust methods to detect port scanning.

Accordingly, we provide a systematic review of 15 papers\npublished between February 2021 and January 2023.

This is done by incentivizing the block producer to move the pool\nprice to the external market price. With this, users transact in expectancy at\nthe external market price in exchange for a fee, with AMMs providing liquidity\nin expectancy at the external market price. Under block producer and liquidity\nprovider competition, all of the fees in V0LVER approach zero.

However, in real-world applications,\nplayers are usually subject to constraints ruling out the feasibility of some\nof their strategies, such as, e.g., safety requirements and budget caps.\nComputational studies on constrained versions of the Nash equilibrium have lead\nto some results under very stringent assumptions, while finding constrained\nversions of the correlated equilibrium (CE) is still unexplored. In this paper,\nwe introduce and computationally characterize constrained Phi-equilibria -- a\nmore general notion than constrained CEs -- in normal-form games. We show that\ncomputing such equilibria is in general computationally intractable, and also\nthat the set of the equilibria may not be convex, providing a sharp divide with\nunconstrained CEs. Nevertheless, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for\ncomputing a constrained (approximate) Phi-equilibrium maximizing a given linear\nfunction, when either the number of constraints or that of players' actions is\nfixed. Moreover, in the special case in which a player's constraints do not\ndepend on other players' strategies, we show that an exact, function-maximizing\nequilibrium can be computed in polynomial time, while one (approximate)\nequilibrium can be found with an efficient decentralized no-regret learning\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 12:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

The approach utilizes sequential decomposition of the input random\nspace into smaller sub-domains approximated by low-order polynomial expansions.\nThis allows approximation of functions with strong nonlinearties,\ndiscontinuities, and/or singularities. Decomposition of the input random space\nand local approximations alleviates the Gibbs phenomenon for these types of\nproblems and confines error to a very small vicinity near the non-linearity.\nThe global behavior of the surrogate model is therefore significantly better\nthan existing methods as shown in numerical examples.

However, a study\nto explore the AC-prediction power of modern QSAR methods and its relationship\nto general QSAR-prediction performance is lacking. We systematically construct\nnine distinct QSAR models by combining three molecular representation methods\n(extended-connectivity fingerprints, physicochemical-descriptor vectors and\ngraph isomorphism networks) with three regression techniques (random forests,\nk-nearest neighbours and multilayer perceptrons); we then use each resulting\nmodel to classify pairs of similar compounds as ACs or non-ACs and to predict\nthe activities of individual molecules in three case studies: dopamine receptor\nD2, factor Xa, and SARS-CoV-2 main protease. We observe low AC-sensitivity\namongst the tested models when the activities of both compounds are unknown,\nbut a substantial increase in AC-sensitivity when the actual activity of one of\nthe compounds is given. Graph isomorphism features are found to be competitive\nwith or superior to classical molecular representations for AC-classification\nand can thus be employed as baseline AC-prediction models or simple\ncompound-optimisation tools. For general QSAR-prediction, however,\nextended-connectivity fingerprints still consistently deliver the best\nperformance. Our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that indeed\nQSAR methods frequently fail to predict ACs.

However, in the\nstandard setting without monetary transfers, it is generally impossible to have\ntruthful mechanisms that provide non-trivial fairness guarantees. Recently,\nAmanatidis et al.

Following this agenda, we\nshow that this outstanding property of the Round-Robin mechanism extends much\nbeyond the above default assumption of additivity.

These\nare problems in which a principal commits to an outcome-dependent payment\nscheme in order to incentivize some agents to take costly, unobservable actions\nthat lead to favorable outcomes. Previous works on multi-agent problems study\nmodels where the principal observes a single outcome determined by the actions\nof all the agents. Such models considerably limit the contracting power of the\nprincipal, since payments can only depend on the joint result of all the\nagents' actions, and there is no way of paying each agent for their individual\nresult. In this paper, we consider a model in which each agent determines their\nown individual outcome as an effect of their action only, the principal\nobserves all the individual outcomes separately, and they perceive a reward\nthat jointly depends on all these outcomes. This considerably enhances the\nprincipal's contracting capabilities, by allowing them to pay each agent on the\nbasis of their individual result. We analyze the computational complexity of\nfinding principal-optimal contracts, revolving around two newly-introduced\nproperties of principal's rewards, which we call IR-supermodularity and\nDR-submodularity. Intuitively, the former captures settings with increasing\nreturns, where the rewards grow faster as the agents' effort increases, while\nthe latter models the case of diminishing returns, in which rewards grow slower\ninstead. These two properties naturally model two common real-world phenomena,\nnamely diseconomies and economies of scale.

In such a context, a set of nature-inspired\nstochastic methods, called meta-heuristic optimization, can provide robust\napproximate solutions to different kinds of problems with a small computational\nburden, such as derivative-free real function optimization. Nevertheless, these\nmethods may converge to inadequate solutions if the function landscape is too\nharsh, e.g., enclosing too many local optima. Previous works addressed this\nissue by employing a hypercomplex representation of the search space, like\nquaternions, where the landscape becomes smoother and supposedly easier to\noptimize. Under this approach, meta-heuristic computations happen in the\nhypercomplex space, whereas variables are mapped back to the real domain before\nfunction evaluation. Despite this latter operation being performed by the\nEuclidean norm, we have found that after the optimization procedure has\nfinished, it is usually possible to obtain even better solutions by employing\nthe Minkowski $p$-norm instead and fine-tuning $p$ through an auxiliary\nsub-problem with neglecting additional cost and no hyperparameters. Such\nbehavior was observed in eight well-established benchmarking functions, thus\nfostering a new research direction for hypercomplex meta-heuristic\noptimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 14:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

U-Net variants are known to provide\nexcellent results in supervised semantic segmentation. However, in distinct\nbone segmentation from upper body CTs a large field of view and a\ncomputationally taxing 3D architecture are required. This leads to\nlow-resolution results lacking detail or localisation errors due to missing\nspatial context when using high-resolution inputs.\n  Methods: We propose to solve this problem by using end-to-end trainable\nsegmentation networks that combine several 3D U-Nets working at different\nresolutions. Our approach, which extends and generalizes HookNet and MRN,\ncaptures spatial information at a lower resolution and skips the encoded\ninformation to the target network, which operates on smaller high-resolution\ninputs. We evaluated our proposed architecture against single resolution\nnetworks and performed an ablation study on information concatenation and the\nnumber of context networks.\n  Results: Our proposed best network achieves a median DSC of 0.86 taken over\nall 125 segmented bone classes and reduces the confusion among similar-looking\nbones in different locations. These results outperform our previously published\n3D U-Net baseline results on the task and distinct-bone segmentation results\nreported by other groups.\n  Conclusion: The presented multi-resolution 3D U-Nets address current\nshortcomings in bone segmentation from upper-body CT scans by allowing for\ncapturing a larger field of view while avoiding the cubic growth of the input\npixels and intermediate computations that quickly outgrow the computational\ncapacities in 3D.

Motivated by recent non-thermal line broadening\nobservations that suggested extended regions of turbulence in coronal loops, an\nextended turbulent acceleration region is incorporated into the model. We\nproduce outputs for the density weighted electron flux, a quantity directly\nrelated to observed X-rays, modelled in energy and space from the corona to\nchromosphere. We find that by combining several spectral and imaging\ndiagnostics (such as spectral index differences or ratios, energy or\nspatial-dependent flux ratios, and electron depths into the chromosphere) the\nacceleration properties, including the timescale and velocity dependence, can\nbe constrained alongside the spatial properties. Our diagnostics provide a\nfoundation for constraining the properties of acceleration in an individual\nflare from X-ray imaging spectroscopy alone, and can be applied to past,\ncurrent and future observations including those from RHESSI and Solar Orbiter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 14:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

Although some exquisitely designed models achieve excellent\nprediction performances, how to extract more useful information and make\naccurate predictions is still an open issue. Most of modern models only focus\non a short range of information, which are fatal for problems such as time\nseries forecasting which needs to capture long-term information\ncharacteristics. As a result, the main concern of this work is to further mine\nrelationship between local and global information contained in time series to\nproduce more precise predictions. In this paper, to satisfactorily realize the\npurpose, we make three main contributions that are experimentally verified to\nhave performance advantages. Firstly, original time series is transformed into\ndifference sequence which serves as input to the proposed model. And secondly,\nwe introduce the global atrous sliding window into the forecasting model which\nreferences the concept of fuzzy time series to associate relevant global\ninformation with temporal data within a time period and utilizes\ncentral-bidirectional atrous algorithm to capture underlying-related features\nto ensure validity and consistency of captured data.

Here we study how\nthe magnitude of this noise $T$ affects performance as the size of the training\nset $P$ and the scale of initialization $\\alpha$ are varied. For gradient\ndescent, $\\alpha$ is a key parameter that controls if the network is\n`lazy'($\\alpha\\gg1$) or instead learns features ($\\alpha\\ll1$). For\nclassification of MNIST and CIFAR10 images, our central results are: (i)\nobtaining phase diagrams for performance in the $(\\alpha,T)$ plane. They show\nthat SGD noise can be detrimental or instead useful depending on the training\nregime. Moreover, although increasing $T$ or decreasing $\\alpha$ both allow the\nnet to escape the lazy regime, these changes can have opposite effects on\nperformance. (ii) Most importantly, we find that the characteristic temperature\n$T_c$ where the noise of SGD starts affecting the trained model (and eventually\nperformance) is a power law of $P$. We relate this finding with the observation\nthat key dynamical quantities, such as the total variation of weights during\ntraining, depend on both $T$ and $P$ as power laws. These results indicate that\na key effect of SGD noise occurs late in training by affecting the stopping\nprocess whereby all data are fitted. Indeed, we argue that due to SGD noise,\nnets must develop a stronger `signal', i.e. larger informative weights, to fit\nthe data, leading to a longer training time. A stronger signal and a longer\ntraining time are also required when the size of the training set $P$\nincreases. We confirm these views in the perceptron model, where signal and\nnoise can be precisely measured. Interestingly, exponents characterizing the\neffect of SGD depend on the density of data near the decision boundary, as we\nexplain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 15:22:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 12:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Our analysis shows that IC cooling is the primary cooling process\nfor the shocked-wind layer over a significant portion of the relevant parameter\nspace, particularly in eccentric systems with large wind-momentum ratios, e.g.,\nthose containing a Wolf-Rayet and O-type star. Using the binary system WR140 as\na case study, we demonstrate that IC cooling leads to a strongly radiative\nshocked wind near periastron, which may otherwise remain adiabatic if only\ncollisional cooling was considered. Our results are further supported by 2D and\n3D simulations, which illustrate the impact of including or neglecting IC\ncooling. Specifically, 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of WR140 show a\nsignificant decrease in hard-X-ray emission around periastron, in agreement\nwith observations but in contrast to equivalent simulations that omit IC\ncooling. A novel method is proposed for constraining mass-loss rates of both\nstars in eccentric binaries where the wind-collision zone switches from\nadiabatic to radiative approaching periastron.

To overcome such limitation, we propose\nmulti-\\textbf{View} \\textbf{Co}nsistent learning (ViewCo) for text-supervised\nsemantic segmentation. Specifically, we first propose text-to-views consistency\nmodeling to learn correspondence for multiple views of the same input image.\nAdditionally, we propose cross-view segmentation consistency modeling to\naddress the ambiguity issue of text supervision by contrasting the segment\nfeatures of Siamese visual encoders. The text-to-views consistency benefits the\ndense assignment of the visual features by encouraging different crops to align\nwith the same text, while the cross-view segmentation consistency modeling\nprovides additional self-supervision, overcoming the limitation of ambiguous\ntext supervision for segmentation masks. Trained with large-scale image-text\ndata, our model can directly segment objects of arbitrary categories in a\nzero-shot manner.

In the paper at hand, full\nwaveform inversion is the considered inverse problem. The performance of PINNs\nis compared against classical adjoint optimization, focusing on three key\naspects: the forward-solver, the neural network Ansatz for the inverse field,\nand the sensitivity computation for the gradient-based minimization. Starting\nfrom PINNs, each of these key aspects is adapted individually until the\nclassical adjoint optimization emerges. It is shown that it is beneficial to\nuse the neural network only for the discretization of the unknown material\nfield, where the neural network produces reconstructions without oscillatory\nartifacts as typically encountered in classical full waveform inversion\napproaches. Due to this finding, a hybrid approach is proposed. It exploits\nboth the efficient gradient computation with the continuous adjoint method as\nwell as the neural network Ansatz for the unknown material field. This new\nhybrid approach outperforms Physics-Informed Neural Networks and the classical\nadjoint optimization in settings of two and three-dimensional examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 17:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}
