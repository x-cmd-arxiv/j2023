This technology requires high quality virtual view synthesis to\nenable viewers to move freely in a dynamic real world scene. Depth imagery at\ndifferent viewpoints is used to synthesize an arbitrary number of novel views.\nUsually, depth images at multiple viewpoints are estimated individually by\nstereo-matching algorithms, and hence, show lack of interview consistency. This\ninconsistency affects the quality of view synthesis negatively. This paper\nproposes a method for depth consistency testing in depth difference subspace to\nenhance the depth representation of a scene across multiple viewpoints.\nFurthermore, we propose a view synthesis algorithm that uses the obtained\nconsistency information to improve the visual quality of virtual views at\narbitrary viewpoints. Our method helps us to find a linear subspace for our\ndepth difference measurements in which we can test the inter-view consistency\nefficiently. With this, our approach is able to enhance the depth information\nfor real world scenes. In combination with our consistency-adaptive view\nsynthesis, we improve the visual experience of the free-viewpoint user. The\nexperiments show that our approach enhances the objective quality of virtual\nviews by up to 1.4 dB. The advantage for the subjective quality is also\ndemonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 18:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

We have carried out instrument\nmodelling and analytic calculations for the analysis of aperture, flux and\nevent rate, and the analyses show the detectability of the Cherenkov radiation.\nBased on the properties of the Cherenkov radiation, we have demonstrated that\nthe cosmic ray and neutrino events could be reconstructed with the three ULW\nvector antennas onboard the lunar satellites via measurements of the Askaryan\nradio pulse intensity, polarizations, etc. The results obtained by this study\nwould be useful for future lunar radio explorer mission, where the detections\nof UHE cosmic rays and neutrinos could be successfully attempted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 16:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Observations and\nearlier 3D models indicate that giant convection cells cause high-contrast\nsurface intensity patterns, and contribute to the origin of clumpy dust clouds.\nWe study the formation and resulting properties of dust-driven winds from AGB\nstars, using new global 3D simulations. The dynamical stellar interiors,\natmospheres, and wind acceleration zones of two M-type AGB stars were modeled\nwith the CO5BOLD code. These first global 3D simulations are based on\nfrequency-dependent gas opacities, and they feature time-dependent condensation\nand evaporation of silicate grains. Convection and pulsations emerge\nself-consistently, allowing us to derive wind properties (e.g., mass-loss rates\nand outflow velocities), without relying on parameterized descriptions of these\nprocesses. In contrast to 1D models with purely radial pulsations, the shocks\ninduced by convection and pulsation in the 3D models cover large parts, but not\nthe entirety, of the sphere, leading to a patchy, nonspherical structure of the\natmosphere. Since dust condensation critically depends on gas density, new dust\nclouds form mostly in the dense wakes of atmospheric shocks, where the grains\ncan grow efficiently. The resulting clumpy distribution of newly formed dust\nleads to a complex 3D morphology of the extended atmosphere and\nwind-acceleration zone, with simultaneous infall and outflow regions close to\nthe star. Highly nonspherical isotherms and short-lived cool pockets of gas in\nthe stellar vicinity are prominent features. Efficient dust formation sets in\ncloser to the star than spherical averages of the temperature indicate, in\ndense regions where grain growth rates are higher than average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 16:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

One of the\nchallenges for these methods is to generate models that are mesh independent\nand generalize to different material properties. Moreover, the model should\nalso be able to react to unforeseen external forces like ubiquitous collisions.\nOur contribution is based on a simple observation: evaluating forces is\ncomputationally relatively cheap for traditional simulation methods and can be\ncomputed in parallel in contrast to their integration.

We develop a semi-analytic model of Sagittarius~A* flares based on an\nejected large plasmoid, inspired by recent particle-in-cell global simulations\nof black hole magnetospheres. We model the infrared astrometric and photometric\nsignatures associated to this model. We consider a spherical large plasmoid\nejected along a conical orbit around the black hole. This plasmoid is assumed\nto be formed by successive mergers of smaller plasmoids produced through\nmagnetic reconnection. Non-thermal electrons are injected in the plasmoid. We\ncompute the evolution of the electron-distribution under the influence of\nsynchrotron cooling. We solve the radiative transfer problem and transport the\nradiation along null geodesics of the Schwarzschild spacetime.

Consensus is the problem in which all processes in a distributed\ncomputation must agree on some value. Average consensus is a popular form of\nconsensus, where the agreed upon value is the average of the initial values of\nall the processes. In a typical solution for consensus, each process learns the\nvalue of others' to determine the final decision. However, this is undesirable\nif processes want to keep their values secret from others.\n  With this motivation, we present a solution to privacy-preserving average\nconsensus, where no process can learn the initial value of any other process.\nAdditionally, we augment our approach to provide outlier resistance, where\nextreme values are not included in the average calculation. Privacy is fully\npreserved at every stage, including preventing any process from learning the\nidentities of processes that hold outlier values. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst privacy-preserving average consensus algorithm featuring outlier\nresistance.\n  In the context of leader election, each process votes for the one that it\nwants to be the leader. The goal is to ensure that the leader is elected in\nsuch a way that each vote remains secret and the sum of votes remain secret\nduring the election. Only the final vote tally is available to all processes.\nThis ensures that processes that vote early are not able to influence the votes\nof other processes.

MAT treats the\nheuristic algorithm as a filter to receive high-quality samples to train an ML\nmodel and likely candidate objects for evictions. We evaluate MAT on 8\nproduction workloads, spanning storage, in-memory caching, and CDNs. The\nsimulation experiments show MAT reduces the number of costly ML\npredictions-per-eviction from 63 to 2, while achieving comparable miss ratios\nto the state-of-the-art ML cache system. We compare a MAT prototype system with\nan LRU-based caching system in the same setting and show that they achieve\nsimilar request rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 17:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

Previous analyses have not\nresulted in all the similarity variables. We perform a symmetry analysis of the\nequations for ZPGTBL using Lie dilation groups, and obtain local, leading-order\nsymmetries of the equations. The full set of similarity variables were obtained\nin terms of the boundary layer parameters. The friction velocity was shown to\nbe the outer-layer velocity scale. The downstream evolution of the boundary\nthickness and the friction velocity is obtained analytically. The dependent\nsimilarity variables are written as asymptotic expansions. By asymptotically\nmatching the expansions, an approximate similarity solution up to the third\norder in the overlapping layer are obtained. These results are obtained from\nfirst principles without any major assumptions and a turbulence model. The\nsimilarities and differences between ZPGTBL and turbulent channel flows in\nterms of the similarity equations, the gauge functions and the approximate\nsolutions are discussed. In particular, the leading-order expansions are\nidentical for ZPGTBL and channel flows, supporting the notion of universality\nof the near-wall layer. In addition, the logarithmic friction law for ZPGTBL is\naccurate to all orders while it is only accurate at the leading order in\nchannel flows. The results will help further understand ZPGTBL and the issue of\nuniversality of the near-wall layer in wall-bounded turbulent flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 18:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

Forecast accuracy depends upon the latitudinal separation (or\noffset $\\Delta \\theta$) between source and spacecraft, forecast lead time\n($\\Delta t$) and the solar cycle via the sunspot number (SSN). The precise\ndependencies factoring in uncertain- ties however, are a mixture of influences\nfrom each of these factors. And for high precision forecasts, it is important\nto understand what drives the forecast accuracy and its uncertainty. Here we\npresent a causal inference approach based on information theoretic measures to\ndo this. Our framework can compute not only the direct (linear and non-linear)\ndependencies of the forecast mean absolute error (MAE) on SSN, $\\Delta t$ and\n$\\Delta t$, but also how these individual variables combine to enhance or\ndiminish the MAE. We provide an initial assessment of this with potential of\naiding data assimilation in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 18:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

The formalism constitutes a powerful method to study\ncomplex phenomena in interacting quantum systems characterized by the\ncoexistence and competition of various ordered states. Overall, such a\nframework provides a simple and systematic methodology to predict and discover\nnew kinds of orders. In particular, the pseudospin formalism provides the most\neffective way to describe different topological structures, in particular, due\nto a possibility of a geometrical two-vector description of the on-site states.\nWe introduce and analyze effective pseudospin Hamiltonian with on-site and\ninter-site charge correlations, two types of a correlated one-particle transfer\nand two-particle, or the composite boson transfer. The 2D S=1 pseudospin system\nis prone to a creation of different topological structures, which form\ntopologically protected inhomogeneous distributions of the eight local S=1\npseudospin order parameters. We present a short overview of localized\ntopological structures, typical for S=1 (pseudo)spin systems, focusing on\nunexpected antiphase domain walls in parent cuprates and so-called quadrupole\nskyrmion, which are believed to be candidates for a topological charge\nexcitation in parent or underdoped cuprates.

Kinetic energy and momentum injection from jets peaks\nat z ~ 1, while the other two sources peak at z ~ 2. Massive stars are the\ndominant global source of momentum injection. For supermassive black holes, we\nfind that the amount of kinetic energy from jets is about an order-of-magnitude\nlarger than that from winds.

While numerous disease-specific \"screening\" tests that are closer to\nPoint-of-Care (POC) are in use for this task, their low specificity results in\nunnecessary biopsies, leading to avoidable patient trauma and wasteful\nhealthcare spending. On the other hand, despite the high accuracy of Magnetic\nResonance (MR) imaging in disease diagnosis, it is not used as a POC disease\nidentification tool because of poor accessibility.

In this study we explore the\nfeasibility of an ML-augmented MR pipeline that directly infers the disease\nsidestepping the image reconstruction process.

Unlike traditional homomorphic encryption\nwhere users can only passively perform ciphertext addition or multiplication,\nthe homomorphic functional encryption retains homomorphic addition and scalar\nmultiplication properties, but also allows for the user's inputs through\npolynomial variables. The proposed homomorphic encryption can be applied to any\npolynomials over a finite field, with their coefficients considered as their\nprivacy. We denote the polynomials before homomorphic encryption as plain\npolynomials and after homomorphic encryption as cipher polynomials. A cipher\npolynomial can be evaluated with variables from the finite field, GF(p), by\ncalculating the monomials of variables modulo a prime p. These properties allow\nfunctional homomorphic encryption to be used for public key encryption of\ncertain asymmetric cryptosystems to hide the structure of its central map\nconstruction.

The proposed distillation approach supports both retrieval and\nre-ranking stages and crucially leverages the relative geometry among queries\nand documents learned by the large teacher model. It goes beyond existing\ndistillation methods in the IR literature, which simply rely on the teacher's\nscalar scores over the training data, on two fronts: providing stronger signals\nabout local geometry via embedding matching and attaining better coverage of\ndata manifold globally via query generation. Embedding matching provides a\nstronger signal to align the representations of the teacher and student models.\nAt the same time, query generation explores the data manifold to reduce the\ndiscrepancies between the student and teacher where training data is sparse.\nOur distillation approach is theoretically justified and applies to both dual\nencoder (DE) and cross-encoder (CE) models.

Existing techniques typically use current (static)\nsensor measurements to perform such tasks and require principled sensor\nplacement or an abundance of randomly placed sensors.

This paper proposes a heuristic method for retrieving sparse approximate\nsolutions of optimization problems via minimizing the $\\ell_{p}$ quasi-norm,\nwhere $0<p<1$. An iterative two-block ADMM algorithm for minimizing the\n$\\ell_{p}$ quasi-norm subject to convex constraints is proposed. For $p=s/q<1$,\n$s,q \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}$, the proposed algorithm requires solving for the roots\nof a scalar degree $2q$ polynomial as opposed to applying a soft thresholding\noperator in the case of $\\ell_{1}$. The merit of that algorithm relies on its\nability to solve the $\\ell_{p}$ quasi-norm minimization subject to any convex\nset of constraints. However, it suffers from low speed, due to a convex\nprojection step in each iteration, and the lack of mathematical convergence\nguarantee.

Weak, guessable, or hard-coded passwords, and a lack of security\nmeasures contribute to these vulnerabilities along with insecure network\nconnections and outdated update procedures. To understand IoT malware, current\nmethods and analysis ,using static methods, are ineffective. The field of deep\nlearning has made great strides in recent years due to their tremendous data\nmining, learning, and expression capabilities, cybersecurity has enjoyed\ntremendous growth in recent years. As a result, malware analysts will not have\nto spend as much time analyzing malware. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndetection and analysis method that harnesses the power and simplicity of\ndecision trees.

Our STATE is equipped with a specifically\ndesigned learnable convolutional attention module for efficient temporal\nlearning and reasoning. Secondly, we put forward a novel reconstruction-based\ninput perturbation technique during testing to further differentiate anomalous\nframes.

For this purpose, this work extends our\nprevious parallel transformation based multiple instance learning (MIL) for\ntight bounding box supervision by integrating an MIL strategy based on polar\ntransformation to assist image segmentation. The proposed polar transformation\nbased MIL formulation works for both tight and loose bounding boxes, in which a\npositive bag is defined as pixels in a polar line of a bounding box with one\nendpoint located inside the object enclosed by the box and the other endpoint\nlocated at one of the four sides of the box.

One canonical argument is that the benefits of informational\ndiversity are in tension with affinity bias. To better understand the impact of\nthis tension on the makeup of teams, we analyze a sequential model of team\nformation in which individuals care about their team's performance (captured in\nterms of accurately predicting some future outcome based on a set of features)\nbut experience a cost as a result of interacting with teammates who use\ndifferent approaches to the prediction task.

Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) are characterized\nby multiple and progressive anatomo clinical changes. Yet, modeling changes\nover disease course from cohort data is challenging as the usual timescales are\ninappropriate and time-to-clinical diagnosis is available on small subsamples\nof participants with short follow-up durations prior to diagnosis. One solution\nto circumvent this challenge is to define the disease time as a latent\nvariable.\n  Methods: We developed a multivariate mixed model approach that realigns\nindividual trajectories into the latent disease time to describe disease\nprogression. Our methodology exploits the clinical diagnosis information as a\npartially observed and approximate reference to guide the estimation of the\nlatent disease time. The model estimation was carried out in the Bayesian\nFramework using Stan. We applied the methodology to 2186 participants of the\nMEMENTO study with 5-year follow-up.

We estimated ages for 227 of these stars, and upper\nlimits for 8 others, excluding 14 which have too rapidly rotating or are\notherwise outside the valid parameter range of our gyrochronology. We estimated\nuncertainties based on observed scatter in rotation periods in young clusters,\nerror in the gyrochrones, and uncertainties in temperature and non-solar\nmetallicity. For those stars with measured metallicities, we provide but do not\nincorporate a correction for the effects of deviation from solar metallicity.\nThe age distribution of our sample declines to near zero at 10 Gyr, the age of\nthe Galactic disk, with the handful of outliers explainable by large\nuncertainties. Continued addition or extension of cluster rotation sequences to\nmore thoroughly calibrate the gyrochronology in time and temperature space,\nmore precise and robust measurement of rotation periods, and more accurate\nstellar parameter measurements will enable continued improvements in the age\nestimates of these important exoplanet host stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2023 06:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

We can thus speculate on the possibility that the\nspacetime around astrophysical black holes may be described by other solutions\nof the Einstein Equations and we can test such a hypothesis with observations.\nIn this work, we consider the $\\delta$-Kerr metric, which is an exact solution\nof the field equations in vacuum and can be obtained from a non-linear\nsuperposition of the Kerr metric with a static axially symmetric solution,\noften referred to as the $\\delta$-metric. The parameter $\\delta=1+q$ quantifies\nthe departure of the source from the Kerr metric and for $q=0$ we recover the\nKerr solution.

At radio wavelengths, remote-sensing of the middle corona\nfalls in the meter-decameter wavelength range where a critical transition of\nradio emission mechanisms occurs.

Such\nmodels could accommodate a dark matter candidate if there is an additional\nscalar representation with a vanishing vacuum expectation value and, in\naddition, there are no couplings between fermions and the dark matter\ncandidate. The most natural way to have these conditions implemented is to\nconsider models where an underlying symmetry is imposed. Governed by this, we\nconsider a three-Higgs-doublet model with an $S_3$ symmetry. Within this\nframework there are different implementations which could possibly accommodate\na dark matter candidate. The family of $S_3$-symmetric three-Higgs-doublet\nimplementations arises due to different vacua and, as a result, different\nminimisation conditions. In this framework the dark matter candidate falls into\nthe class of weakly interacting massive particles. The dark matter candidate is\nassociated with an $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry which survives spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking and is a remnant of the $S_3$ symmetry. We explore two cases, they\nshare many aspects of the Type-I two-Higgs-doublet model plus an inert SU(2)\ndoublet. The main difference between these two cases is the presence of an\nirremovable phase, which leads to CP violation in one of the implementations.\nThe two candidate cases differ from other previously studied models with three\nscalar doublets by the fact that they do not allow for heavy dark matter\ncandidates, $\\mathcal{O}(500)\\text{ GeV}$.

The strong suppression of the\nscattering between DM and SM particles happens quite early in the DM depletion\nhistory, where the DM temperature drops away from the thermal equilibrium,\n$T_\\chi < T_{\\rm SM}$, leading to the decreased kinetic energy of DM. The\nforbidden annihilation thus becomes inefficient since small kinetic energy\ncannot help exceed the annihilation threshold, naturally leading to a larger\nabundance.

Being atomically-thin materials, these\ndegrees of freedom can be influenced by the presence of adjacent layers, due to\nproximity interactions that arise from wave function overlap across the 2D\ninterface. Here, we report 60 T magnetoreflection spectroscopy of the A- and B-\nexcitons in monolayer WS$_2$, systematically encapsulated in monolayer\ngraphene. While the observed variations of the valley Zeeman effect for the A-\nexciton are qualitatively in accord with expectations from the bandgap\nreduction and modification of the exciton binding energy due to the\ngraphene-induced dielectric screening, the valley Zeeman effect for the B-\nexciton behaves markedly different. We investigate prototypical WS$_2$/graphene\nstacks employing first-principles calculations and find that the lower\nconduction band of WS$_2$ at the $K/K'$ valleys (the $CB^-$ band) is strongly\ninfluenced by the graphene layer on the orbital level. This leads to variations\nin the valley Zeeman physics of the B- exciton, consistent with the\nexperimental observations. Our detailed microscopic analysis reveals that the\nconduction band at the $Q$ point of WS$_2$ mediates the coupling between $CB^-$\nand graphene due to resonant energy conditions and strong coupling to the Dirac\ncone. Our results therefore expand the consequences of proximity effects in\nmultilayer semiconductor stacks, showing that wave function hybridization can\nbe a multi-step process with different bands mediating the interlayer\ninteractions. Such effects can be exploited to resonantly engineer the\nspin-valley degrees of freedom in van der Waals and moir\\'e heterostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2023 15:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

In a typical walking droplet\nexperiment, a liquid droplet, known as \\textit{walker}, propels itself\nlaterally on the free surface of a vibrating bath of the same liquid. This\nmotion is the result of the interaction between the droplets and the surface\nwaves generated by the droplet itself after each successive bounce. A walker\ncan exhibit a highly irregular trajectory over the course of its motion,\nincluding rapid acceleration and complex interactions with the other walkers\npresent in the same bath. In analogy with the hydrodynamic experiments, the\ngranular matter experiments consist of a vibrating bath of very small solid\nparticles and a larger solid \\textit{intruder}. Like the fluid droplets, the\nintruder interacts with and travels the domain due to the waves of the bath but\ntends to move much slower and much less smoothly than the droplets. When\nmultiple intruders are introduced, they also exhibit complex interactions with\neach other. We leverage the state-of-art object detection model YOLO and the\nHungarian Algorithm to accurately extract the trajectory of a walker or\nintruder in real-time. Our proposed methodology is capable of tracking\nindividual walker(s) or intruder(s) in digital images acquired from a broad\nspectrum of experimental settings and does not suffer from any identity-switch\nissues. Thus, the deep learning approach developed in this work could be used\nto automatize the efficient, fast and accurate extraction of observables of\ninterests in walking droplet and granular flow experiments. Such extraction\ncapabilities are critically enabling for downstream tasks such as building\ndata-driven dynamical models for the coarse-grained dynamics and interactions\nof the objects of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 16:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

They last about a second.\nIn a call, an orca typically uses multiple frequencies simultaneously, varies\nthe frequencies, and varies their volumes. Behavior data is hard to obtain\nbecause orcas live under water and travel quickly. Sound data is relatively\neasy to capture. As a science goal, we would like to know whether orca\nvocalizations constitute a semantic language. We do this by studying whether\nmachine learning can predict behavior from vocalizations. Such prediction would\nalso help scientific research and safety applications because one would like to\npredict behavior while only having to capture sound. A significant challenge in\nthis process is lack of labeled data. We work with recent recordings of McMurdo\nSound orcas [Wellard et al. 2020] where each recording is labeled with the\nbehaviors observed during the recording. This yields a dataset where sound\nsegments - continuous vocalizations that can be thought of as call sequences or\nmore general structures - within the recordings are labeled with superfluous\nbehaviors. Despite that, with a careful combination of recent machine learning\ntechniques, we achieve 96.4% classification accuracy. This suggests that orcas\ndo use a semantic language.

Despite its success, the\nbehavior and robustness of deep networks are not fully understood yet, posing a\nsignificant risk. In particular, researchers recently found that neural\nnetworks are overly confident in their predictions, even on data they have\nnever seen before. To tackle this issue, one can differentiate two approaches\nin the literature. One accounts for uncertainty in the predictions, while the\nsecond estimates the underlying density of the training data to decide whether\na given input is close to the training data, and thus the network is able to\nperform as expected.In this thesis, we investigate the capabilities of EBMs at\nthe task of fitting the training data distribution to perform detection of\nout-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We find that on most datasets, EBMs do not\ninherently outperform other density estimators at detecting OOD data despite\ntheir flexibility. Thus, we additionally investigate the effects of\nsupervision, dimensionality reduction, and architectural modifications on the\nperformance of EBMs. Further, we propose Energy-Prior Network (EPN) which\nenables estimation of various uncertainties within an EBM for classification,\nbridging the gap between two approaches for tackling the OOD detection problem.\nWe identify a connection between the concentration parameters of the Dirichlet\ndistribution and the joint energy in an EBM. Additionally, this allows\noptimization without a held-out OOD dataset, which might not be available or\ncostly to collect in some applications. Finally, we empirically demonstrate\nthat Energy-Prior Network (EPN) is able to detect OOD inputs, datasets shifts,\nand adversarial examples.
