The particular shape of the Time of Arrival (TOA) distribution is\nexamined and the relation between the time resolution and the spread of\nintrinsic charge collection time is discussed, by varying electronics\nparameters and discrimination thresholds. The results are obtained with and\nwithout simulated electronics noise. We show that the 3D-trench sensors are\ncharacterized by a $synchronous~region$, i.e. a portion of the active volume\nwhich leads to the same TOA values when charged particles cross it. The\nsynchronous region size is dependent on the front-end electronics and\ndiscrimination threshold, and the phenomenon represents an intrinsic physical\neffect that leads to the excellent time resolution of these sensors. Moreover,\nwe show that the TOA distribution is characterized by an intrinsic asymmetry,\ndue to the 3D geometry only, that becomes negligible in case of significant\nelectronics jitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 16:01:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 15:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

These\nquestions are addressed both in problems involving a single potential energy\nsurface, and those with multiple, strongly coupled surfaces; and both in the\nelectrostatic model and those for which fine structure and electron spin are\nimportant. The analysis leads to an examination of the transformation laws\nunder rotations of the electronic Hamiltonian; of the basis states, both\nadiabatic and diabatic, along with their phase conventions; of the potential\nenergy matrix; and of the derivative couplings. These transformation laws are\nplaced in the geometrical context of the structures in the nuclear\nconfiguration space that are induced by rotations, which include the rotational\norbits or fibers, the surfaces upon which the orientation of the molecule\nchanges but not its shape; and the section, an initial value surface that cuts\ntransversally through the fibers.

We revisit some\nnostalgias such as static universes and de Sitter/steady state universes. We\nreproduce the original ones, moreover, present some novelties, e.g., a\nspatially flat static universe, de Sitter expansion by negative vacuum energy,\nsteady state universes in the presence of arbitrary fluids with constant\nequation of state (EoS) parameter other than dust, etc. We also investigate the\npossible dynamics of dust dominated and radiation dominated universes.\nDepending on the value of $\\alpha$, dust/radiation dominated universe exhibits\npower-law accelerated/decelerated expansion, corresponds to a steady state\nmodel or may end in a big rip. In the framework of anisotropic cosmology, we\nreproduce Barrow's quiescent universe in the presence of stiff fluid and extend\nit to fluids with arbitrary constant EoS parameter. We also relax the condition\nfor isotropic initial singularity (big bang) owing to that EMSG effectively\nallows ultra-stiff EoS parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 16:26:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 09:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

With that and perfect\ncredibility, the theory of the price level and inflation only needs the Fisher\nequation, but it interprets causality in a new sense: if the monetary authority\nraises the policy rate, it will raise the inflation target, and vice versa,\ngiven the natural interest rate.

Both power cables and\nhydrogen energy facilities are analyzed. Each method is examined with the\nassociated proposed optimal sizing model. A cost-benefit analysis is conducted,\nand these methods are compared under different scenarios. Three long-distance\nenergy transmission methods are proposed to transmit offshore energy onshore,\nconsidering the capital/operation costs for related energy conversion and\ntransmission facilities. The first method that deploys power cables only is a\nbenchmark method. The other two methods utilize a hydrogen supercenter (HSC)\nand transmit offshore energy to and onshore substation through hydrogen\npipelines. For the second method, electrolyzers are placed at offshore wind\nfarms connected to HSC with low-pressure hydrogen pipelines. For the third\nmethod, offshore wind power is distributed to the HSC and then converted into\nhydrogen using electrolyzers placed at the HSC. An offshore scenario including\nthree wind farms located in the Gulf of Mexico and one onshore substation is\nused as the base test case. Numerical simulations are conducted over a planning\nperiod of 30 years using the proposed optimization models for each method\nseparately. Simulation results show that the proposed hydrogen-based methods\ncan effectively transmit offshore energy to the onshore substation. The\ndistances between the wind farms can influence the selection and configuration\nof the offshore wind energy system.

Existing methods either ignore\nreferences or utilize only abstracts indiscriminately from them, failing to\ntackle the challenge mentioned above. To fill that gap, we propose a novel\ncitation-aware scientific paper summarization framework based on citation\ngraphs, able to accurately locate and incorporate the salient contents from\nreferences, as well as capture varying relevance between source papers and\ntheir references. Specifically, we first build a domain-specific dataset\nPubMedCite with about 192K biomedical scientific papers and a large citation\ngraph preserving 917K citation relationships between them.

Based on it, we design a self-supervised citation-aware\nsummarization framework (CitationSum) with graph contrastive learning, which\nboosts the summarization generation by efficiently fusing the salient\ninformation in references with source paper contents under the guidance of\ntheir correlations.

This article extends this framework to worldsheet\nmodels for massive particles in 4d, obtained via a symmetry reduction of a\nhigher dimensional massless model. The target space of the resulting models\nturns out to be the phase space of 4d massive particles in a twistorial\nrepresentation, and so the worldsheet theory agrees with the two-twistor string\npreviously introduced by the authors. However, the paper has been written so as\nto be largely self-contained. We discuss two interesting classes of massive\ntheories in detail. For gauge theories, the reduction procedure is explicitly\nadapted to supersymmetric gauge theories on the Coulomb branch. For\nsupergravity theories, the reduction is adapted to give theories obtained via\nCremmer, Scherk and Schwartz (CSS) reduction, with broken supersymmetry and\nmassive multiplets. The reduction procedure gives explicit and systematic rules\nto obtain amplitudes for all these theories and their amplitudes from two\ncompact master formulae that have their origins in 6d based on the polarized\nscattering equations; in the CSS case the formulae are new, and in both cases\ntheir derivation is systematic. The freedom to include mass allows the\ndefinition of a loop insertion operator, thereby extending the formulae to\n1-loop.

A promising\nalternative, proposed by Refsdal in 1964, relies on the inverse scaling of H0\nwith the delay between the arrival times of at least two images of a\nstrongly-lensed variable source such as a quasar. To date, Refsdal's method has\nmostly been applied to quasars lensed by individual galaxies rather than by\ngalaxy clusters.

While a single time delay measurement does not yield a\nwell-constrained H0 value, analyzing the systems together tightens the\nconstraint. Combining the six time delays measured in the three cluster-lensed\nquasars gives H0 = 71.5 +/- 6.1 km/s/Mpc.

The recent refutation of the periodic tiling\nconjecture in high dimensions due to Greenfeld and Tao motivates finding\ndifferent generalizations of Newman's theorem and of Bhattacharya's theorem\nthat hold in arbitrary dimension $d$.

We propose an\nexperimental scheme for the quantum test of LPI: an internal atomic clock\ninterferometer comprising two interfering clocks within one atom. We prepare\nthe atom in a superposition of two clock states and one ground state, which\nevolves coherently along two quantum clock oscillations into stable internal\nRamsey interference patterns. The interference pattern with the shared ground\nstate shows a visibility modulation, which can be interpreted as the beating of\nthe individual clock oscillations and a direct consequence of complementarity.\nUpon the interferometer experiencing a different gravitational potential, LPI\npredicts that both clock tick rates will change proportionally, while quantum\ncomplementarity indicates that the visibility modulation should modify\naccordingly. This change is deemed insignificant for the first period of\nvisibility modulation but can be stacked up until the limit of the system\ncoherence time. Since no splitting or recombining is involved, the system\ncoherence time can be as long as the trap lifetime or the clock state lifetime.\nThe required resolution to observe the visibility modulation is within reach of\nthe state-of-art optical clocks' sensitivities.

Although a number of such techniques have been recently\ndeveloped for coronagraphic imaging, here we present one designed for\nnon-coronagraphic imaging. Utilizing conventional AO system components, this\nconcept additionally requires (1) a detector imaging the focal plane of the WFS\nlight source and (2) a pupil plane optical chopper device that is non-common\npath to the first WFS and is synchronized to the focal plane imager readout.\nThese minimal hardware requirements enable the temporal amplitude modulation to\nresolve the sine ambiguity of even wavefront modes for both low, mid, and high\nwavefront spatial frequencies. Similar capabilities have been demonstrated with\nclassical phase diversity by defocusing the detector, but such techniques are\nincompatible with simultaneous science observations. This optical chopping\ntechnique, however, enables science imaging at up to a 50% duty cycle.

Recently, it has been shown\nthat finetuning LMs on a set of factual knowledge makes them produce better\nanswers to queries from a different set, thus making finetuned LMs a good\ncandidate for knowledge extraction and, consequently, knowledge graph\nconstruction. In this paper, we analyze finetuned LMs for factual knowledge\nextraction. We show that along with its previously known positive effects,\nfinetuning also leads to a (potentially harmful) phenomenon which we call\nFrequency Shock, where at the test time the model over-predicts rare entities\nthat appear in the training set and under-predicts common entities that do not\nappear in the training set enough times. We show that Frequency Shock leads to\na degradation in the predictions of the model and beyond a point, the harm from\nFrequency Shock can even outweigh the positive effects of finetuning, making\nfinetuning harmful overall. We then consider two solutions to remedy the\nidentified negative effect: 1- model mixing and 2- mixture finetuning with the\nLM's pre-training task.

While the theoretical ratio of these two\nfrequencies is close to 2, simultaneous observations give ratios ranging from\n1.6 to 2, suggesting either a ratio different from 2, a delay of the\nfundamental emission, or both. To address this long-standing question, we\nconducted high frequency, high time resolution imaging spectroscopy of type III\nand type J bursts with fine structures for both the fundamental and harmonic\ncomponents with LOFAR between 30 and 80 MHz. The short-lived and narrow\nfrequency-band fine structures observed simultaneously at fundamental and\nharmonic frequencies give a frequency ratio of 1.66 and 1.73, similar to\nprevious observations. However, frequency-time cross-correlations suggest a\nfrequency ratio of 1.99 and 1.95 with a time delay between the F and H\nemissions of 1.00 and 1.67 s, respectively for each event. Hence, simultaneous\nfrequency ratio measurements different from 2 are caused by the delay of the\nfundamental emission. Among the processes causing fundamental emission delays,\nanisotropic radio-wave scattering is dominant. Moreover, the levels of\nanisotropy and density fluctuations reproducing the delay of fundamental\nemissions are consistent with those required to simulate the source size and\nduration of fundamental emissions. Using these simulations we are able to, for\nthe first time, provide quantitative estimates of the delay time of the\nfundamental emissions caused by radio-wave propagation effects at multiple\nfrequencies, which can be used in future studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 18:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

We\ninvestigate the potential of polarimetry for distinguishing exo-Earths from\nexo-Venuses. We present computed fluxes and polarisation of starlight that is\nreflected by exoplanets with atmospheres in evolutionary states from current\nEarth to current Venus, with cloud compositions ranging from pure water to 0.75\nsulfuric acid solution, for wavelengths between 0.3 and 2.5 microns. The\npolarisation of the reflected light shows larger variations with the planetary\nphase angle than the total flux. Across the visible, the largest polarisation\nis reached for an Earth-like atmosphere with water clouds, due to Rayleigh\nscattering above the clouds and the rainbow near 40 deg phase angle. In the\nnear-infrared, the planet with a Venus-like CO2 atmosphere and thin water\nclouds shows the most prominent polarisation features due to scattering by the\nsmall cloud droplets. A planet around Alpha Centauri A would leave temporal\nvariations on the order of 10E-13 W/m3 in the reflected flux and 10E-11 in the\ndegree of polarisation along the planet's orbit for a spatially unresolved\nstar-planet system. Star-planet contrasts are on the order of 10E-10. Current\npolarimeters cannot distinguish between the possible evolutionary phases of\nspatially unresolved terrestrial exoplanets, as a sensitivity near 10E-10 is\nrequired to discern the planet signal on the background of unpolarised\nstarlight. Telescopes capable of reaching planet-star contrasts lower than\n10E-9 should be able to observe the variation of the planet's resolved degree\nof polarisation as a function of its phase angle and thus to discern an\nexo-Earth from an exo-Venus based on its clouds' unique polarisation\nsignatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 18:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing\nprotocols for cutting the IS ratios to combat the variance of the IS estimator.\nUnfortunately, once a trace has been fully cut, the effect cannot be reversed.\nThis has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account\nfor multiple past experiences at a time.

Traditionally, ensembling\nalgorithms train their base learners independently or sequentially with the\ngoal of optimizing their joint performance. In the case of deep ensembles of\nneural networks, we are provided with the opportunity to directly optimize the\ntrue objective: the joint performance of the ensemble as a whole. Surprisingly,\nhowever, directly minimizing the loss of the ensemble appears to rarely be\napplied in practice. Instead, most previous research trains individual models\nindependently with ensembling performed post hoc. In this work, we show that\nthis is for good reason - joint optimization of ensemble loss results in\ndegenerate behavior. We approach this problem by decomposing the ensemble\nobjective into the strength of the base learners and the diversity between\nthem.

The control problem is stated as a trajectory tracking\ndirectly on the load. To do so, a hierarchical control scheme is proposed based\non the attractive ellipsoid method, where a virtual controller is calculated\nfor tracking the position of the load, with this, the desired position for each\nvehicle along with their desired cable tensions are estimated, and used to\ncompute the virtual controller for the position of each vehicle.

Kinetic models affect the design, the optimization and the\ncontrol of catalytic processes, but they are not easy to obtain. Classical\nparadigms, such as mechanistic modeling require substantial domain knowledge,\nwhile data-driven and hybrid modeling lack interpretability. Consequently, a\ndifferent approach called automated knowledge discovery has recently gained\npopularity. Many methods under this paradigm have been developed, where ALAMO,\nSINDy and genetic programming are notable examples. However, these methods\nsuffer from important drawbacks: they require assumptions about model\nstructures, scale poorly, lack robust and well-founded model selection\nroutines, and they are sensitive to noise. To overcome these challenges, the\npresent work constructs two methodological frameworks, Automated Discovery of\nKinetics using a Strong/Weak formulation of symbolic regression, ADoK-S and\nADoK-W, for the automated generation of catalytic kinetic models.

Its presence\ncan notably hide the presence of orbiting circumbinary planets because many\nfitting algorithms assume perfectly Keplerian motion. To first order, apsidal\nprecession ($\\dot{\\omega}$) can be accounted for by adding a linear term to the\nusual Keplerian model. We include apsidal precession in the kima package, an\norbital fitter designed to detect and characterise planets from radial velocity\ndata. In this paper, we detail this and other additions to kima that improve\nfitting for stellar binaries and circumbinary planets including corrections\nfrom general relativity. We then demonstrate that fitting for $\\dot{\\omega}$\ncan improve the detection sensitivity to circumbinary exoplanets by up to an\norder of magnitude in some circumstances, particularly in the case of\nmulti-planetary systems. In addition, we apply the algorithm to several real\nsystems, producing a new measurement of aspidal precession in KOI-126 (a tight\ntriple system), and a detection of $\\dot{\\omega}$ in the Kepler-16 circumbinary\nsystem. Although apsidal precession is detected for Kepler-16, it does not have\na large effect on the detection limit or the planetary parameters.

By contrast, the Navier-Stokes equations that describe the\ndynamics of a thin liquid film flowing down an inclined plane are too complex\nto stabilize with standard control-theoretical techniques. To bridge this gap\nwe use reduced-order models - the Benney equation and a weighted-residual\nintegral boundary layer model - obtained via asymptotic analysis to derive a\nmulti-level control framework. This framework consists of an LQR feedback\ncontrol designed for a linearised and discretised system of ODEs approximating\nthe reduced-order system, which are then applied to the full Navier-Stokes\nsystem. The control scheme is tested via direct numerical simulation (DNS), and\ncompared to analytical predictions of linear stability thresholds and minimum\nrequired actuator numbers. Comparing the strategy between the two reduced-order\nmodels we show that in both cases we can successfully stabilize towards a\nuniform flat film across their respective ranges of valid parameters, with the\nmore accurate weighted-residual model outperforming the Benney-derived\ncontrols. The weighted-residual controls are also found to work successfully\nfar beyond their anticipated range of applicability.

Imaging Sgr A* is plagued by two major challenges: variability on short\n(approximately minutes) timescales and interstellar scattering along our line\nof sight. While the scattering is well studied, the source variability\ncontinues to push the limits of current imaging algorithms. In particular,\nmovie reconstructions are hindered by the sparse and time-variable coverage of\nthe array. In this paper, we study the impact of the planned Africa Millimetre\nTelescope (AMT, in Namibia) and Canary Islands telescope (CNI) additions to the\ntime-dependent coverage and imaging fidelity of the EHT array. This African\narray addition to the EHT further increases the eastwest (u, v) coverage and\nprovides a wider time window to perform high-fidelity movie reconstructions of\nSgr A*. We generated synthetic observations of Sgr A*'s accretion flow and used\ndynamical imaging techniques to create movie reconstructions of the source. To\ntest the fidelity of our results, we used one general-relativistic\nmagneto-hydrodynamic model of the accretion flow and jet to represent the\nquiescent state and one semi-analytic model of an orbiting hotspot to represent\nthe flaring state. We found that the addition of the AMT alone offers a\nsignificant increase in the (u, v) coverage, leading to robust averaged images\nduring the first hours of the observating track. Moreover, we show that the\ncombination of two telescopes on the African continent, in Namibia and in the\nCanary Islands, produces a very sensitive array to reconstruct the variability\nof Sgr A* on horizon scales. We conclude that the African expansion to the EHT\nincreases the fidelity of high-resolution movie reconstructions of Sgr A* to\nstudy gas dynamics near the event horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 19:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

We present three systems\nthat we developed for the Challenge and discuss the distinctive task\nformulation used in each of the three systems. Materials and Methods: The first\nsystem identifies target pieces of information independently using machine\nlearning classifiers. The second system uses a large language model (LLM) to\nextract complete structured outputs per document. The third system extracts\ncandidate phrases using machine learning and identifies target relations with\nhand-crafted rules. Results: The three systems achieved F1 scores of 0.884,\n0.831, and 0.663 in the Subtask A of the Challenge, which are ranked third,\nseventh, and eighth among the 15 participating teams. The review of the\nextraction results from our systems reveals characteristics of each approach\nand those of the SODH extraction task. Discussion: Phrases and relations\nannotated in the task is unique and diverse, not conforming to the conventional\nevent extraction task. These annotations are difficult to model with limited\ntraining data. The system that extracts information independently, ignoring the\nannotated relations, achieves the highest F1 score. Meanwhile, LLM with its\nversatile capability achieves the high F1 score, while respecting the annotated\nrelations. The rule-based system tackling relation extraction obtains the low\nF1 score, while it is the most explainable approach. Conclusion: The F1 scores\nof the three systems vary in this challenge setting, but each approach has\nadvantages and disadvantages in a practical application. The selection of the\napproach depends not only on the F1 score but also on the requirements in the\napplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 20:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

To this end,\nwe propose a practical universal domain adaptation setting for remote sensing\nimage scene classification that requires no prior knowledge on the label sets.\nFurthermore, a novel universal domain adaptation method without source data is\nproposed for cases when the source data is unavailable. The architecture of the\nmodel is divided into two parts: the source data generation stage and the model\nadaptation stage. The first stage estimates the conditional distribution of\nsource data from the pre-trained model using the knowledge of\nclass-separability in the source domain and then synthesizes the source data.\nWith this synthetic source data in hand, it becomes a universal DA task to\nclassify a target sample correctly if it belongs to any category in the source\nlabel set, or mark it as ``unknown\" otherwise. In the second stage, a novel\ntransferable weight that distinguishes the shared and private label sets in\neach domain promotes the adaptation in the automatically discovered shared\nlabel set and recognizes the ``unknown'' samples successfully.

A biodegradable\npolymer such as PLA or PLGA is the most effective carrier for encapsulating\nlycopene due to its excellent biodegradability, biocompatibility, and\nnontoxigenic effect on the human metabolic system.

From these we\nbuild predictive models for pump&dump events based on the language used in the\nsocial media posts.\n  There are multiple difficulties: not every post will cause the intended\nmarket reaction, some pump&dump events may be triggered by posts in other\nforums, and there may be accidental confluences of post timing and market\nmovements. Nevertheless, our best model achieves a prediction accuracy of 85%\nand an F1-score of 62%. Such a tool can provide early warning to investors and\nregulators that a pump&dump may be underway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 20:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

In\nthis scenario, stars move through a medium polluted with AGB and massive star\nejecta, accreting material to produce companions with typical mass ratio $q\\sim\n0.1$. These companions undergo eccentricity excitation due to dynamical\nperturbations by passing stars, culminating in a merger with their host star.\nThe accretion of the companion alters surface abundances via injected\npollutant.

The model also explains the ubiquity and discreteness of the\npopulations and correlations of enrichment rates with cluster mass, cluster age\nand stellar binarity. Abundance variations in some clusters can be broadly\nreproduced using AGB and massive binary ejecta abundances from the literature.\nIn other clusters, some high companion mass ratios ($q\\gtrsim 1$) are required.\nIn these cases, the available mass budget necessitates a variable degree of\nmixing of the polluted material with the primary star, deviations from model\nejecta abundances or mixing of internal burning products.

The advent of JWST has exacerbated this issue by\nconfirming the existence of galaxies in significant numbers as early as the\nfirst few hundred million years. Perhaps even more surprisingly, in some\ngalaxies, this initial highly efficient star formation rapidly shuts down, or\nquenches, giving rise to massive quiescent galaxies as little as 1.5 billion\nyears after the Big Bang. However, due to their faintness and red colour, it\nhas proven extremely challenging to learn about these extreme quiescent\ngalaxies, or to confirm whether any exist at earlier times.

One of the promising approaches for overcoming such aberrations\nis wavefront-shaping, where one modulates the incoming and/or the outgoing\nwavefront in a way that will allow it to focus into one spot despite scattering\nin the tissue. Wavefront modulations are specific to the tissue sample being\nimaged and need to be estimated based on a non-invasive feedback from a camera\ncollecting back-scattered light. Such modulations have been successively\nestimated using feedback from strong fluorescent beads which have been manually\nadded to a sample. However, in a real biomedical application, such feedback\nshould be provided by the fluorescent components of the tissue itself, whose\nemission is orders of magnitude lower than the one provided by beads.

We present a novel 3D Seq2Seq deep learning respiratory motion simulator\n(RMSim) that learns from 4D-CT images and predicts future breathing phases\ngiven a static CT image. The predicted respiratory patterns, represented by\ntime-varying displacement vector fields (DVFs) at different breathing phases,\nare modulated through auxiliary inputs of 1D breathing traces so that a larger\namplitude in the trace results in more significant predicted deformation.\nStacked 3D-ConvLSTMs are used to capture the spatial-temporal respiration\npatterns. Training loss includes a smoothness loss in the DVF and mean-squared\nerror between the predicted and ground truth phase images. A spatial\ntransformer deforms the static CT with the predicted DVF to generate the\npredicted phase image. 10-phase 4D-CTs of 140 internal patients were used to\ntrain and test RMSim. The trained RMSim was then used to augment a public DIR\nchallenge dataset for training VoxelMorph to show the effectiveness of\nRMSim-generated deformation augmentation.

To enable robust\nnetwork localization, we present Sparse Matrix Inference and Linear Embedding\n(SMILE), a novel approach which draws on both the well-known Locally Linear\nEmbedding (LLE) algorithm and recent advances in sparse plus low-rank matrix\ndecomposition.

Part of the problem is that many candidate solutions\nfound via ML are actually infeasible and have to be discarded. Restricting the\nsearch space to only the feasible solution candidates simplifies finding an\noptimal solution for the tasks. Further, the set of feasible solutions could be\nre-used in multiple problems characterized by different tasks. In particular,\nwe observe that complex tasks can be decomposed into subtasks and corresponding\nskills.

Traditionally, the gyre circulation is thought to be\ndriven by surface winds and quantified via Sverdrup balance, but it has been\nproposed that surface buoyancy fluxes may also contribute to gyre forcing.\nThrough a series of eddy-permitting global ocean model simulations with\nperturbed surface forcing, the relative contribution of wind stress and surface\nheat flux forcing to the large-scale ocean circulation is investigated,\nfocusing on the subtropical gyres. In addition to gyre strength being linearly\nproportional to wind stress, it is shown that the gyre circulation is strongly\nimpacted by variations in the surface heat flux (specifically, its meridional\ngradient) through a rearrangement of the ocean's buoyancy structure. On shorter\ntimescales ($\\sim$ decade), the gyre circulation anomalies are proportional to\nthe magnitude of the surface heat flux gradient perturbation, with up to $\\sim\n0.15\\,\\mathrm{Sv}$ anomaly induced per $\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ change in\nthe surface heat flux. On timescales longer than a decade, the gyre response to\nsurface buoyancy flux gradient perturbations becomes non-linear as ocean\ncirculation anomalies feed back onto the buoyancy structure induced by the\nsurface buoyancy fluxes.

In this paper, we present a method to directly measure the gas\nelectron density in outflows (ne), which in turn yields estimates of outflow\ncloud properties (e.g., density, volume filling-factor, and sizes/masses). We\nalso estimate the distance (r) from the starburst at which the observed\ndensities are found.

The traditional line of thinking is to design a system that is\nconceptually similar to transactional memory, where we log updates all the\ntime, and minimize the wasted work or alternatively the MTTR (mean time to\nrecovery). Such ``instant recovery'' systems allow the system to recover from a\npoint that is quite close to the point of failure.

In this\npaper, we characterize the secrecy performance of RZF precoding in the large\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast system. For this purpose, we\nfirst consider a central limit theorem (CLT) for the joint distribution of the\nusers' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the eavesdropper's\n(Eve's) signal-to-noise ratio (ESNR) by leveraging random matrix theory (RMT).\nThe result is then utilized to obtain a closed-form approximation for the\nergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and SOP of three typical scenarios: the case with\nonly external Eves, the case with only internal Eves, and that with both. The\nderived results are then used to evaluate the percentage of users in secrecy\noutage and the required number of transmit antennas to achieve a positive\nsecrecy rate. It is shown that, with equally-capable Eves, the secrecy loss\ncaused by external Eves is higher than that caused by internal Eves.

Many previous works have shown how deep learning models are\nprone to adversarial attacks and studied their vulnerabilities. However, the\nvulnerabilities of time series models for forecasting due to adversarial inputs\nare not extensively explored. While the attack on a forecasting model might aim\nto deteriorate the performance of the model, it is more effective, if the\nattack is focused on a specific impact on the model's output. In this paper, we\npropose a novel formulation of Directional, Amplitudinal, and Temporal targeted\nadversarial attacks on time series forecasting models. These targeted attacks\ncreate a specific impact on the amplitude and direction of the output\nprediction. We use the existing adversarial attack techniques from the computer\nvision domain and adapt them for time series. Additionally, we propose a\nmodified version of the Auto Projected Gradient Descent attack for targeted\nattacks. We examine the impact of the proposed targeted attacks versus\nuntargeted attacks. We use KS-Tests to statistically demonstrate the impact of\nthe attack.

Phononic circuits rely on waveguides that transmit elastic waves\nwithin desired frequency passbands, typically designed based on the Bloch modes\nof the waveguide constitutive cell, assuming linearity and periodicity. MEMS\nwaveguides composed of coupled drumhead (membrane) resonators offer tunable MHz\noperation frequencies for applications in nonlinear optomechanics, topological\ninsulators, phononic cavities, and acoustic switching. Here, we construct a\nreduced-order model (ROM) to demonstrate the switching of signal transmission\nin drumhead-resonator waveguides due to thermoelastic buckling. The ROM shows\nthat buckling amplifies existing structural disorders, breaking the periodicity\nrequired for waveguide transmission through the first passband. This\nperiodicity breaking manifests in the localization of the first-passband modes,\nlike classical Anderson localization caused by disorders. The proposed ROM is\nessential to study the investigated phenomena since Bloch mode analysis fails\nfor weakly-disordered (< 5%) finite waveguides due to the disorder\namplification caused by the thermoelastic buckling.

The\nDVL transmits four acoustic beams to the seafloor, and by measuring changes in\nthe frequency of the returning beams, the DVL can estimate the AUV velocity\nvector. However, in practical scenarios, not all the beams are successfully\nreflected. When only three beams are available, the accuracy of the velocity\nvector is degraded.

The masses of\nquark and gluon as well as the interaction-vertex scale have been chosen in a\nrange suggested by lattice-QCD calculations, and calibrated to reproduce both\npion mass and decay constant. The sum rules to be fulfilled by the\ntransverse-momentum dependent distributions are carefully investigated,\nparticularly the leading-twist one, that has to match the collinear parton\ndistribution function, and hence can be scrutinized in terms of existing data\nas well as theoretical predictions. Noteworthy, the joint use of the Fock\nexpansion of the pion state facilitates a more in-depth analysis of the content\nof the pion Bethe-Salpeter amplitude, allowing for the first time to determine\nthe gluon contribution to the quark average longitudinal fraction, that results\nto be $\\sim 6\\%$.

Various AI risk assessment frameworks have been released recently by\ngovernments, organisations, and companies. However, it can be challenging for\nAI stakeholders to have a clear picture of the available frameworks and\ndetermine the most suitable ones for a specific context. Additionally, there is\na need to identify areas that require further research or development of new\nframeworks, as well as updating and maintaining existing ones. To fill the gap,\nwe present a mapping study of 16 existing AI risk assessment frameworks from\nthe industry, governments, and non-government organizations (NGOs). We identify\nkey characteristics of each framework and analyse them in terms of RAI\nprinciples, stakeholders, system lifecycle stages, geographical locations,\ntargeted domains, and assessment methods. Our study provides a comprehensive\nanalysis of the current state of the frameworks and highlights areas of\nconvergence and divergence among them. We also identify the deficiencies in\nexisting frameworks and outlines the essential characteristics of a concrete\nand connected framework AI risk assessment (C$^2$AIRA) framework. Our findings\nand insights can help relevant stakeholders choose suitable AI risk assessment\nframeworks and guide the design of future frameworks towards concreteness and\nconnectedness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 09:34:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:58:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 13:35:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 00:35:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

For\nclosure models and quasi-discrete closure models, in this paper we present\nthree notions of bisimilarity that are logically characterised by corresponding\nmodal logics with spatial modalities: (i) CM-bisimilarity for closure models\n(CMs) is shown to generalise Topo-bisimilarity for topological models.\nCM-bisimilarity corresponds to equivalence with respect to the infinitary modal\nlogic IML that includes the modality ${\\cal N}$ for ``being near''. (ii)\nCMC-bisimilarity, with `CMC' standing for CM-bisimilarity with converse,\nrefines CM-bisimilarity for quasi-discrete closure spaces, carriers of\nquasi-discrete closure models. Quasi-discrete closure models come equipped with\ntwo closure operators, Direct ${\\cal C}$ and Converse ${\\cal C}$, stemming from\nthe binary relation underlying closure and its converse. CMC-bisimilarity, is\ncaptured by the infinitary modal logic IMLC including two modalities, Direct\n${\\cal N}$ and Converse ${\\cal N}$, corresponding to the two closure operators.\n(iii) CoPa-bisimilarity on quasi-discrete closure models, which is weaker than\nCMC-bisimilarity, is based on the notion of compatible paths. The logical\ncounterpart of CoPa-bisimilarity is the infinitary modal logic ICRL with\nmodalities Direct $\\zeta$ and Converse $\\zeta$, whose semantics relies on\nforward and backward paths, respectively. It is shown that CoPa-bisimilarity\nfor quasi-discrete closure models relates to divergence-blind stuttering\nequivalence for Kripke structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 10:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

In this paper, we propose a new graph-based\nconditional moments (GRACE) method to do portfolio selection based on thousands\nof stocks or more. The GRACE method first learns the conditional quantiles and\nmean of stock returns via a factor-augmented temporal graph convolutional\nnetwork, which guides the learning procedure through a factor-hypergraph built\nby the set of stock-to-stock relations from the domain knowledge as well as the\nset of factor-to-stock relations from the asset pricing knowledge. Next, the\nGRACE method learns the conditional variance, skewness, and kurtosis of stock\nreturns from the learned conditional quantiles by using the quantiled\nconditional moment (QCM) method. The QCM method is a supervised learning\nprocedure to learn these conditional higher-order moments, so it largely\novercomes the computational difficulty from the classical high-dimensional\nGARCH-type methods. Moreover, the QCM method allows the mis-specification in\nmodeling conditional quantiles to some extent, due to its regression-based\nnature. Finally, the GRACE method uses the learned conditional mean, variance,\nskewness, and kurtosis to construct several performance measures, which are\ncriteria to sort the stocks to proceed the portfolio selection in the\nwell-known 10-decile framework. An application to NASDAQ and NYSE stock markets\nshows that the GRACE method performs much better than its competitors,\nparticularly when the performance measures are comprised of conditional\nvariance, skewness, and kurtosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 13:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

Different methods have been proposed to reduce\nthis gap, but most of them require architectural changes in ST training. In\nthis work, we propose to mitigate this issue at the pre-training stage,\nrequiring no change in the ST model. First, we show that the connectionist\ntemporal classification (CTC) loss can reduce the modality gap by design. We\nprovide a quantitative comparison with the more common cross-entropy loss,\nshowing that pre-training with CTC consistently achieves better final ST\naccuracy. Nevertheless, CTC is only a partial solution and thus, in our second\ncontribution, we propose a novel pre-training method combining CTC and optimal\ntransport to further reduce this gap. Our method pre-trains a Siamese-like\nmodel composed of two encoders, one for acoustic inputs and the other for\ntextual inputs, such that they produce representations that are close to each\nother in the Wasserstein space. Extensive experiments on the standard CoVoST-2\nand MuST-C datasets show that our pre-training method applied to the vanilla\nencoder-decoder Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance under the\nno-external-data setting, and performs on par with recent strong multi-task\nlearning systems trained with external data.

We conducted a survey in 14 geographic regions around\nthe world (N = 3,993), focusing on regions whose perspectives have been\ninsufficiently elevated in social media governance decisions (e.g. Mongolia,\nCameroon). {Results show} that, on average, women perceive greater harm\nassociated with online harassment than men, especially for non-consensual image\nsharing. Women also prefer most platform responses compared to men, especially\nremoving content and banning users; however, women are less favorable towards\npayment as a response. Addressing global gender-based violence online requires\nunderstanding how women experience online harms and how they wish for it to be\naddressed. This is especially important given that the people who build and\ngovern technology are not typically those who are most likely to experience\nonline harms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 14:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

In recent years, a number of convolutional deep\nlearning architectures have been proposed for automatically classifying the\nmodulation used on observed signal bursts.

Thus it is unclear what tradeoffs the differing designs of\nthese convolutional neural networks might have. In this research, we\ninvestigate numerous architectures for automatic modulation classification and\nperform a comprehensive ablation study to investigate the impacts of varying\nhyperparameters and design elements on automatic modulation classification\nperformance. We show that a new state of the art in performance can be achieved\nusing a subset of the studied design elements.

Describing an\nagent's desired behaviors and properties can be difficult, even for experts. A\nnew paradigm called reinforcement learning from human preferences (or\npreference-based RL) has emerged as a promising solution, in which reward\nfunctions are learned from human preference labels among behavior trajectories.\nHowever, existing methods for preference-based RL are limited by the need for\naccurate oracle preference labels. This paper addresses this limitation by\ndeveloping a method for crowd-sourcing preference labels and learning from\ndiverse human preferences. The key idea is to stabilize reward learning through\nregularization and correction in a latent space. To ensure temporal\nconsistency, a strong constraint is imposed on the reward model that forces its\nlatent space to be close to the prior distribution. Additionally, a\nconfidence-based reward model ensembling method is designed to generate more\nstable and reliable predictions. The proposed method is tested on a variety of\ntasks in DMcontrol and Meta-world and has shown consistent and significant\nimprovements over existing preference-based RL algorithms when learning from\ndiverse feedback, paving the way for real-world applications of RL methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 15:18:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

If the fuzzball proposal is to be a viable model for quantum black\nholes, it should reproduce this expectation. This is considered challenging,\nbecause it is natural for the modes on a fuzzball microstate to follow Poisson\nstatistics. In a previous paper, we noted a potential loophole here, thanks to\nthe modes depending not just on the $n$-quantum number, but also on the\n$J$-quantum numbers of the compact dimensions. For a free scalar field $\\phi$,\nby imposing a Dirichlet boundary condition $\\phi=0$ at the stretched horizon,\nwe showed that this $J$-dependence leads to a linear ramp in the Spectral Form\nFactor (SFF). Despite this, the status of level repulsion remained mysterious.\nIn this letter, motivated by the profile functions of BPS fuzzballs, we\nconsider a generic profile $\\phi = \\phi_0(\\theta)$ instead of $\\phi=0$ at the\nstretched horizon. For various notions of genericity (eg. when the Fourier\ncoefficients of $\\phi_0(\\theta)$ are suitably Gaussian distributed), we find\nthat the $J$-dependence of the spectrum exhibits striking evidence of level\nrepulsion, along with the linear ramp. We also find that varying the profile\nleads to natural interpolations between Poisson and Wigner-Dyson(WD)-like\nspectra. The linear ramp in our previous work can be understood as arising via\nan extreme version of level repulsion in such a limiting spectrum. We also\nexplain how the stretched horizon/fuzzball is different in these aspects from\nsimply putting a cut-off in flat space or AdS (ie., without a horizon).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 15:38:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 12:19:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 08:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

However, the binary spike propagation of the Full-Spike Neural\nNetworks (FSNN) with limited time steps is prone to significant information\nloss. To improve performance, several state-of-the-art SNN models trained from\nscratch inevitably bring many non-spike operations. The non-spike operations\ncause additional computational consumption and may not be deployed on some\nneuromorphic hardware where only spike operation is allowed. To train a\nlarge-scale FSNN with high performance, this paper proposes a novel Dual-Stream\nTraining (DST) method which adds a detachable Auxiliary Accumulation Pathway\n(AAP) to the full spiking residual networks. The accumulation in AAP could\ncompensate for the information loss during the forward and backward of full\nspike propagation, and facilitate the training of the FSNN. In the test phase,\nthe AAP could be removed and only the FSNN remained. This not only keeps the\nlower energy consumption but also makes our model easy to deploy. Moreover, for\nsome cases where the non-spike operations are available, the APP could also be\nretained in test inference and improve feature discrimination by introducing a\nlittle non-spike consumption. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, DVS Gesture,\nand CIFAR10-DVS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 02:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

Knowledge\ntracing aims to model student knowledge state given the student's sequence of\nlearning activities. Modern Knowledge tracing (KT) is usually formulated as a\nsupervised sequence learning problem to predict students' future practice\nperformance according to their past observed practice scores by summarizing\nstudent knowledge state as a set of evolving hidden variables. Because of this\nformulation, many current KT solutions are not fit for modeling student\nlearning from non-assessed learning activities with no explicit feedback or\nscore observation (e.g., watching video lectures that are not graded).\nAdditionally, these models cannot explicitly represent the dynamics of\nknowledge transfer among different learning activities, particularly between\nthe assessed (e.g., quizzes) and non-assessed (e.g., video lectures) learning\nactivities. In this paper, we propose Transition-Aware Multi-activity Knowledge\nTracing (TAMKOT), which models knowledge transfer between learning materials,\nin addition to student knowledge, when students transition between and within\nassessed and non-assessed learning materials. TAMKOT is formulated as a deep\nrecurrent multi-activity learning model that explicitly learns knowledge\ntransfer by activating and learning a set of knowledge transfer matrices, one\nfor each transition type between student activities. Accordingly, our model\nallows for representing each material type in a different yet transferrable\nlatent space while maintaining student knowledge in a shared space.

The recently introduced heteroscedastic location-scale noise\nfunctional models (LSNMs) combine expressive power with identifiability\nguarantees. LSNM model selection based on maximizing likelihood achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy, when the noise distributions are correctly\nspecified.

Our analysis shows that the failure occurs mainly\nwhen the conditional variance in the anti-causal direction is smaller than that\nin the causal direction.

In particular, there are adversaries aiming to detect\nD2D communications based on their received signal powers. To avoid being\ndetected, the legitimate entity, i.e., D2D-underlaid cellular network, performs\npower control so as to hide the presence of the D2D communication. We model the\ncombat between the adversaries and the legitimate entity as a two-stage\nStackelberg game. Therein, the adversaries are the followers and aim to\nminimize their detection errors at the lower stage while the legitimate entity\nis the leader and aims to maximize its utility constrained by the D2D\ncommunication covertness and the cellular quality of service (QoS) at the upper\nstage. Different from the conventional works, the study of the combat is\nconducted from the system-level perspective, where the scenario that a\nlarge-scale D2D-underlaid cellular network threatened by massive spatially\ndistributed adversaries is considered and the network spatial configuration is\nmodeled by stochastic geometry. We obtain the adversary's optimal strategy as\nthe best response from the lower stage and also both analytically and\nnumerically verify its optimality. Taking into account the best response from\nthe lower stage, we design a bi-level algorithm based on the successive convex\napproximation (SCA) method to search for the optimal strategy of the legitimate\nentity, which together with the best response from the lower stage constitute\nthe Stackelberg equilibrium.

In\nthis article, we highlight the important influence of the temporal distance\nbetween a stimulus event and the moment when its experience is reported on the\nprovided information's validity. This influence stems from the time-dependent\nand time-demanding nature of the involved cognitive processes. As such, reports\ncan be collected too late: forgetting is a widely acknowledged challenge for\naccurate descriptions of past experience. For this reason, methods striving for\nassessment as early as possible have become increasingly popular. However, here\nwe argue that collection may also occur too early: descriptions about very\nrecent stimuli might be collected before emotional processing has fully\nconverged. Based on these notions, we champion the existence of a temporal\ndistance for each type of stimulus that maximizes the validity of self-reports\n-- a \"right\" time. Consequently, we recommend future research to (1)\nconsciously consider the potential influence of temporal distance on affective\nself-reports when planning data collection, (2) document the temporal distance\nof affective self-reports wherever possible as part of corpora for\ncomputational modelling, and finally (3) and explore the effect of temporal\ndistance on self-reports across different types of stimuli.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 15:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

The success can be partly\nattributed to the advancements of deep neural networks made in the sub-fields\nof AI such as Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The\npromising research area that this dissertation focuses on is visual and\nlanguage understanding which involves many challenging tasks, i.e.,\nclassification, detection, segmentation, machine translation and captioning,\netc. The state-of-the-art methods for solving these problems usually involves\nonly two parts: source data and target labels, which is rather insufficient\nespecially when the dataset is small. Meanwhile, many external tools or sources\ncan provide extra useful information (external knowledge) that can help improve\nthe performance of these methods. For example, a detection model has been\napplied to provide better object features than state-of-the-art ResNet for\nimage captioning models. Inspired by this observation, we developed a\nmethodology that we can first extract external knowledge and then integrate it\nwith the original models. The external knowledge has to be extracted from the\ndataset, or can directly come from external, e.g., grammar rules or scene\ngraphs. We apply this methodology to different AI tasks, including machine\ntranslation and image captioning and improve the original state-of-the-art\nmodels by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 02:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

To minimize the maximum loss within a\nneighborhood in the parameter space, SAM uses an ascent step, which perturbs\nthe weights along the direction of gradient ascent with a given radius. While\nsingle-step or multi-step can be taken during ascent steps, previous studies\nhave shown that multi-step ascent SAM rarely improves generalization\nperformance. However, this phenomenon is particularly interesting because the\nmulti-step ascent is expected to provide a better approximation of the maximum\nneighborhood loss. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the effect of the\nnumber of ascent steps and investigate the difference between both single-step\nascent SAM and multi-step ascent SAM. We identify the effect of the number of\nascent on SAM optimization and reveal that single-step ascent SAM and\nmulti-step ascent SAM exhibit distinct loss landscapes. Based on these\nobservations, we finally suggest a simple modification that can mitigate the\ninefficiency of multi-step ascent SAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 06:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

However, existing CS-MRI\nmethods suffer from the challenge of aliasing artifacts. This challenge results\nin the noise-like textures and missing the fine details, thus leading to\nunsatisfactory reconstruction performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose\na hierarchical perception adversarial learning framework (HP-ALF). HP-ALF can\nperceive the image information in the hierarchical mechanism: image-level\nperception and patch-level perception. The former can reduce the visual\nperception difference in the entire image, and thus achieve aliasing artifact\nremoval. The latter can reduce this difference in the regions of the image, and\nthus recover fine details. Specifically, HP-ALF achieves the hierarchical\nmechanism by utilizing multilevel perspective discrimination. This\ndiscrimination can provide the information from two perspectives (overall and\nregional) for adversarial learning. It also utilizes a global and local\ncoherent discriminator to provide structure information to the generator during\ntraining. In addition, HP-ALF contains a context-aware learning block to\neffectively exploit the slice information between individual images for better\nreconstruction performance. The experiments validated on three datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of HP-ALF and its superiority to the comparative\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 14:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}
