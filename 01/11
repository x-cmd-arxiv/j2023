However, whether proteins are packaged\nstochastically or co-enriched within individual EVs, and whether co-enrichment\nfluctuates under homeostasis and disease, has not been measured. EV abundance\nand protein global relative expression have been qualified by bulk analysis.\nMeanwhile, co-enrichment is not directly accessible via bulk measurement and\nhas not been reported for single EV analysis. Here, we introduce the normalized\nindex of co-enrichment (NICE) to measure protein co-enrichment. NICE was\nderived by (i) capturing EVs based on the expression of a membrane-bound\nprotein, (ii) probing for the co-expression of a second protein at the\npopulation level - EV integrity underwrites the detection of single EV\nco-expression without the need to resolve single EVs - and (iii) normalizing\nmeasured values using two universal normalization probes. Axiomatically, NICE =\n1 for stochastic inclusion or no overall co-enrichment, while for positive and\nnegative co-enrichment NICE > 1 or < 1, respectively. We quantified the NICE of\ntetraspanins, growth factor receptors and integrins in EVs of eight breast\ncancer cell lines of varying metastatic potential and organotropism,\ncombinatorially mapping up to 104 protein pairs.

In this\npaper, we analyse the origin of the difference between the deposition of\nsuspended particles in a sessile drop and in an axisymmetric drop deposited on\na fibre. First, we model the shape of a drop on a fibre and its evaporative\nflux with some approximations to derive analytical calculations. Then, for\npinned contact lines, we solve the hydrodynamics equations in the liquid phase\nunder the lubrication approximation to determine the flow velocity toward the\ncontact lines. We comment these results by comparison to a sessile drop of\nsimilar evaporating conditions, and we show that the substrate curvature plays\na role on the contact line depinning, the local evaporative flux, and the\nliquid flow field. The competition between the advection and the Brownian\nmotion indicates that the transport of the particles toward the contact line\noccurs in a volume localised in the close vicinity of the contact lines for a\ndrop on a fibre. Thus, the fibre geometry induces a weaker accumulation of\nparticles at the contact line compared to a sessile drop, leading to the more\nhomogeneous deposit observed experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 16:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

While the state of the art for a single species totally\nasymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) can be described, from different\naspects as mature, much less is known when multiple interacting species are\npresent. Using tools from integrable systems and hydrodynamics in the first\nplace and stochastic processes in the second place, this work attempts to study\nthe behavior of a novel version of the model with different species of\nparticles having hierarchical dynamics that depend on arbitrary parameters.\nWhile Burger's equation famously represents the hydrodynamic limit of TASEP\nwith a single species, we present a counterpart coupled system of PDE\nrepresenting the hydrodynamic limit for a model with two species. The solutions\nof these PDEs display a rich phenomenology of solutions best characterized\nthrough the underlying normal modes. This system with two species can be used\nas a toy model for studying driven diffusive systems with open boundaries.\nUsing heuristics, we present results suggesting a general principle governing\nthe boundary-induced phase diagram of systems with multiple coupled driven\nconserved quantities, generalizing thus the extremal current principle known\nfor the case of a single driven quantity. Using integrability tools, we develop\na formalism allowing the computation of the finite-time probability\ndistribution of particle positions on the 1D lattice, generalizing therefore\nknown results for TASEP and other multi-species models.

We estimate that this common phenomenon is\ndetectable in 60% of the overall pulsar population if high quality data were\navailable for all. This large study reveals the evolution of drifting subpulses\nacross the pulsar population in unprecedented detail. In particular, we find\nthat the modulation period $P_3$ follows a V-shaped evolution with respect to\nthe characteristic age $\\tau_c$, such that the smallest $P_3$ values,\ncorresponding to the Nyquist period $P_3>\\sim2$, are found at\n$\\tau_c>\\sim10^{7.5}$ yr. The V-shaped evolution can be interpreted and\nreproduced if young pulsars possess aliased fast intrinsic $P_3$, which\nmonotonically increase, ultimately achieving a slow unaliased $P_3$.\nEnhancement of irregularities in intrinsic subpulse modulation by aliasing in\nsmall $\\tau_c$ pulsars would explain their observed less well defined $P_3$'s\nand weaker spectral features. Modelling these results as rotating subbeams,\ntheir circulation must slow down as the pulsar evolves. This is the opposite to\nthat expected if circulation is driven by ExB drift. This can be resolved if\nthe observed $P_3$ periodicity is due to a beat between an ExB system and the\npulsar period.

Beginning with a single molecule coupled to a single cavity mode,\nwe show that the cavity indeed enforces hydrogen transfer from an enol to an\nenethiol configuration with transfer rates significantly increasing with\nlight-matter interaction strength. This positive effect of the cavity on\nreaction rates is different from several other systems studied so far, where a\nretarding effect of the cavity on rates was found. It is argued that the cavity\n``catalyzes'' the reaction by transfer of virtual photons to the molecule. The\nsame concept applies to ensembles with up to $N=20$ TAA molecules coupled to a\nsingle cavity mode, where an additional, significant, ensemble-induced\ncollective isomerization rate enhancement is found. The latter is traced back\nto complex entanglement dynamics of the ensemble, which we quantify by means of\nvon Neumann-entropies.

The O-C diagram shows\nthat the pulsation period of V838 Cyg increases linearly on the large time\nscale. In the reanalysis of the high-precision Kepler data, we confirmed the\nmodulation with the period of 59.45\\pm0.04 days found earlier, and also found\nan additional weak modulation with a longer period (840\\pm21 days). After a\nseries of analyses, we incline to the view that the mechanisms leading the two\nmodulations are different: the former is more similar to the typical Blazhko\neffect, while the mechanism leading to the latter may be an extrinsic factor.\nWe also collected and compared the modulation and physical parameters of other\nBlazhko RR Lyrae stars from several works of literature, and find that there is\na potential negative correlation between the modulation amplitude (or upper\nlimit of amplitude) and the metal abundance. We infer that the relative\nmetal-rich will promote the convection in the outer stellar atmosphere, and\nthen inhibit those factors (turbulence, shock wave, etc.) that may cause\nBlazhko modulation. Future observations and research work can be carried out\nwith reference to this viewpoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 17:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

The accuracy and precision of these\nredshifts estimates is directly linked to the constraining power of photometric\nsurveys. It is hence necessary to define precision and accuracy requirements\nfor the redshift calibration to not to infer biased results in the final\nanalysis. For weak gravitational lensing of the LSS the photometry culminates\nin the estimation of the source redshift distribution (SRD) in each of the\ntomographic bins used in the analysis. The focus has been on shifts of the mean\nof the SRDs and how well the calibration must be able to recover those. Since\nthe estimated SRDs are usually given as a normalized histogram with\ncorresponding errors, it would be advantageous to propagate these uncertainties\naccordingly to see whether the requirements of the given survey are indeed\nfulfilled. Here we propose the use of functional derivatives to calculate the\nsensitivity of the final observables, e.g. the lensing angular power spectrum,\nwith respect to the SRD at a specific redshift.

The flow is characterised with single-point\nhot-wire measurements as well as planar Particle Image Velocimetry. In order to\nelucidate differences in shallow and deep flows past porous substrate, foams\nwith two different thickness (h) are used (for all three substrates). A wide\nrange of Friction Reynolds number (2000< Retau < 15000) and Permeability based\nReynolds number (1<ReK< 50) are attained. For substrates with ReK=1, the flow\nbehaviour remains similar to flow over impermeable smooth walls and as such\nTownsend's hypothesis remains valid. In contrast, a substantial reduction in\nvelocity disturbances and associated length scales is achieved for permeable\n(ReK>1) and dense (relative to viscous scales) foam at the thick substrate\nlimit (h/s>10), which leads to the breakdown of outer-layer similarity. As\nporosity is increased, a thin substrate limit is reached (h/s), and the foam\nbecomes sparse relative to viscous scales (s+ > 100). For such foams, the flow\nconforms to outer-layer similarity and is more akin to flow over rough\nsurfaces. Such substrates are unable to attenuate velocity disturbances and the\ndependence of substrate thickness (h/s) on spectral energy content of turbulent\nfluctuations ceases to exist. The present study shows that transition from\nthick to thin substrate flow behavior depends not only on thickness-to-pore\nratio (h/s) but also on substrate density relative to viscous scales of the\nflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 18:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

This article presents the solutions to a number of questions about\nthe Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses (in all dimensions) that\nwere raised in the physics literature many years ago. First, it is shown that\nthe ground state is sensitive to small perturbations of the disorder, in the\nsense that a small amount of noise gives rise to a new ground state that is\nnearly orthogonal to the old one with respect to the site overlap inner\nproduct. Second, it is shown that one can overturn a macroscopic fraction of\nthe spins in the ground state with an energy cost that is negligible compared\nto the size of the boundary of the overturned region - a feature that is\nbelieved to be typical of spin glasses but clearly absent in ferromagnets. The\nthird result is that the boundary of the overturned region in dimension $d$ has\nfractal dimension strictly greater than $d-1$, confirming a prediction from\nphysics. The fourth result is that the correlations between bonds in the ground\nstate can decay at most like the inverse of the distance. This contrasts with\nthe random field Ising model, where it has been shown recently that the\ncorrelation decays exponentially in distance in dimension two. The fifth result\nis that the expected size of the critical droplet of a bond grows at least like\na power of the volume.

The questions\nare, how good is the quality of this reporting, and what insights can be drawn\nfrom it? Apart from the company-reported statistics, which are available from\nthe North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC), flared volumes can be estimated\nvia satellite remote sensing, serving as an unbiased benchmark.

First, there is\nheterogeneity among the different counties, in the associations between the\nNDIC and VIIRS volumes.

Such limitation\narises from the lack of a comprehensive observational investigation of this\ntopic. Here we present the first homogeneous kinematic analysis of mPOPs in 56\nGCs based on high-precision proper motions computed with Hubble Space Telescope\ndata. We focused on red-giant-branch stars, for which the mPOP tagging is\nclearer, and measured the velocity dispersion of stars belonging to first (1G)\nand second generations (2G). We find that 1G stars are generally kinematically\nisotropic even at the half-light radius, whereas 2G stars are isotropic at the\ncenter and become radially anisotropic before the half-light radius.

Gamma-ray\nobservations provide a powerful tool in this respect, allowing us to constrain\nboth the interaction of CR protons with the ISM and their transport properties.\nTo help better understand the link between observational signatures and CR\nphysics, we use a series of magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) AREPO simulations of\nisolated galaxies performed using spectrally-resolved CR transport in every\ncomputational cell, with subsequent gamma-ray emission calculated using the\nCRAYON+ (Cosmic RAY emissiON) code. In each of our simulated halos, modelling\nthe energy-dependent spatial diffusion of CRs leads to a more extended\ndistribution of high-energy (~100 GeV) gamma rays compared to that predicted by\na 'grey' steady-state model, which is especially visible in the corresponding\nemission maps and radial profiles. Despite this, the total gamma-ray spectra\ncan often be well approximated by the steady-state model, although recovering\nthe same spectral index typically requires a minor variation of the energy\ndependence of the diffusion coefficient. Our simulations reproduce the observed\nspectral indices and gamma-ray spectra of nearby star-forming galaxies and also\nmatch recent observations of the far infrared--gamma-ray relation. We find,\nhowever, that the spectrally resolved model yields marginally smaller\nluminosities for lower star formation rates compared to grey simulations of\nCRs. Our work highlights the importance of modelling spectrally resolved CR\ntransport for an accurate prediction of spatially resolved high-energy\ngamma-ray emission, as will be probed by the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array\nobservatory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

In particular,\nGCs generally contain a `primordial' population with abundances similar to\nfield stars, along with an `enriched' population exhibiting light element\nanomalies. In this paper we present a homogeneous and wide-view analysis of\nmultiple stellar populations in 28 Galactic GCs. By using a combination of HST\nphotometry together with wide-field, ground-based photometry we are able to\nanalyse between 84% and 99% of all stars in each cluster. For each GC, we\nclassify stars into separate sub-populations using the well-established\n$C_{\\rm{UBI}}$ colour index, and investigate the spatial distributions of these\npopulations. Our results show that dynamically young GCs can contain either\ncentrally concentrated enriched or primordial populations, or no centrally\nconcentrated population. Dynamically old GCs show fully mixed populations as\nexpected. The existence of clusters born with centrally concentrated primordial\n(and homogeneously mixed) populations exacerbates the mass-budget problem\nfacing many cluster formation scenarios. The diversity in these results also\nhighlights the need for additional theories that can account for the wide\nvariety of initial conditions that we find. We finally investigate the enriched\nstar fraction as a function of different global parameters in our GC sample,\nusing also data for young and low-mass clusters from the Small- and Large\nMagellanic Clouds and confirm earlier results that the enriched star fraction\nstrongly correlates with the initial mass of a cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 19:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

The synthesis and processing\nof these plastic scintillators on the kilogram scale required consideration of\nmany factors. First, a comonomer (methacrylic acid) was used to solubilize\nsalts of lithium-6, which allow for a thermal-neutron capture reaction that\nproduces scintillation light following energy transfer. Second, scintillation\nperformance and processability were considered because the increasing content\nof the comonomer resulted in a sharp decrease in the light output. The use of\nsmall amounts of comonomer (less than or equal to 3 wt. %) resulted in better\nperformance but required high processing temperatures. At large scales, these\nhigh temperatures could initiate an exothermic polymerization that results in\npremature curing and/or defects. The deleterious effects of the comonomer may\nbe mitigated by using m-terphenyl as a primary dye rather than\n2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO), which has been traditionally used in organic\nscintillators.

Here we show that jointly modelling the\nantenna gains and RFI has significant benefits when the RFI follows precise\ntrajectories, such as for satellites. One surprising benefit is improved\ncalibration solutions, by leveraging the RFI signal itself. We present TABASCAL\n(TrAjectory BAsed RFI Subtraction and CALibration), a new algorithm that\njointly models the RFI signal & trajectory as well as the calibration\nparameters in post-correlation visibilities. TABASCAL can use either\noptimisation or fully Bayesian statistical methods to find calibration\nsolutions in contaminated data that would otherwise be thrown away. We test\nTABASCAL on simulated MeerKAT calibration observations contaminated by\nsatellite-based RFI with amplitudes varying between -20 dB and 15 dB relative\nto a 1 Jy source. We obtain gain estimates that are both unbiased and up to an\norder of magnitude better constrained compared to the case of no RFI. TABASCAL\ncan be further applied to an adjacent target observation: using 5 minutes of\ncalibration data resulted in an image with about half the noise compared to\nusing purely flagged data, and only 23% higher than an uncontaminated\nobservation. The source detection threshold and recovered flux distribution of\nTABASCAL-processed data was on par with uncontaminated data. In contrast, RFI\nflagging alone resulted in consistent underestimation of source fluxes and less\nsources detected. For a mean RFI amplitude of 17 Jy, using TABASCAL leads to\nless than 1% loss of data compared to 75% data loss from ideal $3\\sigma$\nflagging, a significant increase in data available for science analysis.\nAlthough we have examined the case of satellite RFI, TABASCAL should work for\nany RFI moving on parameterizable trajectories, such as planes or objects fixed\nto the ground.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 19:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

In this work, we study the potential of\ndetecting these elusive objects from radial velocity monitoring of\nself-luminous directly imaged planets. This technique is now possible thanks to\nthe development of dedicated instruments combining the power of high-resolution\nspectroscopy and high-contrast imaging. First, we demonstrate a sensitivity to\nsatellites with a mass ratio of 1-4% at separations similar to the Galilean\nmoons from observations of a brown-dwarf companion (HR 7672 B; Kmag=13; 0.7\"\nseparation) with the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC; R~35,000 in K\nband) at the W.

Using end-to-end\nsimulations, we then estimate that future instruments such as MODHIS, planned\nfor the Thirty Meter Telescope, should be sensitive to satellites with mass\nratios of ~1e-4. Such small moons would likely form in a circumplanetary disk\nsimilar to the Jovian satellites in the solar system.

The drastically increasing demand for higher throughput in\nintegrated circuit (IC) manufacturing and inspection calls for the\nnext-generation precision stages that have light weight and high control\nbandwidth simultaneously. In today's design techniques, the stage's first\nflexible mode is limiting its achievable control bandwidth, which enforces a\ntrade-off between the stage's acceleration and closed-loop stiffness and thus\nlimits the system's overall performance. To overcome this challenge, this paper\nproposes a new hardware design and control framework for lightweight precision\nmotion stages with the stage's low-frequency flexible modes actively\ncontrolled. Our method proposes to minimize the resonance frequency of the\ncontrolled mode to reduce the stage's weight, and to maximize that of the\nuncontrolled mode to enable high control bandwidth. In addition, the proposed\nframework determines the placement of the actuators and sensors to maximize the\ncontrollability/observability of the stage's controlled flexible mode while\nminimizing that of the uncontrolled mode, which effectively simplifies the\ncontroller designs. Two case studies are used to evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed framework. Simulation results show that the stage designed using\nthe proposed method has a weight reduction of more than 55% compared to a\nbaseline stage design. Improvement in control bandwidth was also achieved.\nThese results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving\nlightweight precision positioning stages with high acceleration, bandwidth, and\nprecision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 21:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

In this paper, we\nfind that we can change how a fact is stored in a model by editing weights that\nare in a different location than where existing methods suggest that the fact\nis stored. This is surprising because we would expect that localizing facts to\nspecific parameters in models would tell us where to manipulate knowledge in\nmodels, and this assumption has motivated past work on model editing methods.\nSpecifically, we show that localization conclusions from representation\ndenoising (also known as Causal Tracing) do not provide any insight into which\nmodel MLP layer would be best to edit in order to override an existing stored\nfact with a new one.

This approach is not necessary for\na more read-only oriented data landscape, and one where data contains many\ndimensions that represent a risk if overshared. In order to encourage users to\nshare data and smooth out the process of accessing such data a new approach is\nneeded. This new approach must simplify the RBAC of older DFS approaches to\nsomething more read-only and something that integrates redaction for user\nprotections. To accomplish this we present CageCoach, a simple sharing-oriented\nDistributed Cryptographic File System (DCFS). CageCoach leverages the\nsimplicity and speed of basic HTTP, linked data concepts, and automatic\nredaction systems to facilitate safe and easy sharing of user data. The\nimplementation of CageCoach is available at\nhttps://github.umn.edu/CARPE415/CageCoach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 21:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

To ensure coverage and utility, we adapt computer vision\ntechniques for image inpainting to operate on 3D histograms (2D space + 1D\ntime) commonly used for data exchange in urban settings.\n  Adapting these techniques to the spatiotemporal setting requires handling\nskew: urban data tend to follow population density patterns (small dense\nregions surrounded by large sparse areas); these patterns can dominate the\nlearning process and fool the model into ignoring local or transient effects.\nTo combat skew, we 1) train simultaneously in space and time, and 2) focus\nattention on dense regions by biasing the masks used for training to the skew\nin the data. We evaluate the core model and these two extensions using the NYC\ntaxi data and the NYC bikeshare data, simulating different conditions for\nmissing data.

Several\nresearch works have been done to investigate the different characteristics of\nlogging practices in traditional software systems (e.g., Android applications,\nJAVA applications, C/C++ applications). Nowadays, we are witnessing more and\nmore development of Machine Learning-based applications (ML-based\napplications).

In this paper, we aim to fill this knowledge gap and help ML\npractitioners understand the characteristics of logging in ML-based\napplications. In particular, we conduct an empirical study on 110 open-source\nML-based applications. Through a quantitative analysis, we find that logging\npractice in ML-based applications is less pervasive than in traditional\napplications including Android, JAVA, and C/C++ applications. Furthermore, the\nmajority of logging statements in ML-based applications are in info and warn\nlevels, compared to traditional applications where info is the majority of\nlogging statement in C/C++ application and debug, error levels constitute the\nmajority of logging statement in Android application. We also perform a\nquantitative and qualitative analysis of a random sample of logging statements\nto understand where ML developers put most of logging statements and examine\nwhy and how they are using logging. These analyses led to the following\nobservations: (i) ML developers put most of the logging statements in model\ntraining, and in non-ML components. (ii) Data and model management appear to be\nthe main reason behind the introduction of logging statements in ML-based\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 22:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

Moreover, these approaches learn soft class centers\nbased on coarse mask prediction, which is prone to error accumulation. To\nbetter exploit class level information, we propose a universal Class-Aware\nRegularization (CAR) approach to optimize the intra-class variance and\ninter-class distance during feature learning, motivated by the fact that humans\ncan recognize an object by itself no matter which other objects it appears\nwith.

The first loss\nfunction encourages more compact class representations within each class, the\nsecond directly maximizes the distance between different class centers, and the\nthird further pushes the distance between inter-class centers and pixels.\nFurthermore, the class center in our approach is directly generated from ground\ntruth instead of from the error-prone coarse prediction.

Such a fully-passive jammer (FPJ) can launch jamming\nattacks on multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems via\ninter-user interference caused by active channel aging, where the IJ requires\nno additional transmit power and instantaneous CSI. The simulation results show\nthe effectiveness of the proposed FPJ scheme. Moreover, we also investigate how\nthe transmit power and the number of quantization phase shift bits influence\nthe jamming performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 02:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

However, the price\ndifference across stages due to inadequate competition and unforeseen\ncircumstances leads to undesirable price manipulation. To mitigate this, some\nIndependent System Operators (ISOs) proposed system-level market power\nmitigation (MPM) policies in addition to existing local policies. These\npolicies aim to substitute noncompetitive bids with a default bid based on\nestimated generator costs. However, these policies may lead to unintended\nconsequences when implemented without accounting for the conflicting interest\nof participants. In this paper, we model the competition between generators\n(bidding supply functions) and loads (bidding quantity) in a two-stage market\nwith a stage-wise MPM policy. An equilibrium analysis shows that a real-time\nMPM policy leads to equilibrium loss, meaning no stable market outcome (Nash\nequilibrium) exists. A day-ahead MPM policy, besides, leads to a\nStackelberg-Nash game with loads acting as leaders and generators as followers.\nIn this setting, loads become winners, i.e., their aggregate payment is always\nless than competitive payments. Moreover, comparison with standard market\nequilibrium highlights that markets are better off without such policies.\nFinally, numerical studies highlight the impact of heterogeneity and load size\non market equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 02:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

The procedure of viscosity\ncalculation of the polysolution, although based on a very basic power law\nmodel, is based on empiric coefficients which depends on a spatio-temporally\nevolving variable namely concentration of polymer. Since viscosity calculation\nis done pointwise, the accuracy of the model is higher than what exists in\nliterature.

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art ML\nmodels like long short-term memories (LSTMs) and transformers incur significant\ncomputation overheads. This overhead makes it infeasible to deploy them in\nreal-time environments. We propose a novel ML-based exploit detection model,\nML-FEED, that enables highly efficient inference without sacrificing\nperformance. We develop a novel automated technique to extract vulnerability\npatterns from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures (CVE) databases. This feature enables ML-FEED to be aware of the\nlatest cyber weaknesses. Second, it is not based on the traditional approach of\nclassifying sequences of application programming interface (API) calls into\nexploit categories. Such traditional methods that process entire sequences\nincur huge computational overheads. Instead, ML-FEED operates at a finer\ngranularity and predicts the exploits triggered by every API call of the\nprogram trace. Then, it uses a state table to update the states of these\npotential exploits and track the progress of potential exploit chains. ML-FEED\nalso employs a feature engineering approach that uses natural language\nprocessing-based word embeddings, frequency vectors, and one-hot encoding to\ndetect semantically-similar instruction calls. Then, it updates the states of\nthe predicted exploit categories and triggers an alarm when a vulnerability\nfingerprint executes.

Existing methods\ntypically suffer from low computational efficiency, and this hinders the\nappropriate applications in large-scale scenarios involving an increasing\nnumber of vehicles. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel decentralized\niterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) algorithm by leveraging the dual\nconsensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). First, the\noriginal non-convex optimization problem is reformulated into a series of\nconvex optimization problems through iterative neighbourhood approximation.\nThen, the dual of each convex optimization problem is shown to have a consensus\nstructure, which facilitates the use of consensus ADMM to solve for the dual\nsolution in a fully decentralized and parallel architecture. Finally, the\nprimal solution corresponding to the trajectory of each vehicle is recovered by\nsolving a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem iteratively, and a novel\ntrajectory update strategy is proposed to ensure the dynamic feasibility of\nvehicles. With the proposed development, the computation burden is\nsignificantly alleviated such that real-time performance is attainable. Two\ntraffic scenarios are presented to validate the proposed algorithm, and\nthorough comparisons between our proposed method and baseline methods\n(including centralized iLQR, IPOPT, and SQP) are conducted to demonstrate the\nscalability of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 10:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

Due to\nthe increased attention that threats have received, many efficient specialized\nattacks against logic locking have been introduced over the years. However, the\nability of an adversary to manipulate a locked netlist prior to mounting an\nattack has not been investigated thoroughly. This paper introduces a\nresynthesis-based strategy that utilizes the strength of a commercial\nelectronic design automation (EDA) tool to reveal the vulnerabilities of a\nlocked circuit. To do so, in a pre-attack step, a locked netlist is\nresynthesized using different synthesis parameters in a systematic way, leading\nto a large number of functionally equivalent but structurally different locked\ncircuits. Then, under the oracle-less threat model, where it is assumed that\nthe adversary only possesses the locked circuit, not the original circuit to\nquery, a prominent attack is applied to these generated netlists collectively,\nfrom which a large number of key bits are deciphered. Nevertheless, this paper\nalso describes how the proposed oracle-less attack can be integrated with an\noracle-guided attack. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated\nfor several benchmarks, including remarkable results for breaking a recently\nproposed provably secure logic locking method and deciphering values of a large\nnumber of key bits of the CSAW'19 circuits with very high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 10:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

The answer to this question\ngoes beyond simple predictive performance, and is instead a balance of many\nfactors, including behavioural interpretability and explainability,\ncomputational complexity, and data efficiency. There is a growing body of\nresearch which attempts to compare the predictive performance of different ML\nclassifiers with classical random utility models. However, existing studies\ntypically analyse only the disaggregate predictive performance, ignoring other\naspects affecting model choice. Furthermore, many studies are affected by\ntechnical limitations, such as the use of inappropriate validation schemes,\nincorrect sampling for hierarchical data, lack of external validation, and the\nexclusive use of discrete metrics. We address these limitations by conducting a\nsystematic comparison of different modelling approaches, across multiple\nmodelling problems, in terms of the key factors likely to affect model choice\n(out-of-sample predictive performance, accuracy of predicted market shares,\nextraction of behavioural indicators, and computational efficiency). We combine\nseveral real world datasets with synthetic datasets, where the data generation\nfunction is known.

The proposed\nframework is used to analyze the environmental effect on the prediction\nalgorithm performance. In the analysis, the traffic environment is considered\nin terms of scenario features and shifts, respectively, where features are\ndivided into kinematic features of a target agent, features of its surrounding\ntraffic participants, and other features. In addition, feature correlation and\nimportance analyses are performed to study the above features' influence on the\nprediction error and epistemic uncertainty. Further, a cross-dataset case study\nis conducted using multiple intersection datasets to investigate the impact of\nunavoidable distributional shifts in the real world on trajectory prediction.\nThe results indicate that the deep ensemble-based method has advantages in\nimproving prediction robustness and estimating epistemic uncertainty. The\nconsistent conclusions are obtained by the feature correlation and importance\nanalyses, including the conclusion that kinematic features of the target agent\nhave relatively strong effects on the prediction error and epistemic\nuncertainty. Furthermore, the prediction failure caused by distributional\nshifts and the potential of the deep ensemble-based method are analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 11:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

As such FL systems are\nexposed to, or indeed the cause of, congestion across a wide set of network\nresources. Lossy compression can be used to reduce the size of exchanged files\nand associated delays, at the cost of adding noise to model updates. By\njudiciously adapting clients' compression to varying network congestion, an FL\napplication can reduce wall clock training time. To that end, we propose a\nNetwork Adaptive Compression (NAC-FL) policy, which dynamically varies the\nclient's lossy compression choices to network congestion variations. We prove,\nunder appropriate assumptions, that NAC-FL is asymptotically optimal in terms\nof directly minimizing the expected wall clock training time. Further, we show\nvia simulation that NAC-FL achieves robust performance improvements with higher\ngains in settings with positively correlated delays across time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 12:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

Existing approaches for entity\nand relation extraction tasks mainly focus on the English corpora and ignore\nother languages. Thus, it is critical to improving performance in a\nmultilingual setting. Meanwhile, multilingual training is usually used to boost\ncross-lingual performance by transferring knowledge from languages (e.g.,\nhigh-resource) to other (e.g., low-resource) languages. However, language\ninterference usually exists in multilingual tasks as the model parameters are\nshared among all languages. In this paper, we propose a two-stage multilingual\ntraining method and a joint model called Multilingual Entity and Relation\nExtraction framework (mERE) to mitigate language interference across languages.\nSpecifically, we randomly concatenate sentences in different languages to train\na Language-universal Aggregator (LA), which narrows the distance of embedding\nrepresentations by obtaining the unified language representation. Then, we\nseparate parameters to mitigate interference via tuning a Language-specific\nSwitcher (LS), which includes several independent sub-modules to refine the\nlanguage-specific feature representation. After that, to enhance the relational\ntriple extraction, the sentence representations concatenated with the relation\nfeature are used to recognize the entities. Extensive experimental results show\nthat our method outperforms both the monolingual and multilingual baseline\nmethods. Besides, we also perform detailed analysis to show that mERE is\nlightweight but effective on relational triple extraction and mERE{} is easy to\ntransfer to other backbone models of multi-field tasks, which further\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 12:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

In this context, we would like to emphasize that our kinematic\nanalysis with Gaia catalogs played a key role in identifying the new members of\nthe Lupus I cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 13:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

To address these issues, we propose an\nUncertainty-guided Collaborative Mean-Teacher (UCMT) for semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation with the high-confidence pseudo labels. Concretely, UCMT\nconsists of two main components: 1) collaborative mean-teacher (CMT) for\nencouraging model disagreement and performing co-training between the\nsub-networks, and 2) uncertainty-guided region mix (UMIX) for manipulating the\ninput images according to the uncertainty maps of CMT and facilitating CMT to\nproduce high-confidence pseudo labels. Combining the strengths of UMIX with\nCMT, UCMT can retain model disagreement and enhance the quality of pseudo\nlabels for the co-training segmentation.

Recent approaches mainly focus on\nthe design of view transformation, either pixel-wisely lifting perspective view\nfeatures into 3D space with estimated depth or grid-wisely constructing BEV\nfeatures via 3D projection, treating all pixels or grids equally. However,\nchoosing what to transform is also important but has rarely been discussed\nbefore. The pixels of a moving car are more informative than the pixels of the\nsky. To fully utilize the information contained in images, the view\ntransformation should be able to adapt to different image regions according to\ntheir contents. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named\nFrustumFormer, which pays more attention to the features in instance regions\nvia adaptive instance-aware resampling. Specifically, the model obtains\ninstance frustums on the bird's eye view by leveraging image view object\nproposals. An adaptive occupancy mask within the instance frustum is learned to\nrefine the instance location. Moreover, the temporal frustum intersection could\nfurther reduce the localization uncertainty of objects.

To address this, one can try to use output from\nconvection-parametrising (global) ensembles, post-processed to forecast at\npoint-scale, or convection-resolving limited area ensembles. In this study, we\ncombine both. First, we apply the \"ecPoint-rainfall\" post-processing to the\nECMWF global ensemble. Then, we use 2.2km COSMO LAM ensemble output (centred on\nItaly), and also post-process it using a scale-selective neighbourhood approach\nto compensate for insufficient members. The two components then undergo\nlead-time-weighted blending, to create the final probabilistic 6h rainfall\nforecasts. Product creation for forecasters constituted the \"Italy Flash Flood\nuse case\" within the EU-funded MISTRAL project and it will be a real-time\nopen-access product.\n  One year of verification shows that ecPoint is the most skilful ensemble\nproduct. The post-processed COSMO ensemble adds most value to summer convective\nevents in the evening, when the global model has an underprediction bias. In\ntwo heavy rainfall case studies we observed underestimation of the largest\npoint totals in the raw ECMWF ensemble, and overestimation in the raw COSMO\nensemble. However, ecPoint increase the value and highlighted best the most\naffected areas, whilst post-processing of COSMO diminished extremes by\neradicating unreliable detail. The final merged products looked best from a\nuser perspective and seemed to be the most skilful of all. Although our LAM\npost-processing does not implicitly include bias correction (a topic for\nfurther work) our study nonetheless provides a unique blueprint for\nsuccessfully combining ensemble rainfall forecasts from global and LAM systems\naround the world. It also has important implications for forecast products as\nglobal ensembles move ever closer to having convection-permitting resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 14:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

In this approach we combine two dimensionality\nreduction algorithms (cc\\_analysis and encodermap) with a density-based spatial\nclustering algorithm (HDBSCAN). The proposed scheme benefits from the strengths\nof the three algorithms while avoiding most of the drawbacks of the individual\nmethods. Here the cc\\_analysis algorithm is for the first time applied to\nmolecular simulation data. Encodermap complements cc\\_analysis by providing an\nefficient way to process and assign large amounts of data to clusters. The main\ngoal of the procedure is to maximize the number of assigned frames of a given\ntrajectory, while keeping a clear conformational identity of the clusters that\nare found. In practice we achieve this by using an iterative clustering\napproach and a tunable root-mean-square-deviation-based criterion in the final\ncluster assignment. This allows to find clusters of different densities as well\nas different degrees of structural identity. With the help of four test systems\nwe illustrate the capability and performance of this clustering workflow:\nwild-type and thermostable mutant of the Trp-cage protein (TC5b and TC10b),\nNTL9 and Protein B.

The same design\nprinciple was used in many other musical instruments, such as xylophones, pan\nflutes, pianos, etc. We reveal that there is a fascinating connection between\nthe progression pattern of many musical instruments and filtration (or spectral\nsequence) in topological data analysis (TDA). We argue that filtration-induced\nevolutionary de Rham-Hodge theory provides a new mathematical foundation for\nmusical instruments. Its discrete counterpart, persistent Laplacians and many\nother persistent topological Laplacians, including persistent sheaf Laplacians\nand persistent path Laplacians are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 15:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

In this work, we calculate the phonon-assisted temperature-dependent\noptical absorption spectra of the commonly occurring SiC polytypes (3C, 2H, 4H\nand 6H), using first-principles approaches based on density functional theory\nand related techniques.

The temperature dependence of the spectra can be\nwell-predicted with taking the temperature-dependence of the band gaps into\naccount.

As more consumers\nseek to utilize public charging services, the pricing and scheduling of such\nservices will become vital, complementary tools to mediate competition for\ncharging resources. However, determining the right prices to charge is\ndifficult due to the online nature of EV arrivals. This paper studies a joint\npricing and scheduling problem for the operator of EV charging networks with\nlimited charging capacity and time-varying energy cost. Upon receiving a\ncharging request, the operator offers a price, and the EV decides whether to\nadmit the offer based on its own value and the posted price. The operator then\nschedules the real-time charging process to satisfy the charging request if the\nEV admits the offer. We propose an online pricing algorithm that can determine\nthe posted price and EV charging schedule to maximize social welfare, i.e., the\ntotal value of EVs minus the energy cost of charging stations. Theoretically,\nwe prove the devised algorithm can achieve the order-optimal competitive ratio\nunder the competitive analysis framework. Practically, we show the empirical\nperformance of our algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms in\nexperiments using real EV charging data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 03:40:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 00:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}
