In such games,\nagents maximize their utility by choosing actions that differ from their\nneighbors' actions. Two important problems concerning evolutionary games are\nthe existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (NE) and the convergence time of the\ndynamics. In this work, we study these two problems for anti-coordination games\nunder sequential and synchronous update schemes.

Using a relationship between games and dynamical systems, we show that\nfor both update schemes, finding an NE can be done efficiently under the self\nnon-essential mode but is computationally intractable under the self essential\nmode. To cope with this hardness, we identify special cases for which an NE can\nbe obtained efficiently.

The latter sews together successive rounds\nof reflected BM, each of which is restricted to a single layer. Each round of\nreflected BM is killed when the local time at one end of the layer exceeds an\nindependent, exponentially distributed random variable. (The local time\nspecifies the amount of time a reflected Brownian particle spends in a\nneighborhood of a boundary.) The particle then immediately resumes reflected BM\nin the same layer or the layer on the other side of the boundary with equal\nprobability, and the process is iterated We proceed by constructing a last\nrenewal equation for multi-layered snapping out BM that relates the full\nprobability density to the probability densities of partially reflected BM in\neach layer. We then show how transfer matrices can be used to solve the Laplace\ntransformed renewal equation, and prove that the renewal equation and\ncorresponding multi-layer diffusion equation are equivalent. We illustrate the\ntheory by analyzing the first passage time (FPT) problem for escape at the\nexterior boundaries of the domain. Finally, we use the renewal approach to\nincorporate a generalization of snapping out BM based on the encounter-based\nmethod for surface absorption; each round of reflected BM is now killed\naccording to a non-exponential distribution for each local time threshold. This\nis achieved by considering a corresponding first renewal equation that relates\nthe full probability density to the FPT densities for killing each round of\nreflected BM.

The\nexisting approaches adapt the method to compute differentially private(DP)\ncentroids by iterative Llyod's algorithm and perturbing the centroid with\nvarious DP mechanisms.

However, PPG is susceptible to motion artifacts, considerably\ndeteriorating the accuracy of IBIs estimation. Although a multi-channel model\nin previous study improves accuracy, prevailing compact commercial wearables\nwould favor single-channel sensors, causing benefits of multi-channel\napplications to have restrictions. In this paper, a greedy-optimized framework\nis proposed for measurement of IBI and HRV featuring single-channel and\nmulti-channel PPG signals collected during daily activities. Utilizing the fact\nof continuity in heartbeats, the IBI estimation problem is converted into the\nshortest path problem in a directed acyclic graph, where candidate heartbeats\nfrom the noisy PPG are regarded as vertices. The framework exploits a convex\npenalty function to optimize weight assignment in the shortest path calculation\nand a greedy-optimized fusion method to mitigate overly fluctuating patterns in\nestimated IBIs. The results achieve correlation of 0.96 with percentage error\nof 3.2% for IBI estimation using single-channel PPG signals from the 2015 IEEE\nSignal Processing Cup dataset, where percentage error is reduced by 58.4% and\ncorrelation is improved by 11.6% in comparison to those without\ngreedy-optimized fusion. In the multi-channel model, it achieves correlation of\n0.98 with percentage error of 2.2%. Estimated and true HRV parameters are also\nhighly correlated with low percentage errors. This paper further validates\nthese techniques on the PPG-DaLiA dataset, indicating the robustness of the\nproposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 17:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Usually, anomaly detection is tackled from an unsupervised\nperspective because anomalous labels are rare and difficult to acquire.\nHowever, the lack of labels makes the anomaly detector have high uncertainty in\nsome regions, which usually results in poor predictive performance or low user\ntrust in the predictions. One can reduce such uncertainty by collecting\nspecific labels using Active Learning (AL), which targets examples close to the\ndetector's decision boundary. Alternatively, one can increase the user trust by\nallowing the detector to abstain from making highly uncertain predictions,\nwhich is called Learning to Reject (LR). One way to do this is by thresholding\nthe detector's uncertainty based on where its performance is low, which\nrequires labels to be evaluated. Although both AL and LR need labels, they work\nwith different types of labels: AL seeks strategic labels, which are evidently\nbiased, while LR requires i.i.d. labels to evaluate the detector's performance\nand set the rejection threshold. Because one usually has a unique label budget,\ndeciding how to optimally allocate it is challenging. In this paper, we propose\na mixed strategy that, given a budget of labels, decides in multiple rounds\nwhether to use the budget to collect AL labels or LR labels. The strategy is\nbased on a reward function that measures the expected gain when allocating the\nbudget to either side. We evaluate our strategy on 18 benchmark datasets and\ncompare it to some baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 18:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

However, segmentation\nmethods are hampered by the difficulty of obtaining pixel-level annotations,\nwhich are tedious and expensive to obtain for Whole-Slide images (WSI). To\nremedy this, weakly supervised methods have been developed to exploit the\nannotations directly available at the image level. However, to our knowledge,\nnone of these techniques is adapted to deal with WSIs. In this paper, we\npropose WholeSIGHT, a weakly-supervised method, to simultaneously segment and\nclassify WSIs of arbitrary shapes and sizes. Formally, WholeSIGHT first\nconstructs a tissue-graph representation of the WSI, where the nodes and edges\ndepict tissue regions and their interactions, respectively. During training, a\ngraph classification head classifies the WSI and produces node-level pseudo\nlabels via post-hoc feature attribution. These pseudo labels are then used to\ntrain a node classification head for WSI segmentation. During testing, both\nheads simultaneously render class prediction and segmentation for an input WSI.\nWe evaluated WholeSIGHT on three public prostate cancer WSI datasets. Our\nmethod achieved state-of-the-art weakly-supervised segmentation performance on\nall datasets while resulting in better or comparable classification with\nrespect to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised WSI classification methods.\nAdditionally, we quantify the generalization capability of our method in terms\nof segmentation and classification performance, uncertainty estimation, and\nmodel calibration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 20:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

Recent research has developed a deep feature collaboration network\nwhich simultaneously incorporates intermediate features from deep neural\nnetworks with multiple scales. However, this approach results in a large\nfeature dimension, and the trained classification layer is required for\ncomparing probe samples, which limits the introduction of new classes. This\npaper advances this approach by investigating the possibility of learning a\ndiscriminative feature vector with the least possible dimension for\nrepresenting 3D finger knuckle images. Experimental results are presented using\na publicly available 3D finger knuckle images database with comparisons to\npopular deep learning architectures and the state-of-the-art 3D finger knuckle\nrecognition methods. The proposed approach offers outperforming results in\nclassification and identification tasks under the more practical feature\ncomparison scenario, i.e., using the extracted deep feature instead of the\ntrained classification layer for comparing probe samples. More importantly,\nthis approach can offer 99% reduction in the size of feature templates, which\nis highly attractive for deploying biometric systems in the real world.\nExperiments are also performed using other two public biometric databases with\nsimilar patterns to ascertain the effectiveness and generalizability of our\nproposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 20:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Specifically, we show that the quantile autoregression\n(QAR) estimates for non-causal processes do not remain constant across\ndifferent quantiles in contrast to their causal counterparts. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that non-causal autoregressive processes admit nonlinear\nrepresentations for conditional quantiles given past observations. Exploiting\nthese properties, we propose three novel testing strategies of non-causality\nfor non-Gaussian processes within the QAR framework. The tests are constructed\neither by verifying the constancy of the slope coefficients or by applying a\nmisspecification test of the linear QAR model over different quantiles of the\nprocess. Some numerical experiments are included to examine the finite sample\nperformance of the testing strategies, where we compare different specification\ntests for dynamic quantiles with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov constancy test. The new\nmethodology is applied to some time series from financial markets to\ninvestigate the presence of speculative bubbles. The extension of the approach\nbased on the specification tests to AR processes driven by innovations with\nheteroskedasticity is studied through simulations.

A\nmajor open question is the relationship between molecular transport,\nthermodynamic state, and chemical structure of the penetrant and polymeric\nmedia. Here we address this question by combining experiment, simulation, and\ntheory to unravel the competing effects of penetrant chemistry on its transport\nin rubbery and supercooled polymer permanent networks over a wide range of\ncrosslink densities, size ratios, and temperatures. The crucial importance of\nthe coupling of local penetrant hopping to the polymer structural relaxation\nprocess, and the secondary importance of geometric mesh confinement effects,\nare established. Network crosslinks induce a large slowing down of nm-scale\npolymer relaxation which greatly retards the rate of penetrant activated\nrelaxation.

Numerical simulations of systems of such molecules reveal\nthat the structure of the resulting hydrogen-bond chains depends on the\nisomeric composition of the molecules. If all molecules are homochiral (i.e.\nonly one isomer is present), they form secondary structures (chains of hydrogen\nbonds in the shapes of arcs, circles, and spirals).

If the reward-worthy behavior is known, it can be\nspecified in terms of a non-Markovian reward function - a function that depends\non aspects of the state-action history, rather than just the current state and\naction. Such reward functions yield sparse rewards, necessitating an inordinate\nnumber of experiences to find a policy that captures the reward-worthy pattern\nof behavior. Recent work has leveraged Knowledge Representation (KR) to provide\na symbolic abstraction of aspects of the state that summarize reward-relevant\nproperties of the state-action history and support learning a Markovian\ndecomposition of the problem in terms of an automaton over the KR. Providing\nsuch a decomposition has been shown to vastly improve learning rates,\nespecially when coupled with algorithms that exploit automaton structure.\nNevertheless, such techniques rely on a priori knowledge of the KR. In this\nwork, we explore how to automatically discover useful state abstractions that\nsupport learning automata over the state-action history.

The concept of the Continuously Habitable Zone (CHZ) has\nbeen used to define the region around a star most likely to host planets with\nlong-term habitability. However, definitions of the CHZ vary in the literature\nand often conflict with each other. Calculating the fraction of habitable zone\nplanets in the CHZ as a function of stellar properties, we find that the\nquality of a star as a host for planets with long-term habitability and\nbiosignatures depends strongly on the formulation of the CHZ used. For\ninstance, older M stars are either excellent or sub-optimal hosts for CHZ\nplanets, depending on whether one's definition of habitability prioritizes the\ntotal time spent in the habitable zone or the continuity of habitable\nconditions from the delivery of volatiles to its current age. In this study, we\nfocus on Belatedly Habitable Zone (BHZ) planets, i.e. planets which enter the\nhabitable zone after formation due to the evolution of their host star. We find\nthat between ~29-74% of planets in the habitable zone belong to this class of\nBHZ planets depending on the timescale for the delivery of volatiles. Whether\nthese planets can retain their volatiles and support habitable conditions is\nunclear. Since BHZ planets comprise a large portion of the planets we expect to\nsurvey for biosignatures with future missions, the open question of their\nhabitability is an important factor for mission design, survey strategies, and\nthe interpretation of results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 02:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

In this paper, we focus on the small-scale spatial correlation and\neigenvalue properties excluding and including MC effects, for RISs with a\nquasi-continuous aperture (i.e., holographic RISs). Specifically, asymptotic\nbehaviors of far-field and near-field eigenvalues of the spatial correlation\nmatrix of holographic RISs without MC are first investigated, where the\ncounter-intuitive observation of a lower DoF with more elements is explained by\nleveraging the power spectrum of the spatial correlation function.

The coupled solver with AMR is rigorously validated for a liquid\njet in crossflow at varying operating conditions. We have further carried out a\nthorough investigation to study the effect of momentum flux ratio and weber\nnumber on the various flow features and liquid jet break-up phenomenon in a\ncrossflow while identifying the stream-wise location of the liquid jet breakup\nregion. At low momentum flux ratios in the bag breakup regime, the predictions\nreveal that the liquid jet breakup occurs due to the growth of similar\ninstability as usually observed in the high-speed liquid sheet atomization.

In order to extract cosmological information\nfrom next-generation weak lensing surveys (e.g., Euclid, Roman, LSST, and CSST)\nas much as possible, accurate measurements of weak lensing shear are required.\nIn this work, we present a fully deep-learning-based approach to measuring weak\nlensing shear accurately. Our approach comprises two modules. The first one\ncontains a CNN with two branches for taking galaxy images and PSF\nsimultaneously, and the output of this module includes the galaxy's magnitude,\nsize, and shape. The second module includes a multiple-layer Neural Network to\ncalibrate weak lensing shear measurements. We name the program Forklens and\nmake it publicly available online. Applying Forklens to CSST-like mock images,\nwe achieve consistent accuracy with traditional approaches (such as\nmoment-based measurement and forward model fitting) on the sources with high\nsignal-to-noise ratios (S/N). For the sources with meagre S/N, Forklens\nexhibits powerful latent denoising ability and offers accurate predictions on\ngalaxy shapes. The final shear measurements with Forklens deliver a\nmultiplicative bias $m=-0.4\\pm3.0\\times10^{-3}$ and an additive bias\n$c=-0.5\\pm1.9\\times10^{-4}$. Our tests with CSST-like simulation show that\nForklens is competitive with other shear measurement algorithms such as\nMetacalibration, while Forklens can potentially lower the S/N limit. Moreover,\nthe whole procedure of Forklens is automated and costs about 0.6 milliseconds\nper galaxy, which is appropriate to adequately take advantage of the sky\ncoverage and depth of the upcoming weak lensing surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 05:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

This\nstudy addresses the following questions: (i) What is the role of the\nnon-Gaussian statistics of the turbulent velocity gradient on polymer\nstretching? (ii) How does the p.d.f. of $R$ evolve to its asymptotic stationary\nform? Our analysis is based on simulations of the dynamics of\nfinitely-extensible bead-spring dumbbells and chains, in the extremely dilute\nlimit, that are transported in a homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow, as\nwell as in a Gaussian random flow. First, we recall the large deviations theory\nof polymer stretching, and illustrate its application. Then, we compare polymer\nstretching in turbulent and Gaussian random flows and show that while\nextreme-valued strain rates aid in stretching small-$Wi$ stiff polymers, they\nare unimportant for high-$Wi$ polymers, which instead are stretched by the\ncumulative action of moderate strain-rates. This result is supported by an\nanalysis of the persistence time of polymers in stretched states. Next,\nbeginning from a distribution of coiled polymers, we find that the p.d.f. of\n$R$ has the form of an evolving power-law, for low to moderate $Wi$, though\nthis is not the case at high $Wi$. In either case, the p.d.f. relaxes to its\nstationary form exponentially.

In this work, we propose DeepMatcher, a deep Transformer-based network\nbuilt upon our investigation of local feature matching in detector-free\nmethods. The key insight is that local feature matcher with deep layers can\ncapture more human-intuitive and simpler-to-match features. Based on this, we\npropose a Slimming Transformer (SlimFormer) dedicated for DeepMatcher, which\nleverages vector-based attention to model relevance among all keypoints and\nachieves long-range context aggregation in an efficient and effective manner. A\nrelative position encoding is applied to each SlimFormer so as to explicitly\ndisclose relative distance information, further improving the representation of\nkeypoints. A layer-scale strategy is also employed in each SlimFormer to enable\nthe network to assimilate message exchange from the residual block adaptively,\nthus allowing it to simulate the human behaviour that humans can acquire\ndifferent matching cues each time they scan an image pair. To facilitate a\nbetter adaption of the SlimFormer, we introduce a Feature Transition Module\n(FTM) to ensure a smooth transition in feature scopes with different receptive\nfields. By interleaving the self- and cross-SlimFormer multiple times,\nDeepMatcher can easily establish pixel-wise dense matches at coarse level.\nFinally, we perceive the match refinement as a combination of classification\nand regression problems and design Fine Matches Module to predict confidence\nand offset concurrently, thereby generating robust and accurate matches.\nExperimentally, we show that DeepMatcher significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating the superior\nmatching capability of DeepMatcher.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 07:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

In order to systematically study late infall of gas onto disks, we\nidentify candidate Class II sources in close vicinity to a reflection nebula\n(RN) that may be undergoing this process.\n  Methods. First we targeted Class II sources with known kilo-au scale gas\nstructures - possibly due to late infall of material - and we searched for RNe\nin their vicinity in optical and near-infrared images. Second, we compiled a\ncatalogue of Class II sources associated with RNe and looked for the\nlarge-scale CO structures in archival ALMA data. Using the catalogues of\nprotostars and RNe, we also estimated the probability of Class II sources\ninteracting with surrounding material.\n  Results. All of the sources with large-scale gas structures also exhibit some\nreflection nebulosity in their vicinity.

Our results suggest that a non-negligible fraction of Class II\ndisks in nearby star-forming regions may be associated with RNe and could\ntherefore be undergoing late accretion of gas.

In fact, in situations with\nsmall-to-moderate sample size, even simple parametric models often yield\nposterior distributions which are far from resembling a Gaussian shape, mainly\ndue to skewness. In this article, we provide rigorous theoretical arguments for\nsuch a behavior by deriving a novel limiting law that coincides with a\nclosed-form and tractable skewed generalization of Gaussian densities, and\nyields a total variation distance from the exact posterior whose convergence\nrate crucially improves by a $\\sqrt{n}$ factor the one obtained under the\nclassical Bernstein-von Mises theorem based on limiting Gaussians.

This further motivates a practical plug-in version\nwhich replaces the unknown model parameters with the corresponding MAP estimate\nto obtain a novel skew-modal approximation achieving the same improved rate of\nconvergence of its population counterpart. Extensive quantitative studies\nconfirm that our new theory closely matches the empirical behavior observed in\npractice even in finite, possibly small, sample regimes.

Most of the conventional optimization and deep\nlearning techniques explore local information for reconstruction. Recently,\nnonlocal low-rank (NLR) reconstruction has achieved remarkable success in\nimproving accuracy and generalization. However, the computational cost has\ninhibited NLR from seeking global structural similarity, which consequentially\nkeeps it trapped in the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency and prevents\nit from high-dimensional large-scale tasks. To address this challenge, we\nreport here the global low-rank (GLR) optimization technique, realizing\nhighly-efficient large-scale reconstruction with global self-similarity.\nInspired by the self-attention mechanism in deep learning, GLR extracts\nexemplar image patches by feature detection instead of conventional uniform\nselection. This directly produces key patches using structural features to\navoid burdensome computational redundancy. Further, it performs patch matching\nacross the entire image via neural-based convolution, which produces the global\nsimilarity heat map in parallel, rather than conventional sequential block-wise\nmatching. As such, GLR improves patch grouping efficiency by more than one\norder of magnitude. We experimentally demonstrate GLR's effectiveness on\ntemporal, frequency, and spectral dimensions, including different computational\nimaging modalities of compressive temporal imaging, magnetic resonance imaging,\nand multispectral filter array demosaicing.

To address this, a growing cadre of professional fact-checkers\nand journalists provide high-quality investigations into purported facts.\nHowever, these largely manual efforts have struggled to match the enormous\nscale of the problem. In response, a growing body of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) technologies have been proposed for more scalable\nfact-checking. Despite tremendous growth in such research, however, practical\nadoption of NLP technologies for fact-checking still remains in its infancy\ntoday.\n  In this work, we review the capabilities and limitations of the current NLP\ntechnologies for fact-checking. Our particular focus is to further chart the\ndesign space for how these technologies can be harnessed and refined in order\nto better meet the needs of human fact-checkers. To do so, we review key\naspects of NLP-based fact-checking: task formulation, dataset construction,\nmodeling, and human-centered strategies, such as explainable models and\nhuman-in-the-loop approaches. Next, we review the efficacy of applying\nNLP-based fact-checking tools to assist human fact-checkers. We recommend that\nfuture research include collaboration with fact-checker stakeholders early on\nin NLP research, as well as incorporation of human-centered design practices in\nmodel development, in order to further guide technology development for human\nuse and practical adoption. Finally, we advocate for more research on benchmark\ndevelopment supporting extrinsic evaluation of human-centered fact-checking\ntechnologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 15:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Existing defenses perform passive analysis to detect fake content.\nHowever, with the rapid progress of deepfake quality, this may be a losing\ngame.\n  In this paper, we propose D-CAPTCHA: an active defense against real-time\ndeepfakes. The approach is to force the adversary into the spotlight by\nchallenging the deepfake model to generate content which exceeds its\ncapabilities. By doing so, passive detection becomes easier since the content\nwill be distorted. In contrast to existing CAPTCHAs, we challenge the AI's\nability to create content as opposed to its ability to classify content.

The HOI instance has a greater span in spatial,\nscale, and task than the individual object instance, making its detection more\nsusceptible to noisy backgrounds. To alleviate the disturbance of noisy\nbackgrounds on HOI detection, it is necessary to consider the input image\ninformation to generate fine-grained anchors which are then leveraged to guide\nthe detection of HOI instances. However, it is challenging for the following\nreasons. i) how to extract pivotal features from the images with complex\nbackground information is still an open question. ii) how to semantically align\nthe extracted features and query embeddings is also a difficult issue. In this\npaper, a novel end-to-end transformer-based framework (FGAHOI) is proposed to\nalleviate the above problems. FGAHOI comprises three dedicated components\nnamely, multi-scale sampling (MSS), hierarchical spatial-aware merging (HSAM)\nand task-aware merging mechanism (TAM). MSS extracts features of humans,\nobjects and interaction areas from noisy backgrounds for HOI instances of\nvarious scales.

The two heuristics have different ways of ensuring\ndiversification. The heuristics can be implemented for solving the stowage\nplanning problem. The stowage planning problem occurs every time a vessel is\nloaded. The idea is to stow the cargo in an optimal manner satisfying a set of\nconstraints and specifically the stability constraints. An optimal plan can be\nto assign the cargo to spots on the vessel so that the vessel trim and draft\nare optimized ensuring a low fuel consumption. Here the problem considered is\nthe stowage planning of trailers on a Roll-on/Roll-off vessel. Roll-on/Roll-off\nvessels carries vehicles or trailers on the different levels of the vessel.\nWhen making a stowage plan of a vessel ballast tanks can be adjusted to improve\nstability and to change draft. This leads to stability constraints which can be\nvery complex to model and solve using a mixed integer model and solver.\nComplicating constraints occur in many different applications and different\nforms and are the cause of the popularity of search algorithms, such as tabu\nsearch and simulated annealing, for solving real-life applications. Results of\nthe two meta-heuristics are shown for real-life stowage planning cases for\nRoll-on/Roll-off vessels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 17:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

To render their practical applications as OLED\nemitters, it is in great need to develop Pt(II) complexes with high radiative\ndecay rate constant ($k_r$) and photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield. Thus, an\nefficient and accurate prediction tool is highly desirable. Here, we develop a\ngeneral protocol for accurate predictions of emission wavelength, radiative\ndecay rate constant, and PL quantum yield for phosphorescent Pt(II) emitters\nbased on the combination of first-principles quantum mechanical method, machine\nlearning (ML) and experimental calibration. A new dataset concerning\nphosphorescent Pt(II) emitters is constructed, with more than two hundred\nsamples collected from the literature. Features containing pertinent electronic\nproperties of the complexes are chosen. Our results demonstrate that ensemble\nlearning models combined with stacking-based approaches exhibit the best\nperformance, where the values of squared correlation coefficients ($R^2$), mean\nabsolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.96, 7.21 nm and\n13.00 nm for emission wavelength prediction, and 0.81, 0.11 and 0.15 for PL\nquantum yield prediction. For radiative decay rate constant ($k_r$), the\nobtained value of $R^2$ is 0.67 while MAE and RMSE are 0.21 and 0.25 (both in\nlog scale), respectively. The accuracy of the protocol is further confirmed\nusing 24 recently reported Pt(II) complexes, which demonstrates its reliability\nfor a broad palette of Pt(II) emitters.We expect this protocol will become a\nvaluable tool, accelerating the rational design of novel OLED materials with\ndesired properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 04:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

Sample\ntortuosity, thermal conductivity, and thermal source strength are estimated\nfrom fitting an analytical solution to temperature observations during a single\nlaboratory test. The closed-form analytical solution is derived using Green's\nfunctions for heat conduction in the limit of \"slow\" water movement; that is,\nwhen advection of thermal energy with the wetting front is negligible. The\nsolution has four free fitting parameters and is efficient for parameter\nestimation. Laboratory imbibition data used to constrain the model include a\ntime series of the mass of water imbibed, visual location of the wetting front\nthrough time, and temperature time series at six locations. The thermal front\nreached the end of the core hours before the visible wetting front. Thus, the\npredominant form of heating during imbibition in this zeolitic tuff is due to\nvapor adsorption in dry zeolitic rock ahead of the wetting front. The\nseparation of the wetting front and thermal front in this zeolitic tuff is\nsignificant, compared to wetting front behavior of most materials reported in\nthe literature. This work is the first interpretation of a thermal imbibition\nresponse to estimate transport (tortuosity) and thermal properties (including\nthermal conductivity) from a single laboratory test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 17:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}
