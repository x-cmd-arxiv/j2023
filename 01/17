The policy uses a unique combination of input data to generate\nthe desired steering angle and forward velocity: a short history of lidar data,\nkinematic data about nearby pedestrians, and a sub-goal point. The policy is\ntrained in a reinforcement learning setting using a reward function that\ncontains a novel term based on velocity obstacles to guide the robot to\nactively avoid pedestrians and move towards the goal. Through a series of 3D\nsimulated experiments with up to 55 pedestrians, this control policy is able to\nachieve a better balance between collision avoidance and speed (i.e., higher\nsuccess rate and faster average speed) than state-of-the-art model-based and\nlearning-based policies, and it also generalizes better to different crowd\nsizes and unseen environments.

The proposal considers the sparsity of the representation\nof a heartbeat as a parameter for morphological identification. The approach\ninvolves greedy algorithms for selecting elements from redundant dictionaries,\nwhich should be previously learnt from examples of the classes to be\nidentified. Using different metrics of sparsity, the dictionary rendering the\nsmallest sparsity value, for the equivalent approximation quality of a new\nheartbeat, classifies the morphology of that beat.

The change in the longitudinal momentum spectrum can occur due to the\nquantum interference effect, and this quantum interference effect comes from\nthe result of dynamical tunneling. The transverse momentum spectrum shows the\nGaussian structure with a peak at zero transverse momentum when $t = 0$. After\n$t \\approx \\tau/2$, the smooth Gaussian design becomes distorted, and we see\ninconstancy in spectrum structure, either a dip at the origin with an off-axis\nmaximum or a peak at zero transverse momentum with small mountains up to $t\n\\approx 2{\\tau}$ observed. After that, the spectrum shows a maximum height at\nzero transverse momentum with weakly pronounced peaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 18:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

For all\nmodels, steady-state BHL accretion solutions are attained that are\ncharacterized by the presence of a shock-cone and a stagnation point\ndownstream. For the models of the sample with the largest component of scalar\nfield, the shock-cone envelops fully the black hole, transitioning into a\nbow-shock, and the stagnation points move further away downstream. Analytical\nexpressions for the mass accretion rates are derived, which can be used to\nanalyze black-hole formation scenarios in the presence of ultralight scalar\nfields. The formation of a shock-cone leads to regions where sound waves can be\ntrapped and resonant oscillations excited. We measure the frequencies of such\nquasi-periodic oscillations and point out a possible association with\nquasi-periodic oscillations in the X-ray light curve of Sgr~A* and\nmicroquasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 19:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 09:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

One of their most\npromising EM signatures is the lightcurve modulation caused by a strong, unique\nand extended azimuthal overdensity structure orbiting at the inner edge of the\ncircumbinary disc (CBD), dubbed \"lump\". In this paper, we investigate the\norigin of this structure using 2D general-relativistic (GR) hydrodynamical\nsimulations of a CBD in an approximate BBH spacetime. First, we use the\nsymmetric mass-ratio case to study the transition from the natural m = 2 mode\nto m = 1. The asymmetry with respect to m = 2 grows exponentially, pointing to\nan instability origin. We indeed find that the CBD edge is prone to a\n(magneto-)hydrodynamical instability owing to the disc edge density sharpness:\nthe Rossby Wave Instability (RWI). The RWI criterion is naturally fullfilled at\nthe CBD edge and we report the presence of vortices, which are typical\nstructures of the RWI. The RWI is also at work in the asymmetric mass-ratio\ncases (from 0.1 to 0.5). However, the CBD edge sharpness decreases with a\ndecreasing mass ratio, and so the lump. By proposing a scenario for this lump\nformation, our work further supports its existence in astrophysical CBDs and\npotential source for an EM signature of BBHs. Finally, because the RWI is not\ncaused by GR effects, it is also a robust candidate for the lump origin in CBDs\naround non-compact objects, e.g. binary protostars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 19:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

The diversity of communication\nprotocols and hardware creates a problematic case, since this diversity\nrequires to design or update the calibration procedures for each new advanced\nantenna system. In this study, we formulate antenna calibration in an\nalternative way, namely as a task of functional approximation, and address it\nvia Bayesian machine learning. Our contributions are three-fold. Firstly, we\ndefine a parameter space, based on near-field measurements, that captures the\nunderlying hardware impairments corresponding to each radiating element, their\npositional offsets, as well as the mutual coupling effects between antenna\nelements. Secondly, Gaussian process regression is used to form models from a\nsparse set of the aforementioned near-field data. Once deployed, the learned\nnon-parametric models effectively serve to continuously transform the\nbeamforming weights of the system, resulting in corrected beam patterns.\nLastly, we demonstrate the viability of the described methodology for both\ndigital and analog beamforming antenna arrays of different scales and discuss\nits further extension to support real-time operation with dynamic hardware\nimpairments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 19:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 14:51:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 14:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

To achieve control over the target shape, two different concepts\nare coupled. First, motivated by biological growth, strain mismatch is applied\nbetween the flat composite layers to transform it into a 3D shape. Depending on\nthe amount of the applied strain mismatch, the transformation involves buckling\ninto one of the available finite number of mode shapes. Second, inspired by\nkirigami, portions of the material are removed from one of the layers according\nto a specific pattern. This dramatically increases the number of possible 3D\nshapes and allows us to attain specific topologies. We devise an experimental\napparatus that allows precise control of the strain mismatch. An inverse\nproblem is posed, where starting from a given target shape, the physical\nparameters that make these shapes possible are determined.

In the last few years, there has been a considerable interest in\nadapting machine learning algorithms to the problem of estimating heterogeneous\neffects from observational and experimental data. However, these algorithms\noften make strong assumptions about the observed features in the data and\nignore the structure of the underlying causal model, which can lead to biased\nestimation. At the same time, the underlying causal mechanism is rarely known\nin real-world datasets, making it hard to take it into consideration. In this\nwork, we provide a survey of state-of-the-art data-driven methods for\nheterogeneous treatment effect estimation using machine learning, broadly\ncategorizing them as methods that focus on counterfactual prediction and\nmethods that directly estimate the causal effect. We also provide an overview\nof a third category of methods which rely on structural causal models and learn\nthe model structure from data. Our empirical evaluation under various\nunderlying structural model mechanisms shows the advantages and deficiencies of\nexisting estimators and of the metrics for measuring their performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 21:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

In the\npresence of consumer social awareness (CSA), the manufacturer notices consumers\nthrough some activities (i.e. labelling) that he participates in a CRM campaign\nby donating a proportion of the retail price to a cause whenever a consumer\nmakes a purchase. In this study, the market demand depends on the retail price,\nthe retailer's stock level and donation size. The proposed problem is designed\nunder three decision-making systems.

Then,\nthe problem is designed under a centralized decision-making system to obtain\nthe best values of the retail price and replenishment decisions from the entire\nSC perspective.

Active learning addresses such\neffort by prioritizing which samples are best to annotate in order to maximize\nthe performance of the task model. While frameworks for active learning have\nbeen widely explored in the context of classification of natural images, they\nhave been only sparsely used in medical image segmentation. The challenge\nresides in obtaining an uncertainty measure that reveals the best candidate\ndata for annotation. This paper proposes Test-time Augmentation for Active\nLearning (TAAL), a novel semi-supervised active learning approach for\nsegmentation that exploits the uncertainty information offered by data\ntransformations. Our method applies cross-augmentation consistency during\ntraining and inference to both improve model learning in a semi-supervised\nfashion and identify the most relevant unlabeled samples to annotate next. In\naddition, our consistency loss uses a modified version of the JSD to further\nimprove model performance. By relying on data transformations rather than on\nexternal modules or simple heuristics typically used in uncertainty-based\nstrategies, TAAL emerges as a simple, yet powerful task-agnostic\nsemi-supervised active learning approach applicable to the medical domain.

In line with this distinction, LLMs show impressive (although\nimperfect) performance on tasks requiring formal linguistic competence, but\nfail on many tests requiring functional competence. Based on this evidence, we\nargue that (1) contemporary LLMs should be taken seriously as models of formal\nlinguistic skills; (2) models that master real-life language use would need to\nincorporate or develop not only a core language module, but also multiple\nnon-language-specific cognitive capacities required for modeling thought.\nOverall, a distinction between formal and functional linguistic competence\nhelps clarify the discourse surrounding LLMs' potential and provides a path\ntoward building models that understand and use language in human-like ways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 22:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Nevertheless, a significant\ncontribution of this paper is to establish the convergence rate of regular\nsequence to nonsmooth loss that answers a call from the relevant literature.\nFor parameter estimation where objective function may be nonsmooth, this paper\nfirst shows as a general paradigm that how generalized function approach can be\nused to tackle the nonsmooth loss functions in Section two using a very simple\nmodel. This approach is of general interest and applicability. We further use\nthe approach in robust M-estimation for additive single-index cointegrating\ntime series models; the asymptotic theory is established for the proposed\nestimators.

We\nexamine the existence of the first overtone in GW150914 from multiple novel\nperspectives. First, we confirm that the estimates of the remnant black hole\nmass and spin are more consistent with those obtained from the full IMR signal\nwhen including the first overtone at an early stage of the ringdown (right\nafter the inferred signal peak); such improvement fades away at later times.\nSecond, we formulate a new way to compare the ringdown models with and without\nthe first overtone by calculating the Bayes factor at different times during\nthe ringdown. We obtain a Bayes factor of 600 at the time when the signal\namplitude reaches its peak. The Bayes factor decreases sharply when moving away\nfrom the peak time and eventually oscillates around a small value when the\novertone signal is expected to have decayed. Third, we clean the fundamental\nmode from the ringdown of GW150914 and estimate the amplitudes of the modes\nusing the filtered data with MCMC. The inferred amplitude of the fundamental\nmode is ~0 whereas the amplitude of the first overtone remains almost\nunchanged, implying that the filtered data is consistent with a\nfirst-overtone-only template. Similarly, if we remove the first overtone from\nthe GW150914 data, the filtered data are consistent with a\nfundamental-mode-only template. Finally, after removing the fundamental mode,\nwe use MCMC to infer the remnant black hole mass and spin from the first\novertone alone.

However, multiple challenges remain to\nbe addressed for deploying FL in real-world Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks\nwith hierarchies. Although existing works have proposed various approaches to\naccount data heterogeneity, system heterogeneity, unexpected stragglers and\nscalibility, none of them provides a systematic solution to address all of the\nchallenges in a hierarchical and unreliable IoT network. In this paper, we\npropose an asynchronous and hierarchical framework (Async-HFL) for performing\nFL in a common three-tier IoT network architecture. In response to the largely\nvaried delays, Async-HFL employs asynchronous aggregations at both the gateway\nand the cloud levels thus avoids long waiting time. To fully unleash the\npotential of Async-HFL in converging speed under system heterogeneities and\nstragglers, we design device selection at the gateway level and device-gateway\nassociation at the cloud level. Device selection chooses edge devices to\ntrigger local training in real-time while device-gateway association determines\nthe network topology periodically after several cloud epochs, both satisfying\nbandwidth limitation. We evaluate Async-HFL's convergence speedup using\nlarge-scale simulations based on ns-3 and a network topology from NYCMesh. Our\nresults show that Async-HFL converges 1.08-1.31x faster in wall-clock time and\nsaves up to 21.6% total communication cost compared to state-of-the-art\nasynchronous FL algorithms (with client selection).

We revisit a semi-oblivious approach to this problem: each\nsource-destination pair is assigned a small set of predefined paths before the\ndemand is revealed, while the sending rates along the paths can be optimally\nadapted to the demand. This approach has been considered in practice in network\ntraffic engineering due to its superior robustness and performance as compared\nto both oblivious routing and traditional traffic engineering approaches.\n  We show the existence of sparse semi-oblivious routings: only $O(\\log n)$\npaths are selected between each pair of vertices. The routing is $(poly \\log\nn)$-competitive for all demands against the offline-optimal congestion\nobjective. Even for the well-studied case of hypercubes, no such result was\nknown: our deterministic and oblivious selection of $O(\\log n)$ paths is the\nfirst simple construction of a deterministic oblivious structure that\nnear-optimally assigns source-destination pairs to few routes. Our results\ncontrast the current solely-negative landscape of results for semi-oblivious\nrouting. We give the sparsity-competitiveness trade-off for lower sparsities\nand nearly match it with a lower bound.\n  Our construction is extremely simple: Sample the few paths from any\ncompetitive oblivious routing. Indeed, this natural construction was used in\ntraffic engineering as an unproven heuristic.

The problem becomes more\nchallenging when data of different clients are non-IID, since it is\nunreasonable to learn a global graph for heterogeneous data. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel framework in which a personalized graph for each\nclient and a consensus graph are jointly learned in a federated fashion.\nSpecifically, we commute model updates instead of raw data to the central\nserver in the proposed federated algorithm. A provable convergence analysis\nshows that the algorithm enjoys $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate.

These tags have two\ncharacteristics: i) they are numbered to help the photographer for placement of\ntags in sequence and; ii) bi-colored, which allows better learning of tag\ndetection (using YOLOv5 architecture) in an image and digit recognition (using\ncustom MobileNet architecture) tasks. Finally, we link/connect all the\nequirectangular images based on detected tags. We show the efficiency of the\nproposed pipeline on a real-world equirectangular image dataset collected from\nthe Housing.com database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 03:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Recently, deep learning has been used to reconstruct the PA\nimage with a supervised scheme, which requires high-quality images as ground\ntruth labels. In practice, there are inevitable trade-offs between cost and\nperformance since the use of more channels is an expensive strategy to access\nmore measurements. Here, we propose a cross-domain unsupervised reconstruction\n(CDUR) strategy with a pure transformer model, which overcomes the lack of\nground truth labels from limited PA measurements. The proposed approach\nexploits the equivariance of PACT to achieve high performance with a smaller\nnumber of channels. We implement a self-supervised reconstruction in a\nmodel-based form. Meanwhile, we also leverage the self-supervision to enforce\nthe measurement and image consistency on three partitions of measured PA data,\nby randomly masking different channels. We find that dynamically masking a high\nproportion of the channels, e.g., 80%, yields nontrivial self-supervisors in\nboth image and signal domains, which decrease the multiplicity of the pseudo\nsolution to efficiently reconstruct the image from fewer PA measurements with\nminimum error of the image. Experimental results on in-vivo PACT dataset of\nmice demonstrate the potential of our unsupervised framework. In addition, our\nmethod shows a high performance (0.83 structural similarity index (SSIM) in the\nextreme sparse case with 13 channels), which is close to that of supervised\nscheme (0.77 SSIM with 16 channels). On top of all the advantages, our method\nmay be deployed on different trainable models in an end-to-end manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 03:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

This inherent one-to-many\nrelationship makes co-speech gesture generation from audio particularly\nchallenging. Conventional CNNs/RNNs assume one-to-one mapping, and thus tend to\npredict the average of all possible target motions, easily resulting in\nplain/boring motions during inference. So we propose to explicitly model the\none-to-many audio-to-motion mapping by splitting the cross-modal latent code\ninto shared code and motion-specific code. The shared code is expected to be\nresponsible for the motion component that is more correlated to the audio while\nthe motion-specific code is expected to capture diverse motion information that\nis more independent of the audio.

A mismatch between\nelectronic energy gaps and phonon frequencies in NCs has led to the hypothesis\nof a phonon bottleneck, in which cooling would be extremely slow, while\nenhanced electron-hole interactions in NCs have been used to explain cooling\nthat would occur on ultrafast timescales.

In contrast, robots can not perform reactive\nmanipulation and they mostly operate in open-loop while interacting with their\nenvironment. Consequently, the current manipulation algorithms either are\ninefficient in performance or can only work in highly structured environments.\nIn this paper, we present closed-loop control of a complex manipulation task\nwhere a robot uses a tool to interact with objects. Manipulation using a tool\nleads to complex kinematics and contact constraints that need to be satisfied\nfor generating feasible manipulation trajectories. We first present an\nopen-loop controller design using Non-Linear Programming (NLP) that satisfies\nthese constraints. In order to design a closed-loop controller, we present a\npose estimator of objects and tools using tactile sensors. Using our tactile\nestimator, we design a closed-loop controller based on Model Predictive Control\n(MPC). The proposed algorithm is verified using a 6 DoF manipulator on tasks\nusing a variety of objects and tools. We verify that our closed-loop controller\ncan successfully perform tool manipulation under several unexpected contacts.\nVideo summarizing this work and hardware experiments are found\nhttps://youtu.be/VsClK04qDhk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 04:24:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 15:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

Recently, learning-based algorithms achieve huge success in depth\nestimation by training models with a large amount of data in a supervised\nmanner. However, it is challenging to acquire dense ground truth depth labels\nfor supervised training, and the unsupervised depth estimation using monocular\nsequences emerges as a promising alternative. Unfortunately, most studies on\nunsupervised depth estimation explore loss functions or occlusion masks, and\nthere is little change in model architecture in that ConvNet-based\nencoder-decoder structure becomes a de-facto standard for depth estimation. In\nthis paper, we employ a convolution-free Swin Transformer as an image feature\nextractor so that the network can capture both local geometric features and\nglobal semantic features for depth estimation.

This densely\ncascaded connectivity reinforces the interconnection between decoding layers\nand produces high-quality multi-scale depth outputs. The experiments on two\ndifferent datasets, KITTI and Make3D, demonstrate that our proposed method\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 06:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

A straight path\nto evaluate the viability of the reassembly of the Schenberg antenna is to\nverify the possibility of detecting gravitational wave (GW) signals within its\ndesign sensitivity features. The eventual identification of significant signals\nwould operate as motivation for the Schenberg rebuild. As the antenna was\ndismantled, we can get some indication from the third observing run (O3) data\nof the LIGO detectors. It is based on the similarity between Schenberg\nsensitivity and the sensitivity of the interferometers in the O3 [3150-3260] Hz\nband. We search for signals with milliseconds to a few seconds without making\nassumptions about their morphology, polarization, and arrival sky direction.\nThe data were analyzed with the coherent WaveBurst pipeline (cWB) with\nfrequencies from 512 Hz to 4096 Hz and the search targets only signals with\nbandwidth overlapping the Schenberg frequency band. No statistically\nsignificant evidence of GW bursts during O3 was found. The null result was used\nto feature the search efficiency in identifying different simulated signal\nmorphologies and establish upper limits on the GW burst event rate as a\nfunction of its strain amplitude.

It is however unclear whether these\nhuman-defined stages can be re-discovered with unsupervised methods of data\nanalysis, using only a minimal amount of generic pre-processing. Based on EEG\ndata, recorded overnight from sleeping human subjects, we investigate the\ndegree of clustering of the sleep stages using the General Discrimination Value\nas a quantitative measure of class separability. Virtually no clustering is\nfound in the raw data, even after transforming the EEG signals of each\nthirty-second epoch from the time domain into the more informative frequency\ndomain. However, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of these epoch-wise\nfrequency spectra reveals that the sleep stages separate significantly better\nin the low-dimensional sub-space of certain PCA components. In particular the\ncomponent $C_1(t)$ can serve as a robust, continuous 'master variable' that\nencodes the depth of sleep and therefore correlates strongly with the\n'hypnogram', a common plot of the discrete sleep stages over time. Moreover,\n$C_1(t)$ shows persistent trends during extended time periods where the sleep\nstage is constant, suggesting that sleep may be better understood as a\ncontinuum. These intriguing properties of $C_1(t)$ are not only relevant for\nunderstanding brain dynamics during sleep, but might also be exploited in\nlow-cost single-channel sleep tracking devices for private and clinical use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 08:39:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

In this context, lean H2-air flames show\npromising features but, among other characteristics, they tend to exhibit\nthermo-diffusive instabilities. The formation of cellular structures associated\nwith these instabilities leads to an increased flame surface area which further\npromotes the flame propagation speed, an important reference quantity for\ndesign, control, and safe operation of technical combustors. While many studies\nhave addressed the physical phenomena of intrinsic flame instabilities in the\npast, there is also a demand to predict such flame characteristics with\nreduced-order models to allow computationally efficient simulations. In this\nwork, a H2-air spherical expanding flame, which exhibits thermo-diffusive\ninstabilities, is studied with flamelet-based modeling approaches both in\na-priori and a-posteriori manner. A recently proposed Flamelet/Progress\nVariable (FPV) model, with a manifold based on unstretched planar flames, and a\nnovel FPV approach, which takes into account a large curvature variation in the\ntabulated manifold, are compared to detailed chemistry (DC) calculations.\nFirst, both FPV approaches are assessed in terms of an a-priori test with the\nDC reference dataset. Thereafter, the a-posteriori assessment contains two\nparts: a linear stability analysis of perturbed planar flames and the\nsimulation of the spherical expanding flame. Both FPV models are systematically\nanalyzed considering global and local flame properties in comparison to the DC\nreference data. It is shown that the new FPV model, incorporating large\ncurvature variations in the manifold, leads to improved predictions for the\nmicrostructure of the corrugated flame front and the formation of cellular\nstructures, while global flame properties are reasonably well reproduced by\nboth models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 10:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

A\nrecently-introduced framework, named \\emph{maximum submodular ranking} (MSR),\ntackles a family of ranking problems that arise naturally when resources are\nshared among multiple demands with different budgets. For example, the MSR\nframework can be used to rank web pages for multiple user intents. In this\npaper, we extend the MSR framework in the streaming setting. In particular, we\nconsider two different streaming models and we propose practical approximation\nalgorithms. In the first streaming model, called \\emph{function arriving}, we\nassume that submodular functions (demands) arrive continuously in a stream,\nwhile in the second model, called \\emph{item arriving}, we assume that items\n(resources) arrive continuously. Furthermore, we study the MSR problem with\nadditional constraints on the output sequence, such as a matroid constraint\nthat can ensure fair exposure among items from different groups. These\nextensions significantly broaden the range of problems that can be captured by\nthe MSR framework.

Specifically, we augment the law of the wall\n(LoW) by an additional mode based on a one-dimensional proper orthogonal\ndecomposition (POD) applied to a 2D turbulent channel. The constructed wall\nmodel contains two modes, i.e., the LoW mode and the POD-based mode, and the\nmodel matches with the LES at two, instead of one, off-wall locations. To show\nthat the proposed model captures non-equilibrium effects, we perform {\\it\na-priori} and {\\it a-posteriori} tests in the context of both equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium flows. The {\\it a-priori} tests show that the proposed wall\nmodel captures extreme wall-shear stress events better than the equilibrium\nwall model.

In\ncontrast to the related work on meta-learning, ours does not require any\nassumptions on the Hessian smoothness, and can leverage smoothness and\nconvexity of the reformulation based on Moreau envelopes.

Such disks\nare expected to disappear when these stars reach the main sequence. The\nphysical and dynamical structure of these remnant disks are poorly constrained,\nespecially the inner regions where accretion, photo-evaporation, and companion\nformation and migration may be ongoing. We aim to constrain the physical\nproperties of the inner parts of the circumstellar disks of massive young\nstellar objects B243 (6 Msun) and B331 (12 Msun), two systems for which the\ncentral star has been detected and characterized previously despite strong dust\nextinction. Two-dimensional radiation thermo-chemical modelling with ProDiMo of\ndouble-peaked hydrogen lines of the Paschen and Brackett series observed with\nX-shooter was used to probe the properties of the inner disks. Additionally,\nthe dust structure was studied by fitting the optical and near-infrared\nspectral energy distribution. B243 features a hot gaseous inner disk with dust\nat the sublimation radius at 3 AU. The disk appears truncated at roughly 6.5\nAU; a cool outer disk of gas and dust may be present, but it cannot be detected\nwith our data. B331 also has a hot gaseous inner disk. A gap separates the\ninner disk from a colder dusty outer disk starting at up to 100 AU. In both\nsources the inner disk extends to almost the stellar surface.

To\neliminate the need for tactile data, in this paper we propose a novel method\nnamed as Vis2Hap to generate haptic rendering from visual inputs that can be\nobtained from a distance without physical interaction.

Although significant progress has been achieved, existing\napproaches typically suffer from two major limitations: (1) It hurts the\naccuracy of the representation by directly exploiting the bottom-up attention\nbased region-level features where each region is equally treated. (2) It limits\nthe scale of negative sample pairs by employing the mini-batch based end-to-end\ntraining mechanism. To address these limitations, we propose a Unified Semantic\nEnhancement Momentum Contrastive Learning (USER) method for ITR. Specifically,\nwe delicately design two simple but effective Global representation based\nSemantic Enhancement (GSE) modules. One learns the global representation via\nthe self-attention algorithm, noted as Self-Guided Enhancement (SGE) module.\nThe other module benefits from the pre-trained CLIP module, which provides a\nnovel scheme to exploit and transfer the knowledge from an off-the-shelf model,\nnoted as CLIP-Guided Enhancement (CGE) module.

The Fibonacci approach\ngenerates a uniform isotropic covering of the sphere with approximately\nequal-area triangles, thus potentially supporting a smooth thermodynamic limit.\nIn the absence of a magnetic field, the model exhibits a spontaneous\nmagnetization phase transition at a critical temperature that depends on the\nconnectivity properties of the underlying lattice. While in the standard\ntriangular lattice, every site is connected to 6 neighboring sites, the\ntriangulated Fibonacci lattice of the curved surface contains a substantial\ndensity of the 5- and 7-vertices. As the number of sites in the Fibonacci\nsphere increases, the triangular cover of the sphere experiences a series of\nsingular transitions that reflect a sudden change in its connectivity\nproperties.

In this paper, we propose new algorithms\nthat do not explicitly execute submodular function minimization, and we prove\nthat they are faster than those by Schl\\\"oter (2018) and Kamiyama (2019) when\nan input network is restricted such that the sink has a small in-degree and\nevery edge has the same capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 13:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 07:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Our SAT achieves size-aware learning via two steps: introduce\nmulti-scale features to each attention layer and allow each point to choose its\nattentive fields adaptively. It contains two key designs: the Multi-Granularity\nAttention (MGA) scheme and the Re-Attention module.

Specifically, point-voxel\ncross attention is proposed to address the first challenge, and the shunted\nstrategy based on the standard multi-head self attention is applied to solve\nthe second. The Re-Attention module dynamically adjusts the attention scores to\nthe fine- and coarse-grained features output by MGA for each point. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that SAT achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances on S3DIS and ScanNetV2 datasets.

In this work, a methodology is\ndeveloped for quantifying the individual electrophysiological properties of\nlarge numbers of uncoupled cardiomyocytes under ion channel block in terms of\nthe parameters values of a conceptual fast-slow model of electrical\nexcitability. The approach is applied to a population of nearly 500 rabbit\nventricular myocytes for which action potential duration (APD) before and after\nthe application of the drug nifedipine was experimentally measured (Lachaud et\nal., 2022, Cardiovasc.

To this end, drug action is represented by a\nmultiplicative factor to an effective ion conductance, a closed form asymptotic\nexpression for APD is derived and inverted to determine model parameters as\nfunctions of APD and dAPD (drug-induced change in APD) for each myocyte. Two\nfree protocol-related quantities are calibrated to experiment using an\nadaptive-domain procedure based on an original assumption of optimal\nexcitability. The explicit APD expression and the resulting set of model\nparameter values allow (a) direct evaluation of conditions necessary to\nmaintain fixed APD or dAPD, (b) predictions of the proportion of cells\nremaining excitable after drug application, (c) predictions of stimulus period\ndependency and (d) predictions of dose-response curves, the latter being in\nagreement with additional experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 13:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

To meet the above\nchallenges, we propose a hybrid network called Fusion-Transformer-HardNetMSEG\n(i.e., Fu-TransHNet) in this study. Fu-TransHNet uses deep learning of\ndifferent mechanisms to fuse each other and is enhanced with multi-view\ncollaborative learning techniques. Firstly, the Fu-TransHNet utilizes the\nTransformer branch and the CNN branch to realize the global feature learning\nand local feature learning, respectively. Secondly, a fusion module is designed\nto integrate the features from two branches. The fusion module consists of two\nparts: 1) the Global-Local Feature Fusion (GLFF) part and 2) the Dense Fusion\nof Multi-scale features (DFM) part. The former is built to compensate the\nfeature information mission from two branches at the same scale; the latter is\nconstructed to enhance the feature representation.

In this paper, the\nprediction problem is formulated as a disturbance observer design problem. The\ndisturbance observer provides accurate estimation of the total sum of model\nerrors and external disturbances acting on the object. From the estimation\nresults, it is revealed that there is a strong linear relationship between the\napplied force or torque and the estimated disturbances. The proposed prediction\nalgorithm has two phases: the identification & the prediction. During the\nidentification phase, the linear relationship is identified from the observer\noutput using a recursive least-square algorithm.

In this paper,\nwe revisit the curve-based lane detection methods from the perspectives of the\nlane representations' globality and locality. The globality of lane\nrepresentation is the ability to complete invisible parts of lanes with visible\nparts. The locality of lane representation is the ability to modify lanes\nlocally which can simplify parameter optimization. Specifically, we first\npropose to exploit the b-spline curve to fit lane lines since it meets the\nlocality and globality. Second, we design a simple yet efficient network BSNet\nto ensure the acquisition of global and local features.

This\nversatility benefits large-scale space-frame structures, as the individual\ndesign of each structural node can be tailored to meet specific mechanical and\nother functional requirements. To this end, however, the design and analysis of\nsuch space-frames with distinct structural nodes needs to be highly automated.\nA critical aspect in this context is automated integration of the local 3D\nfeatures into the 1D large-scale models. In the present work, a two-scale\nmodeling approach is developed to improve the design and linear-elastic\nanalysis of space frames with complex additively manufactured nodes. The\nmechanical characteristics of the 3D nodes are numerically reduced through an\nautomated dimensional reduction process based on the Finite Cell Method (FCM)\nand substructuring. The reduced stiffness quantities are assembled in the\nlarge-scale 1D model which, in turn, enables efficient structural analysis.

The memories allow rapid, selective querying of\ndistal related past behaviours of others to deliberatively reason about their\ncurrent mental state, beliefs and future behaviours.

Trust functions to reduce the effort spent in constantly\nmonitoring others' actions in order to verify their assertions, thus\nfacilitating cooperation by allowing groups to function with reduced\ncomplexity. To date, in modern societies, large scale trust is almost\nexclusively provided by large centralized institutions.

Thus, they\ncontrol who can interact and conduct transactions through their monopoly of\nonline trust.

There has been a lot of research on dynamic\nalgorithms for graph problems that are solvable in polynomial time by a static\nalgorithm. However, while there is a large body of theoretical work on\nefficient dynamic graph algorithms, a lot of these algorithms were never\nimplemented and empirically evaluated. In this work, we consider the fully\ndynamic edge orientation problem, also called fully dynamic\n$\\Delta$-orientation problem, which is to maintain an orientation of the edges\nof an undirected graph such that the out-degree is low. If edges are inserted\nor deleted, one may have to flip the orientation of some edges in order to\navoid vertices having a large out-degree. While there has been theoretical work\non dynamic versions of this problem, currently there is no experimental\nevaluation available. In this work, we close this gap and engineer a range of\nnew dynamic edge orientation algorithms as well as algorithms from the current\nliterature. Moreover, we evaluate these algorithms on real-world dynamic\ngraphs.

The recruitment of trustworthy and high-quality\nworkers is an important research issue for MCS. Previous studies assume that\nthe qualities of workers are known in advance, or the platform knows the\nqualities of workers once it receives their collected data. In reality, to\nreduce their costs and thus maximize revenue, many strategic workers do not\nperform their sensing tasks honestly and report fake data to the platform. So,\nit is very hard for the platform to evaluate the authenticity of the received\ndata. In this paper, an incentive mechanism named Semi-supervision based\nCombinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit reverse Auction (SCMABA) is proposed to solve\nthe recruitment problem of multiple unknown and strategic workers in MCS.\nFirst, we model the worker recruitment as a multi-armed bandit reverse auction\nproblem, and design an UCB-based algorithm to separate the exploration and\nexploitation, considering the Sensing Rates (SRs) of recruited workers as the\ngain of the bandit. Next, a Semi-supervised Sensing Rate Learning (SSRL)\napproach is proposed to quickly and accurately obtain the workers' SRs, which\nconsists of two phases, supervision and self-supervision. Last, SCMABA is\ndesigned organically combining the SRs acquisition mechanism with multi-armed\nbandit reverse auction, where supervised SR learning is used in the\nexploration, and the self-supervised one is used in the exploitation. We prove\nthat our SCMABA achieves truthfulness and individual rationality. Additionally,\nwe exhibit outstanding performances of the SCMABA mechanism through in-depth\nsimulations of real-world data traces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 08:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

For large-scale data sets that are expensive to\nstore and manipulate, a new variant of the discrete empirical interpolation\nmethod known as L-DEIM, which needs much lower cost and provides a significant\nacceleration in practice, is also combined with the random sampling approach to\nfurther improve the efficiency of our algorithm. Moreover, adopting the\nrandomized algorithm to implement the truncation process of restricted singular\nvalue decomposition (RSVD), combined with the L-DEIM procedure, we propose a\nfast algorithm for computing an RSVD based CUR decomposition, which provides a\ncoordinated low-rank approximation of the three matrices in a CUR-type format\nsimultaneously and provides advantages over the standard CUR approximation for\nsome applications. We establish detailed probabilistic error analysis for the\nalgorithms and provide numerical results that show the promise of our\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 02:49:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 00:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

However, practical application of these models can be hindered by a\nlack of information about how well they will perform on previously unseen types\nof materials. Because machine learning model predictions depend on the quality\nof the available training data, different domains of the material feature space\nare predicted with different accuracy levels by such models. The ability to\nidentify such domains enables the ability to find the confidence level of each\nprediction, to determine when and how the model should be employed depending on\nthe prediction accuracy requirements of different tasks, and to improve the\nmodel for domains with high errors.

In recent years, the C++ standards committee has worked to\nrefine the language features and libraries needed to support parallel\nprogramming on a single computational node. Eventually, all major vendors and\ncompilers will provide robust and performant implementations of these\nstandards. Until then, the HPX library and runtime provides cutting edge\nimplementations of the standards, as well as proposed standards and extensions.\nBecause of these advances, it is now possible to write high performance\nparallel code without custom extensions to C++.

Previous work proposed several methods to estimate WSS, including\nself-balloning, Zballoning and so on. However, these methods which are based on\nvirtual machine usually cause a large overhead. Thus, using those methods to\nestimate WSS is impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to\nefficiently estimate WSS with eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter), a\ncutting-edge technology which monitors and filters data by being attached to\nthe kernel. With an eBPF program pinned into the kernel, we get the times of\npage fault and other information of memory allocation. Moreover, we collect WSS\nvia vanilla tool to train a predictive model to complete estimation work with\nLightGBM, a useful tool which performs well on generating decision trees over\ncontinuous value. The experimental results illustrate that our framework can\nestimate WSS precisely with 98.5\\% reduction in overhead compared to\ntraditional methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 03:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

Therefore, continual learning (CL) area\ngradually attracts the attention of more researchers. For edge intelligence,\nthe CL model not only needs to overcome catastrophic for-getting, but also\nneeds to face the huge challenge of severely limited resources: the lack of\nlabeled resources and powerful devices. However, the existing classic CL\nmethods usually rely on a large number of labeled samples to maintain the\nplasticity and stability, and the semi-supervised learning methods often need\nto pay a large computational and memory overhead for higher accuracy. In\nresponse to these prob-lems, a low-cost semi-supervised CL method named Edge\nHierarchical Memory Learner (EdgeHML) will be proposed. EdgeHML can\neffec-tively utilize a large number of unlabeled samples and a small number of\nlabeled samples. It is based on a hierarchical memory pool, lever-age\nmulti-level storage structure to store and replay samples. EdgeHML implements\nthe interaction between different levels through a combination of online and\noffline strategies. In addition, in order to further reduce the computational\noverhead for unlabeled samples, EdgeHML leverages a progressive learning\nmethod. It reduces the computation cycles of unlabeled samples by controlling\nthe learning process. The experimental results show that on three\nsemi-supervised CL tasks, EdgeHML can improve the model accuracy by up to\n16.35% compared with the classic CL method, and the training iterations time\ncan be reduced by more than 50% compared with semi-supervised methods. EdgeHML\nachieves a semi-supervised CL process with high performance and low overhead\nfor edge intelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 03:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}
