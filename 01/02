To avert this, the existing strategies for VAEs focus\non adjusting the tradeoff by introducing hyperparameters, deriving a tighter\nbound under some mild assumptions, or decomposing the loss components per\ncertain neural settings. VAEs still suffer from uncertain tradeoff learning.We\npropose a novel evolutionary variational autoencoder (eVAE) building on the\nvariational information bottleneck (VIB) theory and integrative evolutionary\nneural learning. eVAE integrates a variational genetic algorithm into VAE with\nvariational evolutionary operators including variational mutation, crossover,\nand evolution. Its inner-outer-joint training mechanism synergistically and\ndynamically generates and updates the uncertain tradeoff learning in the\nevidence lower bound (ELBO) without additional constraints. Apart from learning\na lossy compression and representation of data under the VIB assumption, eVAE\npresents an evolutionary paradigm to tune critical factors of VAEs and deep\nneural networks and addresses the premature convergence and random search\nproblem by integrating evolutionary optimization into deep learning.\nExperiments show that eVAE addresses the KL-vanishing problem for text\ngeneration with low reconstruction loss, generates all disentangled factors\nwith sharp images, and improves the image generation quality,respectively. eVAE\nachieves better reconstruction loss, disentanglement, and generation-inference\nbalance than its competitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 23:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

Most previous attacks assumed that the wild images are\nlabeled. In reality, however, most images on the web are unlabeled.\nSpecifically, we study the effects of unlabeled backdoor images under\nsemi-supervised learning (SSL) on widely studied deep neural networks. To be\nrealistic, we assume that the adversary is zero-knowledge and that the\nsemi-supervised learning model is trained from scratch. Firstly, we find the\nfact that backdoor poisoning always fails when poisoned unlabeled images come\nfrom different classes, which is different from poisoning the labeled images.\nThe reason is that the SSL algorithms always strive to correct them during\ntraining. Therefore, for unlabeled images, we implement backdoor poisoning on\nimages from the target class. Then, we propose a gradient matching strategy to\ncraft poisoned images such that their gradients match the gradients of target\nimages on the SSL model, which can fit poisoned images to the target class and\nrealize backdoor injection. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first\napproach to backdoor poisoning on unlabeled images of trained-from-scratch SSL\nmodels. Experiments show that our poisoning achieves state-of-the-art attack\nsuccess rates on most SSL algorithms while bypassing modern backdoor defenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 16:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

Here, we describe a plug-in graph neural network\nthat can be flexibly integrated into a main learning-based fMRI model to boost\nits temporal sensitivity. Receiving brain regions as nodes and\nblood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals as node inputs, the proposed\nGraphCorr method leverages a node embedder module based on a transformer\nencoder to capture temporally-windowed latent representations of BOLD signals.\nGraphCorr also leverages a lag filter module to account for delayed\ninteractions across nodes by computing cross-correlation of windowed BOLD\nsignals across a range of time lags. Information captured by the two modules is\nfused via a message passing algorithm executed on the graph, and enhanced node\nfeatures are then computed at the output.

Specifically, we establish our platform\nbased on our previously released SurRoL simulator with several new features\nco-developed to allow high-quality human interaction via an input device. We\nshowcase the improvement of our simulation environment with the designed new\nfeatures, and validate effectiveness of incorporating human factors in embodied\nintelligence through the use of human demonstrations and reinforcement learning\nas a representative example. Promising results are obtained in terms of\nlearning efficiency. Lastly, five new surgical robot training tasks are\ndeveloped and released, with which we hope to pave the way for future research\non surgical embodied intelligence. Our learning platform is publicly released\nand will be continuously updated in the website:\nhttps://med-air.github.io/SurRoL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 18:05:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 05:48:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Taking the side\neffects of COVID-19 vaccination as the case topic, we first track the patterns\nof tipping features in 100 online communities, which are detected using Louvain\nAlgorithm from the aggregated communication network on Twitter between May 2020\nand April 2021. Then, we use multi-variant linear regression to explore the\ncorrelations between tipping features and community characteristics. We find\nthat social tipping in online communities can sustain for two to four months\nand lead to a 50% increase in populations who accept the normative belief in\nonline communities. The regression indicates that the duration of social\ntipping is positively related to the community populations and original\nacceptance of social norms, while the correlation between the tipping duration\nand the degrees among community members is negative. Additionally, the network\nmodularity and original acceptance of social norms have negative relationships\nwith the extent of social tipping, while the degree and betweenness centrality\ncan have significant positive relationships with the extent of tipping.

It has been\npredicted that grating interferometry (GI) could eventually allow computed\ntomography (CT) to be more dose-efficient. However, the benefit of refraction\nin clinical CT has not been demonstrated so far. Here we show that GI-CT is\nmore dose-efficient in imaging of breast tissue than conventional CT.

Both density estimation and distance-based methods to\ndetect anomalies in latent space have been explored in the past. These methods\nprove that retaining valuable properties of input data in latent space helps in\nthe better reconstruction of test data. Moreover, real-world sensor data is\nskewed and non-Gaussian in nature, making mean-based estimators unreliable for\nskewed data. Again, anomaly detection methods based on reconstruction error\nrely on Euclidean distance, which does not consider useful correlation\ninformation in the feature space and also fails to accurately reconstruct the\ndata when it deviates from the training distribution. In this work, we address\nthe limitations of reconstruction error-based autoencoders and propose a\nkernelized autoencoder that leverages a robust form of Mahalanobis distance\n(MD) to measure latent dimension correlation to effectively detect both near\nand far anomalies. This hybrid loss is aided by the principle of maximizing the\nmutual information gain between the latent dimension and the high-dimensional\nprior data space by maximizing the entropy of the latent space while preserving\nuseful correlation information of the original data in the low-dimensional\nlatent space.

The famous Birkhoff Conjecture (studied by\nmany mathematicians including H.Poritsky, M.Bialy, S.Bolotin, A.Mironov,\nV.Kaloshin, A.Sorrentino) states that the only integrable billiards are\nellipses. Integrability is equivalent to existence of a first integral of the\nbilliard flow independent (on appropriate subset) with its trivial integral:\nthe squared velocity. Bolotin's Conjecture, now a joint theorem of Bialy,\nMironov and the author, deals with billiards whose flow admits a non-trivial\nintegral polynomial in the velocity. It states that 1) if the boundary of such\na billiard is $C^2$, nonlinear, connected, then it is a conic; 2) if it is\npiecewise $C^2$-smooth and contains a nonlinear arc, then it consists of arcs\nof conics from a confocal pencil and segments of \"admissible lines\" for the\npencil. The minimal degree of integral is always either 2, or 4.

A new component of\nthese calculations involves sampling a 300 K canonical ensemble to determine\nthe distribution of possible outcomes of the calculations, and with this\napproach we are able to determine the threshold for dissociation as a function\nof laser intensity, wavelength, and nanocluster size. We show that the\nthreshold intensity varies as an inverse power of nanocluster size, which makes\nit possible to extrapolate the results to sizes that are more typical of\nexperimental studies. The intensities obtained from this extrapolation are\naround a factor of 100 above powers used in the pulsed experiments. This is a\ncloser comparison of theory and experiment than has been obtained in previous\nreal-time simulations, and the remaining discrepancy can be understood in terms\nof electromagnetic hot spots that are associated with cluster formation. We\nalso compare the influence of plasmon excitation versus inter-band excitation\non reaction thresholds, revealing that for silver clusters plasmon excitation\nleads to lower thresholds, but for gold clusters, inter-band excitation is more\neffective. Our study also includes an analysis of charge transfer to and from\nthe H$_2$ molecule, and a determination of orbital populations during and after\nthe pulse, showing the correlation between metal excitations and the location\nof the antibonding level of H$_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 21:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

It can be represented by its own\ngene tree which can differ substantially from a general species tree\nrepresentation. Consensus trees and supertrees have been widely used in\nevolutionary studies to combine phylogenetic information contained in\nindividual gene trees. Nevertheless, if the available gene trees are quite\ndifferent from each other, then the resulting consensus tree or supertree can\neither include many unresolved subtrees corresponding to internal nodes of high\ndegree or can simply be a star tree. This may happen if the available gene\ntrees have been affected by different reticulate evolutionary events, such as\nhorizontal gene transfer, hybridization or genetic recombination. Thus, the\nproblem of inferring multiple alternative consensus trees or supertrees, using\nclustering, becomes relevant since it allows one to regroup in different\nclusters gene trees having similar evolutionary patterns (e.g. gene trees\nrepresenting genes that have undergone the same horizontal gene transfer or\nrecombination events).

The aim of this paper is to\nstudy radiative symmetry breaking in the singlet scalar extension of type II\nseesaw neutrino mass model. We derive bounded-from-below conditions for the\nscalar potential of the model in full generality for the first time. The\nGildener-Weinberg approach is utilised in minimising the multiscalar potential.\nUpon imposing the bounded-from-below and perturbativity conditions, as well as\nexperimental constraints from colliders, we find the parameter space of scalar\nquartic couplings that can radiatively realise electroweak symmetry breaking at\none-loop level. To satisfy all the constraints, the masses of the heavy\ntriplet-like Higgs bosons must be nearly degenerate. The evolution of the Higgs\ndoublet quartic coupling $\\lambda_{H}$ can be prevented from being negative up\nto the Planck scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 22:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 02:16:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 09:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

To accurately\ndepict performance and inspire an end-to-end design for futuristic BCI designs,\na more thorough examination and definition of ITR is therefore required. We\nmodel the symbiotic communication medium, hosted by the retinogeniculate visual\npathway, as a discrete memoryless channel and use the modified capacity\nexpressions to redefine the ITR. We use graph theory to characterize the\nrelationship between the asymmetry of the transition statistics and the ITR\ngain with the new definition, leading to potential bounds on data rate\nperformance. On two well-known SSVEP datasets, we compared two cutting-edge\ntarget identification methods. Results indicate that the induced DM channel\nasymmetry has a greater impact on the actual perceived ITR than the change in\ninput distribution. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the ITR gain under the\nnew definition is inversely correlated with the asymmetry in the channel\ntransition statistics. Individual input customizations are further shown to\nyield perceived ITR performance improvements. An algorithm is proposed to find\nthe capacity of binary classification and further discussions are given to\nextend such results to ensemble techniques.We anticipate that the results of\nour study will contribute to the characterization of the highly dynamic BCI\nchannel capacities, performance thresholds, and improved BCI stimulus designs\nfor a tighter symbiosis between the human brain and computer systems while\nenhancing the efficiency of the underlying communication resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 23:07:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 02:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

The two\nstandard methods to measure/infer $H_0$ rely on: (i) anchored observables for\nthe distance ladder, and (ii) establishing the relationship of the $H_0$ to the\nangular size of the sound horizon in the recombination era assuming a standard\nCosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) cosmology. However, the\nformer requires a calibration with observables at nearby distances, while the\nlatter is not a direct measurement and is model-dependent. The physics behind\nthese aspects restrains our possibilities in selecting a calibration method\nthat can help minimise the systematic effects or in considering a fixed\ncosmological model background. Anticipating the possibility of deeply exploring\nthe physics of new nearby observables such as the recently detected black hole\nshadows, in this paper we propose standard rules to extend the studies related\nto these observables. Supermassive black hole shadows can be characterised by\ntwo parameters: the angular size of the shadow and the black hole mass.

Much of\nthis past work focuses on studying a simulation's response to external\nmanipulation. In contrast, we explore the potential to train a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) on internal variability alone and then use it to examine\npossible nonlinear responses of the jet to tropospheric thermal forcing that\nmore closely resemble anthropogenic climate change.

Despite the\npotential benefits of AR in poker, not much research has been done in the\nfield. In fact, PokAR is the first application to enable AR poker on a mobile\ndevice without requiring extra costly equipment.

We evaluated this\napplication by instructing 4 participant dyads to use PokAR to engage in poker\nplay and respond to survey questions about their experience.

We focus on prolongedness and define PAE-POMDP (Prolonged Action\nEffect-Partially Observable Markov Decision Process), a subclass of POMDPs in\nwhich the Markov assumption does not hold specifically due to prolonged effects\nof actions.

The\nvideo downsampling process may lose these two frames and take the adjacent\nirrelevant frames as new boundaries. 2) Reasoning-bias: Such incorrect new\nboundary frames also lead to the reasoning bias during frame-query interaction,\nreducing the generalization ability of model.

It was found that the displacements of some shear-coupling GBs do\nnot exhibit a linear or approximately linear relation with the time, as widely\nassumed, but evidently exhibit an acceleration tendency. Moreover, the boundary\nvelocity significantly decreases when increasing the bicrystal size\nperpendicular to the GB plane.

Inspired by video representation\nlearning, these methods mainly focus on designing modules to extract\ninformative spatial and temporal features. However, they are still limited in\nextracting local attributes and global identity information, which are critical\nfor the person re-identification task. In this paper, we propose a novel\nMulti-Stage Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Transformer (MSTAT) with two novel\ndesigned proxy embedding modules to address the above issue. Specifically,\nMSTAT consists of three stages to encode the attribute-associated, the\nidentity-associated, and the attribute-identity-associated information from the\nvideo clips, respectively, achieving the holistic perception of the input\nperson. We combine the outputs of all the stages for the final identification.\nIn practice, to save the computational cost, the Spatial-Temporal Aggregation\n(STA) modules are first adopted in each stage to conduct the self-attention\noperations along the spatial and temporal dimensions separately. We further\nintroduce the Attribute-Aware and Identity-Aware Proxy embedding modules (AAP\nand IAP) to extract the informative and discriminative feature representations\nat different stages. All of them are realized by employing newly designed\nself-attention operations with specific meanings. Moreover, temporal patch\nshuffling is also introduced to further improve the robustness of the model.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmodules in extracting the informative and discriminative information from the\nvideos, and illustrate the MSTAT can achieve state-of-the-art accuracies on\nvarious standard benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 05:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

Existing approaches to\nposterior collapse often attribute it to the use of neural networks or\noptimization issues due to variational approximation. In this paper, we\nconsider posterior collapse as a problem of latent variable\nnon-identifiability.

This fact\nimplies that posterior collapse is not a phenomenon specific to the use of\nflexible distributions or approximate inference.

Many hypotheses for species loss with\nincreasing N availability highlight density-dependent mechanisms, i.e., changes\nin species interactions. However, an alternative set of hypotheses highlights\ndensity-independent detrimental effects of nitrogen (e.g., N toxicity). We\ntested the role of density-dependent and density-independent mechanisms in\nreducing species performance. For this aim, we used 120 experimental plant\ncommunities comprised of annual species growing together in containers under\nfour fertilization treatments: (1) no nutrient addition(, (2) all nutrients\nexcept N (P, K, and micronutrients), (3) Low N, and (4) high N.

Several distinct\ncategories of jet properties -- the ``Kinetic-energy-dominated\" (KED),\n``Poynting-flux-dominated\" (PFD), and ``Hybrid-dominated\" (HD) jets -- have\nbeen observed in the observed GRB spectra, and the emission dominated by\ndifferent jet properties is expected to have a different level of polarization\n($\\pi_{\\rm KED}\\lesssim\\pi_{\\rm HD}\\lesssim\\pi_{\\rm PED}$).

Numerous R-MTSs with\npowerful capabilities and various functions are presented explosively. In light\nof the five dimensions of EM wave, this review proposes a unified model to\ndescribe the interactions among R-MTS, EM wave and EM information, and suggests\ninformation bit allocation strategy to categorize different types of R-MTSs\nsystematically. As recent advances of R-MTS, 1-bit and 2-bit elements\nmanipulating different wave dimensions are reviewed respectively in detail.\nFinally, this review discusses the future research trends of R-MTS.

This is exacerbated when there are relatively many more\nfeatures than instances, and thus the proportion of affected instances is high.\nSuch a scenario is common in many important domains, for example, single\nnucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets provide a large number of features over\na genome for a relatively small number of individuals. To preserve as much\ninformation as possible prior to modeling, a rigorous imputation scheme is\nacutely needed. While Denoising Autoencoders is a state-of-the-art method for\nimputation in high-dimensional data, they still require enough complete cases\nto be trained on which is often not available in real-world problems. In this\npaper, we consider missing value imputation as a multi-label classification\nproblem and propose Chains of Autoreplicative Random Forests. Using multi-label\nRandom Forests instead of neural networks works well for low-sampled data as\nthere are fewer parameters to optimize. Experiments on several SNP datasets\nshow that our algorithm effectively imputes missing values based only on\ninformation from the dataset and exhibits better performance than standard\nalgorithms that do not require any additional information. In this paper, the\nalgorithm is implemented specifically for SNP data, but it can easily be\nadapted for other cases of missing value imputation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 10:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

Although recent deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) based models can learn the weight of data adaptively, a lack of\nresearch on explicitly quantifying the data quality of each view when fusing\nthem renders these models inexplicable, performing unsatisfactorily and\ninflexible in downstream remote sensing tasks.

However,\na fully centralized RL approach is beset with difficulties in a multi-network\nscenario because of exponential growth in state-action space with increasing\nintersections. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can overcome the\nhigh-dimension problem by employing the global control of each local RL agent,\nbut it also brings new challenges, such as the failure of convergence caused by\nthe non-stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we introduce\nan off-policy nash deep Q-Network (OPNDQN) algorithm, which mitigates the\nweakness of both fully centralized and MARL approaches. The OPNDQN algorithm\nsolves the problem that traditional algorithms cannot be used in large\nstate-action space traffic models by utilizing a fictitious game approach at\neach iteration to find the nash equilibrium among neighboring intersections,\nfrom which no intersection has incentive to unilaterally deviate. One of main\nadvantages of OPNDQN is to mitigate the non-stationarity of multi-agent Markov\nprocess because it considers the mutual influence among neighboring\nintersections by sharing their actions.

In this paper we developed a $\\tau$-leaping\nmethod for computing the FPT and position in arbitrary volumes for a Brownian\nparticle governed by the Langevin equation. The $\\tau$-leaping method proposed\nhere works as follows. A sphere is inscribed within the volume of interest\n(VOI) centered at the initial particle's location. On this sphere, the FPT is\nsampled, as well as the position, which becomes the new initial position. Then,\nanother sphere, centered at this new location, is inscribed. This process\ncontinues until the sphere becomes smaller than some minimal radius\n$R_{\\text{min}}$. When this occurs, the $\\tau$-leaping switches to the\nconventional Monte Carlo, which runs until the particle either crosses the\nsurface of the VOI or finds its way to a position where a sphere of radius\n$>R_{\\text{min}}$ can be inscribed. The switching between $\\tau$-leaping and MC\ncontinues until the particle crosses the surface of the VOI. The size of this\nradius depends on the system parameters and on one's notion of accuracy: the\nlarger this radius the more accurate the $\\tau$-leaping method, but also less\nefficient. This trade off between accuracy and efficiency is discussed. For two\nVOI, the $\\tau$-leaping method is shown to be accurate and more efficient than\nMC by at least a factor of 10 and up to a factor of about 110. However, while\nMC becomes exponentially slower with increasing VOI, the efficiency of the\n$\\tau$-leaping method remains relatively unchanged. Thus, the $\\tau$-leaping\nmethod can potentially be many orders of magnitude more efficient than MC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 13:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

We argue that, although in this regime a\nredistribution of the neutrino energies might take place, making low-energy\nneutrinos more trapped, this only affects a small part of the neutrino\npopulation and it cannot be constrained with the SN 1987A data. Thus, contrary\nto previous claims, the region of the parameter space where the\n$U(1)_{L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}}$ model explains the discrepancy in the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment is not ruled out. We then focus on small gauge couplings, where\nthe decay length of the new gauge boson is larger than the neutrino-nucleon\nmean free path, but still smaller than the size of proto-neutron star. We show\nfor the first time that in this regime, the resonant production of a long-lived\n$Z'$ and its subsequent decay into neutrinos can significantly reduce the\nduration of the neutrino burst, probing values of the coupling below ${\\cal\nO}(10^{-7})$ for mediator masses between 10 and 100~MeV. This rules out new\nareas of the parameter space of the $U(1)_{L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}}$ model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 13:29:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 17:49:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 16:19:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

We\nsearched for spectroscopic analogues of the andesitic meteorite Erg Chech 002\nin the asteroid population using the Gaia DR3 spectral dataset. Methods. In\norder to identify which asteroids have the most similar spectrum to Erg Chech\n002, we first determined the spectral parameters of Gaia DR3 asteroids\n(spectral slope and Band I depth) and compared them to the spectral parameters\nof different samples of the meteorite. In addition, we performed a spectral\ncurve matching between Erg Chech 002 and Gaia DR3 asteroid data, and we\ncompared the results of both methods. Results. We found that 51 main-belt\nasteroids have a visible spectrum similar to the one of Erg Chech 002, and 91\nhave a spectrum similar to the space-weathered spectra of the meteorite,\ncorresponding to 0.08 and 0.15% of the whole Gaia DR3 dataset of asteroids with\nspectra, respectively.

However, the installation of multiple\nsensors to monitor each appliance currently has a high initial cost and as a\nresult, monitoring consumption from different appliances using sensors is not\ncost-effective. To address this challenge, studies have focused on analyzing\nmeasurements of the total domestic consumption using Machine Learning (ML)\nmethods, to disaggregate water usage into each appliance. Identifying which\nappliances are in use through ML is challenging since their operation may be\noverlapping, while specific appliances may operate with intermittent flow,\nmaking individual consumption events hard to distinguish. Moreover, ML\napproaches require large amounts of labeled input data to train their models,\nwhich are typically not available for a single household, while usage\ncharacteristics may vary in different regions. In this work, we initially\npropose a data model that generates synthetic time series based on regional\nwater usage characteristics and resolution to overcome the need for a large\ntraining dataset with real labeled data.

We find\nthat many activities in the current HAR datasets have shared label names, e.g.,\n\"open door\" and \"open fridge\", \"walk upstairs\" and \"walk downstairs\". Through\nsome exploratory analysis, we find that such shared structure in activity names\nalso maps to similarity in the input features. To this end, we design a\nsequence-to-sequence framework to decode the label name semantics rather than\nclassifying labels as integer IDs. Our proposed method decomposes learning\nactivities into learning shared tokens (\"open\", \"walk\"), which is easier than\nlearning the joint distribution (\"open fridge\", \"walk upstairs\") and helps\ntransfer learning to activities with insufficient data samples.

The advantage, of the block based\nvariant, in-terms of speed are significant in comparison to other variants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 10:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

Traditional cloud computing architectures are not designed\nfor latency-critical applications such as AI (Artificial Intelligence) and IoT\n(Internet Of Things) because they rely on low data volumes generated by\napplications running near highly-populated areas. When volume grows beyond 50\nmiles from the population center, networks experience higher latency and packet\nloss rates which impacts application performance. Since everyone's life is\nequipped with more and more IoT devices by the day, decisions should be made at\na split second in edge computing. It is really crucial to perform at optimum\nlevel, some devices specially the medical wearables deal with patient life and\nany delay in decision making will result in disaster. Similarly, modern day\nautonomous self driving vehicles where late decisions can endup in accidents\nand really there is no room for any errors.\n  This paper provides a new approach to improve performance of the edge\ncomputing by having two identical computing systems in which one system will\nact as primary and another as reserved or secondary, this system will be\navailable at the local environment of the IoT device and not in cloud. The\nsecondary system will be reserved for mission critical requests and whenever\nthe primary system breaches latency threshold for response only then the\nrequest will be re-routed to the secondary system. Both the systems will sync\ndata on background and can also serve as backup computing systems in case of\nany failure to one of the systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 21:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}
