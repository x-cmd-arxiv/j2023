Recent measurements of the\nCMB temperature field provide tantalizing evidence of the deviation from SI. A\nsystematic approach based on strong mathematical formulation allows any nSI\nfeature to be traced to known physical effects or observational artefacts.\nUnexplained nSI features could have immense cosmological ramifications for the\nstandard model of cosmology. BipoSH (Bipolar Spherical Harmonics) provides a\ngeneral formalism for quantifying the departure from statistical isotropy for a\nfield on a 2D sphere.

However, the use of MD directly to\ntreat the deformation and failure of materials at the mesoscale is still\nlargely beyond reach. Herein, we propose a learning framework to extract a\nperidynamic model as a mesoscale continuum surrogate from MD simulated material\nfracture datasets. Firstly, we develop a novel coarse-graining method, to\nautomatically handle the material fracture and its corresponding\ndiscontinuities in MD displacement dataset. Inspired by the Weighted\nEssentially Non-Oscillatory scheme, the key idea lies at an adaptive procedure\nto automatically choose the locally smoothest stencil, then reconstruct the\ncoarse-grained material displacement field as piecewise smooth solutions\ncontaining discontinuities. Then, based on the coarse-grained MD data, a\ntwo-phase optimization-based learning approach is proposed to infer the optimal\nperidynamics model with damage criterion. In the first phase, we identify the\noptimal nonlocal kernel function from datasets without material damage, to\ncapture the material stiffness properties. Then, in the second phase, the\nmaterial damage criterion is learnt as a smoothed step function from the data\nwith fractures. As a result, a peridynamics surrogate is obtained. Our\nperidynamics surrogate model can be employed in further prediction tasks with\ndifferent grid resolutions from training, and hence allows for substantial\nreductions in computational cost compared with MD. We illustrate the efficacy\nof the proposed approach with several numerical tests for single layer\ngraphene. Our tests show that the proposed data-driven model is robust and\ngeneralizable: it is capable in modeling the initialization and growth of\nfractures under discretization and loading settings that are different from the\nones used during training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 16:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

To facilitate\nTransformers to better leverage the inductive bias about 3D geometric\nstructures of point clouds, we further devise a geometry-aware block that\nmodels the local geometric relationships explicitly.

This reflects in empirical literature that\neither focuses on outputs instead of transformative processes, or preemptively\nassumes the nature of technology. Building on recent advances in information\ntheory, we develop a method to quantify technological sophistication. Our\napproach explicitly addresses the transformative process where inputs interact\nto generate outputs; providing a more direct inference about the nature of\ntechnology. More specifically, we measure the degree to which an industry's\ninputs interact in a synergistic fashion. Synergies create novel outputs, so we\nconjecture that synergistic technologies are more sophisticated. We test this\nconjecture by estimating synergy scores for industries across nearly 150\ncountries using input-output datasets. We find that these scores predict\npopular export-based measures of economic complexity that are commonly used as\nproxies for economic sophistication. The method yields synergistic interaction\nnetworks that provide further insights on the structure of industrial\nprocesses. For example, they reveal that industries from the tertiary sector\ntend to be disassortative sector-wise. To the extent of our knowledge, our\nfindings are the first data-driven inference of technological sophistication\nwithin production processes (on an industrial scale).

Methods for\nautomatic 3D urban building modeling typically employ multi-view images as\ninput to algorithms to recover point clouds and 3D models of buildings.\nHowever, such models rely heavily on multi-view images of buildings, which are\ntime-intensive and limit the applicability and practicality of the models. To\nsolve these issues, we focus on designing an efficient DSM estimation-driven\nreconstruction framework (Building3D), which aims to reconstruct 3D building\nmodels from the input single-view remote sensing image. First, we propose a\nSemantic Flow Field-guided DSM Estimation (SFFDE) network, which utilizes the\nproposed concept of elevation semantic flow to achieve the registration of\nlocal and global features. Specifically, in order to make the network semantics\nglobally aware, we propose an Elevation Semantic Globalization (ESG) module to\nrealize the semantic globalization of instances. Further, in order to alleviate\nthe semantic span of global features and original local features, we propose a\nLocal-to-Global Elevation Semantic Registration (L2G-ESR) module based on\nelevation semantic flow.

The compound orders antiferromagnetically at around 36 K\naccompanied by a simultaneous structural transition from a tetragonal to an\northorhombic phase. The hydrostatic pressure dependence of the magnetic and\nstructural transitions is investigated using electrical-transport, ac\nmagnetic-susceptibility, ac calorimetry, M$\\ddot{\\rm o}$ssbauer, muon-spin\nrelaxation ($\\mu$SR), and x-ray diffraction measurements. External pressure\nsuppresses the first-order transition to the antiferromagnetic phase (AFM1)\naround 1.8 GPa. The structural transition is largely unaffected by pressure and\nremains between 30 to 35 K for pressures up to 2 GPa. A second\nantiferromagnetic phase (AFM2) is observed at higher pressures. The transition\nfrom the paramagnetic to the AFM2 phase is of second-order nature and appears\nto be connected to the structural transition.

Magnetic memory elements such as magnetic tunnel junctions\n(MTJs) could be useful for ACAM due to their low read/write energy and high\nendurance, but MTJs are usually restricted to digital values.

Progress can be made by deriving\nthe full (polarizing) scattering phase function of such particles at multiple\nwavelengths. This has now become possible by careful extraction from scattered\nlight images. Such an extraction requires knowledge about the shape of the\nscattering surface in the disk and we discuss how to obtain such knowledge as\nwell as the associated uncertainties. We use a sample of disk images from\nobservations with VLT/SPHERE to, for the first time, extract the phase\nfunctions of a whole sample of disks with broad phase angle coverage. We find\nthat polarized phase functions come in two categories. Comparing the extracted\nfunctions with theoretical predictions from rigorous T-Matrix computations of\naggregates, we show that one category can be linked back to fractal, porous\naggregates, while the other is consistent with more compact, less porous\naggregates. We speculate that the more compact particles become visible in\ndisks where embedded planets trigger enhanced vertical mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 18:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

Further, some\nof these proposed missions require autonomous driving and absolute localization\nin darkness. For example, the Endurance A mission proposes to drive 1200km of\nits total traverse at night. The lack of natural light available during such\nmissions limits what can be used as visual landmarks and the range at which\nlandmarks can be observed. In order for planetary rovers to traverse long\nranges, onboard absolute localization is critical to the ability of the rover\nto maintain its planned trajectory and avoid known hazardous regions.\nCurrently, to accomplish absolute localization, a ground in the loop (GITL)\noperation is performed wherein a human operator matches local maps or images\nfrom onboard with orbital images and maps. This GITL operation limits the\ndistance that can be driven in a day to a few hundred meters, which is the\ndistance that the rover can maintain acceptable localization error via relative\nmethods.

To address these two challenges, we consider a Bussgang\nlinear minimum mean square error (BLMMSE)-based channel estimator for large\nscale massive MIMO systems with one-bit quantizers and a spatially\nnon-stationary channel. Whereas other works usually assume that the channel\ncovariance is known at the base station, we consider a plug-in BLMMSE estimator\nthat uses an estimate of the channel covariance and rigorously analyze the\ndistortion produced by using an estimated, rather than the true, covariance.

Despite its benefits, having access to a large volume of corpora\nmakes it difficult when it comes to benchmark TIE systems.

On the other hand, the\nfact that each corpus is commonly disseminated in a different format requires a\nconsiderable engineering effort for a researcher/practitioner to develop\nparsers for all of them. This constraint forces researchers to select a limited\namount of datasets to evaluate their systems which consequently limits the\ncomparability of the systems. Yet another obstacle that hinders the\ncomparability of the TIE systems is the evaluation metric employed. While most\nresearch works adopt traditional metrics such as precision, recall, and $F_1$,\na few others prefer temporal awareness -- a metric tailored to be more\ncomprehensive on the evaluation of temporal systems. Although the reason for\nthe absence of temporal awareness in the evaluation of most systems is not\nclear, one of the factors that certainly weights this decision is the necessity\nto implement the temporal closure algorithm in order to compute temporal\nawareness, which is not straightforward to implement neither is currently\neasily available.

In this paper, we propose a head-free\nlightweight architecture specifically for semantic segmentation, named Adaptive\nFrequency Transformer. It adopts a parallel architecture to leverage prototype\nrepresentations as specific learnable local descriptions which replaces the\ndecoder and preserves the rich image semantics on high-resolution features.\nAlthough removing the decoder compresses most of the computation, the accuracy\nof the parallel structure is still limited by low computational resources.\nTherefore, we employ heterogeneous operators (CNN and Vision Transformer) for\npixel embedding and prototype representations to further save computational\ncosts. Moreover, it is very difficult to linearize the complexity of the vision\nTransformer from the perspective of spatial domain.

We want to find the distribution of initial conditions that best\nreproduces disc observations at the population level. Methods. We first ran a\nparameter study using a 1D model that includes the viscous evolution of a gas\ndisc, dust, and pebbles, coupled with an emission model to compute the\nmillimetre flux observable with ALMA. This was used to train a machine learning\nsurrogate model that can compute the relevant quantity for comparison with\nobservations in seconds. This surrogate model was used to perform parameter\nstudies and synthetic disc populations. Results. Performing a parameter study,\nwe find that internal photoevaporation leads to a lower dependency of disc\nlifetime on stellar mass than external photoevaporation. This dependence should\nbe investigated in the future. Performing population synthesis, we find that\nunder the combined losses of internal and external photoevaporation, discs are\ntoo short lived. Conclusions. To match observational constraints, future models\nof disc evolution need to include one or a combination of the following\nprocesses: infall of material to replenish the discs, shielding of the disc\nfrom internal photoevaporation due to magnetically driven disc winds, and\nextinction of external high-energy radiation. Nevertheless, disc properties in\nlow-external-photoevaporation regions can be reproduced by having more massive\nand compact discs. Here, the optimum values of the $\\alpha$ viscosity parameter\nlie between $3\\times10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$ and with internal photoevaporation\nbeing the main mode of disc dispersal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 12:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Gapless phases, however, exhibit\nexotic phenomena beyond naive mean-field descriptions. Such phenomena include\n(i) zero-energy peaks in spectral density at low temperatures, (ii) a cascade\nof transitions as that of a quantum dot at higher temperatures, (iii) the\nPomeranchuk effect where local moment develops upon heating, (iv) resistance\npeaks in gapless phases at certain integer fillings, etc. These phenomena have\nnever been connected or explained on a microscopic level by any prior theory.\nIn this work, we point out that all these phenomena result from a simple\nunified mechanism - the Kondo effect. We applied systematic analytical and\nnumerical renormalization group analyses to a single-impurity version of the\nrecently proposed topological heavy fermion (THF) model of MATBG. We find that\nthe Fermi liquid ground state exhibiting (i) zero-energy peaks is stabilized by\nthe Kondo screening effect. A higher temperature will drive the system into a\nlocal moment phase that obeys Curie's law and has higher entropy. This explains\nthe (ii) transition cascade, (iii) the Pomeranchuk effect, and (iv) resistance\npeaks. Remarkably, the computed spectral densities, entropies, and spin\nsusceptibilities are quantitatively comparable to experiments. Furthermore, we\npredict that the ground state in a wide range of fractional fillings is the\nheavy Fermi liquid, and compute its dispersion, quasi-particle weight, and\nenergy surfaces that could be used to verify our theory if compared to\nexperiments in the future studies.

The key idea of this paper is to bypass\nthe sub-object component annotations by leveraging the original style of the\ninput image because the original style will include the information about the\ncharacteristics of the sub-object components. Specifically, for each pixel, we\nuse not only the per-class style gap between the source and target domains but\nalso the pixel's original style to determine the target style of a pixel. To\nthis end, we present Style Harmonization for unpaired I2I translation (SHUNIT).\nOur SHUNIT generates a new style by harmonizing the target domain style\nretrieved from a class memory and an original source image style. Instead of\ndirect source-to-target style mapping, we aim for source and target styles\nharmonization. We validate our method with extensive experiments and achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on the latest benchmark sets.

We evaluate and\ncompare the effectiveness of the method against other published algorithms,\nusing both simulated data generated from parametric differential emission\nprofile forms, and AIA data from a solar eruptive event on 2010 November 3.\nSimilarities and differences between the differential emission measure profiles\nand maps reconstructed by the various algorithms are discussed. The RML\ninversion method is mathematically rigorous, computationally efficient, and\nproduces acceptable measures of performance in the following three key areas:\nfidelity to the data, accuracy in the reconstruction, and robustness in the\npresence of data noise. As such, it shows considerable promise for computing\ndifferential emission measure profiles from datasets of discrete spectral\nlines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 19:36:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 18:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

However, 3D shapes in the real\nworld are presented continuously. In this paper, we propose to learn a\ncontinuous representation for meshes with fixed topology, a common and\npractical setting in many faces-, hand-, and body-related applications. First,\nwe split the template into multiple closed manifold genus-0 meshes so that each\ngenus-0 mesh can be parameterized onto the unit sphere. Then we learn spherical\nimplicit surface (SIS), which takes a spherical coordinate and a global feature\nor a set of local features around the coordinate as inputs, predicting the\nvertex corresponding to the coordinate as an output. Since the spherical\ncoordinates are continuous, SIS can depict a mesh in an arbitrary resolution.\nSIS representation builds a bridge between discrete and continuous\nrepresentation in 3D shapes. Specifically, we train SIS networks in a\nself-supervised manner for two tasks: a reconstruction task and a\nsuper-resolution task. Experiments show that our SIS representation is\ncomparable with state-of-the-art methods that are specifically designed for\nmeshes with a fixed resolution and significantly outperforms methods that work\nin arbitrary resolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 20:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

Specifically, it features a blending of UV and IR in its ground\nstate, restricted mobility of its quasiparticles, and variations in the\nbraiding statistics of its quasiparticles based on their position. In this\npaper, we investigate various aspects of $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ rank-2 gauge theory in\n${(2+1)}$-dimensional spacetime. Firstly, we demonstrate that $U(1)$ rank-2\ngauge theory can arise from ${U(1)\\times U(1)}$ rank-1 gauge theory after\ncondensing the gauge charges in a specific way. This construction scheme of\n$U(1)$ rank-2 gauge theory carries over to the $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ case simply by\nHiggsing $U(1)$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_N$, after which the resulting rank-2 gauge\ntheory can be tuned to the R2TC. The holonomy operators of R2TC are readily\nidentified using this scheme and are given clear physical interpretation as the\npair creation/annihilation of various monopoles and dipoles. Explicit tensor\nnetwork construction of the ground states of R2TC are given as two copies of\nthe ground states of Kitaev's toric code that are `sewn together' according to\nthe condensation scheme. In addition, through a similar anyon condensation\nprotocol, we present a double semion version of rank-2 toric code whose flux\nexcitations exhibit restricted mobility and semionic statistics. Finally, we\nidentify the generalized discrete symmetries of the R2TC, which are much more\ncomplex than typical 1-form symmetries. They include conventional and\nunconventional 1-form symmetries, such as framed 1-form symmetries and what we\ncall sublattice 1-form symmetries. Using these, we interpret the R2TC's unique\nproperties (UV/IR mixing, position-dependent braiding, etc.) from the modern\nperspective of generalized spontaneous symmetry breaking and 't Hooft\nanomalies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 20:29:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2023 01:42:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 02:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Extending previous formulas derived in\nPeters et al. (2020), entrainment is connected to the background environment\nvia an analytic manipulation of the equations of motion that yields a direct\ncorrespondence between the storm relative flow and the updraft radius, and an\ninverse scaling between the updraft radius squared and entrainment rate. These\nconcepts, combined with the assumption of adiabatic conservation of moist\nstatic energy, yield an explicit analytic equation for ECAPE that depends\nentirely on state variables in an atmospheric profile and a few constant\nparameters with values that are established in past literature. Using a\nsimplified Bernoulli-like equation, a second formula is derived that accounts\nfor updraft enhancement via kinetic energy extracted from the cloud's\nbackground environment. CAPE and ECAPE can be viewed as predictors of the\nmaximum vertical velocity $w_{max}$ in an updraft. Hence, these formulas are\nevaluated using $w_{max}$ from past numerical modeling studies. Both of the new\nformulas improve predictions of $w_{max}$ substantially over undiluted CAPE,\nECAPE with a prescribed entrainment rate, and the ECAPE formula from Peters et\nal. (2020). The formula that incorporates environmental kinetic energy\ncontribution to the updraft correctly predicts instances of exceedance of\n$\\sqrt{2\\text{CAPE}}$ by $w_{max}$ in simulations, and provides a conceptual\nexplanation for why such exceedance is rare among past simulations. These\nformulas are potentially useful in nowcasting and forecasting thunderstorms and\nas thunderstorm proxies in climate change studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 20:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

This method constructs a one-to-one mapping between individual\nstructure descriptors and spectral trends. Specifically, an adversarial\nautoencoder is augmented with a novel rank constraint (RankAAE). The RankAAE\nmethodology produces a continuous and interpretable latent space, where each\ndimension can track an individual structure descriptor. As a part of this\nprocess, the model provides a robust and quantitative measure of the\nstructure-spectrum relationship by decoupling intertwined spectral\ncontributions from multiple structural characteristics. This makes it ideal for\nspectral interpretation and the discovery of new descriptors. The capability of\nthis procedure is showcased by considering five local structure descriptors and\na database of over fifty thousand simulated XANES spectra across eight\nfirst-row transition metal oxide families.

Inspired by the training procedure of interventional\ncardiologists for interpreting the structure of coronary arteries, we propose\nan association graph-based graph matching network (AGMN) for coronary arterial\nsemantic labeling. We first extract the vascular tree from invasive coronary\nangiography (ICA) and convert it into multiple individual graphs. Then, an\nassociation graph is constructed from two individual graphs where each vertex\nrepresents the relationship between two arterial segments. Using the\nassociation graph, the AGMN extracts the vertex features by the embedding\nmodule, aggregates the features from adjacent vertices and edges by graph\nconvolution network, and decodes the features to generate the semantic mappings\nbetween arteries. By learning the mapping of arterial branches between two\nindividual graphs, the unlabeled arterial segments are classified by the\nlabeled segments to achieve semantic labeling. A dataset containing 263 ICAs\nwas employed to train and validate the proposed model, and a five-fold\ncross-validation scheme was performed. Our AGMN model achieved an average\naccuracy of 0.8264, an average precision of 0.8276, an average recall of\n0.8264, and an average F1-score of 0.8262, which significantly outperformed\nexisting coronary artery semantic labeling methods.

At the same time, there is\na growing demand for interpretability of prediction models. To determine which\nfeatures of a dataset are important to predict a target variable $Y$, a Feature\nImportance (FI) method can be used. By quantifying how important each feature\nis for predicting $Y$, irrelevant features can be identified and removed, which\ncould increase the speed and accuracy of a model, and moreover, important\nfeatures can be discovered, which could lead to valuable insights. A major\nproblem with evaluating FI methods, is that the ground truth FI is often\nunknown. As a consequence, existing FI methods do not give the exact correct FI\nvalues. This is one of the many reasons why it can be hard to properly\ninterpret the results of an FI method. Motivated by this, we introduce a new\nglobal approach named the Berkelmans-Pries FI method, which is based on a\ncombination of Shapley values and the Berkelmans-Pries dependency function. We\nprove that our method has many useful properties, and accurately predicts the\ncorrect FI values for several cases where the ground truth FI can be derived in\nan exact manner.

In this paper, we propose a long-short diffeomorphic motion\nnetwork, which is a multi-task framework with a learnable deformation prior to\nsearch for the plausible deformation of landmark. Specifically, we design a\nnovel diffeomorphism representation in both long and short temporal domains for\ndelineating motion margins and reducing long-term cumulative tracking errors.\nTo further mitigate local anatomical ambiguity, we propose an expectation\nmaximisation motion alignment module to iteratively optimize both long and\nshort deformation, aligning to the same directional and spatial representation.\nThe proposed multi-task system can be trained in a weakly-supervised manner,\nwhich only requires few landmark annotations for tracking and zero annotation\nfor long-short deformation learning. We conduct extensive experiments on two\nultrasound landmark tracking datasets. Experimental results show that our\nproposed method can achieve better or competitive landmark tracking performance\ncompared with other state-of-the-art tracking methods, with a strong\ngeneralization capability across different scanner types and different\nultrasound modalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 22:57:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 12:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

To be competitive\nwith conventional energy-generation technologies, a thermoelectric material\nmust possess the properties of both an electrical conductor and a thermal\ninsulator. However, these properties are normally mutually exclusive because of\nthe interconnection of the scattering mechanisms for charge carriers and\nphonons. Recent theoretical investigations on sub-device scales have revealed\nthat silicon membranes covered by nanopillars exhibit a multitude of local\nphonon resonances, spanning the full spectrum, that couple with the\nheat-carrying phonons in the membrane and collectively cause a reduction in the\nin-plane thermal conductivity$-$while, in principle, not affecting the\nelectrical properties because the nanopillars are external to the pathway of\nvoltage generation and charge transport. Here this effect is demonstrated\nexperimentally for the first time by investigating device-scale suspended\nsilicon membranes with GaN nanopillars grown on the surface. The nanopillars\ncause up to 21 % reduction in the thermal conductivity while the electrical\nconductivity and the Seebeck coefficient remain unaffected, thus demonstrating\nan unprecedented decoupling in the semiconductor's thermoelectric properties.\nThe measured thermal conductivity behavior for coalesced nanopillars and\ncorresponding lattice-dynamics calculations provide further evidence that the\nreductions are mechanistically tied to the phonon resonances. This finding\nbreaks a longstanding trade-off between competing properties in\nthermoelectricity and paves the way for engineered high-efficiency solid-state\nenergy recovery and cooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

Recent work has shown that mountain-scale\nstructures at the core-mantle boundary may be highly enriched in FeO reported\nto exhibit high conductivity and metallic behavior at extreme\npressure-temperature (P-T) conditions. However, the underlying electronic\nprocesses in FeO remain poorly understood and controversial. Here we\nsystematically explore the electronic structure of B1-FeO at extreme conditions\nwith large-scale theoretical modeling using state-of-the-art embedded dynamical\nmean field theory (eDMFT). Fine sampling of the phase diagram at more than 350\nvolume-temperature conditions reveals that, instead of sharp metallization,\ncompression of FeO at high temperatures induces a gradual orbitally selective\ninsulator-metal transition. Specifically, at P-T conditions of the lower\nmantle, FeO exists in an intermediate \"quantum critical\" state, characteristic\nof strongly correlated electronic matter. Transport in this regime, distinct\nfrom insulating or metallic behavior, is marked by incoherent diffusion of\nelectrons in the conducting t_{2g} orbital and a band gap in the e_g orbital,\nresulting in moderate electrical conductivity (~ 10^5 S/m) with modest P -T\ndependence as observed in experiments. FeO-rich regions in Earth's lowermost\nmantle could thus influence electromagnetic interactions between the mantle and\nthe core, producing several features observed in Earth's rotation and magnetic\nfield evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 01:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

We in this paper generalize it to the\nstudy of timelike circular orbits in static, spherically symmetric, and\nasymptotic flat black holes. By making use of the equation of motion of the\nmassive particles, we construct a vector with its zero points exactly relating\nwith the timelike circular orbits. Since each zero point of the vector can be\nendowed with a winding number, the topology of the timelike circular orbits is\nestablished. Stable and unstable timelike circular orbits respectively have\nwinding number +1 and -1. In particular, different from that of the light ring,\nthe timelike circular orbits possess vanishing topological number and appear in\npairs for given angular momentum. Moreover, we apply the study to the\nSchwarzschild, scalarized Einstein-Maxwell, and dyonic black holes, which have\ndistinct topological configurations. It is shown that although the existence of\nscalar hair and quasi-topological term leads to richer topological\nconfigurations of the timelike circular orbits, whereas they have no influence\non the topological number. These results indicate that the topological approach\nindeed provides us a novel way to understand the timelike circular orbits.

We provide a necessary condition on the\nnetwork size and edge formation probabilities to establish the asymptotic\nnormality of the model parameters under the assumption that the graph structure\nis a stochastic block model. We evaluate the performance of our approach\nthrough simulations and apply it to estimate the joint impact of baseline\ncovariates and network effects on COVID-19 incidence rate among countries\nconnected by a network of commercial airline traffic. We find that during the\nbeginning of the pandemic the network effect has some influence, the percentage\nof urban population has more influence on the incidence rate compared to the\nnetwork effect after the travel ban was in effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 04:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

Some existing deep learning\nbased methods are devoted to improving the model performance via increasing the\ndepth or width of convolution. The learning ability of convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) structure is still under-explored. In this paper, a\ndetail-enhanced attention block (DEAB) consisting of the detail-enhanced\nconvolution (DEConv) and the content-guided attention (CGA) is proposed to\nboost the feature learning for improving the dehazing performance.\nSpecifically, the DEConv integrates prior information into normal convolution\nlayer to enhance the representation and generalization capacity. Then by using\nthe re-parameterization technique, DEConv is equivalently converted into a\nvanilla convolution with NO extra parameters and computational cost. By\nassigning unique spatial importance map (SIM) to every channel, CGA can attend\nmore useful information encoded in features. In addition, a CGA-based mixup\nfusion scheme is presented to effectively fuse the features and aid the\ngradient flow. By combining above mentioned components, we propose our\ndetail-enhanced attention network (DEA-Net) for recovering high-quality\nhaze-free images.

The crucial treatment\nleading to this controversy lies at an artificial scheme that whether the\nexternal optical frequency is taken as continuous variable or bosonic Matsubara\nfrequency to handle the gap dynamics within the Matsubara formalism. To resolve\nthis issue, we derive the effective action of the superconducting gap near\n$T_c$ in the presence of the vector potential through the path-integral\napproach, to fill the long missing blank of the microscopic derivation of the\nGinzburg-Landau Lagrangian in superconductors.

Due to the label scarcity in\npractice, semi-supervised time series classification with only a few labeled\nsamples has become popular. Recently, Similarity-aware Time Series\nClassification (SimTSC) is proposed to address this problem by using a graph\nneural network classification model on the graph generated from pairwise\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of batch data. It shows excellent accuracy\nand outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in several few-label\nsettings. However, since SimTSC relies on pairwise DTW distances, the quadratic\ncomplexity of DTW limits its usability to only reasonably sized datasets. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a new efficient semi-supervised time series\nclassification technique, LB-SimTSC, with a new graph construction module.\nInstead of using DTW, we propose to utilize a lower bound of DTW, LB_Keogh, to\napproximate the dissimilarity between instances in linear time, while retaining\nthe relative proximity relationships one would have obtained via computing DTW.\nWe construct the pairwise distance matrix using LB_Keogh and build a graph for\nthe graph neural network. We apply this approach to the ten largest datasets\nfrom the well-known UCR time series classification archive. The results\ndemonstrate that this approach can be up to 104x faster than SimTSC when\nconstructing the graph on large datasets without significantly decreasing\nclassification accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 06:49:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 03:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Some of the most significant families\ninclude the partition, Brauer and Temperley-Lieb monoids, among other diagram\nmonoids.\n  Our main result shows that the category of regular $*$-semigroups is\nisomorphic to the category of so-called `chained projection groupoids'. Such a\ngroupoid is in fact a pair $(\\mathcal G,\\varepsilon)$, where:\n  $\\bullet$ $\\mathcal G$ is an ordered groupoid, whose object set $P$ is a\nprojection algebra (in the sense of Imaoka and Jones), and\n  $\\bullet$ $\\varepsilon:\\mathscr C\\to\\mathcal G$ is a special functor, where\n$\\mathscr C$ is a certain natural `chain groupoid' constructed from $P$.\n  Roughly speaking: the groupoid $\\mathcal G$ remembers only the `easy'\nproducts in a regular $*$-semigroup $S$; the projection algebra $P$ remembers\nonly the `conjugation action' of the projections of $S$; and the functor\n$\\varepsilon$ tells us how $\\mathcal G$ and $P$ `fit together' in order to\nrecover the entire structure of $S$.

The quantile function describing the\ntarget distribution using quantile levels is critical for quantile regression.\nAlthough various parametric forms for the distributions (that the quantile\nfunction specifies) can be adopted, an everlasting problem is selecting the\nmost appropriate one that can properly approximate the data distributions.

In this paper, we first rethink semantic\nsegmentation from a perspective of similarity between pixels and class centers.\nEach weight vector of the segmentation head represents its corresponding\nsemantic class in the whole dataset, which can be regarded as the embedding of\nthe class center. Thus, the pixel-wise classification amounts to computing\nsimilarity in the final feature space between pixels and the class centers.\nUnder this novel view, we propose a Class Center Similarity layer (CCS layer)\nto address the above-mentioned challenges by generating adaptive class centers\nconditioned on different scenes and supervising the similarities between class\ncenters. It utilizes a Adaptive Class Center Module (ACCM) to generate class\ncenters conditioned on each scene, which adapt the large intra-class variation\nbetween different scenes. Specially designed loss functions are introduced to\ncontrol both inter-class and intra-class distances based on predicted\ncenter-to-center and pixel-to-center similarity, respectively.

However, these methods\ncould suffer from the inaccurate and sometimes unrealistic pseudo segmentation\ndue to the insufficient supervision and incomplete shape features. Different\nfrom previous efforts, we first investigate the principle of ''good scribble\nannotations'', which leads to efficient scribble forms via supervision\nmaximization and randomness simulation.

First, we construct the process,\nshowing that it is well-posed even when starting from non-bounded initial\nconditions. Secondly, we prove hydrodynamic limits in a diffusive scaling. The\nlimiting process follows a deterministic reaction diffusion equation. We use\nstochastic homogenization to characterize its diffusion coefficient as the\nsolution of a variational principle.

Three properties characterize\nconsensus: (1) termination, requiring correct (non-faulty) processes to\neventually reach a decision, (2) agreement, preventing them from deciding\ndifferent values, and (3) validity, precluding ``unreasonable'' decisions. But,\nwhat is a reasonable decision? Strong validity, a classical property,\nstipulates that, if all correct processes propose the same value, only that\nvalue can be decided. Weak validity, another established property, stipulates\nthat, if all processes are correct and they propose the same value, that value\nmust be decided. The space of possible validity properties is vast. However,\ntheir impact on consensus remains unclear.\n  This paper addresses the question of which validity properties allow\nByzantine consensus to be solvable with partial synchrony, and at what cost.\nFirst, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a validity property\nto make the consensus problem solvable; we say that such validity properties\nare solvable. Notably, we prove that, if n <= 3t, all solvable validity\nproperties are trivial (there exists an always-admissible decision).\nFurthermore, we show that, with any non-trivial (and solvable) validity\nproperty, consensus requires Omega(t^2) messages. This extends the seminal\nDolev-Reischuk bound, originally proven for strong validity, to all non-trivial\nvalidity properties. Lastly, we give a general Byzantine consensus algorithm,\nwe call Universal, for any solvable (and non-trivial) validity property.\nImportantly, Universal incurs O(n^2) message complexity. Thus, together with\nour lower bound, Universal implies a fundamental result in partial synchrony:\nwith t \\in Omega(n), the message complexity of all (non-trivial) consensus\nvariants is Theta(n^2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 10:28:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 07:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate how CLIP\nknowledge benefits 3D scene understanding.

For the former, we first leverage\nCLIP's text semantics to select the positive and negative point samples and\nthen employ the contrastive loss to train the 3D network.

The conditions under which dust grains\ndecouple from the dynamics of gas remain poorly constrained. We first aim to\ninvestigate the critical dust grain size for dynamical decoupling, using both\nanalytical predictions and numerical experiments. Second, we aim to set the\nrange of validity of two fundamentally different numerical implementations for\nthe evolution of dust and gas mixtures in turbulent molecular clouds. We\ncarried out a suite of numerical experiments using two different schemes.\nFirst, we used a monofluid formalism in the terminal velocity approximation\n(TVA) on a Eulerian grid. Second, we used a two-fluid scheme, in which the dust\ndynamics is handled with Lagrangian super-particles, and the gas dynamics on a\nEulerian grid. The monofluid results are in good agreement with the theoretical\ncritical size for decoupling. We report dust dynamics decoupling for Stokes\nnumber St>0.1, that is, dust grains of $s>4~\\mu$m in size. We find that the TVA\nis well suited for grain sizes of 10 $\\mu$m in molecular clouds, in particular\nin the densest regions. However, the maximum dust enrichment measured in the\nlow-density material where St>1 is questionable. In the Lagrangian dust\nexperiments, we show that the results are affected by the numerics for all dust\ngrain sizes. At St<<1, the dust dynamics is largely affected by artificial\ntrapping in the high-density regions, leading to spurious variations of the\ndust concentration. At St>1, the maximum dust enrichment is regulated by the\ngrid resolution used for the gas dynamics. The results of previous similar\nnumerical work should therefore be revisited with respect to the limitations we\nhighlight in this study. Dust enrichment of submicron dust grains is unlikely\nto occur in the densest parts of molecular clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 11:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

The turbulent wake was\nmarked with a high-Schmidt-number ($Sc$) scalar and a planar laser induced\nfluorescence (PLIF) experiment was carried out to capture the interface between\nthe wake and the ambient flow from $x/d$ = 5 to 40 where $x$ is the streamwise\ncoordinate from the centre of the cylinder and $d$ is the cylinder's diameter.\nIt is found that the TTI generally spreads faster toward the ambient flow than\nthe TNTI. A transition region of the interfaces' spreading is found at $x/d\n\\approx 15$, after which the interfaces propagate at a slower rate than\npreviously (upstream) and the mean interface positions of both TNTI and TTI\nscale with the local wake half-width. The location of both the TNTI and TTI\nhave non-Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs) in the near wake because\nof the influence of the large-scale coherent motions present within the flow.\nFurther downstream, after the large-scale coherent motions have dissipated, the\nTNTI position PDF does become Gaussian. For the first time we explore the\nspatial variation of the ``roughness'' of the TTI, quantified via the fractal\ndimension, from near field to far field. The length scale in the background\nflow has a profound effect on the TTI fractal dimension in the near wake,\nwhilst the turbulence intensity only becomes important for the fractal\ndimension farther downstream.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 12:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

First, we suggest the\ndynamic masks (DM), which enables multiple small-sized benchmark mask vectors\nto roughly learn the critical information in the image through an optimization\nmethod. Then the benchmark mask vectors guide the learning of large-sized\nauxiliary mask vectors so that their superimposed mask can accurately learn\nfine-grained pixel importance information and reduce the sensitivity to\nadversarial perturbations.

These DM modules are used to find and fuse the regions of interest\nin the remaining neural network classification decisions in the mask image in a\nlearning-based way.

The effective viscosity ($\\mu_{eff}$) of MC beneath\nMORs is recognized as the crucial factor in modulating their axial high versus\nflat topography. Based on a two-step viscosity calculation (suspension and\nsolid-melt mixture rheology), we provide a theoretical estimate of $\\mu_{eff}$\nas a function of melt suspension characteristics (crystal content,\npolymodality, polydispersity and strain-rate), and its volume fraction in the\nMC region. We then develop a numerical model to show the control of $\\mu_{eff}$\non the axial topography. Using an enthalpy-porosity-based fluid-formulation of\nuppermost mantle the model implements a one-way fluid-structure interaction\n(FSI) that transmits viscous forces of the MC region to the overlying upper\ncrust. The limiting non-rifted topographic elevations (-0.06 km to 1.27 km) of\nmodel MORs are found to occur in the viscosity range: $\\mu_{eff}$ = $10^{12}$\nto $10^{14}$ Pa s. The higher-end ($10^{13}$ to $10^{14}$) Pa s of this\nspectrum produce axial highs, which are replaced by flat or slightly negative\ntopography as $\\mu_{eff} \\leq 5\\times 10^{12}$ Pa s.

Nevertheless, many of the obstacles that have slowed progress on the\ndevelopment of traditional aspects of the theory have now been overcome, while\nnew theoretical aspects and new applications have been identified. This permits\na comprehensive account of themes addressed too in the complex case: eigenvalue\nprobability density functions and correlation functions, limit formulas for\ncorrelation functions, fluctuation formulas, sum rules, gap probabilities and\neigenvector statistics, among others. Distinct from the complex case is the\nneed to develop a theory of skew orthogonal polynomials corresponding to the\nskew inner product associated with the Pfaffian. Another distinct theme is the\nstatistics of real eigenvalues, which is unique to GinOE. These appear in a\nnumber of applications of the theory, coming from areas as diverse as diffusion\nprocesses and persistence in statistical physics, topologically driven\nparametric energy level crossings for certain quantum dots, and equilibria\ncounting for a system of random nonlinear differential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 13:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

Recently, Balmer-Sanders and\nBarthel-Hausmann-Naumann-Nikolaus-Noel-Stapleton showed that a new BSP is\nclosely related to the Zariski topology of Balmer spectrum of the category of\ncompact genuine A-spectra for a finite abelian group A. To unify these two BSP\nto one framework, we propose a general blue-shift phenomenon (GBSP) in this\npaper and have a new idea to explain it in a more conceptual way. To carry out\nour idea, we use the roots of p^j-series of formal group law of a complex\noriented spectrum E in the homotopy group of the generalized Tate spectrum of E\noriginally due to the seminal paper of Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel. This motivates us\nto go further to study the relation of roots and coefficients of a polynomial\nin a commutative ring R. And we propose a notion called n-tuple of a polynomial\nin R to obtain generalized relations of roots and coefficients of this\npolynomial in R. These generalized relations have a broad application prospect\nin reducing the relations of R, especially they play an extremely important\nrole in explaining GBSP. By taking this brand-new approach, we successfully\nachieve our idea of the explanation of GBSP for some abelian cases, and obtain\nthat the generalized Tate construction lowers Bousfield class along with many\nTate vanishing results. This strengthens and extends previous theorems of\nBalmer-Sanders and Ando-Morava-Sadofsky. Though our approach could only recover\nBarthel-Hausmann-Naumann-Nikolaus-Noel-Stapleton, it seems more accessible to\ndeal with GBSP for non-abelian cases. Besides, our approach greatly simplifies\nthe original proof of Bonventre-Guillou-Stapleton (arXiv:2204.03797), which\nshowed that its applications are not restricted to GBSP. Thus our approach\ndeserves more applications and further study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 13:56:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 07:34:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 14:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 16:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

Our Galaxy is composed of different stellar populations with varying\nchemical abundances, which are thought to imprint the composition of planet\nbuilding blocks (PBBs). As such, the properties of stars should affect the\nproperties of planets and small bodies formed in their systems. In this\ncontext, high-resolution spectroscopic surveys open a window into the chemical\nlinks between and their host stars.\n  Aims. We aim to determine the PBB composition trends for various stellar\npopulations across the Galaxy by comparing the two large spectroscopic surveys\nAPOGEE and GALAH. We assess the reliability of the PBB composition as\ndetermined with these surveys with a propagation error study.\n  Methods. Stellar spectroscopic abundances from the large surveys GALAH-DR3\nand APOGEE-DR17 were used as input with a stoichiometric condensation model. We\nclassified stars into different Galactic components and we quantified the PBB\ncomposition trends as a function of [Fe/H]. We also analysed the distribution\ncomposition patterns in the [$\\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] diagram.\n  Results. Our propagation error study suggests that the overall trends with\n[Fe/H] and [$\\alpha$/Fe] are robust, which is supported by the double study of\nboth APOGEE and GALAH. We therefore confirm the existence of a bimodal PBB\ncomposition separating the thin disc stars from the thick disc stars.\nFurthermore, we confirm that the stoichiometric water PBB content is\nanti-correlated with [Fe/H].\n  Conclusions. Our results imply that metal-poor stars both in the thin and\nthick disks are suitable hosts for water-rich PBBs and for ice-rich small\nbodies. However, for metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<0), the PBBs around thick disc\nstars should have a higher water content than that around thin disc stars\nbecause of the $\\alpha$-contentdependence of the water mass fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 14:02:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

A cyber\ncriminal can register such domains to establish periodically changing\nrendezvous points with the bots. DGAs make use of seeds to generate sets of\ndomains. Seeds can easily be changed in order to generate entirely new groups\nof domains while using the same underlying algorithm. While this requires very\nlittle manual effort for an adversary, security specialists typically have to\nmanually reverse engineer new malware strains to reconstruct the seeds. Only\nwhen the seed and DGA are known, past and future domains can be generated,\nefficiently attributed, blocked, sinkholed or used for a take-down.

One is to stop gradients from the vision-language training when learning\nthe language encoder. The other is to leverage the vision-language training to\nguide the learning of the vision encoder. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets show that X-FM can significantly outperform existing general\nfoundation models and perform better than or comparable to existing foundation\nmodels specifically for language, vision, or vision-language understanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 15:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

Most $\\alpha\\omega$ solar dynamo models rely on\ndifferential rotation in the solar tachocline to generate a strong toroidal\nfield. The most problematic part of such models is then the production of the\nlarge-scale poloidal field, via a process known as the $\\alpha$-effect. Whilst\nthis is usually attributed to small-scale convective motions under the\ninfluence of rotation, the efficiency of this regenerative process has been\ncalled into question by some numerical simulations. Motivated by likely\nconditions within the tachocline, the aim of this paper is to investigate an\nalternative mechanism for the poloidal field regeneration, namely the magnetic\nbuoyancy instability in a shear-generated, rotating magnetic layer. We use a\nlocal, fully compressible model in which an imposed vertical shear winds up an\ninitially vertical magnetic field. The field ultimately becomes buoyantly\nunstable, and we measure the resulting mean electromotive force (EMF). For\nsufficiently rapid rotation, we find that a significant component of the mean\nEMF is aligned with the direction of the mean magnetic field, which is the\ncharacteristic feature of the classical $\\alpha\\omega$-dynamo model. Our\nresults therefore suggest that magnetic buoyancy could contribute directly to\nthe generation of large-scale poloidal field in the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 15:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

Second, if\nclimate change was not influential, what factors were important for predicting\nfinancial wellbeing of the farm. And third, ascertain whether observed effects\non the financial wellbeing of the farm were a result of interactions between\npredictor variables. This is the first report directly comparing climate change\nwith other factors potentially impacting financial wellbeing of farms. Certain\nclimate change factors, namely increases in temperature and reductions in\nprecipitation, can regionally impact self-perceived financial wellbeing of\nfruit farmers. Specifically, increases in temperature and reduction in\nprecipitation can have a measurable negative impact on the financial wellbeing\nof farms in Chile. This effect is less pronounced in Tunisia. Climate impact\ndifferences were observed within Chile but not in Tunisia. However, climate\nchange is only of minor importance for predicting farm financial wellbeing,\nespecially for farms already doing financially well. Factors that are more\nimportant, mainly in Tunisia, included trust in information sources and prior\nfarm ownership.

However, if the\nmechanical compliance of the thermal diode is poor, which prevents its intimate\ncontact with heat source or sink surfaces, the thermal rectification\nperformance cannot be used to its full extent. In this work, we introduce a\nheterojunction thermal diode made of a phase change material (PCM) consisting\nof dual alkanes (hexadecane and paraffine wax) and polyurethane. The fabricated\nthermal diode exhibits an ultra soft mechanical feature, with a low elastic\nmodulus of 0.4 KPa and larger than 300% elongation until failure: the best\nvalues reported to date for thermal diodes. The measured thermal rectification\nfactor is as high as 1.42 that in line with the theoretical model prediction.\nMolecular dynamic simulations reveal that the thermal rectification mechanism\nof the PCM based thermal diode originates from the crystal-amorphous phase\ntransition of the hexadecane terminal as the temperature bias flips.

However, their accuracy\nand reliability vary under different settings and for different age groups and\nhealth conditions. A main limitation of the existing oscillometric monitors is\ntheir underlying analysis algorithms that are unable to fully capture the BP\ninformation encoded in the pattern of the recorded oscillometric pulses. In\nthis paper, we propose a new 2D oscillometric data representation that enables\na full characterization of arterial system and empowers the application of deep\nlearning to extract the most informative features correlated with BP. A hybrid\nconvolutional-recurrent neural network was developed to capture the\noscillometric pulses morphological information as well as their temporal\nevolution over the cuff deflation period from the 2D structure, and estimate\nBP. The performance of the proposed method was verified on three oscillometric\ndatabases collected from the wrist and upper arms of 245 individuals. It was\nfound that it achieves a mean error and a standard deviation of error of as low\nas 0.08 mmHg and 2.4 mmHg in the estimation of systolic BP, and 0.04 mmHg and\n2.2 mmHg in the estimation of diastolic BP, respectively.

Fibre optic-based delay lines can realize the large delay\nrequired for low phase noise systems whilst simultaneously achieving insertion\nloss levels that can be compensated by available microwave and photonic\namplification technologies. However, the long fibre is vulnerable to\nenvironmental perturbations such as mechanical vibrations and variations in\nambient temperature, which result in short term fluctuations and thermally\ninduced drift of the oscillation frequency. The phase shifter used\nconventionally to adjust the frequency of an OEO to enable phase lock has a\nfinite range that is insufficient to compensate the delay change resulting from\noperational temperature ranges. A solution to continuous tuning without\nmode-hopping and to compensation of thermally induced frequency drift without\nloss of lock of a time delay oscillator is proposed. The basic concept is to\nintroduce a tuning mechanism that works with Cartesian co-ordinates on the\ncomplex plane and to avoid explicit use of polar co-ordinates. Consequently,\nthe transmission of the tuning component may traverse the unit circle in either\ndirection multiple times without range limitation to the phase. Thereby tuning\nby mode-hopping is avoided and expedients to stabilisation, such as the use of\ntunable lasers within a control loop or precision temperature stabilisation\nmeasures are not required. The concept is verified by Simulink simulations. The\nmethod has been experimentally tested successfully using a prototype OEO phase\nlocked to a system reference. Solid lock was maintained even when the OEO was\nplaced in an oven and cycled over a temperature range from ambient to 80\n{\\deg}C.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 00:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

The\ncomputational protocols typically adopted to protect individual privacy include\nsharing summary statistics, such as allele frequencies, or limiting query\nresponses to the presence/absence of alleles of interest using web-services\ncalled Beacons. However, even such limited releases are susceptible to\nlikelihood-ratio-based membership-inference attacks. Several approaches have\nbeen proposed to preserve privacy, which either suppress a subset of genomic\nvariants or modify query responses for specific variants (e.g., adding noise,\nas in differential privacy). However, many of these approaches result in a\nsignificant utility loss, either suppressing many variants or adding a\nsubstantial amount of noise. In this paper, we introduce optimization-based\napproaches to explicitly trade off the utility of summary data or Beacon\nresponses and privacy with respect to membership-inference attacks based on\nlikelihood-ratios, combining variant suppression and modification. We consider\ntwo attack models. In the first, an attacker applies a likelihood-ratio test to\nmake membership-inference claims. In the second model, an attacker uses a\nthreshold that accounts for the effect of the data release on the separation in\nscores between individuals in the dataset and those who are not. We further\nintroduce highly scalable approaches for approximately solving the\nprivacy-utility tradeoff problem when information is either in the form of\nsummary statistics or presence/absence queries. Finally, we show that the\nproposed approaches outperform the state of the art in both utility and privacy\nthrough an extensive evaluation with public datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 19:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}
