The recursion of the filtering can be characterized by the\ncomposition of Perron-Frobenius operator and likelihood operator.

While such methods are fast at test-time and achieve good\nresults for specific data distributions, they are sensitive to the distribution\ndrift of the scattered fields, common in practice.

Transverse oscillations are ubiquitously observed in the solar\ncorona, both in coronal loops and open magnetic flux tubes. Numerical\nsimulations suggest that their dissipation could heat coronal loops,\ncounterbalancing radiative losses. These models rely on a continuous driver at\nthe footpoint of the loops. However, analytical works predict that transverse\nwaves are subject to a cut-off in the transition region. It is thus unclear\nwhether they can reach the corona, and indeed heat coronal loops. Aims. Our\naims are to determine how the cut-off of kink waves affects their propagation\ninto the corona, and to characterize the variation of the cut-off frequency\nwith altitude. Methods. Using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we modelled\nthe propagation of kink waves in a magnetic flux tube, embedded in a realistic\natmosphere with thermal conduction, that starts in the chromosphere and extends\ninto the corona. We drove kink waves at four different frequencies, and\ndetermined whether they experienced a cut-off. We then calculated the altitude\nat which the waves were cut-off, and compared it to the prediction of several\nanalytical models. Results. We show that kink waves indeed experience a cut-off\nin the transition region, and we identified the analytical model that gives the\nbest predictions. In addition, we show that waves with periods shorter than\napproximately 500 s can still reach the corona by tunnelling through the\ntransition region, with little to no attenuation of their amplitude. This means\nthat such waves can still propagate from the footpoints of loop, and result in\nheating in the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 19:51:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 13:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

The core contribution is a set of novel excess risk\nbounds of M-SPP derived through the lens of algorithmic stability theory.\nParticularly under smoothness and quadratic growth conditions, we show that\nM-SPP with minibatch-size $n$ and iteration count $T$ enjoys an in-expectation\nfast rate of convergence consisting of an\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{T^2}\\right)$ bias decaying term and an\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{nT}\\right)$ variance decaying term. In the\nsmall-$n$-large-$T$ setting, this result substantially improves the best known\nresults of SPP-type approaches by revealing the impact of noise level of model\non convergence rate. In the complementary small-$T$-large-$n$ regime, we\nprovide a two-phase extension of M-SPP to achieve comparable convergence rates.\nMoreover, we derive a near-tight high probability (over the randomness of data)\nbound on the parameter estimation error of a sampling-without-replacement\nvariant of M-SPP.

To address this issue, we\npropose a transceiver cooperative learning-assisted semantic communication\n(TCL-SC) scheme against mismatched KBs.

We will show that the\npresence of these metal ions modifies the charge state of NV centers inside the\nND, which can then be read out by measuring their photoluminescence spectrum.\nOur work paves the way for designing selective biosensors based on NV centers\nin diamond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 01:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

With\ndatacenters exceeding 100MW, they can affect grid dynamics, so doing this\nwithout damaging grid performance is difficult.\n  We study power adaptation algorithms that use grid metrics and seek to reduce\ndatacenter (DC) operational carbon emissions. First, we consider local, online\nadaptation. Second, to reduce grid disruption that can arise from adaptation,\nwe consider using an external coordinator that limits aggregate impact.\nFinally, we study a novel cooperative scheme, where datacenters first create a\nfull-day adapted power plan, based on day-ahead information, and then share it\nwith the power grid. This novel approach is a partnership that reflects the\nshared responsibility between datacenter and the grid for carbon minimization.\nFor each, we report DC carbon emissions reduction and grid impacts.\n  Results show that PlanShare, the novel cooperative scheme is superior to all\nonline approaches considered, achieving a net benefit of 12.6% reduction in\ndatacenter operational carbon emissions. PlanShare achieves 26%--132% better\nperformance than the best online approach, and far larger for many.

High censoring rates, common in events with long\ntime horizons, further limit available training data and exacerbate the risk of\noverfitting.

Then, the blipped-SMSlab\ndMRI sequence is designed, with blipped-CAIPI gradients for inter-slab\nencoding, and a 2D multi-band accelerated navigator for inter-kz-shot phase\ncorrection. Third, strategies are developed to remove the phase interferences,\nby RF phase modulation and/or phase correction during reconstruction, thus\ndecoupling intra-slab and inter-slab encodings that are otherwise entangled.

However, in\nprevious studies, the conditions were often conducive for relational search,\nallowing successfully selecting the target relationally on 50% of trials or\nmore. Moreover, the search displays were often only sparsely populated and\npresented repeatedly, rendering it possible that relational search was based on\ncontext learning and not spontaneous. The present study tested the shape of the\nattentional tuning function in 36-item search displays, when the target never\nhad a maximal feature value (e.g., was never the reddest or yellowest item),\nand when only the target colour but not the context colour was known. The first\nfixations on a trial showed that these displays still reliably evoked\nrelational search, even when participants had no advance information about the\ncontext and no on-task training. Context learning further strengthened\nrelational tuning on subsequent trials, but was not necessary for relational\nsearch. Analysing the progression of visual search within a singe trial showed\nthat attention is first guided to the relationally maximal item (e.g.,\nreddest), then the next-maximal (e.g., next-reddest) item, and so forth, before\nattention can hone in on target-matching features. In sum, the results support\ntwo tenets of the relational account, that information about the dominant\nfeature in a display can be rapidly extracted and used to guide attention to\nthe relatively best-matching features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 03:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Motivated by previous\nexperimental observations, the failure pattern of particle rafts under uniform\nradial expansion is reported in this paper. The expansion process is\nspecifically designed to expand the system affinely in the radial direction and\nto keep the velocity gradient constant throughout. A strong resemblance to the\nresults of particle rafts under uniform uniaxial expansion[1] is found. The\nsize of the cluster emerging as the rafts are pulled apart scales inversely\nwith the pulling velocity. This is a result of two competing velocities: the\ninter-particle separation speed provided by the flow and a size-dependent\nrelaxation speed for clustering. A model, generalized from a one-dimensional\nlinear (in)stability calculation, is in agreement with the failure morphology\nfound for this radially expanded system. Nonlinear relaxation and particle\nrearrangement is observed after the initial clustering occurs. This is a\nfeature unique to a two-dimensional system.

Despite the success,\nexisting deep learning-based shadow removal methods still produce images with\nshadow remnants. These shadow remnants typically exist in homogeneous regions\nwith low intensity values, making them untraceable in the existing\nimage-to-image mapping paradigm. We observe from our experiments that shadows\nmainly degrade object colors at the image structure level (in which humans\nperceive object outlines filled with continuous colors). Hence, in this paper,\nwe propose to remove shadows at the image structure level. Based on this idea,\nwe propose a novel structure-informed shadow removal network (StructNet) to\nleverage the image structure information to address the shadow remnant problem.\nSpecifically, StructNet first reconstructs the structure information of the\ninput image without shadows and then uses the restored shadow-free structure\nprior to guiding the image-level shadow removal. StructNet contains two main\nnovel modules: (1) a mask-guided shadow-free extraction (MSFE) module to\nextract image structural features in a non-shadow to shadow directional manner,\nand (2) a multi-scale feature & residual aggregation (MFRA) module to leverage\nthe shadow-free structure information to regularize feature consistency. In\naddition, we also propose to extend StructNet to exploit multi-level structure\ninformation (MStructNet), to further boost the shadow removal performance with\nminimum computational overheads. Extensive experiments on three shadow removal\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing shadow removal\nmethods, and our StructNet can be integrated with existing methods to boost\ntheir performances further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 06:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

It is desired\nto leverage recent development in deep learning to automatically detect\nmetastatic LNs. Besides a two-stage detection network, we here introduce an\nadditional branch to leverage information about LN stations, an important\nreference for radiologists during metastatic LN diagnosis, as supplementary\ninformation for metastatic LN detection. The branch targets to solve a closely\nrelated task on the LN station level, i.e., classifying whether an LN station\ncontains metastatic LN or not, so as to learn representations for LN stations.\nConsidering that a metastatic LN station is expected to significantly affect\nthe nearby ones, a GCN-based structure is adopted by the branch to model the\nrelationship among different LN stations. At the classification stage of\nmetastatic LN detection, the above learned LN station features, as well as the\nfeatures reflecting the distance between the LN candidate and the LN stations,\nare integrated with the LN features.

An accelerated form of the HPM is combined with the\nElzaki transformation to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the method. One\nof the significant advantages of the technique lies over the classic numerical\nmethods as it allows solving the linear and non-linear differential equations\nwithout discretization.

The novelty of the scheme is shown by comparing the numerical\nfindings with the existing results obtained via ADM, HPM, HAM and ODM for\nnon-linear coagulation equation. This motivates us to extend the scheme for\nsolving the other models mentioned above. The supremacy of the proposed scheme\nis demonstrated by taking several numerical examples for each problem.

However, due to the instability of AIGC models, e.g.,\nthe stochastic nature of diffusion models, the quality and accuracy of the\ngenerated content can vary significantly. In wireless edge networks, the\ntransmission of incorrectly generated content may unnecessarily consume network\nresources. Thus, a dynamic AIGC service provider (ASP) selection scheme is\nrequired to enable users to connect to the most suited ASP, improving the\nusers' satisfaction and quality of generated content. In this article, we first\nreview the AIGC techniques and their applications in wireless networks. We then\npresent the AIGC-as-a-service (AaaS) concept and discuss the challenges in\ndeploying AaaS at the edge networks. Yet, it is essential to have performance\nmetrics to evaluate the accuracy of AIGC services. Thus, we introduce several\nimage-based perceived quality evaluation metrics. Then, we propose a general\nand effective model to illustrate the relationship between computational\nresources and user-perceived quality evaluation metrics. To achieve efficient\nAaaS and maximize the quality of generated content in wireless edge networks,\nwe propose a deep reinforcement learning-enabled algorithm for optimal ASP\nselection.

In recent\nyears, the tremendous progress with SAT and SMT solvers enabled the\nconstruction of a new generation of tools that promise to make formal\nverification more accessible for software engineers, by automating most if not\nall of the verification process. The Dafny system is a prominent example of\nthat trend. However, little evidence exists yet about its accessibility. To\nhelp fill this gap, we conducted a set of 10 case studies of developing\nverified implementations in Dafny of some real-world algorithms and data\nstructures, to determine its accessibility for software engineers. We found\nthat, on average, the amount of code written for specification and verification\npurposes is of the same order of magnitude as the traditional code written for\nimplementation and testing purposes (ratio of 1.14) -- an ``overhead'' that\ncertainly pays off for high-integrity software. The performance of the Dafny\nverifier was impressive, with 2.4 proof obligations generated per line of code\nwritten, and 24 ms spent per proof obligation generated and verified, on\naverage.

This is a challenging inverse problem,\nyet one that if solved could have a significant impact on many engineering\napplications. The exploitation of such an inverse logic has gained interest in\nrecent years with the advent of widely available cheap but capable MEMS-based\nsensors. When combined with novel data-driven methods, these sensors may allow\nfor flow reconstruction around immersed structures, benefiting applications\nsuch as unmanned airborne/underwater vehicle path planning or control and\nstructural health monitoring of wind turbine blades. In this work, we train\ndeep reversible Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to perform flow sensing (flow\nreconstruction) around two-dimensional aerodynamic shapes: airfoils. Motivated\nby recent work, which has shown that GNNs can be powerful alternatives to\nmesh-based forward physics simulators, we implement a Message-Passing Neural\nNetwork to simultaneously reconstruct both the pressure and velocity fields\nsurrounding simulated airfoils based on their surface pressure distributions,\nwhilst additionally gathering useful farfield properties in the form of context\nvectors. We generate a unique dataset of Computational Fluid Dynamics\nsimulations by simulating random, yet meaningful combinations of input boundary\nconditions and airfoil shapes. We show that despite the challenges associated\nwith reconstructing the flow around arbitrary airfoil geometries in high\nReynolds turbulent inflow conditions, our framework is able to generalize well\nto unseen cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 09:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

We define causal quantities based on potential outcomes and\nestablish nonparametric identification results with a binary instrumental\nvariable. We extend the traditional Wald estimation to deal with point process\ntreatment and outcome, showing that it should be performed after a Fourier\ntransform of the intention-to-treat effects on the treatment and outcome and\nthus takes the form of deconvolution. We term this as the generalised Wald\nestimation and propose an estimation strategy based on well-established\ndeconvolution methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 10:23:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Although SF-BC have been\nemployed in the pioneering work of Lorenzani & Tilgner (J.

In a wide range of systems, the wave kinetic\nequation is derived from a fundamental equation of wave motion, which is\nsymmetric through time-reversal. By contrast, the corresponding wave kinetic\nequation is time-irreversible. A similar paradox appears whenever one makes a\nmesoscopic description of the evolution of a very large number of microscopic\ndegrees of freedom. Recently, it has been understood that the kinetic\ndescription itself, at a mesoscopic level, should not break time-reversal\nsymmetry. The proper theoretical or mathematical tool to derive a mesoscopic\ntime-reversal stochastic process is large deviation theory, for which the\ndeterministic wave kinetic equation appears as the most probable evolution.\nThis paper follows Bouchet (2020) and a series of other works that derive the\nlarge deviation Hamiltonians of the classical kinetic theories. We propose a\nderivation of the large deviation principle for the linear scattering of waves\nby a weak random potential in an inhomogeneous situation. This problem involves\nmicroscopic scales corresponding to the typical wavelengths and periods of the\nwaves and mesoscopic ones which are the scales of spatial inhomogeneities in\nthe spectral density and the time needed for the random scatterers to alter the\nwave spectrum. The main assumption of the kinetic regime is a large separation\nof these microscopic and mesoscopic scales. We choose a generic model of wave\nscattering by weak disorder: the Schr\\\"odinger equation with a random\npotential. We derive the path large deviation principle for the local spectral\ndensity and discuss its main properties. We show that the mesoscopic process\nobeys a time-reversal symmetry at the level of large deviations.

With the recent\nadvances in deep learning (DL), an increasing number of APR techniques have\nbeen proposed to leverage neural networks to learn bug-fixing patterns from\nmassive open-source code repositories. Such learning-based techniques usually\ntreat APR as a neural machine translation (NMT) task, where buggy code snippets\n(i.e., source language) are translated into fixed code snippets (i.e., target\nlanguage) automatically. Benefiting from the powerful capability of DL to learn\nhidden relationships from previous bug-fixing datasets, learning-based APR\ntechniques have achieved remarkable performance. In this paper, we provide a\nsystematic survey to summarize the current state-of-the-art research in the\nlearning-based APR community. We illustrate the general workflow of\nlearning-based APR techniques and detail the crucial components, including\nfault localization, patch generation, patch ranking, patch validation, and\npatch correctness phases. We then discuss the widely-adopted datasets and\nevaluation metrics and outline existing empirical studies.

Leveraging\non some Pareto optimizers, recent work has shifted from tuning for a single,\ntime-related performance objective to two intrinsically different objectives\nthat assess distinct performance aspects of the system, each with varying\naspirations. Before we design better optimizers, a crucial engineering decision\nto make therein is how to handle the performance requirements with clear\naspirations in the tuning process. For this, the community takes two\nalternative optimization models: either quantifying and incorporating the\naspirations into the search objectives that guide the tuning, or not\nconsidering the aspirations during the search but purely using them in the\nlater decision-making process only. However, despite being a crucial decision\nthat determines how an optimizer can be designed and tailored, there is a\nrather limited understanding of which optimization model should be chosen under\nwhat particular circumstance, and why.\n  In this paper, we seek to close this gap. Firstly, we do that through a\nreview of over 426 papers in the literature and 14 real-world requirements\ndatasets.

As an alternative, we adapt\ndifferent tradeoff models in different phases and propose a novel algorithm\ncalled ATM-R. In the infeasible phase, ATM-R takes the tradeoff between\ndiversity and feasibility into account, aiming to move the population toward\nfeasible regions from diverse search directions. In the semi-feasible phase,\nATM-R promotes the transition from \"the tradeoff between feasibility and\ndiversity\" to \"the tradeoff between diversity and convergence\", which can\nfacilitate the discovering of enough feasible regions and speed up the search\nfor the feasible Pareto optima in succession.

(2021) for Dutch and is made publicly available. We\ntrained a sequence classification model, based on the Dutch language model\nRobBERT (Delobelle et al. 2020). For every word in the input sequence, the\nmodels predicts a punctuation marker that follows the word. We have also\nextended a multilingual model, for cases where the language is unknown or where\ncode switching applies. When performing the task of segmentation, the\napplication of the best models onto out of domain test data, a sliding window\nof 200 words of the ASR output stream is sent to the classifier, and\nsegmentation is applied when the system predicts a segmenting punctuation sign\nwith a ratio above threshold. Results show to be much better than a machine\ntranslation baseline approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 13:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

However, they still\nsuffer from two drawbacks: (i) learning individual features without considering\nthe entire task may result in limited representation capability, and (ii)\nexisting alignment strategies are sensitive to noises and misaligned instances.\nTo handle the two limitations, we propose a novel Hybrid Relation guided\ntemporal Set Matching (HyRSM++) approach for few-shot action recognition. The\ncore idea of HyRSM++ is to integrate all videos within the task to learn\ndiscriminative representations and involve a robust matching technique. To be\nspecific, HyRSM++ consists of two key components, a hybrid relation module and\na temporal set matching metric. Given the basic representations from the\nfeature extractor, the hybrid relation module is introduced to fully exploit\nassociated relations within and cross videos in an episodic task and thus can\nlearn task-specific embeddings. Subsequently, in the temporal set matching\nmetric, we carry out the distance measure between query and support videos from\na set matching perspective and design a Bi-MHM to improve the resilience to\nmisaligned instances. In addition, we explicitly exploit the temporal coherence\nin videos to regularize the matching process. Furthermore, we extend the\nproposed HyRSM++ to deal with the more challenging semi-supervised few-shot\naction recognition and unsupervised few-shot action recognition tasks.\nExperimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance under various few-shot settings.

However, generic methods to ensure such structure is\nsalient in the low-dimensional representations are lacking. This negatively\nimpacts the interpretability of low-dimensional embeddings, and plausibly\ndownstream learning tasks. To address this issue, we introduce topological\nregularization: a generic approach based on algebraic topology to incorporate\ntopological prior knowledge into low-dimensional embeddings.

An extensive\nwork over several decades has led to thousands of papers on this subject, and\nto many well-performing algorithms for this task. Indeed, 10 years ago, these\nachievements have led some researchers to suspect that \"Denoising is Dead\", in\nthe sense that all that can be achieved in this domain has already been\nobtained. However, this turned out to be far from the truth, with the\npenetration of deep learning (DL) into image processing. The era of DL brought\na revolution to image denoising, both by taking the lead in today's ability for\nnoise removal in images, and by broadening the scope of denoising problems\nbeing treated. Our paper starts by describing this evolution, highlighting in\nparticular the tension and synergy that exist between classical approaches and\nmodern DL-based alternatives in design of image denoisers.\n  The recent transitions in the field of image denoising go far beyond the\nability to design better denoisers. In the 2nd part of this paper we focus on\nrecently discovered abilities and prospects of image denoisers. We expose the\npossibility of using denoisers to serve other problems, such as regularizing\ngeneral inverse problems and serving as the prime engine in diffusion-based\nimage synthesis. We also unveil the idea that denoising and other inverse\nproblems might not have a unique solution as common algorithms would have us\nbelieve. Instead, we describe constructive ways to produce randomized and\ndiverse high quality results for inverse problems, all fueled by the progress\nthat DL brought to image denoising.\n  This survey paper aims to provide a broad view of the history of image\ndenoising and closely related topics. Our aim is to give a better context to\nrecent discoveries, and to the influence of DL in our domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 14:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

As buildings consume one-third of global\nenergy and almost half of this energy accounts for Heating, Ventilation, and\nAir Conditioning (HVAC) systems, HVAC are suitable for shifting their\nelectricity consumption in time. To this end, intelligent control strategies\nare necessary as the conventional control of HVAC is not optimized for the\nactual demand of occupants and the current situation in the electricity grid.\nIn this paper, we present the novel multi-zone controller Price Storage Control\n(PSC) that not only considers room-individual Occupants' Thermal Satisfaction\n(OTS), but also the available energy storage, and energy prices.

Multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) has recently become a trending paradigm for\nsolving this challenge. However, existing MARL-based methods adopt\naction-making steps as the metric for exploration efficiency by assuming all\nthe agents are acting in a fully synchronous manner: i.e., every single agent\nproduces an action simultaneously and every single action is executed\ninstantaneously at each time step. Despite its mathematical simplicity, such a\nsynchronous MARL formulation can be problematic for real-world robotic\napplications. It can be typical that different robots may take slightly\ndifferent wall-clock times to accomplish an atomic action or even periodically\nget lost due to hardware issues. Simply waiting for every robot being ready for\nthe next action can be particularly time-inefficient. Therefore, we propose an\nasynchronous MARL solution, Asynchronous Coordination Explorer (ACE), to tackle\nthis real-world challenge. We first extend a classical MARL algorithm,\nmulti-agent PPO (MAPPO), to the asynchronous setting and additionally apply\naction-delay randomization to enforce the learned policy to generalize better\nto varying action delays in the real world. Moreover, each navigation agent is\nrepresented as a team-size-invariant CNN-based policy, which greatly benefits\nreal-robot deployment by handling possible robot lost and allows\nbandwidth-efficient intra-agent communication through low-dimensional CNN\nfeatures. We first validate our approach in a grid-based scenario. Both\nsimulation and real-robot results show that ACE reduces over 10% actual\nexploration time compared with classical approaches.

Some\nstudies hint that a host galaxy mass bias may exist for IIn supernovae. This\npaper aims to provide an updated local IIn supernova-to-core-collapse ratio\nbased on data from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and the Zwicky Transient\nFacility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS). Furthermore, the goal is to\ninvestigate the dependency of the IIn supernova peak magnitude on the host\ngalaxy mass and the consequences of a possible host galaxy mass preference on\nthe volumetric rate of type IIn supernovae. We constructed approximately\nvolume-limited subsamples to determine the local IIn supernova-to-core-collapse\nratio. We investigated the absolute peak magnitude of a subsample of type IIn\nand superluminous II or IIn supernovae exploring how this relates to the i-band\nmagnitude of the host galaxies (as a proxy for stellar mass). We presented a\nmethod to quantify the effect of a potential preference for low-mass host\ngalaxies utilizing the UniverseMachine algorithm.

We capture\ncommuters' travel choices with a discrete choice model, resulting in a\nlarge-scale, mixed-integer, non-convex optimization problem. To solve this\nchallenging problem, we develop a two-stage decomposition with the pricing\ndecisions in the first stage and a mixed-integer linear optimization problem\noptimizing fare discounts and the induced passenger behaviors in the second\nstage. To solve the decomposition, we develop a new solution approach combining\ntailored coordinate descent, parsimonious second-stage evaluations, and\ninterpolations using special ordered sets. This approach, enhanced by\nacceleration techniques based on slanted traversal, randomization and\nwarm-start, significantly improves system-wide practical outcomes over\nalgorithmic benchmarks. Different alliance priorities result in qualitatively\ndifferent fare designs: flat fares decrease the total vehicle-miles traveled,\nwhile geographically-informed discounts improve passenger happiness. The model\nresponds appropriately to equity-oriented and passenger-centric priorities,\nimproving system utilization and lowering prices for low-income residents and\nlong-distance commuters. Finally, our revenue allocation mechanism improves\noutcomes for both operators, thus incentivizing profit-oriented MOD operators\nto adopt transit priorities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 15:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Here, we\ninvestigate the thermal properties of low-cost, low-quality, macro-porous\ngraphite to determine the tradeoff between cost and thermal performance. We use\nlaser flash analysis (LFA) to measure the thermal diffusivity of graphite at\nhigh temperatures.

We therefore develop a methodology based on finite element modeling\nof a variety of sample/coating interface profiles to extract properties of the\nsample.

In our research we try to apply machine translation\nmethods to a dialect/standard (or modern) Arabic pair to automatically produce\na standard Arabic text from a dialect input, a process we call ''automatic\nstandardization''. we opt here for the application of ''statistical models''\nbecause ''automatic standardization'' based on rules is more hard with the lack\nof ''diglossic'' dictionaries on the one hand and the difficulty of creating\nlinguistic rules for each dialect on the other. Carrying out this research\ncould then lead to combining ''automatic standardization'' software and\nautomatic translation software so that we take the output of the first software\nand introduce it as input into the second one to obtain at the end a quality\nmachine translation. This approach may also have educational applications such\nas the development of applications to help understand different Arabic dialects\nby transforming dialectal texts into standard Arabic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 15:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

In ML, it can lead to a higher accuracy,\na faster learning process, and ultimately a simpler and more understandable\nmodel. In data mining, identifying significant features is essential not only\nfor gaining a better understanding of the data but also for visualization. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate a new way of identifying significant features\ninspired by analogical proportions. Such a proportion is of the form of \"a is\nto b as c is to d\", comparing two pairs of items (a, b) and (c, d) in terms of\nsimilarities and dissimilarities. In a classification context, if the\nsimilarities/dissimilarities between a and b correlate with the fact that a and\nb have different labels, this knowledge can be transferred to c and d,\ninferring that c and d also have different labels. From a feature selection\nperspective, observing a huge number of such pairs (a, b) where a and b have\ndifferent labels provides a hint about the importance of the features where a\nand b differ. Following this idea, we introduce the Analogical Relevance Index\n(ARI), a new statistical test of the significance of a given feature with\nrespect to the label. ARI is a filter-based method. Filter-based methods are\nML-agnostic but generally unable to handle feature redundancy. However, ARI can\ndetect feature redundancy. Our experiments show that ARI is effective and\noutperforms well-known methods on a variety of artificial and some real\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2023 23:53:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

In\nthis paper we study, with the help of the exit basins and the escape time\ndistributions, how an external perturbation, be it dissipation or periodic\nforcing with a random phase, can enhance or mitigate the unpredictability of a\nsystem that exhibit chaotic scattering. In fact, if basin boundaries have the\nWada property, predictability becomes very complicated, since the basin\nboundaries start to intermingle, what means that there are points of different\nbasins close to each other. The main responsible of this unpredictability is\nthe external forcing with random phase, while the dissipation can recompose the\nbasin boundaries and turn the system more predictable. Therefore, we do the\nnecessary simulations to find out the values of dissipation and external\nforcing for which the exit basins present the Wada property. Through these\nnumerical simulations, we show that the presence of the Wada basins have a\nspecific relation with the damping, the forcing amplitude and the energy value.\nOur approach consists on investigating the dynamics of the system in order to\ngain knowledge able to control the unpredictability due to the Wada basins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 10:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-12"}

An analogous approach can also be applied to the\nmechanical loads on a wind turbine, such as generator torque. The constructed\nSDE consists of the deterministic and stochastic terms, the latter\ncorresponding to the highly fluctuating behavior of the wind turbine. Here we\nshow how advanced stochastic analysis of the noise contribution can be used to\nshow different operating modes of the conversion process of a wind turbine.

The\ndifference in the noise contributions indicates different operational regions.\nIn particular, we observe that the jump character or discontinuity in power\nproduction has a significant contribution in the regions where the control\nsystem switches strategies.
