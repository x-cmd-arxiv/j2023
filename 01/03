Highly excited molecular hydrogen H2 has been observed in many\nregions of shocked molecular gas.

Doppler-shifted CO line\nemission from outflows is also often the most prominent manifestation of deeply\nembedded early-stage star formation.

Most of the existing approaches for enforcing temporal-consistency\nsuffers from one or more of the following drawbacks.

This\nstudy designs the mmWave link quality prediction method and conducts realistic\nindoor experiments, where the link quality fluctuates significantly due to\nhuman blockage, using commercially available IEEE 802.11ad-based 60 GHz\nwireless LAN devices and Kinect v2 RGB-D camera and Velodyne VLP-16 light\ndetection and ranging (LiDAR) for point cloud acquisition. The experimental\nresults showed that our proposed method can predict future large attenuation of\nmmWave received signal strength and throughput induced by the LOS path blockage\nby pedestrians with comparable or superior accuracy to image-based prediction\nmethods. Hence, our point cloud-based method can serve as a viable alternative\nto image-based methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 16:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 05:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

The majority of these algorithms are however intrusive in the\nsense that the High-Fidelity (HF) code must be modified. To address this issue,\nnon-intrusive strategies are employed. The NIRB two-grid method uses the HF\ncode solely as a ``black-box'', requiring no code modification. Like other\nRBMs, it is based on an offline-online decomposition.

The setting for our result is a horizontally infinite, finite depth\nlayer of compressible, barotropic, viscous fluid, modeled by the free boundary\ncompressible Navier-Stokes equations in dimension $n \\ge 2$. The bottom\nboundary of the fluid is flat and rigid, while the top is a moving free\nboundary. A constant gravitational field acts normal to the flat bottom. We\nallow external forces to act in the fluid's bulk and external stresses to act\non its free surface. These are posited to be in traveling wave form, i.e.\ntime-independent when viewed in a coordinate system moving at a constant,\nnontrivial velocity parallel to the lower rigid boundary.\n  In the absence of such external sources of stress and force, the fluid system\nreverts to equilibrium, which corresponds to a flat, quiescent fluid layer with\nvertically stratified density. In contrast, when such sources of stress or\nforce are present, the system admits traveling wave solutions. We establish a\nsmall data well-posedness theory for this problem by proving that for every\nnontrivial traveling wave speed there exists a nonempty open set of stress and\nforcing data that give rise to unique traveling wave solutions, and that these\nsolutions depend continuously on the data and the wave speed.

For $D=2$ the particles move on the unit circle and\nthe vectors can be described by a single phase, recovering the original\nKuramoto model. This multidimensional description can be further extended by\npromoting the coupling constant between the particles to a matrix that acts on\nthe unit vectors, representing a type of generalized frustration. In a recent\npaper we have analyzed in detail the role of the coupling matrix for $D=2$.\nHere we extend this analysis to arbitrary dimensions, presenting a study of\nsynchronous states and their stability. We show that when the natural\nfrequencies of the particles are set to zero, the system converges either to a\nstationary synchronized state with well defined phase, or to an effective\ntwo-dimensional dynamics, where the synchronized particles rotate on the\nsphere. The stability of these states depend on the eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the coupling matrix. When the natural frequencies are not zero,\nsynchronization depends on whether $D$ is even or odd. In even dimensions the\ntransition to synchronization is continuous and rotating states are replaced by\nactive states, where the order parameter rotates while its module oscillates.\nIf $D$ is odd the phase transition is discontinuous and active states are\nsuppressed, occurring only for a restricted class of coupling matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 17:51:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 10:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

If they try to do both at once from input\ndesigned to teach the full reward function, it is easy to end up with a\nrepresentation that contains spurious correlations in the data, which fails to\ngeneralize to new settings. Instead, our ultimate goal is to enable robots to\nidentify and isolate the causal features that people actually care about and\nuse when they represent states and behavior. Our idea is that we can tune into\nthis representation by asking users what behaviors they consider similar:\nbehaviors will be similar if the features that matter are similar, even if\nlow-level behavior is different; conversely, behaviors will be different if\neven one of the features that matter differs.

For topic extraction to\nfacilitate clustering, we can first project texts into a topic space and then\nperform a clustering algorithm to obtain clusters. To promote topic extraction\nby clustering, we can first obtain clusters with a clustering algorithm and\nthen extract cluster-specific topics. However, this naive strategy ignores the\nfact that text clustering and topic extraction are strongly correlated and\nfollow a chicken-and-egg relationship. Performing them separately fails to make\nthem mutually benefit each other to achieve the best overall performance. In\nthis paper, we propose an unsupervised text clustering and topic extraction\nframework (ClusTop) which integrates text clustering and topic extraction into\na unified framework and can achieve high-quality clustering result and extract\ntopics from each cluster simultaneously. Our framework includes four\ncomponents: enhanced language model training, dimensionality reduction,\nclustering and topic extraction, where the enhanced language model can be\nviewed as a bridge between clustering and topic extraction. On one hand, it\nprovides text embeddings with a strong cluster structure which facilitates\neffective text clustering; on the other hand, it pays high attention on the\ntopic related words for topic extraction because of its self-attention\narchitecture. Moreover, the training of enhanced language model is\nunsupervised.

One method which has been developed\nalong these lines for second order autonomous dynamical systems is the\nso-called direct method. According to this method, one assumes a general\nfunctional form for the FI I and requires the condition dI/dt=0 along the\ndynamical equations. This results to a system of partial differential equations\n(PDEs) to which one adds the necessary integrability conditions of the involved\nscalar quantities. It is found that the final system of PDEs breaks into two\nsets: a. One set containing geometric elements only and b. A second set with\ngeometric and dynamical quantities. Then, provided the geometric quantities are\nknown or can be found, one uses the second set to compute the FIs and,\naccordingly, assess on the integrability of the dynamical system. The solution\nof the system of PDEs for quadratic FIs (QFIs) has been given in a recent paper\nJ. Math. Phys. 61, 122701 (2020).

Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs)\nrepresent an architectural midpoint between the flexibility of an FPGA and the\nefficiency of an ASIC and are a promising candidate for servicing multi-tasked\nworkloads within an application domain. Unfortunately, scheduling multiple\ntasks onto a CGRA is challenging. CGRAs lack abstractions that capture hardware\nresources, leaving workload schedulers unable to reason about performance,\nenergy, and utilization for different schedules. This work first proposes a\nCGRA architecture that can flexibly partition key resources, including the\nglobal buffer memory capacity, the global buffer memory bandwidth, and the\ncompute resources. Partitioned resources serve as hardware abstractions that\ndecouple compilation and resource allocation. The compiler uses these\nabstractions for coarse-grained resource mapping, and the scheduler uses them\nfor flexible resource allocation at run time. We then propose two hardware\nmechanisms to support multi-task execution. A flexible-shape execution region\nincreases the overall resource utilization by mapping multiple tasks with\ndifferent resource requirements. Dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) enables\na CGRA to update the hardware configuration as the scheduler makes decisions\nrapidly. We show that our abstraction can help automatic and efficient\nscheduling of multi-tasked workloads onto our target CGRA with high\nutilization, resulting in 1.05x-1.24x higher throughput and a 23-28% lower\nlatency in a multi-tasked cloud workload and 60.8% reduced latency in an\nautonomous system workload when compared to a baseline CGRA running single\ntasks at a time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 20:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

For instance, the processing must terminate within a\ngiven time limit; or a signal processing computer must integrate input\ninformation across several timescales; or a robot motor controller must react\nto sensor signals with a short latency. For classical digital computing\nmachines such requirements pose no fundamental problems as long as the physical\nclock rate is fast enough for the fastest relevant timescales. However, when\ndigital microchips become scaled down into the few-nanometer range where\nquantum noise and device mismatch become unavoidable, or when the digital\ncomputing paradigm is altogether abandoned in analog neuromorphic systems or\nother unconventional hardware bases, it can become difficult to relate\ntimescale conditions to the physical hardware dynamics. Here we explore the\nrelations between task-defined timescale conditions and physical hardware\ntimescales in some depth. The article has two main parts. In the first part we\ndevelop an abstract model of a generic computational system that admits a\nunified discussion of computational timescales. This model is general enough to\ncover digital computing systems as well as analog neuromorphic or other\nunconventional ones. We identify four major types of timescales which require\nseparate considerations: causal physical timescales; timescales of phenomenal\nchange which characterize the ``speed'' of how something changes in time;\ntimescales of reactivity which describe how fast a computing system can react\nto incoming trigger information; and memory timescales.

Compared\nwith images, videos have much high dimension, which brings huge computational\ncosts when generating adversarial videos. This is especially serious for the\nquery-based black-box attacks where gradient estimation for the threat models\nis usually utilized, and high dimensions will lead to a large number of\nqueries. To mitigate this issue, we propose to simultaneously eliminate the\ntemporal and spatial redundancy within the video to achieve an effective and\nefficient gradient estimation on the reduced searching space, and thus query\nnumber could decrease. To implement this idea, we design the novel Adversarial\nspatial-temporal Focus (AstFocus) attack on videos, which performs attacks on\nthe simultaneously focused key frames and key regions from the inter-frames and\nintra-frames in the video. AstFocus attack is based on the cooperative\nMulti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework. One agent is responsible\nfor selecting key frames, and another agent is responsible for selecting key\nregions. These two agents are jointly trained by the common rewards received\nfrom the black-box threat models to perform a cooperative prediction. By\ncontinuously querying, the reduced searching space composed of key frames and\nkey regions is becoming precise, and the whole query number becomes less than\nthat on the original video. Extensive experiments on four mainstream video\nrecognition models and three widely used action recognition datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed AstFocus attack outperforms the SOTA methods,\nwhich is prevenient in fooling rate, query number, time, and perturbation\nmagnitude at the same.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 00:28:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 01:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

The goal is to discover an intelligent\ndecision rule that processes information available to growers and prescribes\nsensible irrigation amounts for the time steps considered. Due to the technical\nnovelty, however, the research on the technique remains sparse and impractical.\nTo accelerate the progress, the paper proposes a principled framework and\nactionable procedure that allow researchers to formulate their own optimisation\nproblems and implement solution algorithms based on deep reinforcement\nlearning. The effectiveness of the framework was demonstrated using a case\nstudy of irrigated wheat grown in a productive region of Australia where\nprofits were maximised. Specifically, the decision rule takes nine state\nvariable inputs: crop phenological stage, leaf area index, extractable soil\nwater for each of the five top layers, cumulative rainfall and cumulative\nirrigation. It returns a probabilistic prescription over five candidate\nirrigation amounts (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mm) every day.

Nevertheless, these models change and\nimprove over time as humans gather more experience. Interestingly, robot\nactions influence what this experience is, and therefore influence how people's\ninternal models change. In this work we take a step towards enabling robots to\nunderstand the influence they have, leverage it to better assist people, and\nhelp human models more quickly align with reality. Our key idea is to model the\nhuman's learning as a nonlinear dynamical system which evolves the human's\ninternal model given new observations. We formulate a novel optimization\nproblem to infer the human's learning dynamics from demonstrations that\nnaturally exhibit human learning. We then formalize how robots can influence\nhuman learning by embedding the human's learning dynamics model into the robot\nplanning problem. Although our formulations provide concrete problem\nstatements, they are intractable to solve in full generality. We contribute an\napproximation that sacrifices the complexity of the human internal models we\ncan represent, but enables robots to learn the nonlinear dynamics of these\ninternal models. We evaluate our inference and planning methods in a suite of\nsimulated environments and an in-person user study, where a 7DOF robotic arm\nteaches participants to be better teleoperators. While influencing human\nlearning remains an open problem, our results demonstrate that this influence\nis possible and can be helpful in real human-robot interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 23:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

Near to the crosslink-density-controlled continuous\namorphous-solidification transition, this distribution obeys a scaling form: it\nhas a single peak at a lengthscale that diverges (along with the width of the\ndistribution) as the transition is approached. The modulus controlling\nmacroscale elastic shear deformations of the amorphous solid does not depend on\nthe distribution of localization lengths. However, it is natural to anticipate\nthat for deformations at progressively shorter lengthscales -- mesoscale\ndeformations -- the effective modulus exhibits a scale-dependence, softening as\nthe deformation lengthscale is reduced. This is because an increasing fraction\nof the localized particles are, in effect, liquid-like at the deformation\nlengthscale, and therefore less effective at contributing to the elastic\nresponse. In this paper, the relationship between the distribution of\nlocalization lengths and the scale-dependent elastic shear modulus is explored,\nand it is shown, within the setting of a replica mean-field theory, that the\neffective modulus does indeed exhibit scale-dependent softening.

Despite\nits scalability and ease of use, many users who own sensitive data refrain from\nfully utilizing cloud services due to confidentiality concerns. Maintaining\ndata confidentiality for data at rest and in transit has been widely explored\nbut data remains vulnerable in the cloud while it is in use. This vulnerability\nis further elevated once the scope of computing spans across the edge-to-cloud\ncontinuum. Accordingly, the goal of this dissertation is to enable data\nconfidentiality by adopting confidential computing across the continuum.\nTowards this goal, one approach we explore is to separate the intelligence\naspect of data processing from the pattern-matching aspect. We present our\napproach to make confidential data clustering on the cloud, and then develop\nconfidential search service across edge-to-cloud for unstructured text data.\nOur proposed clustering solution named ClusPr, performs topic-based clustering\nfor static and dynamic datasets that improves cluster coherency up to\n30%-to-60% when compared with other encryption-based clustering techniques. Our\ntrusted enterprise search service named SAED, provides context-aware and\npersonalized semantic search over confidential data across the continuum. We\nrealized that enabling confidential computing across edge-to-cloud requires\nmajor contribution from the edge tiers particularly to run multiple Deep\nLearning (DL) services concurrently. This raises memory contention on the edge\ntier. To resolve this, we develop Edge-MultiAI framework to manage Neural\nNetwork (NN) models of DL applications such that it can meet the latency\nconstraints of the DL applications without compromising inference accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 02:09:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

In the region of the tidal tails, the diffuse HI has a typical column\ndensity above $10^{19.5}$ cm$^{-2}$, and is highly turbulent with a velocity\ndispersion around 50 km s$^{-1}$.

Perhaps surprisingly, despite the\nsurge of interest in large-scale, multi-agent reinforcement learning, almost\nnothing is known about the analogous question: Are common reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithms also robust to similar perturbations? In this paper,\nwe investigate this question by studying a variant of the classical temporal\ndifference (TD) learning algorithm with a perturbed update direction, where a\ngeneral compression operator is used to model the perturbation. Our main\ntechnical contribution is to show that compressed TD algorithms, coupled with\nan error-feedback mechanism used widely in optimization, exhibit the same\nnon-asymptotic theoretical guarantees as their SGD counterparts. We then extend\nour results significantly to nonlinear stochastic approximation algorithms and\nmulti-agent settings. In particular, we prove that for multi-agent TD learning,\none can achieve linear convergence speedups in the number of agents while\ncommunicating just $\\tilde{O}(1)$ bits per agent at each time step. Our work is\nthe first to provide finite-time results in RL that account for general\ncompression operators and error-feedback in tandem with linear function\napproximation and Markovian sampling. Our analysis hinges on studying the drift\nof a novel Lyapunov function that captures the dynamics of a memory variable\nintroduced by error feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 04:09:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 03:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

To this end, we use a\ncombination of reinforcement learning and software engineering concepts to\nsimulate a quadruped robot that can understand emotions, navigate through\nvarious terrains and detect sound sources, and respond to emotions using\naudio-visual feedback. This paper aims to establish the framework of simulating\na quadruped robot that is emotionally intelligent and can primarily respond to\naudio-visual stimuli using motor or audio response. The emotion detection from\nthe speech was not as performant as ERANNs or Zeta Policy learning, still\nmanaging an accuracy of 63.5%. The video emotion detection system produced\nresults that are almost at par with the state of the art, with an accuracy of\n99.66%.

In recent years, with the\nsuccessful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers\nby borrowing the idea of NMT.

However, such a mock\ninterview with peers is generally far away from the real interview experience:\nthe mock interviewers are not guaranteed to be professional and are not likely\nto behave like a real interviewer. Due to the rapid growth of online\nrecruitment in recent years, recruiters tend to have online interviews, which\nmakes it possible to collect real interview data from real interviewers. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel application named EZInterviewer, which aims to\nlearn from the online interview data and provides mock interview services to\nthe job seekers. The task is challenging in two ways: (1) the interview data\nare now available but still of low-resource; (2) to generate meaningful and\nrelevant interview dialogs requires thorough understanding of both resumes and\njob descriptions. To address the low-resource challenge, EZInterviewer is\ntrained on a very small set of interview dialogs. The key idea is to reduce the\nnumber of parameters that rely on interview dialogs by disentangling the\nknowledge selector and dialog generator so that most parameters can be trained\nwith ungrounded dialogs as well as the resume data that are not low-resource.\nEvaluation results on a real-world job interview dialog dataset indicate that\nwe achieve promising results to generate mock interviews.

Relied on physical measurements,\ntraditional statistical channel modeling methods suffer from the problem of low\naccuracy with the assumed certain distributions and empirical parameters.\nMoreover, it is time-consuming and expensive to acquire extensive channel\nmeasurement in the THz band. In this paper, a transfer generative adversarial\nnetwork (T-GAN) based modeling method is proposed in the THz band, which\nexploits the advantage of GAN in modeling the complex distribution, and the\nbenefit of transfer learning in transferring the knowledge from a source task\nto improve generalization about the target task with limited training data.\nSpecifically, to start with, the proposed GAN is pre-trained using the\nsimulated dataset, generated by the standard channel model from 3rd generation\npartnerships project (3GPP). Furthermore, by transferring the knowledge and\nfine-tuning the pre-trained GAN, the T-GAN is developed by using the THz\nmeasured dataset with a small amount. Experimental results reveal that the\ndistribution of PDPs generated by the proposed T-GAN method shows good\nagreement with measurement.

However, most of existing studies require to pretrain the Transformer\nbackbone on a large-scale labeled dataset (e.g., ImageNet) for achieving\nsatisfactory performance, which is usually unavailable for medical images.\nAdditionally, due to the gap between medical and natural images, the\nimprovement generated by the ImageNet pretrained weights significantly degrades\nwhile transferring the weights to medical image processing tasks. In this\npaper, we propose Bootstrap Own Latent of Transformer (BOLT), a self-supervised\nlearning approach specifically for medical image classification with the\nTransformer backbone. Our BOLT consists of two networks, namely online and\ntarget branches, for self-supervised representation learning. Concretely, the\nonline network is trained to predict the target network representation of the\nsame patch embedding tokens with a different perturbation. To maximally\nexcavate the impact of Transformer from limited medical data, we propose an\nauxiliary difficulty ranking task. The Transformer is enforced to identify\nwhich branch (i.e., online/target) is processing the more difficult perturbed\ntokens. Overall, the Transformer endeavours itself to distill the\ntransformation-invariant features from the perturbed tokens to simultaneously\nachieve difficulty measurement and maintain the consistency of self-supervised\nrepresentations. The proposed BOLT is evaluated on three medical image\nprocessing tasks, i.e., skin lesion classification, knee fatigue fracture\ngrading and diabetic retinopathy grading.

In this work,\n12C-12C and 40Ca-40Ca heavy ion collisions at center of mass energy of 11\nGeV/nucleon were simulated using the SMASH event generator. Firstly, the\ngenerator-level events were studied. The distribution of track multiplicities\nand momentum distributions of different types of charged particles were\nobtained. Secondly, the generated events passed through the full reconstruction\nusing the SpdRoot framework. At this stage particles were identified using\ndE/dx measurement and time-of-flight information. It allowed us to estimate\ncharge track multiplicities in the tracking system and purities of charge\nparticles spectra. The results on multiplicity are important to estimate\noccupancies in the tracking system, while the results on the pion and proton\nmomentum spectra show that particle identification should be acceptable for\nvalidation of hadron formation models. This is the first study of moderate ion\ncollisions for the SPD Collaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 08:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

The origin of this improvement of fit and $M_<-M_>$\ntension is that the new likelihood model, successfully models two signals\nhidden in the data: 1.

Overcoming the knowledge disruption of previously\nacquired concepts, a drawback affecting deep learning models and that goes by\nthe name of catastrophic forgetting, is a hard challenge. Currently, deep\nlearning methods can attain impressive results when the data modeled does not\nundergo a considerable distributional shift in subsequent learning sessions,\nbut whenever we expose such systems to this incremental setting, performance\ndrop very quickly. Overcoming this limitation is fundamental as it would allow\nus to build truly intelligent systems showing stability and plasticity.\nSecondly, it would allow us to overcome the onerous limitation of retraining\nthese architectures from scratch with the new updated data. In this thesis, we\ntackle the problem from multiple directions. In a first study, we show that in\nrehearsal-based techniques (systems that use memory buffer), the quantity of\ndata stored in the rehearsal buffer is a more important factor over the quality\nof the data.

However, in order to implement these solutions in production and\nenable widespread adoption, the scalability and transferability of deep\nlearning methods have become a focus of research. While transfer learning has\nproven successful in many cases, particularly with computer vision and\nhomogenous data inputs, it can be challenging to apply to heterogeneous data.\nMotivated by the need to transfer and standardize established processes to\ndifferent, non-identical environments and by the challenge of adapting to\nheterogeneous data representations, this work introduces the Domain Adaptation\nNeural Network with Cyclic Supervision (DBACS) approach. DBACS addresses the\nissue of model generalization through domain adaptation, specifically for\nheterogeneous data, and enables the transfer and scalability of deep\nlearning-based statistical control methods in a general manner. Additionally,\nthe cyclic interactions between the different parts of the model enable DBACS\nto not only adapt to the domains, but also match them. To the best of our\nknowledge, DBACS is the first deep learning approach to combine adaptation and\nmatching for heterogeneous data settings. For comparison, this work also\nincludes subspace alignment and a multi-view learning that deals with\nheterogeneous representations by mapping data into correlated latent feature\nspaces. Finally, DBACS with its ability to adapt and match, is applied to a\nvirtual metrology use case for an etching process run on different machine\ntypes in semiconductor manufacturing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 10:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

User localization can be\nachieved based on delay and angle estimation using uplink or downlink pilot\nsignals. However, hardware impairments (HWIs) distort the signals at both the\ntransmitter and receiver sides and thus affect the localization performance.\nWhile this impact can be ignored at lower frequencies where HWIs are less\nsevere, and the localization requirements are not stringent, modeling and\nanalysis efforts are needed for high-frequency 6G bands (e.g., sub-THz) to\nassess degradation in localization accuracy due to HWIs.

Complementary to the\nlocalization analysis, we also investigate the effect of individual and overall\nHWIs on communication in terms of symbol error rate (SER). Our extensive\nsimulation results demonstrate that each type of HWI leads to a different level\nof degradation in angle and delay estimation performance. The prominent factors\non delay estimation (e.g., phase noise and carrier frequency offset) will have\na dominant negative effect on SER, while the impairments affecting only the\nangle estimation (e.g., mutual coupling and antenna displacement) induce slight\ndegradation in SER performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 11:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

It is known that particle inertia can\ndrive this deposition, and that there is a critical value of this inertia,\nbelow which no point particles deposit. Particle inertia is measured by the\nStokes number, St. We show that near the critical value of the Stokes number,\nSt$_c$, the amount of deposition has the unusual scaling law of\nexp(-1/(St-St$_c$)$^{1/2}$). The scaling is controlled by the stagnation point\nof the flow. This scaling is determined by the time for the particle to reach\nthe surface of the cylinder varying as 1/(St-St$_c$)$^{1/2}$, together with the\ndistance away from the stagnation point (perpendicular to the flow direction)\nincreasing exponentially with time. The scaling law applies to inviscid flow, a\nmodel for flow at high Reynolds numbers.

More specifically, we\nconsider the simulation over a finite time interval and provide an a posteriori\nadaption of the standard a priori bound for Balanced Truncation and Balanced\nSingular Perturbation Approximation in that setting, which improves the error\nestimation while still yielding a rigorous bound. Our result is based on an\nerror splitting induced by a Fourier series approximation of the input and a\nsubsequent refined error analysis. We make use of system-theoretic concepts,\nsuch as the notion of signal generator driven systems, steady-states and\nobservability. Our bound is also applicable in the presence of nonzero initial\nconditions. Numerical evidence for the sharpness of the bound is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 11:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

We demonstrate this for information erasure,\nderiving an infinite sequence of \"Landauer inequalities\" for the work cost,\nbounded by linear combinations of expectation values of powers of the modular\nHamiltonian. These inequalities give improved lower bounds for the work cost in\nfinite dimensional systems, and depend on more details of the erased state than\njust on its entropy and variance of modular Hamiltonian. Similarly one can\nderive lower bounds for marginal entropy production for a system coupled to an\nenvironment.

Mechanisms resulting in\nlarge intrinsic AHE include diverging Berry curvature in Weyl semimetals,\nanticrossing nodal rings or points of non-trivial bands, and noncollinear spin\nstructures. Here we show that a half-topological semimetal (HTS) state near a\ntopological critical point can provide a new mechanism for driving an\nexceptionally large AHE. We reveal this through a systematic experimental and\ntheoretical study of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) half-Heusler compound TbPdBi.\nWe not only observed an unusual AHE with a surprisingly large anomalous Hall\nangle {\\Theta}H (tan {\\Theta}H ~ 2, the largest among the antiferromagnets) in\nits field-driven ferromagnetic (FM) phase, but also found a distinct Hall\nresistivity peak in the canted AFM phase within a low field range, where its\nisothermal magnetization is nearly linearly dependent on the field. Moreover,\nwe observed a nearly isotropic, giant negative magnetoresistance with a\nmagnitude of ~98%. Our in-depth theoretical modelling demonstrates that these\nexotic transport properties originate from the HTS state. A minimal Berry\ncurvature cancellation between the trivial spin-up and nontrivial spin-down\nbands results not only in an extremely large AHE, but it also enhances the spin\npolarization of the spin-down bands substantially and thus leads to a giant\nnegative magnetoresistance.

In\nthis paper, we propose the Laplacian Gaussian Mixture (LGM) model for the\nsignals recorded from upper limbs.

The\nmodel is tested on different bench-mark sEMG data sets and is validated using\nboth the qualitative and quantitative perspectives.

In a nutshell, we aim to attain a speaking style from an arbitrary\nreference speaking video and then drive the one-shot portrait to speak with the\nreference speaking style and another piece of audio.

The vorticity field $\\omega(x,t)$ of the\nsolution is smooth at any positive time and corresponds to a vortex ring of\nthickness $\\sqrt{\\nu t}$ that is translated along its symmetry axis due to\nself-induction, an effect anticipated by Helmholtz in 1858 and quantified by\nKelvin in 1867.

Using GJ 1214b as a test-case, we examine the transmission\nspectra of a sub-Neptune planet with C/O ratios of solar, 1, and 1000 to\nevaluate the effective differences between our opacities and those of Khare.\nFor an atmosphere with solar hydrogen and helium abundances, we find a\ndifference of 200-1500 ppm, but for high-metallicity (Z=1000) environments, the\ndifference may only be 20 ppm. The 1-2 micron transmission data for GJ 1214b\nrule out the Titan-like haze model, and are more consistent with C/O=1 and\nC/O=solar haze models.

To solve these\nproblems, we propose a Cluster-guided Contrastive deep Graph Clustering network\n(CCGC) by mining the intrinsic supervision information in the high-confidence\nclustering results.

Moreover, to construct semantic meaningful negative sample pairs, we\nregard the centers of different high-confidence clusters as negative samples,\nthus improving the discriminative capability and reliability of the constructed\nsample pairs. Lastly, we design an objective function to pull close the samples\nfrom the same cluster while pushing away those from other clusters by\nmaximizing and minimizing the cross-view cosine similarity between positive and\nnegative samples.

While optimal algorithms for the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem (MABP)\nprovide allocation policies that optimally balance learning and earning, they\ntend to be computationally expensive. The Gittins Index (GI) is a solution to\nthe MABP that can simultaneously attain optimality and computationally\nefficiency goals, and it has been recently used in experiments with Bernoulli\nand Gaussian rewards. For the first time, we present a modification of the GI\nrule that can be used in experiments with exponentially-distributed rewards. We\nreport its performance in simulated 2- armed and 3-armed experiments. Compared\nto traditional non-adaptive designs, our novel GI modified design shows\noperating characteristics comparable in learning (e.g. statistical power) but\nsubstantially better in earning (e.g. direct benefits). This illustrates the\npotential that designs using a GI approach to allocate participants have to\nimprove participant benefits, increase efficiencies, and reduce experimental\ncosts in adaptive multi-armed experiments with exponential rewards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 14:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

The rise and development of machine learning and\ndeep learning models have created many opportunities to improve our modeling\ntoolbox. Breakthroughs in these fields often come with the requirement of large\namounts of data. Such large datasets are often not publicly available in\nfinance and insurance, mainly due to privacy and ethics concerns. This lack of\ndata is currently one of the main hurdles in developing better models. One\npossible option to alleviating this issue is generative modeling. Generative\nmodels are capable of simulating fake but realistic-looking data, also referred\nto as synthetic data, that can be shared more freely. Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) is such a model that increases our capacity to fit very\nhigh-dimensional distributions of data. While research on GANs is an active\ntopic in fields like computer vision, they have found limited adoption within\nthe human sciences, like economics and insurance. Reason for this is that in\nthese fields, most questions are inherently about identification of causal\neffects, while to this day neural networks, which are at the center of the GAN\nframework, focus mostly on high-dimensional correlations. In this paper we\nstudy the causal preservation capabilities of GANs and whether the produced\nsynthetic data can reliably be used to answer causal questions. This is done by\nperforming causal analyses on the synthetic data, produced by a GAN, with\nincreasingly more lenient assumptions. We consider the cross-sectional case,\nthe time series case and the case with a complete structural model. It is shown\nthat in the simple cross-sectional scenario where correlation equals causation\nthe GAN preserves causality, but that challenges arise for more advanced\nanalyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 14:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

Existing\nmethods for patch assessment involve generating new tests or manual inspection,\nwhich can be time-consuming or biased. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntechnique, INVALIDATOR, to automatically assess the correctness of\nAPR-generated patches via semantic and syntactic reasoning. INVALIDATOR\nleverages program invariants to reason about program semantics while also\ncapturing program syntax through language semantics learned from a large code\ncorpus using a pre-trained language model.

Then, INVALIDATOR determines that an APR-generated patch overfits if:\n(1) it violates correct specifications or (2) maintains erroneous behaviors\nfrom the original buggy program. In case our approach fails to determine an\noverfitting patch based on invariants, INVALIDATOR utilizes a trained model\nfrom labeled patches to assess patch correctness based on program syntax. The\nbenefit of INVALIDATOR is threefold. First, INVALIDATOR leverages both semantic\nand syntactic reasoning to enhance its discriminative capability. Second,\nINVALIDATOR does not require new test cases to be generated, but instead only\nrelies on the current test suite and uses invariant inference to generalize\nprogram behaviors. Third, INVALIDATOR is fully automated. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that INVALIDATOR outperforms existing methods in terms of Accuracy\nand F-measure, correctly identifying 79% of overfitting patches and detecting\n23% more overfitting patches than the best baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 14:16:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 10:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

Our key insights are two folds: Firstly, with the aid of support\nmasks, we can generate dynamic class centers more appropriately to re-weight\nquery features. Secondly, we find that support object queries have already\nencoded key factors after base training. In this way, the query features can be\nenhanced twice from two aspects, i.e., feature-level and instance-level.

In this paper, we propose\nContextual Conservative Q-Learning(C-CQL) to learn a robustly reliable policy\nthrough the contextual information captured via an inverse dynamics model. With\nthe supervision of the inverse dynamics model, it tends to learn a policy that\ngenerates stable transition at perturbed states, for the fact that pertuebed\nstates are a common kind of OOD states. In this manner, we enable the learnt\npolicy more likely to generate transition that destines to the empirical next\nstate distributions of the offline dataset, i.e., robustly reliable transition.\nBesides, we theoretically reveal that C-CQL is the generalization of the\nConservative Q-Learning(CQL) and aggressive State Deviation Correction(SDC).\nFinally, experimental results demonstrate the proposed C-CQL achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance in most environments of offline Mujoco suite and a\nnoisy Mujoco setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 13:33:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 17:54:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 15:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

In industry, deep neural\nnetwork-based models are widely adopted for modeling such problems. Researchers\nproposed various neural network architectures for searching and modeling the\nfeature interactions in an end-to-end fashion. However, most methods only learn\nstatic feature interactions and have not fully leveraged deep CTR models'\nrepresentation capacity. In this paper, we propose a new model: DynInt. By\nextending Polynomial-Interaction-Network (PIN), which learns higher-order\ninteractions recursively to be dynamic and data-dependent, DynInt further\nderived two modes for modeling dynamic higher-order interactions: dynamic\nactivation and dynamic parameter. In dynamic activation mode, we adaptively\nadjust the strength of learned interactions by instance-aware activation gating\nnetworks. In dynamic parameter mode, we re-parameterize the parameters by\ndifferent formulations and dynamically generate the parameters by\ninstance-aware parameter generation networks. Through instance-aware gating\nmechanism and dynamic parameter generation, we enable the PIN to model dynamic\ninteraction for potential industry applications. We implement the proposed\nmodel and evaluate the model performance on real-world datasets. Extensive\nexperiment results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of DynInt over\nstate-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 13:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

The capacity of low-power systems such as\nembedded systems is almost limited. It is difficult to ensure the timely\nprocessing of each image information. To reduce time consuming when matching\nfeature points in SLAM, an algorithm of using inertial measurement unit (IMU)\nto optimize the efficiency of image feature point matching is proposed. When\nmatching two image feature points, the presented algorithm does not need to\ntraverse the whole image for matching feature points, just around the predicted\npoint within a small range traversal search to find matching feature points.\nAfter compared with the traditional algorithm, the experimental results show\nthat this method has greatly reduced the consumption of image feature points\nmatching time. All the conclusions will help research how to use the IMU\noptimize the efficiency of image feature point matching and improve the\nreal-time performance in SLAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 03:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}
