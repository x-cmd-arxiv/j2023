We investigate a population of jets clustered from a\ncombined PYTHIA+TennGen event, focusing on jets which can unambiguously be\nclassified as signal or combinatorial jets. By selecting jets based on their\nkinematic properties, we investigate whether it is possible to separate signal\nand combinatorial jets without biasing the signal population significantly. We\nfind that, after a loose selection on the jet area, surviving combinatorial\njets are dominantly imposters, combinatorial jets with properties\nindistinguishable from signal jets. We also find that, after a loose selection\non the leading hadron momentum, surviving combinatorial jets are still\ndominantly imposters. We use rule extraction, a machine learning technique, to\nextract an optimal kinematic selection from a random forest trained on our\npopulation of jets. In general, this technique found a stricter kinematic\nselection on the jet's leading hadron momentum to be optimal. We find that it\nis possible to suppress combinatorial jets significantly using this machine\nlearning based selection, but that some signal is removed as well. Due to this\nstricter kinematic selection, we find that the surviving signal is biased\ntowards quark-like jets. Since similar selections are used in many\nmeasurements, this indicates that those measurements are biased towards\nquark-like jets as well. These studies should motivate an increased emphasis on\nassumptions made when suppressing and subtracting combinatorial background and\nthe biases introduced by methods for doing so.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 16:20:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 20:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

Recently, many learning-based\nmethods have been proposed to tackle this challenge, with imitation learning\nshowing great promise. However, imperfect demonstrations and a lack of feedback\nfrom teleoperation systems may lead to poor or even unsafe results. In this\nwork we explore the effect of demonstrator force feedback on imitation\nlearning, using a feedback glove and a robot arm to render fingertip-level and\npalm-level forces, respectively. 10 participants recorded 5 demonstrations of a\npick-and-place task with 3 grippers, under conditions with no force feedback,\nfingertip force feedback, and fingertip and palm force feedback. Results show\nthat force feedback significantly reduces demonstrator fingertip and palm\nforces, leads to a lower variation in demonstrator forces, and recorded\ntrajectories that a quicker to execute. Using behavioral cloning, we find that\nagents trained to imitate these trajectories mirror these benefits, even though\nagents have no force data shown to them during training. We conclude that\nimmersive demonstrations, achieved with force feedback, may be the key to\nunlocking safer, quicker to execute dexterous manipulation policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 16:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

In\nthis paper, we consider global entanglement (GE) in a KT phase transition and\nshow that while it does not indicate any clear signature of the phase\ntransition, the conditional version of GE is a good indicator with strong\nsignatures of the KT transition. In particular, we study a deformed version of\nthe $Z_d$ Kitaev model which has an intermediate KT phase which separates a\n$Z_d$ topological phase from a magnetized phase at two different KT transition\npoints. Using a mapping to the classical $d$-state clock model, we consider GE\nand the generalized GE and show that they do not provide a reliable indicator\nof transition points. However, their difference called conditional global\nentanglement (Q) shows a peak at the first KT transition point. Additionally,\nwe show that it can characterize various phases of the model as it behaves\nsubstantially different in each phase. We therefore conclude that Q is a useful\nmeasure that can characterize various phases of KT QPTs as well as their\nrelated critical points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 17:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Here a top-down planar approach is presented by introducing\nKirigami-inspired engineering combined with a pre-stretching process. Using\nthis method, Kirigami-Pre-stretched Substrate-Kirigami trilayered precursors\nare created in a planar manner; upon release, the strain mismatch -- due to the\npre-stretching of substrate -- between layers would induce an out-of-plane\nbuckling to achieve targeted three dimensional (3D) bistable structures. By\ncombining experimental characterization, analytical modeling, and finite\nelement simulation, the effect of the pattern size of Kirigami layers and\npre-stretching on the geometry and stability of resulting 3D composites is\nexplored. In addition, methods to realize soft bistable structures with\narbitrary shapes and soft composites with multistable configurations are\ninvestigated, which could encourage further applications.

We present analyses of recent joint NICER\nand NuSTAR spectra, which are extremely well-described by a highly inclined\ndisk accreting into a near maximally spinning black hole. Owing to the broad\nX-ray coverage of NuSTAR the fitted spin and inclination are strongly\nconstrained for our hypothesized disk models. The faintest spectra are observed\nout to 20 keV, even though their hard tail components are almost absent when\ndescribed with a simple corona. The hard tail increases with luminosity, but\nshows clear two track behavior with one track having appreciably stronger\ntails. The disk spectrum color-correction factor is anti-correlated with the\nstrength of the hard tail (e.g., as measured by the Compton $y$ parameter).\nAlthough the spin and inclination parameters are strongly constrained for our\nchosen model, the mass and distance are degenerate parameters. We use our\nspectral fits, along with a theoretical prior on color-correction, an\nobservational prior on likely fractional Eddington luminosity, and an\nobservational prior on distance obtained from Gaia studies, to present mass and\ndistance contours for this system. The most likely parameters, given our\npresumed disk model, suggest a 4.6 $\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ black hole at 7.8 kpc\nobserved at luminosities ranging from $\\approx 1.7\\%$--$9\\%$ of Eddington.

Higher mass and distance,\nhowever, remain viable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 23:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Although this simple architecture allows fast\nlearning and facile physical implementation, the learning performance is\ninferior to that of other state-of-the-art RNN models. In this paper, to\nimprove the learning ability of RC, we propose self-modulated RC (SM-RC), which\nextends RC by adding a self-modulation mechanism. The self-modulation mechanism\nis realized with two gating variables: an input gate and a reservoir gate. The\ninput gate modulates the input signal, and the reservoir gate modulates the\ndynamical properties of the reservoir. We demonstrated that SM-RC can perform\nattention tasks where input information is retained or discarded depending on\nthe input signal. We also found that a chaotic state emerged as a result of\nlearning in SM-RC. This indicates that self-modulation mechanisms provide RC\nwith qualitatively different information-processing capabilities. Furthermore,\nSM-RC outperformed RC in NARMA and Lorentz model tasks. In particular, SM-RC\nachieved a higher prediction accuracy than RC with a reservoir 10 times larger\nin the Lorentz model tasks.

In this work, we present a Hybrid\nEncoder with Adaptive Restart (HEAR) that addresses these issues while\nmaintaining the performance of bidirectional encoders over the offline (or\ncomplete) inputs while improving performance on streaming (or incomplete)\ninputs. HEAR has a Hybrid unidirectional-bidirectional encoder architecture to\nperform sequence tagging, along with an Adaptive Restart Module (ARM) to\nselectively guide the restart of bidirectional portion of the encoder. Across\nfour sequence tagging tasks, HEAR offers FLOP savings in streaming settings\nupto 71.1% and also outperforms bidirectional encoders for streaming\npredictions by upto +10% streaming exact match.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 02:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 08:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

To overcome this limitation, we\njointly investigate three novel criteria in our framework Crb for point cloud\nacquisition - label conciseness}, feature representativeness and geometric\nbalance, which hierarchically filters out the point clouds of redundant 3D\nbounding box labels, latent features and geometric characteristics (e.g., point\ncloud density) from the unlabeled sample pool and greedily selects informative\nones with fewer objects to annotate.

Point cloud triangulation\nsolves this problem by providing edge information to the input points. Since no\nvertex interpolation is involved, it is beneficial to preserve sharp details on\nthe surface. Taking advantage of learning-based techniques in triangulation,\nexisting methods enumerate the complete combinations of candidate triangles,\nwhich is both complex and inefficient. In this paper, we leverage the duality\nbetween a triangle and its circumcenter, and introduce a deep neural network\nthat detects the circumcenters to achieve point cloud triangulation.\nSpecifically, we introduce multiple anchor priors to divide the neighborhood\nspace of each point. The neural network then learns to predict the presences\nand locations of circumcenters under the guidance of those anchors. We extract\nthe triangles dual to the detected circumcenters to form a primitive mesh, from\nwhich an edge-manifold mesh is produced via simple post-processing. Unlike\nexisting learning-based triangulation methods, the proposed method bypasses an\nexhaustive enumeration of triangle combinations and local surface\nparameterization.

Edge computing promises to exploit these\nunderlying computation resources closer to users to help run latency-sensitive\napplications such as augmented reality and video analytics. However, one key\nmissing piece has been how to incorporate personally owned unmanaged devices\ninto a usable edge computing system. The primary challenges arise due to the\nheterogeneity, lack of interference management, and unpredictable availability\nof such devices.

The distribution of projected rotational\nvelocities shows that the rotation rates of Maia variables are no different\nfrom those of SPB stars. Moreover, many Maia stars pulsate with frequencies\nexceeding 60 c/d. Rapid rotation is ruled out as a possible factor in\nunderstanding the Maia variables. There is clearly a serious problem with\ncurrent pulsational models.

Likewise, there is\ncontinuity between the distributions of delta Sct, Maia, and beta Cep\nvariables. In fact, Maia stars seem to be an extension of delta Sct stars to\nthe mid-B type.

The\nthermogalvanic temperature coefficient {\\alpha}, usually referred to as\neffective thermopower, is the key parameter determining the power density and\nefficiency of thermogalvanic batteries. However, the current understanding of\nimproving {\\alpha} of redox pairs remains at the phenomenological level without\nmicroscopic insights, and the development of electrolytes with high {\\alpha}\nlargely relies on experimental trial and error. This work applies the free\nenergy perturbation method based on molecular dynamics simulations to predict\nthe {\\alpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair in aqueous and acetone\nsolutions. We showed that {\\alpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair can be\nincreased from 1.5{\\pm}0.3 mV/K to 4.1{\\pm}0.4 mV/K with the increased acetone\nto water fraction. The predicted {\\alpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} both in pure\nwater and acetone show excellent agreement with experimental values. By\nmonitoring the fluctuation of dipole orientations in the first solvation shell,\nwe discovered a significant change in the variance of solvent dipole\norientation between Fe^{3+} and Fe^{2+}, which can be a microscopic indicator\nfor large magnitudes of {\\alpha}. The effect of acetone weight fraction in the\nmixed acetone-water solvent on the {\\alpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} is also\nstudied. Acetone molecules are found to intercalate into the first solvation\nshell of the {Fe^{2+}} ion at high acetone fractions, while this phenomenon is\nnot observed in the solvation shell of the Fe^{3+} ion. Such solvation shell\nstructure change of {Fe^{2+}} ions contributes to the enhanced {\\alpha} at high\nacetone fractions.

Therefore, DL models used to map specific natural hazards\nstruggle with their generalization to other types of natural hazards in unseen\nregions. In this work, we propose a methodology to significantly improve the\ngeneralizability of DL natural hazards mappers based on pre-training on a\nsuitable pre-task. Without access to any data from the target domain, we\ndemonstrate this improved generalizability across four U-Net architectures for\nthe segmentation of unseen natural hazards. Importantly, our method is\ninvariant to geographic differences and differences in the type of frequency\nbands of satellite data. By leveraging characteristics of unlabeled images from\nthe target domain that are publicly available, our approach is able to further\nimprove the generalization behavior without fine-tuning. Thereby, our approach\nsupports the development of foundation models for earth monitoring with the\nobjective of directly segmenting unseen natural hazards across novel geographic\nregions given different sources of satellite imagery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 08:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 08:37:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 12:37:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

In this paper, the damping control of IAOs\nis modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by the proposed Deep\nDeterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\napproach. The proposed approach optimizes the eigenvalue distribution of the\nsystem, which determines the IAO modes in nature.

For a given power\nsystem, only a subset of generators selected by participation factors needs to\nbe controlled, alleviating the control and computing burdens. A Switching\nControl Strategy (SCS) is introduced to improve the transient response of IAOs.\nNumerical simulations of the IEEE-39 New England power grid model validate the\neffectiveness and advanced performance of the proposed approach as well as its\nrobustness against communication delays.

A systematic discrepancies between grid models\nand target stars shows that a mismatch in the mixing-length parameter value\nleads to significant bias in the age estimations for MS stars (about 10\\%), but\nthis bias is smaller for SGB and RGB stars. Neglecting the microscopic\ndiffusion effect in the recovery grid leads to a typical 40\\% bias in age\nestimates for stars on the MS.

In the paradigmatic scenario involving the\nprotagonists Alice and Bob, the entangled state shared between them, is said to\nbe steerable from Alice to Bob if the steering assemblage on Bob's side do not\nadmit a local hidden state (LHS) description. Quantum conditional entropies, on\nthe other hand provide for another characterization of quantum correlations.\nContrary to our common intuition conditional entropies for some entangled\nstates can be negative, marking a significant departure from the classical\nrealm. Quantum steering and quantum nonlocality in general share an intricate\nrelation with quantum conditional entropies. In the present contribution, we\ninvestigate this relationship. For a significant class, namely the two-qubit\nWeyl states we show that negativity of conditional R\\'enyi 2-entropy and\nconditional Tsallis 2-entropy is a necessary and sufficient condition for the\nviolation of a suitably chosen three settings steering inequality. With respect\nto the same inequality we find an upper bound for the conditional R\\'enyi\n2-entropy, such that the general two-qubit state is steerable. Moving from a\nparticular steering inequality to local hidden state descriptions, we show that\nsome two-qubit Weyl states which admit a LHS model possess non-negative\nconditional R\\'enyi 2-entropy. However, the same does not hold true for some\nnon-Weyl states. Our study further investigates the relation between\nnon-negativity of conditional entropy and LHS models in two-qudits for the\nisotropic and Werner states. There we find that whenever these states admit a\nLHS model, they possess a non-negative conditional R\\'enyi 2-entropy.

Especially in the context of the\nTraveling Salesman Problem (TSP), new techniques for finding spanning trees\nwith well-defined properties have been crucial in recent progress. We consider\nthe problem of finding a spanning tree subject to constraints on the edges in\ncuts forming a laminar family of small width. Our main contribution is a new\ndynamic programming approach where the value of a table entry does not only\ndepend on the values of previous table entries, as it is usually the case, but\nalso on a specific representative solution saved together with each table\nentry. This allows for handling a broad range of constraint types.\n  In combination with other techniques -- including negatively correlated\nrounding and a polyhedral approach that, in the problems we consider, allows\nfor avoiding potential losses in the objective through the randomized rounding\n-- we obtain several new results. We first present a quasi-polynomial time\nalgorithm for the Minimum Chain-Constrained Spanning Tree Problem with an\nessentially optimal guarantee. More precisely, each chain constraint is\nviolated by a factor of at most $1+\\varepsilon$, and the cost is no larger than\nthat of an optimal solution not violating any chain constraint. The best\nprevious procedure is a bicriteria approximation violating each chain\nconstraint by up to a constant factor and losing another factor in the\nobjective. Moreover, our approach can naturally handle lower bounds on the\nchain constraints, and it can be extended to constraints on cuts forming a\nlaminar family of constant width.\n  Furthermore, we show how our approach can also handle parity constraints (or,\nmore precisely, a proxy thereof) as used in the context of (Path) TSP and one\nof its generalizations, and discuss implications in this context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 09:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

As main\nrheological features, MRFs must present low viscosity in the absence of a\nmagnetic field (0.1 - 1.0 Pa.s) and high yield stress (50 - 100 kPa) when\nmagnetized, in order to optimize the magnetorheological effect. Such\nproperties, in turn, are directly influenced by the composition, volume\nfraction, size, and size distribution (polydispersity) of the particles, the\nlatter being an important piece in the improvement of these main properties. In\nthis context, the present work aims to analyze, through experiments and\nsimulations, the influence of polydispersity on the maximum packing fraction,\non the yield stress under field (on-state), and on the plastic viscosity in the\nabsence of field (off-state) of concentrated MRF (phi = 48.5 vol.%). Three\nblends of carbonyl iron powder in polyalphaolefin oil were prepared. These\nblends have the same mode, but different polydispersity indexes, ranging from\n0.46 to 1.44. Separate simulations show that the random close packing fraction\nincreases from about 68% to 80% as the polydispersity index increases over this\nrange. The on-state yield stress, in turn, is raised from 30 +/- 0.5 kPa to 42\n+/- 2 kPa (B ~ 0.57 T) and the off-state plastic viscosity, is reduced from 4.8\nPa.s to 0.5 Pa.s. Widening the size distributions, as is well known in the\nliterature, increases packing efficiency and reduces the viscosity of\nconcentrated dispersions, but beyond that, it proved to be a viable way to\nincrease the magnetorheological effect of concentrated MRF. The Brouwers model,\nwhich considers the void fraction in suspensions of particles with lognormal\ndistribution, was proposed as a possible hypothesis to explain the increase in\nyield stress under magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 12:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

In experiments on CO ice irradiation, we show that the relative\ncontribution of these two mechanisms of energy loss to molecule destruction and\nsputtering can be probed by selecting ion energies near the peak of the\nelectronic stopping power. We have observed a significant asymmetry, both in\nthe destruction cross section and the sputtering yield, for pairs of ion\nenergies corresponding to same values of the stopping power on either side of\nthe peak. This implies that the stopping power does not solely control these\nprocesses, as usually assumed in the literature.

Verification and testing\nof this hardware depend heavily upon cycle-accurate simulation of\nregister-transfer-level (RTL) designs. The fastest software RTL simulators can\nsimulate designs at 1--1000 kHz, i.e., more than three orders of magnitude\nslower than hardware. Improved simulators can increase designers' productivity\nby speeding design iterations and permitting more exhaustive exploration. One\npossibility is to exploit low-level parallelism, as RTL expresses considerable\nfine-grain concurrency. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art RTL simulators often\nperform best on a single core since modern processors cannot effectively\nexploit fine-grain parallelism. This work presents Manticore: a parallel\ncomputer designed to accelerate RTL simulation. Manticore uses a static\nbulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) execution model to eliminate fine-grain\nsynchronization overhead. It relies entirely on a compiler to schedule\nresources and communication, which is feasible since RTL code contains few\ndivergent execution paths. With static scheduling, communication and\nsynchronization no longer incur runtime overhead, making fine-grain parallelism\npractical. Moreover, static scheduling dramatically simplifies processor\nimplementation, significantly increasing the number of cores that fit on a\nchip.

To overcome the obstacles, we propose\nRainDiffusion, the first real-world image deraining paradigm based on diffusion\nmodels. RainDiffusion is a non-adversarial training paradigm that introduces\nstable training of unpaired real-world data, rather than weakly adversarial\ntraining, serving as a new standard bar for real-world image deraining.

The\nappearance disparity of pathological whole slide images causes algorithms to\nbecome less reliable, which in turn impedes the wide-spread applicability of\ndownstream tasks like cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, different stainings lead\nto biases in the training which in case of domain shifts negatively affect the\ntest performance. Therefore, in this paper we propose MultiStain-CycleGAN, a\nmulti-domain approach to stain normalization based on CycleGAN. Our\nmodifications to CycleGAN allow us to normalize images of different origins\nwithout retraining or using different models. We perform an extensive\nevaluation of our method using various metrics and compare it to commonly used\nmethods that are multi-domain capable. First, we evaluate how well our method\nfools a domain classifier that tries to assign a medical center to an image.\nThen, we test our normalization on the tumor classification performance of a\ndownstream classifier.

We show that\nour method proves to be multi-domain capable, provides the highest image\nquality among the compared methods, and can most reliably fool the domain\nclassifier while keeping the tumor classifier performance high.

However, sparse networks with few\navailable studies and limited direct evidence can arise, threatening the\nrobustness and reliability of NMA estimates. In these cases, the limited amount\nof available information can hamper the formal evaluation of the underlying NMA\nassumptions of transitivity and consistency. In addition, NMA estimates from\nsparse networks are expected to be imprecise and possibly biased as they rely\non large sample approximations which are invalid in the absence of sufficient\ndata. We propose a Bayesian framework that allows sharing of information\nbetween two networks that pertain to different population subgroups.\nSpecifically, we use the results from a subgroup with a lot of direct evidence\n(a dense network) to construct informative priors for the relative effects in\nthe target subgroup (a sparse network). This is a two-stage approach where at\nthe first stage we extrapolate the results of the dense network to those\nexpected from the sparse network. This takes place by using a modified\nhierarchical NMA model where we add a location parameter that shifts the\ndistribution of the relative effects to make them applicable to the target\npopulation. At the second stage, these extrapolated results are used as prior\ninformation for the sparse network. We illustrate our approach through a\nmotivating example of psychiatric patients.

Aggregate insurance liability cashflows typically\ncorrespond to stochastic payments several years into the future. However,\ninsurance regulation requires that capital requirements are computed for a\none-year horizon, by considering cashflows during the year and end-of-year\nliability values. This implies that liability values must be computed\nrecursively, backwards in time, starting from the year of the most distant\nliability payments. Solving such backward recursions with paper and pen is\nrarely possible, and numerical solutions give rise to major computational\nchallenges.\n  The aim of this paper is to provide explicit and easily computable\nexpressions for multi-period valuations that appear as limit objects for a\nsequence of multi-period models that converge in terms of conditional weak\nconvergence. Such convergence appears naturally if we consider large insurance\nportfolios such that the liability cashflows, appropriately centered and\nscaled, converge weakly as the size of the portfolio tends to infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 14:19:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

However, not\nonly the huge variation in the appearance, scale and orientation of the\nconcepts in aerial images, but also the scarcity of the well-annotated datasets\nrestricts the development of VQA in this domain.

To benchmark the\nunderstanding capability of VQA models for aerial images, we evaluate the\nrelevant methods on HRVQA.

We also study the impact of extinction and of a\npotential circumstellar environment on the projection factor.

We find that the choice\nof the SBCR is critical: a scatter of about 8% is found in the projection\nfactor for different SBCRs in the literature. The uncertainty on the\ncoefficients of the SBCR affects the statistical precision of the projection\nfactor only little (1-2\\%). Confirming previous studies, we find that the\nmethod with which the radial velocity curve is derived is also critical, with a\npotential difference on the projection factor of 9%. An increase of 0.1 in\nE(B-V) translates into a decrease in the projection factor of 3%. A 0.1\nmagnitude effect of a circumstellar envelope (CSE) in the visible domain is\nrather small on the projection factor, about 1.5%.

The study of the analytic structure of the neutral rho-meson spectral\nfunction in such a medium shows that in addition to the usual contribution\ncoming from the Unitary cut beyond the two-pion threshold there is a\nnon-trivial yield in the low invariant mass region originating due to the fact\nthat the charged pions occupy different Landau levels before and after\nscattering with the neutral rho-meson and is purely a finite magnetic field\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 15:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 15:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

At any point in time a pattern\nmatching query for a pattern $P$ may arrive, also streamed one character at a\ntime, and all occurrences of $P$ within the current window must be returned.\nThe streaming sliding window string indexing problem naturally captures\nscenarios where we want to index the most recent data (i.e. the window) of a\nstream while supporting efficient pattern matching.\n  Our main result is a simple $O(w)$ space data structure that uses $O(\\log w)$\ntime with high probability to process each character from both the input string\n$S$ and the pattern string $P$.

Individual motor unit firings are currently identified in vivo by\ndecomposing electromyographic (EMG) signals. Due to our body's electric\nproperties, individual motor units can only be separated to a limited extent\nwith surface EMG. Unlike electrical signals, magnetic fields pass through\nbiological tissues without distortion. This physical property and emerging\ntechnology of quantum sensors make magnetomyography (MMG) a highly promising\nmethodology. However, the full potential of MMG to study neuromuscular\nphysiology has not yet been explored. In this work, we perform in silico trials\nthat combine a biophysical model of EMG and MMG with state-of-the-art\nalgorithms for the decomposition of motor units. This allows the prediction of\nan upper-bound for the motor unit decomposition accuracy. It is shown that\nnon-invasive MMG is superior over surface EMG for the robust identification of\nthe discharge patterns of individual motor units. Decomposing MMG instead of\nEMG increased the number of identifiable motor units by 71%. Notably, MMG\nexhibits a less pronounced bias to detect superficial motor units.

However, existing approaches directly model part\nfeatures and global features, which can easily lead to serious gradient\nvanishing issues due to their unequal feature information and unreliable\npseudo-labels for unsupervised vehicle re-identification. To address this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a simple Triplet Contrastive Representation\nLearning (TCRL) framework which leverages cluster features to bridge the part\nfeatures and global features for unsupervised vehicle re-identification.\nSpecifically, TCRL devises three memory banks to store the instance/cluster\nfeatures and proposes a Proxy Contrastive Loss (PCL) to make contrastive\nlearning between adjacent memory banks, thus presenting the associations\nbetween the part and global features as a transition of the part-cluster and\ncluster-global associations. Since the cluster memory bank copes with all the\nvehicle features, it can summarize them into a discriminative feature\nrepresentation. To deeply exploit the instance/cluster information, TCRL\nproposes two additional loss functions. For the instance-level feature, a\nHybrid Contrastive Loss (HCL) re-defines the sample correlations by approaching\nthe positive instance features and pushing the all negative instance features\naway. For the cluster-level feature, a Weighted Regularization Cluster\nContrastive Loss (WRCCL) refines the pseudo labels by penalizing the mislabeled\nimages according to the instance similarity.

We\ndemonstrate, through numerical and visual experiments, that the proposed ViGU\nand GAN variant outperform existing CNN and GAN-based methods. Moreover, we\nshow that the proposed network readily competes with approaches based on\nTransformers while requiring a fraction of the computational cost. More\nimportantly, the graph structure of the network reveals how the network\nextracts features from MR images, providing intuitive explainability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 12:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

We propose a\nmethod to combine prior knowledge with data-driven methods to significantly\nreduce their data dependency. In this study, component-based machine learning\n(CBML) as the knowledge-encoded data-driven method is examined in the context\nof energy-efficient building engineering. It encodes the abstraction of\nbuilding structural knowledge as semantic information in the model\norganization. We design a case experiment to understand the efficacy of\nknowledge-encoded ML in sparse data input (1% - 0.0125% sampling rate). The\nresult reveals its three advanced features compared with pure ML methods: 1.\nSignificant improvement in the robustness of ML to extremely small-size and\ninconsistent datasets; 2. Efficient data utilization from different entities'\nrecord collections; 3. Characteristics of accepting incomplete data with high\ninterpretability and reduced training time. All these features provide a\npromising path to alleviating the deployment bottleneck of data-intensive\nmethods and contribute to efficient real-world data usage. Moreover, four\nnecessary prerequisites are summarized in this study that ensures the target\nscenario benefits by combining prior knowledge and ML generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 08:56:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 16:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Interest rates are purely set by the supply and\ndemand of capital according to a pre-defined function. In the lead-up to The\nMerge: Ethereum blockchain's transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to\nproof-of-stake (PoS), a fraction of the Ethereum ecosystem announced plans of\ncontinuing with a PoW-chain. Owners of ETH - whether their ETH was borrowed or\nnot - would hold the native tokens on each chain. This development alarmed\nlending protocols. They feared spiking ETH borrowing rates would lead to mass\nliquidations which could undermine their viability. Thus, the decentralized\nautonomous organization running the protocols saw no alternative to\nintervention - restricting users' ability to borrow.\n  We investigate the effects of the merge and the intervention on the two\nbiggest lending protocols on Ethereum: AAVE and Compound. Our analysis finds\nthat borrowing rates were extremely volatile, jumping by two orders of\nmagnitude, and borrowing at times reached 100% of the available funds. Despite\nthis, no spike in mass liquidations or irretrievable loans materialized.\nFurther, we are the first to quantify and analyze hard-fork-arbitrage,\nprofiting from holding debt in the native blockchain token during a hard fork.\nWe find that arbitrageurs made 13 Mio US$, money that was effectively extracted\nfrom the platforms' lenders.\n  Finally, we identify alarming security risks to the entire Ethereum\necosystem. Around one-fifth of the staked ETH through LIDO (stETH) was locked\nas collateral on lending protocols. Mass liquidations caused by spiking rates\nwould have devastating effects on the stETH price and pose security concerns\nfor the consensus layer, as staking power could be bought at a significant\ndiscount.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 10:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

Cyberspace refers to the online world that is separate from\neveryday reality. Since the internet is a recent advance in human lives, there\nare many unknown and unpredictable aspects to it that sometimes can be\ncatastrophic to users in financial aspects, high-tech industry, and healthcare.\nCybersecurity failures are usually caused by human errors or their lack of\nknowledge. According to the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)\nX-Force Threat Intelligence Index in 2020, around 8.5 billion records were\ncompromised in 2019 due to failures of insiders, which is an increase of more\nthan 200 percent compared to the compromised records in 2018. In another survey\nperformed by the Ernst and Young Global Information Security during 2018-2019,\nit is reported that 34% of the organizations stated that employees who are\ninattentive or do not have the necessary knowledge are the principal\nvulnerabilities of cybersecurity, and 22% of the organizations indicated that\nphishing is the main threat to them. Inattentive users are one of the reasons\nfor data breaches and cyberattacks. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)\nin the United Kingdom observed that 23.2 million users who were victims of\ncybersecurity attacks used a carelessly selected password, which is 123456, as\ntheir account password. The Annual Cybersecurity Report published by Cisco in\n2018 announced that phishing and spear phishing emails are the root causes of\nmany cybersecurity attacks in recent years. Hence, enhancing the cybersecurity\nbehaviors of both personal users and organizations can protect vulnerable users\nfrom cyber threats. Both human factors and technological aspects of\ncybersecurity should be addressed in organizations for a safer environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 18:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}
