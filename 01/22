The present work investigates the effects of various\nsurfactants (i.e., anionic, cationic, and nonionic) and pH medium on bulk NBs\nformation, size, concentration, bubble size distribution (BSD), zeta potential,\nand stability. The effect of surfactant was investigated at various\nconcentrations above and below critical micelle concentrations. NBs were\ncreated in DI water using a piezoelectric transducer. The stability of NBs was\nassessed by tracking the change in size and concentration over time. NBs size\nis small in the neutral medium compared to the other surfactant or pH mediums.\nThe size, concentration, BSD, and stability of NBs are strongly influenced by\nthe zeta potential rather than the solution medium. BSD curve shifts to lower\nbubble sizes when the magnitude of zeta potential is high in any solution. NBs\nwere observed to exist for a long time, either in pure water, surfactant, or pH\nsolutions. The longevity of NBs is shortened in environments with pH less than\n3. Surfactant adsorption on the NBs surface increases with surfactant\nconcentration up to a certain limit, beyond which it declines considerably. The\nDerjaguin-LandauVerwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory was used to interpret the NBs\nstability, which resulted in a total potential energy barrier that is positive\nand greater than 43.90kBT for pH ranging from 6.0 to 11.0, whereas, for pH\nbelow 6, the potential energy barrier essentially vanishes.

Within state-of-the-art NLP tasks, it is\nwell understood that utilizing context-specific representations from\ntransformer-based pre-trained language models helps achieve improved\nperformance. Within this affective computing task, we explore how incorporating\naffective information can further enhance performance. Towards this, we\nleverage context-specific and affect enriched representations by using a\ntransformer-based pre-trained language model in tandem with affect enriched\nBi-LSTM+Attention. For empirical evaluation, we procure a new dataset REN-20k,\nbesides using RENh-4k and SemEval-2007.

Even glycolysis, the paradigm example of\noscillatory biochemistry, has seen questions about its oscillatory function.\nHere, we take a systems approach to summarize evidence that oscillations play\ncritical physiological roles. Oscillatory behavior enables systems to avoid\ndesensitization, to avoid chronically high and therefore toxic levels of\nchemicals, and to become more resistant to noise. Oscillation also enables\ncomplex physiological systems to reconcile incompatible conditions such as\noxidation and reduction, by cycling between them, and to synchronize the\noscillations of many small units into one large effect. In pancreatic beta\ncells, glycolytic oscillations are in synchrony with calcium and mitochondrial\noscillations to drive pulsatile insulin release, which is pivotal for the liver\nto regulate blood glucose dynamics. In addition, oscillation can keep\nbiological time, essential for embryonic development in promoting cell\ndiversity and pattern formation. The functional importance of oscillatory\nprocesses requires a rethinking of the traditional doctrine of homeostasis,\nholding that physiological quantities are maintained at constant equilibrium\nvalues, a view that has largely failed us in the clinic.

First, for a set of training flow configurations we assign to component\nmodels high weights in the regions where they best perform, and vice versa, by\nintroducing a measure of distance between high-fidelity data and individual\nmodel predictions. The model weights are then mapped into a space of features,\nrepresentative of local flow physics, and regressed by a Random Forests (RF)\nalgorithm. The RF regressor is finally employed to infer spatial distributions\nof the model weights for unseen configurations.

Among them,\nthe tidal and magnetic interactions drive orbital decay and star-planet angular\nmomentum exchange, leading to stellar spin-up. As a result of the above\nprocesses, a planet may initiate the mass transfer to the host star once it\nencounters the Roche limit. Another mechanism providing substantial mass loss\nis associated with the atmospheric escape caused by photoevaporation followed\nby orbital expansion, which is thought to be important for hot Neptunes and\nsuper-Earths. Thus, the fraction of the initial number of hot Jupiters may\ntransform into lower-mass planets through the Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) phase\nand continue secular evolution under the effect of photoevaporation. In the\npresent paper, we compile the latest prescriptions for tidal and magnetic\nmigration and mass-loss rates to explore the dynamics of hot Jupiter systems.\nWe study how the implemented interactions shape the orbital architecture of\nJovian planets and whether their impact is enough to reproduce the\nobservational sample. Our models suggest that the tidal interaction is able to\ngenerate the upper boundary of the hot Jupiter population in the\nmass-separation diagram. To recreate the sub-Jovian desert, we need to make\nadditional assumptions regarding the RLO phase or the influence of the\nprotoplanetary disc's inner edge on the initial planetary location. According\nto our estimates, 12-15% of hot Jupiters around solar-mass stars have been\nengulfed or become lower-mass planets. 0.20-0.25% of the present-day giant\nplanet population undergoes decay intense enough to be detected with modern\nfacilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 00:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

However, constraint-based causal discovery algorithms\nstruggle when data is limited since conditional independence tests quickly lose\ntheir statistical power, especially when the conditioning set is large. To\naddress this, we propose using conditional independence tests where the size of\nthe conditioning set is upper bounded by some integer $k$ for robust causal\ndiscovery. The existing graphical characterizations of the equivalence classes\nof causal graphs are not applicable when we cannot leverage all the conditional\nindependence statements.

For a metal with dense magnetic impurities such that Kondo\nclouds overlap with each other, correlated ground states are formed. When the\nimpurities form a regular lattice, the result is a heavy fermion or\nanti-ferromagnetic order depending on the dominant interaction5,6. Even in the\ncase of random impurities, overlapping Kondo clouds are expected to form a\ncoherent ground state.

We detect the Kondo effect\nin the resistivity of the Si metal below 2 K and an exotic pseudogap in the DOS\nwith gap edge peaks at a Fermi energy below 100 mK. The DOS gap and peaks are\ntuned by applying an external magnetic field and transformed into a metallic\nAltshuler-Aronov gap8 in the paramagnetic disordered Fermi liquid (DFL) phase.\nWe interpret this phenomenon as the Kondo condensation, the formation of a\ncorrelated ground state of overlapping Kondo clouds, and its transition to a\nDFL.

Recent\nyears have witnessed a blossom in applying machine learning (ML) methods to\nrevolutionize the paradigm of turbulence modeling. However, due to the\nblack-box essence of most ML methods, it is currently hard to extract\ninterpretable information and knowledge from data-driven models. To address\nthis critical limitation, this work leverages deep learning with symbolic\nregression methods to discover hidden governing equations of Reynolds stress\nmodels. Specifically, the Reynolds stress tensor is decomposed into linear and\nnon-linear parts. While the linear part is taken as the regular linear eddy\nviscosity model, a long short-term memory neural network is employed to\ngenerate symbolic terms on which tractable mathematical expressions for the\nnon-linear counterpart are built. A novel reinforcement learning algorithm is\nemployed to train the neural network to produce best-fitted symbolic\nexpressions. Within the proposed framework, the Reynolds stress closure is\nexplicitly expressed in algebraic forms, thus allowing for direct functional\ninference. On the other hand, the Galilean and rotational invariance are\ncraftily respected by constructing the training feature space with independent\ninvariants and tensor basis functions. The performance of the present\nmethodology is validated through numerical simulations of three different\ncanonical flows that deviate in geometrical configurations. The results\ndemonstrate promising accuracy improvements over traditional RANS models,\nshowing the generalization ability of the proposed method. Moreover, with the\ngiven explicit model equations, it can be easier to interpret the influence of\ninput features on generated models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 04:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

However, the existing AT methods still suffer from two challenges.\nFirst, they are unable to handle unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs),\nwhich are built from scratch, as opposed to restricted adversarial examples\n(RAEs), which are created by adding perturbations bound by an $l_p$ norm to\nobserved examples. Second, the existing AT methods often achieve adversarial\nrobustness at the expense of standard generalizability (i.e., the accuracy on\nnatural examples) because they make a tradeoff between them. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a unique viewpoint that understands UAEs as\nimperceptibly perturbed unobserved examples. Also, we find that the tradeoff\nresults from the separation of the distributions of adversarial examples and\nnatural examples. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel AT approach called\nProvable Unrestricted Adversarial Training (PUAT), which can provide a target\nclassifier with comprehensive adversarial robustness against both UAE and RAE,\nand simultaneously improve its standard generalizability. Particularly, PUAT\nutilizes partially labeled data to achieve effective UAE generation by\naccurately capturing the natural data distribution through a novel augmented\ntriple-GAN. At the same time, PUAT extends the traditional AT by introducing\nthe supervised loss of the target classifier into the adversarial loss and\nachieves the alignment between the UAE distribution, the natural data\ndistribution, and the distribution learned by the classifier, with the\ncollaboration of the augmented triple-GAN. Finally, the solid theoretical\nanalysis and extensive experiments conducted on widely-used benchmarks\ndemonstrate the superiority of PUAT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 07:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

This task has achieved\nsignificant momentum in the computer vision community as it enables activity\ngrounding beyond pre-defined activity classes by utilizing the semantic\ndiversity of natural language descriptions. The semantic diversity is rooted in\nthe principle of compositionality in linguistics, where novel semantics can be\nsystematically described by combining known words in novel ways (compositional\ngeneralization). However, existing temporal grounding datasets are not\ncarefully designed to evaluate the compositional generalizability.

However, it is also observed that these state-of-the-art\npre-trained models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. The performance of\nthese pre-trained models drops significantly with simple perturbations such as\nrenaming variable names. This weakness may be inherited by their downstream\nmodels and thereby amplified at an unprecedented scale. To this end, we propose\nan approach namely ContraBERT that aims to improve the robustness of\npre-trained models via contrastive learning. Specifically, we design nine kinds\nof simple and complex data augmentation operators on the programming language\n(PL) and natural language (NL) data to construct different variants.\nFurthermore, we continue to train the existing pre-trained models by masked\nlanguage modeling (MLM) and contrastive pre-training task on the original\nsamples with their augmented variants to enhance the robustness of the model.\nThe extensive experiments demonstrate that ContraBERT can effectively improve\nthe robustness of the existing pre-trained models.

Here, we present radiative transfer calculations for a Type\nII SN with and without this interaction power, focusing on the phase between\n350 and 1000d after explosion. Without interaction power, the ejecta are\npowered through radioactive decay whose exponential decline produces an\never-fading SN. Instead, with a constant interaction power of $10^{40}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ (representative of an SN II ramming into a steady-state $10^{-6}\nM_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ wind), the spectrum morphs from decay powered at 350d, with\nnarrow lines forming in the inner metal-rich ejecta, to interaction powered at\n1000d, with broad boxy lines forming in the outer H-rich ejecta. Intermediate\ntimes are characterized by a hybrid and complex spectrum made of overlapping\nnarrow and broad lines. While interaction boosts primarily the flux in the\nultraviolet, which remains largely unobserved today, a knee in the $R$-band\nlight curve or a $U$-band boost are clear signatures of interaction at late\ntimes.

We hypothesize that the 3D\ngeometry is underdetermined due to the insufficient constraint, i.e., being\nclassified as real image to the discriminator is not enough. To solve this\nproblem, we propose to approximate the background as a spherical surface and\nrepresent a scene as a union of the foreground placed in the sphere and the\nthin spherical background. It reduces the degree of freedom in the background\nfield. Accordingly, we modify the volume rendering equation and incorporate\ndedicated constraints to design a novel 3D-aware GAN framework named BallGAN.\nBallGAN has multiple advantages as follows. 1) It produces more reasonable 3D\ngeometry; the images of a scene across different viewpoints have better\nphotometric consistency and fidelity than the state-of-the-art methods. 2) The\ntraining becomes much more stable. 3) The foreground can be separately rendered\non top of different arbitrary backgrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 10:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

Here we propose the generation of a magnon bundle\nin a hybrid magnet-qubit system, where two or more magnons are emitted\nsimultaneously. By tuning the driving frequency of qubit to match the detuning\nbetween magnon and qubit mode, one can effectively generate a magnon bundle via\nsuper-Rabi oscillations. In contrast with general wisdom, magnetic dissipation\nplays an enabling role in generating the magnon bundle, where the relaxation\ntime of magnons determines the typical time delay between two successive\nmagnons. The maximal damping that allows an antibunched magnon bundle can reach\nthe order of 0.1, which may break the monopoly of low-dissipation magnetic\ninsulators in quantum spintronics and enables a large class of magnetic\nmaterials for quantum manipulation.

Moreover, we suggest that afternoon crowding can be\npredicted at 1 p.m. with an AUC of 0.84.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 12:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

Moreover, dense item\nembedding in FL results in expensive communication cost and latency. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Federated Recommendation with Additive\nPersonalization (FedRAP), which learns a global view of items via FL and a\npersonalized view locally on each user.

Recent work has shown promise in simplifying protein\nstructures as sequences of protein angles; therefore, language models could be\nused for unconstrained protein backbone generation. Unfortunately, such\nsimplification is unsuitable for the constrained protein inpainting problem,\nwhere the model needs to recover masked structures conditioned on unmasked\nones, as it dramatically increases the computing cost of geometric constraints.\nTo overcome this dilemma, we suggest inserting a hidden \\textbf{a}tomic\n\\textbf{d}irection \\textbf{s}pace (\\textbf{ADS}) upon the language model,\nconverting invariant backbone angles into equivalent direction vectors and\npreserving the simplicity, called Seq2Direct encoder ($\\text{Enc}_{s2d}$).\nGeometric constraints could be efficiently imposed on the newly introduced\ndirection space.

These movements cover several thousand\nkilometers and have the capability of connecting the whole West African region\nthus facilitating the diffusion of many animal and zoonotic diseases. Several\nfactors shape mobility patterns even in normal years and surveillance systems\nneed to account for such changes. In this paper, we present a procedure based\non temporal network theory to identify possible sentinel locations using two\nindicators: vulnerability (i.e. the probability of being reached by the\ndisease) and time of infection (i.e. the time of first arrival of the disease).\nUsing these indicators in our structural analysis of the changing network\nenabled us to identify a set of nodes that could be used in an early warning\nsystem.

For\nthis reason, several sets of sentinel nodes were identified in different\nperiods of the year, underlining the role of temporality in shaping patterns of\ndisease diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 13:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

Here we use electroanalytical\nRotating-Disk Electrode (RDE) studies in a three-electrode electrochemical cell\nto elucidate the fundamental origin of moss-like growth of metals. We report\nthat competing Faradaic reactions occurring on the electrode surface is the\nsource of the phenomenon. On this basis, we conclude that a moss-like growth\nregime can be accessed during electrodeposition of any metal by subtle shifts\nin electrolyte chemistry and deposition rate. Specifically, for Zn, a metal\nthat conventionally is not known to form moss-like electrodeposits, obvious\nmoss-like deposition patterns emerge at low-current densities in\nstrongly-alkaline electrolytes that undergo electroreduction to form an\ninterphase on the electrodeposited Zn. Conversely, we find that under\nconditions where the rate of metal electroplating is large relative to that of\nother competing Faradaic reactions, it is possible to eliminate the mossy-like\ngrowth regime for Zn. Taken together, our findings open up a new approach for\nsimultaneously achieving favorable metal deposition morphology and fast\ncharging in next-generation batteries using metal anodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2023 19:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

It spreads its leaves by the force of its spines and creates a large\nshadow underneath, killing any plants that require sunlight. These water\ntyrants use their formidable spines to compel each other to the surface and\nincrease their strength to grab more space from the surface. As they spread\nthroughout the pond or basin, with the earliest-growing leaves having more room\nto grow, each leaf gains a unique size. Its flowers are transsexual and when\nthey bloom, Cyclocephala beetles are responsible for the pollination process,\nbeing attracted to the scent of the female flower. After entering the flower,\nthe beetle becomes covered with pollen and transfers it to another flower for\nfertilization. After the beetle leaves, the flower turns into a male and\nchanges color from white to pink. The male flower dies and sinks into the\nwater, releasing its seed to help create a new generation. In this paper, the\nmathematical life cycle of this magnificent plant is introduced, and each leaf\nand blossom are treated as a single entity. The proposed bio-inspired algorithm\nis tested with 24 benchmark optimization test functions, such as Ackley, and\ncompared to ten other famous algorithms, including the Genetic Algorithm. The\nproposed algorithm is tested on 10 optimization problems: Minimum Spanning\nTree, Hub Location Allocation, Quadratic Assignment, Clustering, Feature\nSelection, Regression, Economic Dispatching, Parallel Machine Scheduling, Color\nQuantization, and Image Segmentation and compared to traditional and\nbio-inspired algorithms. Overall, the performance of the algorithm in all tasks\nis satisfactory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 10:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

One of the key characteristics\nof a CPS is its ability to take input from its environment and use that\ninformation to produce an output through actuators in the physical world. A\nbalancing robot is a prime example of a CPS, as it uses input from its sensors\nto continually monitor its orientation and take action to prevent falling over\nby generating thrust through its wheels or manipulating its inertia. In this\nspecific project, a two-wheel self-balancing robot was developed, utilizing the\nconcept of a reverse pendulum. A reverse pendulum by default is inherently\nunstable and requires an external force to maintain its balance. In this case,\nthe balancing robot produces this external force through the use of wheels and\nmotors. To achieve precise balancing, stepper motors were utilized in the\ndesign of the robot. Additionally, the robot has the capability to move in four\nbasic directions and the movement is controlled through an app connected to the\nrobot via Bluetooth. This allows for remote control and monitoring of the\nrobot's movements and actions.
