A stability investigation\nfor these methods, which are outside the class of general linear methods, is\nchallenging since the iterates are always generated by a nonlinear map even for\nlinear problems. Recently, a stability theorem was derived presenting criteria\nfor understanding such schemes.\n  For the analysis, the schemes are applied to general linear equations and\nproven to be generated by $\\mathcal C^1$-maps with locally Lipschitz continuous\nfirst derivatives. As a result, the above mentioned stability theorem can be\napplied to investigate the Lyapunov stability of non-hyperbolic fixed points of\nthe numerical method by analyzing the spectrum of the corresponding Jacobian of\nthe generating map. In addition, if a fixed point is proven to be stable, the\ntheorem guarantees the local convergence of the iterates towards it.\n  In the case of first and second order gBBKS schemes the stability domain\ncoincides with that of the underlying Runge--Kutta method. Furthermore, while\nthe first order GeCo scheme converts steady states to stable fixed points for\nall step sizes and all linear test problems of finite size, the second order\nGeCo scheme has a bounded stability region for the considered test problems.\nFinally, all theoretical predictions from the stability analysis are validated\nnumerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 16:00:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 16:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

However, recommender systems often face more\nchallenging fairness issues for new users or cold-start users due to their\ninsufficient amount of interactions. Therefore, it is essential to study\nwhether the trained model still performs fairly for a new set of cold-start\nusers. This paper considers the scenario where the recommender system meets new\nusers who only have limited or even no interaction with the platform, and aims\nat providing high-quality and fair recommendations to such users effectively.\nThe sufficient interaction data from warm users is treated as the source user\ndomain, while the data from new users is treated as the target user domain, and\nwe consider to transfer the counterfactual fairness from the source users to\nthe target users. To this end, we introduce a framework to achieve transferable\ncounterfactual fairness in recommendation.

For the ISM trees, this article\npresents novel algorithms for recognizing scenes and predicting the poses of\nsearched objects. We define scenes as sets of objects, where some objects are\nconnected by 3-D spatial relations. In previous work, we recognized scenes\nusing single ISMs. However, these ISMs were prone to false positives. To\naddress this problem, we introduced ISM trees, a hierarchical model that\nincludes multiple ISMs. Through the recognition algorithm it contributes, this\narticle ultimately enables the use of ISM trees in scene recognition. We intend\nto enable users to generate ISM trees from object arrangements demonstrated by\nhumans. The lack of a suitable algorithm is overcome by the introduction of an\nISM tree generation algorithm. In scene recognition, it is usually assumed that\nimage data is already available. However, this is not always the case for\nrobots. For this reason, we combined scene recognition and object search in\nprevious work.

Unlike the 1998 and\n2010 outbursts, where a giant outburst was followed by several low intensity\nperiodic outbursts, the 2018 and 2021 outbursts were single outbursts. The\nX-ray pulsations are detected over a broad energy band covering 0.5-80 keV from\nthe compact object. We construct the spin evolution history of the pulsar over\ntwo decades and find that the pulsar spins-up during the outbursts but switches\nto spin-down state in the quiescent periods between the outbursts. Energy\nresolved pulse profiles generated in several bands in 0.5-80 keV show that the\npulse shape varies with the energy. The energy spectrum of the pulsar is\ndetermined for the 2018 and 2021 outbursts.

The\ndistinguishing feature of the present work is that agents are constrained to\nshare opinions regarding only a single hypothesis. We devise a novel learning\nstrategy where each agent forms a valid belief by completing the partial\nbeliefs received from its neighbors. This completion is performed by exploiting\nthe knowledge accumulated in the past beliefs, thanks to a principled\nmemory-aware rule inspired by a Bayesian criterion.

Despite being\narguably a key parameter, no systematic and satisfactory guiding principles\nexist to select the number of units required for a given task and environment.\nEven when limited by practical considerations, system designers should endeavor\nto identify what a reasonable swarm size should be. Here, we show that this\nfundamental question is closely linked to that of selecting an appropriate\nswarm density. Our analysis of the influence of density on the collective\nperformance of a target tracking task reveals different `phases' corresponding\nto markedly distinct group dynamics. We identify a `transition' phase, in which\na complex emergent collective response arises. Interestingly, the collective\ndynamics within this transition phase exhibit a clear trade-off between\nexploratory actions and exploitative ones. We show that at any density, the\nexploration-exploitation balance can be adjusted to maximize the system's\nperformance through various means, such as by changing the level of\nconnectivity between agents. While the density is the primary factor to be\nconsidered, it should not be the sole one to be accounted for when sizing the\nsystem. Due to the inherent finite-size effects present in physical systems, we\nestablish that the number of constituents primarily affects system-level\nproperties such as exploitation in the transition phase.

However, its\nquantized pulse-based operation and high environmental requirements, process\nvariations and other SFQ-specific non-idealities are the significant causes of\nlogic error for SFQ circuits.

Given the safety requirements associated with\noperating in proximity to humans and expensive infrastructure, it is important\nto understand and mitigate the security vulnerabilities of such systems caused\nby compromised robots who diverge from their assigned plans. We focus on\ncentralized systems, where a *central entity* (CE) is responsible for\ndetermining and transmitting the motion plans to the robots, which report their\nlocation as they move following the plan. The CE checks that robots follow\ntheir assigned plans by comparing their expected location to the location they\nself-report.

In this setting, the complexity can\nbe flexibly adjusted via the kernel width or by using a stride greater than\none. Moreover, scaling from smaller to larger systems -- or the transfer\nbetween different domains -- becomes a straightforward task requiring little\neffort. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework using several\nPDE examples with increasing complexity, where stabilization is achieved by\ntraining a low-dimensional deep deterministic policy gradient agent using\nminimal computing resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 17:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-26"}

Instead, in\nthis work we investigate an IRS-aided time division multiple access (TDMA)\ncellular network, where the reconfiguration of the IRS may entail an energy or\ncommunication cost, and we aim at limiting the number of reconfigurations over\ntime. We develop a clustering-based heuristic scheduling, which optimizes the\nsystem sum-rate subject to a given number of reconfigurations within the TDMA\nframe. To such end, we first cluster user equipments (UEs) with a similar\noptimal IRS configuration. Then, we compute an overall IRS cluster\nconfiguration, which can be thus kept constant while scheduling the whole UEs\ncluster.

We perform an extensive numerical simulation and demonstrates that\nproposed FQAOA provides substantial performance advantage against existing\napproaches in portfolio optimization problems.

While this problem can be formulated as a combination of\nfence segmentation and image inpainting, this often leads to implausible\nhallucinations of the occluded regions. Existing multi-frame approaches rely on\npropagating information to a selected keyframe from its temporal neighbors, but\nthey are often inefficient and struggle with alignment of severely obstructed\nimages. In this work we draw inspiration from the video completion literature\nand develop a simplified framework for multi-frame de-fencing that computes\nhigh quality flow maps directly from obstructed frames and uses them to\naccurately align frames.

The near-Earth orbital space is shared by natural objects and space\ndebris that can be temporarily captured in geocentric orbits. Short-term\nnatural satellites are often called mini-moons. Reflectance spectroscopy can\ndetermine the true nature of transient satellites because the spectral\nsignatures of spacecraft materials and near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are\ndifferent. The recently discovered object 2022 NX1 follows an Earth-like orbit\nthat turns it into a recurrent but ephemeral Earth companion. It has been\nsuggested that 2022 NX1 could have an artificial origin or be lunar ejecta.\n  Aims. Here, we use reflectance spectroscopy and N-body simulations to\ndetermine the nature and actual origin of 2022 NX1.\n  Methods. We carried out an observational study of 2022 NX1, using the OSIRIS\ncamera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias, to derive its\nspectral class. N-body simulations were also performed to investigate how it\nreached NEA space.\n  Results. The reflectance spectrum of 2022 NX1 is neither compatible with an\nartificial origin nor lunar ejecta; it is also different from the V type of the\nonly other mini-moon with available spectroscopy, 2020 CD3. The visible\nspectrum of 2022 NX1 is consistent with that of a K-type asteroid, although it\ncould also be classified as an Xk type. Considering typical values of the\nsimilar albedo of both K-type and Xk-type asteroids and its absolute magnitude,\n2022 NX1 may have a size range of 5 to 15 m. We confirm that 2022 NX1 inhabits\nthe rim of Earth's co-orbital space, the 1:1 mean-motion resonance, and\nexperiences recurrent co-orbital engagements of the horseshoe-type and\nmini-moon events.\n  Conclusions. The discovery of 2022 NX1 confirms that mini-moons can be larger\nthan a few meters and also that they belong to a heterogeneous population in\nterms of surface composition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 19:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

To address this issue, we extend the recently proposed Neural\nGalerkin Projection (NeuralGP) data driven framework to\ncompressibility-dominated transonic flow, considering a prototypical problem of\na buffeting NACA0012 airfoil governed by the full Navier-Stokes equations. The\nalgorithm maintains the form of the ROM-ODE obtained from the Galerkin\nprojection; however coefficients are learned directly from the data using\ngradient descent facilitated by differentiable programming.

For this implementation, a pad of 56 2-qubit\nPermutation matrices was used, providing 256 bits of entropy for the QPP\nalgorithm. An image of a cat was used as the plaintext for this experiment. To\ncreate corresponding superposition states, we applied a novel operator defined\nin this paper.

Due to the lack of a quantum\nchannel, we omitted the transmission and executed the decryption procedure on\nthe same IBM quantum system. If a quantum channel existed, the superposition\nciphertext states could be transmitted as qubits, and be directly decrypted on\na different quantum system. We provide a brief discussion of the security,\nalthough the focus of the paper remains on the implementation.

While the\nbifurcations at low Rayleigh number, when the flow is laminar or moderately\nchaotic, have been fully understood for a long time, transitions at higher\nRayleigh number are much more difficult to be clearly identified. Here, through\na numerical study of the two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection covering\nfour decades in Rayleigh number for two different Prandtl numbers, we find a\nclear-cut transition by considering the fluctuations of the heat flux through a\nhorizontal plane, rather than its mean value. More specifically, we have found\nthat this sharp transition is displayed by a jump of the ratio of the\nroot-mean-square fluctuations of the heat flux to its mean value and occurs at\n$Ra/Pr \\approx 10^9$. Above the transition, this ratio is found to be constant\nin all regions of the flow, while taking different values in the bulk and at\nthe boundaries. Below the transition instead, different behaviors are observed\nat the boundaries and in the bulk: at the boundaries, this ratio decreases with\nrespect to the Rayleigh number whereas it is found to be constant in the bulk\nfor all values of the Rayleigh number. Through this numerical evidence and an\nanalytical reasoning we confirm what was already observed in experiments, that\nis the decrease of the ratio of root-mean-square fluctuations of the heat flux\nto its mean value, observed at the boundaries below the transition, can\nunderstood in terms of the law of large numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 21:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

Many advances in pruning leverage concepts from the Lottery Ticket\nHypothesis (LTH). LTH reveals that inside a trained dense network exists sparse\nsubnetworks (tickets) able to achieve similar accuracy (i.e., win the lottery -\nwinning tickets). Pruning at initialization focuses on finding winning tickets\nwithout training a dense network. Studies on these concepts share the trend\nthat subnetworks come from weight or filter pruning. In this work, we\ninvestigate LTH and pruning at initialization from the lens of layer pruning.\nFirst, we confirm the existence of winning tickets when the pruning process\nremoves layers. Leveraged by this observation, we propose to discover these\nwinning tickets at initialization, eliminating the requirement of heavy\ncomputational resources for training the initial (over-parameterized) dense\nnetwork. Extensive experiments show that our winning tickets notably speed up\nthe training phase and reduce up to 51% of carbon emission, an important step\ntowards democratization and green Artificial Intelligence.

Transformer-based\napproaches are currently prevailing since they enlarge the reception field to\nmodel global contextual correlation. To further extract rich representations,\nsome extensions of the U-Net employ multi-scale feature extraction and fusion\nmodules and obtain improved performance. Inspired by this idea, we propose\nTransCeption for medical image segmentation, a pure transformer-based U-shape\nnetwork featured by incorporating the inception-like module into the encoder\nand adopting a contextual bridge for better feature fusion. The design proposed\nin this work is based on three core principles: (1) The patch merging module in\nthe encoder is redesigned with ResInception Patch Merging (RIPM). Multi-branch\ntransformer (MB transformer) adopts the same number of branches as the outputs\nof RIPM. Combining the two modules enables the model to capture a multi-scale\nrepresentation within a single stage. (2) We construct an Intra-stage Feature\nFusion (IFF) module following the MB transformer to enhance the aggregation of\nfeature maps from all the branches and particularly focus on the interaction\nbetween the different channels of all the scales. (3) In contrast to a bridge\nthat only contains token-wise self-attention, we propose a Dual Transformer\nBridge that also includes channel-wise self-attention to exploit correlations\nbetween scales at different stages from a dual perspective.

The second phenomenon is related to the ability of particles to turn from\nthe wellbore to a perforation. Consequently, the paper considers both of these\nphenomena independently at first, and then they are combined to address the\nwhole problem of flow in a perforated wellbore. A mathematical model for\ncalculating the particle and velocity profiles within the wellbore is\ndeveloped.

How\nto choose the most appropriate algorithm generally depends on the type of\nnetwork being analyzed and the specific properties of the data that define the\nnetwork. In functional temporal networks derived from neuronal spike train\ndata, communities are expected to be transient, and it is common for the\nnetwork to contain multiple singleton communities. Here, we compare the\nperformance of different DCD algorithms on functional temporal networks built\nfrom synthetic neuronal time series data with known community structure. We\nfind that, for these networks, DCD algorithms that utilize interlayer links to\nperform community carryover between layers outperform other methods. However,\nwe also observe that algorithm performance is highly dependent on the topology\nof interlayer links, especially in the presence of singleton and transient\ncommunities. We therefore define a novel method for defining interlayer links\nin temporal networks called skeleton coupling that is specifically designed to\nenhance the linkage of communities in the network throughout time based on the\ntopological properties of the community history. We show that integrating\nskeleton coupling with current DCD methods improves algorithm performance in\nsynthetic data with planted singleton and transient communities.

It is also well-understood\nthat students enter the physics classroom with a host of conceptions learned\nfrom the world at large. It stands to reason, then, to suspect that media\ncoverage may be a major contributing factor to students' views on physical\nphenomena and the nature of science - one whose influence will only grow amid\nthe 21st century digital age. Yet the role of the media in shaping physics\nteaching and learning has remained largely unexplored in the physics education\nresearch (PER) literature so far.\n  Here, we explore the phenomenon of media hype from a theoretical and\npractical perspective: how media rhetoric of current topics in science and\ntechnology evolves, and how it affects students and instructors. We argue that\nmedia hype of cutting-edge science can be a double-edged sword for educators,\nwith the same amped-up rhetoric that motivates students to enter the classroom\ntending to result in inflated preconceptions of what the science and technology\ncan actually do. We draw on examples related to teaching quantum computing as a\ncase study, though the findings we present should generalize to other topics\ngarnering significant media attention - from exoplanets to graphene to\nbatteries for electric vehicles. We conclude with a set of practical\nrecommendations for physics teachers at all levels who wish to be more\ncognizant of the role exposure to popular media has on students and to tailor\nour teaching accordingly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 00:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

Though modern\nneural networks have achieved impressive performance on both vision and\nlanguage tasks, we know little about the functions that they implement. One\npossibility is that neural networks implicitly break down complex tasks into\nsubroutines, implement modular solutions to these subroutines, and compose them\ninto an overall solution to a task -- a property we term structural\ncompositionality. Or they may simply learn to match new inputs to memorized\nrepresentations, eliding task decomposition entirely. Here, we leverage model\npruning techniques to investigate this question in both vision and language,\nacross a variety of architectures, tasks, and pretraining regimens. Our results\ndemonstrate that models oftentimes implement solutions to subroutines via\nmodular subnetworks, which can be ablated while maintaining the functionality\nof other subroutines. This suggests that neural networks may be able to learn\nto exhibit compositionality, obviating the need for specialized symbolic\nmechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 00:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

For example, in real-world healthcare data, spam detection\nlabels, and financial fraud detection datasets. Many data balance methods were\nintroduced to improve machine learning algorithms' performance. Research claims\nSMOTE and SMOTE-based data-augmentation (generate new data points) methods\ncould improve algorithm performance. However, we found in many online\ntutorials, the valuation methods were applied based on synthesized datasets\nthat introduced bias into the evaluation, and the performance got a false\nimprovement. In this study, we proposed, a new evaluation framework for\nimbalanced data learning methods. We have experimented on five data balance\nmethods and whether the performance of algorithms will improve or not. Methods\nWe collected 8 imbalanced healthcare datasets with different imbalanced rates\nfrom different domains. Applied 6 data augmentation methods with 11 machine\nlearning methods testing if the data augmentation will help with improving\nmachine learning performance. We compared the traditional data augmentation\nevaluation methods with our proposed cross-validation evaluation framework\nResults Using traditional data augmentation evaluation meta hods will give a\nfalse impression of improving the performance. However, our proposed evaluation\nmethod shows data augmentation has limited ability to improve the results.\nConclusion EFIDL is more suitable for evaluating the prediction performance of\nan ML method when data are augmented. Using an unsuitable evaluation framework\nwill give false results. Future researchers should consider the evaluation\nframework we proposed when dealing with augmented datasets. Our experiments\nshowed data augmentation does not help improve ML prediction performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 01:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

Therefore, when selecting an optimal feature set, we should\nconsider the influence of both feature and its interaction. However, most\nprevious works focus on either feature field selection or only select feature\ninteraction based on the fixed feature set to produce the feature set. The\nformer restricts search space to the feature field, which is too coarse to\ndetermine subtle features. They also do not filter useless feature\ninteractions, leading to higher computation costs and degraded model\nperformance. The latter identifies useful feature interaction from all\navailable features, resulting in many redundant features in the feature set. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method named OptFS to address these problems. To\nunify the selection of feature and its interaction, we decompose the selection\nof each feature interaction into the selection of two correlated features. Such\na decomposition makes the model end-to-end trainable given various feature\ninteraction operations. By adopting feature-level search space, we set a\nlearnable gate to determine whether each feature should be within the feature\nset. Because of the large-scale search space, we develop a\nlearning-by-continuation training scheme to learn such gates. Hence, OptFS\ngenerates the feature set only containing features which improve the final\nprediction results. Experimentally, we evaluate OptFS on three public datasets,\ndemonstrating OptFS can optimize feature sets which enhance the model\nperformance and further reduce both the storage and computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 02:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

Bayesian modular\ninference is concerned with complex models which have been specified through a\ncollection of coupled submodels, and is useful when there is misspecification\nin some of the submodels. The submodels are often called modules in the\nliterature. Cutting feedback is a widely used Bayesian modular inference method\nwhich ensures that information from suspect model components is not used in\nmaking inferences about parameters in correctly specified modules. However, it\nmay be hard to decide in what circumstances this ``cut posterior'' is preferred\nto the exact posterior.

Our findings\nreplicated and extended previous research which suggests that different\nsubregions of the VTA are sensitive to rewarding and aversive stimuli. Taken\ntogether, this study suggests that emotional music embedded in an imagined\nscenario is a salient social signal that prompts preparation of\napproach/avoidance behaviours and emotional responses in listeners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 03:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

However, commodity\naccelerators are built mainly for efficient dense computation, creating a huge\ngap for general sparse computation to leverage. Existing solutions have to use\ntime-consuming compiling to improve the efficiency of sparse kernels in an\nahead-of-time manner and thus are limited to static sparsity. A wide range of\ndynamic sparsity opportunities is missed because their sparsity patterns are\nonly known at runtime. This limits the future of building more biological\nbrain-like neural networks that should be dynamically and sparsely activated.\n  In this paper, we bridge the gap between sparse computation and commodity\naccelerators by proposing a system, called Spider, for efficiently executing\ndeep learning models with dynamic sparsity. We identify an important property\ncalled permutation invariant that applies to most deep-learning computations.\nThe property enables Spider (1) to extract dynamic sparsity patterns of tensors\nthat are only known at runtime with little overhead; and (2) to transform the\ndynamic sparse computation into an equivalent dense computation which has been\nextremely optimized on commodity accelerators. Extensive evaluation on diverse\nmodels shows Spider can extract and transform dynamic sparsity with negligible\noverhead but brings up to 9.4x speedup over state-of-art solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 04:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

Most recent advances\nfocus on exploring attention mechanism variants for better information\naggregation. We find these schemes are equivalent to or even just a subset of\nthe basic self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we prove that the vanilla\nself-attention structure is sufficient for information aggregation, and\nstructural adaption is unnecessary. The key is not the attention structure, but\nhow to extract the discriminative feature for tracking and enhance the\ncommunication between the target and search image. Based on this finding, we\nadopt the basic vision transformer (ViT) architecture as our main tracker and\nconcatenate the template and search image for feature embedding. To guide the\nencoder to capture the invariant feature for tracking, we attach a lightweight\ncorrelative masked decoder which reconstructs the original template and search\nimage from the corresponding masked tokens. The correlative masked decoder\nserves as a plugin for the compact transform tracker and is skipped in\ninference. Our compact tracker uses the most simple structure which only\nconsists of a ViT backbone and a box head, and can run at 40 fps. Extensive\nexperiments show the proposed compact transform tracker outperforms existing\napproaches, including advanced attention variants, and demonstrates the\nsufficiency of self-attention in tracking tasks.

To prevent data races,\nprogrammers use locks. However, programs can eliminate data races only when\nthey acquire and release correct locks at correct timing. The lock API of C, in\nwhich people have developed a large portion of legacy system programs, does not\nvalidate the correct use of locks. On the other hand, Rust, a recently\ndeveloped system programming language, provides a lock API that guarantees the\ncorrect use of locks via type checking. This makes rewriting legacy system\nprograms in Rust a promising way to retrofit safety into them. Unfortunately,\nmanual C-to-Rust translation is extremely laborious due to the discrepancies\nbetween their lock APIs. Even the state-of-the-art automatic C-to-Rust\ntranslator retains the C lock API, expecting developers to replace them with\nthe Rust lock API. In this work, we propose an automatic tool to replace the C\nlock API with the Rust lock API. It facilitates C-to-Rust translation of\nconcurrent programs with less human effort than the current practice. Our tool\nconsists of a Rust code transformer that takes a lock summary as an input and a\nstatic analyzer that efficiently generates precise lock summaries.

Beyond the single-chain-based scheme, decentralized\nhigh-throughput blockchains adopt parallel protocols to reconcile the\nblockchain trilemma, implementing any tasking and desired allocation. However,\nunneglectable network latency may induce partial observability, resulting in\nincoordination and misallocation issues for the decentralized transaction\npackaging process at the current high-throughput blockchain protocols.\n  To address this problem, we consider a strategic coordination mechanism for\nthe decentralized transaction packaging process by using a game-theoretic\napproach.

A high-density layer with an increased\nmagnetic hyperfine field at the FeCoB-on-MgO interface suggests different\ngrowth mechanisms at the two interfaces. The azimuthal angle-dependent\nmagneto-optic Kerr effect measurements reveal the presence of unusual uniaxial\nmagnetic anisotropy (UMA) in the trilayer.

Here, a new microcomb is\ndemonstrated that mode locks through the formation of pulse pairs in\nnormal-dispersion coupled-ring resonators. Unlike conventional microcombs,\npulses in this system cannot exist alone, and instead must phase lock in pairs\nto form a bright soliton comb. Also, the pulses can form at recurring spectral\nwindows and the pulses in each pair feature different optical spectra. This\npairwise mode-locking modality extends to higher dimensions and we demonstrate\n3-ring systems in which 3 pulses mode lock through alternating pairwise pulse\ncoupling.

We investigate real-time\nML in a federated edge intelligence (FEI) system, an edge computing system that\nimplements federated learning (FL) solutions based on data samples collected\nand uploaded from decentralized data networks. FEI systems often exhibit\nheterogenous communication and computational resource distribution, as well as\nnon-i.i.d. data samples, resulting in long model training time and inefficient\nresource utilization.

To evaluate NSC\nand its influence on adhesion, F\\\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET)\nspectroscopy has been used. FRET is a technique capable to measure nanometric\ndistances between surfaces by taking advantage of the interaction amid some\nspecific fluorescence molecules, named donor and acceptor.

For this,\npolymeric thin films were bonded using different loads, from 1.5 to 150 bar, to\ncreate different degrees of NSC, analyzed by FRET spectroscopy, and later\npulled apart to measure their interfacial separation energy (adhesion force).\nOur experiments showed that NSC increases with the applied pressure in the\nbonded thin films, leading to higher FRET intensity and adhesion\nforce/separation energy.

The cost to an agent for traveling a link has a private as\nwell as a congestion component. The agent's objective is to find a path to the\ngoal node with minimum overall cost in a decentralized way. We model this as a\nfully decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning problem and propose a\nnovel multi-agent congestion cost minimization (MACCM) algorithm. Our MACCM\nalgorithm uses linear function approximations of transition probabilities and\nthe global cost function. In the absence of a central controller and to\npreserve privacy, agents communicate the cost function parameters to their\nneighbors via a time-varying communication network. Moreover, each agent\nmaintains its estimate of the global state-action value, which is updated via a\nmulti-agent extended value iteration (MAEVI) sub-routine. We show that our\nMACCM algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret. The proof requires the\nconvergence of cost function parameters, the MAEVI algorithm, and analysis of\nthe regret bounds induced by the MAEVI triggering condition for each agent. We\nimplement our algorithm on a two node network with multiple links to validate\nit. We first identify the optimal policy, the optimal number of agents going to\nthe goal node in each period.

Nevertheless, a systematic study by increasing the size and coverage\nconcentration of Fe2O3 clusters on the anatase surface can give more insights\ninto observed photocatalytic activity.

Through\nphysical modeling of bright meteors, we describe their fragmentation in the\natmosphere.

We developed\na semi-automatic program for meteoroid fragmentation modeling using parallel\ngenetic algorithms. This allowed us to determine the most probable\nfragmentation cascade of the meteoroid, and also to specify its initial mass\nand velocity. These parameters can be used in turn to derive the heliocentric\norbit of the meteoroid and to place constraints on its likely age as a separate\nobject. The program offers plausible solutions for the majority of fireballs we\ntested, and the quality of the solutions is comparable to that of manual\nsolutions. The two solutions are not the same in detail, but the derived\nquantities, such as the fragment masses of the larger fragments and the proxy\nfor their mechanical strength, are very similar. With this method, we would\nlike to describe the mechanical properties and structure of both meteoroids\nbelonging to major meteor showers and those that cause exceptional fireballs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 13:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

This will lead to mixed traffic flow\nwith multiple classes of route choice behavior. Therefore, it is crucial to\nsolve the multiclass Traffic Assignment Problem (TAP) in mixed traffic of CAVs\nand HDVs. Few studies have tried to solve this problem; however, most used\nanalytical solutions, which are challenging to implement in real and large\nnetworks (especially in dynamic cases). Also, studies in implementing\nsimulation-based methods have not considered all of CAVs' potential\ncapabilities. On the other hand, several different (conflicting) assumptions\nare made about the CAV's route choice behavior in these studies. So, providing\na tool that can solve the multiclass TAP of mixed traffic under different\nassumptions can help researchers to understand the impacts of CAVs better. To\nfill these gaps, this study provides an open-source solution framework of the\nmulticlass simulation-based traffic assignment problem for mixed traffic of\nCAVs and HDVs. This model assumes that CAVs follow system optimal principles\nwith rerouting capability, while HDVs follow user equilibrium principles.\nMoreover, this model can capture the impacts of CAVs on road capacity by\nconsidering distinct driving behavioral models in both micro and meso scales\ntraffic simulation. This proposed model is tested in two case studies which\nshows that as the penetration rate of CAVs increases, the total travel time of\nall vehicles decreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 13:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

GP aims to compute algorithmic solutions that are\nvalid for a set of classical planning instances from a given domain, even if\nthese instances differ in the number of objects, the number of state variables,\ntheir domain size, or their initial and goal configuration. The generalization\nrequirements of GP make it impractical to perform the state-space search that\nis usually implemented by heuristic planners. This paper adapts the planning as\nheuristic search paradigm to the generalization requirements of GP, and\npresents the first native heuristic search approach to GP. First, the paper\nintroduces a new pointer-based solution space for GP that is independent of the\nnumber of classical planning instances in a GP problem and the size of those\ninstances (i.e. the number of objects, state variables and their domain sizes).\nSecond, the paper defines a set of evaluation and heuristic functions for\nguiding a combinatorial search in our new GP solution space. The computation of\nthese evaluation and heuristic functions does not require grounding states or\nactions in advance.

Under the typical unconfoundness assumption,\naugmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) has been popular for estimating\nthe average causal effect (ACE) due to its double robustness in the sense it\nrelies on either the propensity score model or the outcome mean model to be\ncorrectly specified. To ensure the key assumption holds, the effort is often\nmade to collect a sufficiently rich set of pretreatment variables, rendering\nvariable selection imperative. It is well known that variable selection for the\npropensity score targeted for accurate prediction may produce a variable ACE\nestimator by including the instrument variables. Thus, many recent works\nrecommend selecting all outcome predictors for both confounding control and\nefficient estimation. This article shows that the AIPW estimator with variable\nselection targeted for efficient estimation may lose the desirable double\nrobustness property. Instead, we propose controlling the propensity score model\nfor any covariate that is a predictor of either the treatment or the outcome or\nboth, which preserves the double robustness of the AIPW estimator. Using this\nprinciple, we propose a two-stage procedure with penalization for variable\nselection and the AIPW estimator for estimation. We show the proposed procedure\nbenefits from the desirable double robustness property. We evaluate the\nfinite-sample performance of the AIPW estimator with various variable selection\ncriteria through simulation and an application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 13:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

In this paper, based on the CLIP\nmodel, we revisit temporal modeling in the context of image-to-video knowledge\ntransferring, which is the key point for extending image-text pretrained models\nto the video domain. We find that current temporal modeling mechanisms are\ntailored to either high-level semantic-dominant tasks (e.g., retrieval) or\nlow-level visual pattern-dominant tasks (e.g., recognition), and fail to work\non the two cases simultaneously. The key difficulty lies in modeling temporal\ndependency while taking advantage of both high-level and low-level knowledge in\nCLIP model. To tackle this problem, we present Spatial-Temporal Auxiliary\nNetwork (STAN) -- a simple and effective temporal modeling mechanism extending\nCLIP model to diverse video tasks.

In this paper, we develop a novel\ncoarse-grained approach for simulating fluctuating slender filaments with\nhydrodynamic interactions.

First, we discretize the filament\ncenterline using a coarse non-uniform Chebyshev grid, on which we formulate a\ndiscrete constrained Gibbs-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution and overdamped\nLangevin equation. Second, we define the hydrodynamic mobility at each point on\nthe filament as an integral of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa kernel along the\ncenterline, and apply a spectrally-accurate quadrature to accurately resolve\nthe hydrodynamics. Third, we propose a novel midpoint temporal integrator which\ncan correctly capture the Ito drift terms that arise in the overdamped Langevin\nequation. We verify that the equilibrium distribution for the Chebyshev grid is\na good approximation of the blob-link one, and that our temporal integrator\nsamples the equilibrium distribution for sufficiently small time steps. We also\nstudy the dynamics of relaxation of an initially straight filament, and find\nthat as few as 12 Chebyshev nodes provides a good approximation to the dynamics\nwhile allowing a time step size two orders of magnitude larger than a resolved\nblob-link simulation.

Learning from external demonstrators is a possible solution that\nmitigates this problem. However, most prior approaches in this area assume the\npresence of a single demonstrator. Leveraging multiple knowledge sources (i.e.,\nadvisors) with expertise in distinct aspects of the environment could\nsubstantially speed up learning in complex environments.

This\nproblem can be addressed with super-resolution, aimed at reconstructing a\nhigh-resolution image from a low-resolution observation. For Sentinel-2,\nspectral information fusion allows for enhancing the 20 m and 60 m bands to the\n10 m resolution. Also, there were attempts to combine multitemporal stacks of\nindividual Sentinel-2 bands, however these two approaches have not been\ncombined so far. In this paper, we introduce DeepSent -- a new deep network for\nsuper-resolving multitemporal series of multispectral Sentinel-2 images. It is\nunderpinned with information fusion performed simultaneously in the spectral\nand temporal dimensions to generate an enlarged multispectral image. In our\nextensive experimental study, we demonstrate that our solution outperforms\nother state-of-the-art techniques that realize either multitemporal or\nmultispectral data fusion. Furthermore, we show that the advantage of DeepSent\nresults from how these two fusion types are combined in a single architecture,\nwhich is superior to performing such fusion in a sequential manner.\nImportantly, we have applied our method to super-resolve real-world Sentinel-2\nimages, enhancing the spatial resolution of all the spectral bands to 3.3 m\nnominal ground sampling distance, and we compare the outcome with very\nhigh-resolution WorldView-2 images. We will publish our implementation upon\npaper acceptance, and we expect it will increase the possibilities of\nexploiting super-resolved Sentinel-2 images in real-life applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 15:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

The safety-liveness classification\nof boolean properties characterizes whether a given property can be falsified\nby observing a finite prefix of an infinite computation trace (always for\nsafety, never for liveness). In quantitative specification and verification,\nproperties assign not truth values, but quantitative values to infinite traces\n(e.g., a cost, or the distance to a boolean property). We introduce\nquantitative safety and liveness, and we prove that our definitions induce\nconservative quantitative generalizations of both (1)~the safety-progress\nhierarchy of boolean properties and (2)~the safety-liveness decomposition of\nboolean properties. In particular, we show that every quantitative property can\nbe written as the pointwise minimum of a quantitative safety property and a\nquantitative liveness property. Consequently, like boolean properties, also\nquantitative properties can be $\\min$-decomposed into safety and liveness\nparts, or alternatively, $\\max$-decomposed into co-safety and co-liveness\nparts. Moreover, quantitative properties can be approximated naturally. We\nprove that every quantitative property that has both safe and co-safe\napproximations can be monitored arbitrarily precisely by a monitor that uses\nonly a finite number of states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 15:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

An\napproach to tackle this problem consists in selecting actions according to\nspecific policies for an extended period of time, also known as options. A\nrecent line of work to derive such exploratory options builds upon the\neigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian. Importantly, until now these methods\nhave been mostly limited to tabular domains where (1) the graph Laplacian\nmatrix was either given or could be fully estimated, (2) performing\neigendecomposition on this matrix was computationally tractable, and (3) value\nfunctions could be learned exactly. Additionally, these methods required a\nseparate option discovery phase. These assumptions are fundamentally not\nscalable. In this paper we address these limitations and show how recent\nresults for directly approximating the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian can be\nleveraged to truly scale up options-based exploration. To do so, we introduce a\nfully online deep RL algorithm for discovering Laplacian-based options and\nevaluate our approach on a variety of pixel-based tasks.

However,\nin some scenarios, on-axis sputtering is not feasible. During ionized physical\nvapor deposition (PVD), in contrast to conventional PVD, the film-forming\nspecies can be accelerated onto the growing film using substrate-bias\npotentials. This increas-es the ad-atom mobility, but also deflects the\ntrajectory of ions towards the substrate increasing the texture of the growing\nfilm. However, potential gas-ion incorporation in the films limits the\nfeasibility of such approaches for the deposition of defect-sensitive\nmaterials. In this work, we report on the oblique-angle deposition of highly\nc-axis oriented AlN (0002) films, enabled by reactive metal-ion syn-chronized\nHiPIMS. The effect of critical deposition parameters, such as the magnetic\nconfiguration, ion kinetic energies and substrate biasing are investigated. The\nfilms deposited using HiPIMS show a more pronounced texture and orientation\ncompared to DCMS films. We find that combining the HiPIMS dep-ositions with a\nmoderate substrate bias of -30 V is sufficient to improve the crystalline\nquality and tex-ture of the films significantly. To reduce process-gas\nincorporation, and the formation of point defects, the negative substrate-bias\npotential is synchronized to the Al-rich fraction of each HiPIMS pulse. This\nleads to reduced Ar-Ion incorporation and improves the structural properties.\nThe films also show uni-form polarization of the grains making this synthesis\nroute suitable for piezoelectric applications. While the compressive stress in\nthe films is still high, the results demonstrate, that synchronized HiPIMS can\nyield promising results for the synthesis under oblique-angle deposition\nconditions - even with low substrate-bias potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 15:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-27"}

In contrast, here we present a very\ngeneral duality-based reformulation approach for distributionally robust\nproblems that are allowed to depend on elementary functions, which renders the\nproblem nonlinear and nonconvex. In order to be able to reformulate the\nsemiinfinite constraints nevertheless, a safe approximation is presented that\nis realized by a discretized counterpart.

In most previous works, the model trained on\nthe synthetic images obtains unsatisfactory performance on the real-world\nfisheye image. To this end, we propose a Dual Diffusion Architecture (DDA) for\nthe fisheye rectification with a better generalization ability. The proposed\nDDA is simultaneously trained with paired synthetic fisheye images and\nunlabeled real fisheye images. By gradually introducing noises, the synthetic\nand real fisheye images can eventually develop into a consistent noise\ndistribution, improving the generalization and achieving unlabeled real fisheye\ncorrection. The original image serves as the prior guidance in existing DDPMs\n(Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models). However, the non-negligible\nindeterminate relationship between the prior condition and the target affects\nthe generation performance. Especially in the rectification task, the radial\ndistortion can cause significant artifacts. Therefore, we provide an\nunsupervised one-pass network that produces a plausible new condition to\nstrengthen guidance. This network can be regarded as an alternate scheme for\nfast producing reliable results without iterative inference. Compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods, our approach can reach superior performance in both\nsynthetic and real fisheye image corrections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 09:37:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

One is a proxy, such as the purely\nphenomenological resistivity. More fundamental are those based on\nthermodynamics, as in the Carnot cycle, and those based on statistical\nmechanics, such as the ideal gas law. With heat flow $Q$ and temperature $T$, a\ntemperature scale in principle (but not in practice) can be based on the simple\nCarnot cycle relation $Q/T+Q'/T'=0$, with a temperature $T_{0}(p_{0},V_{0})$\nspecified. More generally, a thermodynamics based temperature scale may be\ndetermined by the Clausius condition $\\oint dQ/T=0$ for every closed path in a\ngiven region $\\Omega$ of $p$-$V$ space. Taking a discretized grid $i$ (from\nwhich such closed paths can be composed), for some parametrized model\ntemperature function $T_{n}$ a root-mean-square minimization of\n$\\sum_{i}(\\oint_{i}dQ/T_{n})^{2}$ yields the best set of model $T_{n}$'s\nparameters. Thus any stable material -- even one not described by a known\nstatistical mechanical model -- can be used as a thermometer. If, because of\ninaccuracy of $dQ$ measurement, the Clausius condition method gives a\ntemperature scale of lower accuracy than the best proxy temperature scale, then\nthat proxy temperature scale can be employed with the rms Clausius condition\nmethod to improve the accuracy of (i.e., raise the standards for) the $dQ$\nmeasurements to the accuracy of the proxy-based temperature scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 21:20:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 03:00:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 16:31:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 22:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

Evidences from {\\it in vivo} experiments\nsuggest that astrocytes, a type of glial cell regarded previously as providing\nonly structural and metabolic supports to neurons, participate actively in\nbrain functions and play a crucial role in regulating the neural firing\nactivities, yet the mechanism remains unknown. Introducing astrocyte as a\nreservoir of the glutamate released from neuron synapses, here we propose the\nmodel of complex neuron-astrocyte network and employ it to explore the roles of\nastrocyte in regulating the synchronization behaviors of networked neurons. It\nis found that a fraction of neurons on the network can be synchronized as a\ncluster, while the remaining neurons are kept as desynchronized. Moreover,\nduring the course of network evolution, the cluster is switching between the\nsynchrony and asynchrony states intermittently, henceforth the phenomenon of\n``breathing cluster\". By the method of symmetry-based analysis, we conduct a\ntheoretical investigation on the stability of the cluster and the mechanism\ngenerating the breathing activities. It is revealed that the contents of the\ncluster are determined by the network symmetry and the breathing activities are\ndue to the interplay between the neural network and the astrocyte. The\nbreathing phenomenon is demonstrated in network models of different structures\nand neural dynamics. The studies give insights into the cellular mechanism of\nastrocytes in regulating neural activities, and shed lights onto the\nspontaneous state switching of the neocortex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 10:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

The experimental\nsetup of SB-PCXI requires only a sufficiently coherent source and spatially\nrandom mask, positioned between the source and detector. The technique can\nextract sample information at length scales smaller than the imaging system's\nspatial resolution; this enables multimodal signal reconstruction. ``Multimodal\nIntrinsic Speckle-Tracking'' (MIST) is a rapid and deterministic formalism\nderived from the paraxial-optics form of the Fokker-Planck equation. MIST\nsimultaneously extracts attenuation, refraction, and small-angle scattering\n(diffusive-dark-field) signals from a sample and is more computationally\nefficient compared to alternative speckle-tracking approaches. Hitherto,\nvariants of MIST have assumed the diffusive-dark-field signal to be spatially\nslowly varying. Although successful, these approaches have been unable to\nwell-describe unresolved sample microstructure whose statistical form is not\nspatially slowly varying. Here, we extend the MIST formalism such that there is\nno such restriction, in terms of a sample's rotationally-isotropic\ndiffusive-dark-field signal. We reconstruct multimodal signals of two samples,\neach with distinct X-ray attenuation and scattering properties. The\nreconstructed diffusive-dark-field signals have superior image quality compared\nto our previous approaches which assume the diffusive-dark-field to be a slowly\nvarying function of transverse position.
