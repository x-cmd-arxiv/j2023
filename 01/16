Previous studies on finetuning focused on adapting only the weights\nof a task-specific classifier or re-optimizing all layers of the pre-trained\nmodel using the new task data. The first type of methods cannot mitigate the\nmismatch between a pre-trained model and the new task data, and the second type\nof methods easily cause over-fitting when processing tasks with limited data.\nTo explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning, we propose a novel block-wise\noptimization mechanism, which adapts the weights of a group of layers of a\npre-trained model. In our work, the layer selection can be done in four\ndifferent ways. The first is layer-wise adaptation, which aims to search for\nthe most salient single layer according to the classification performance. The\nsecond way is based on the first one, jointly adapting a small number of\ntop-ranked layers instead of using an individual layer. The third is block\nbased segmentation, where the layers of a deep network is segmented into blocks\nby non-weighting layers, such as the MaxPooling layer and Activation layer. The\nlast one is to use a fixed-length sliding window to group layers block by\nblock. To identify which group of layers is the most suitable for finetuning,\nthe search starts from the target end and is conducted by freezing other layers\nexcluding the selected layers and the classification layers. The most salient\ngroup of layers is determined in terms of classification performance. In our\nexperiments, the proposed approaches are tested on an often-used dataset,\nTf_flower, by finetuning five typical pre-trained models, VGG16, MobileNet-v1,\nMobileNet-v2, MobileNet-v3, and ResNet50v2, respectively. The obtained results\nshow that the use of our proposed block-wise approaches can achieve better\nperformances than the two baseline methods and the layer-wise method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 16:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

This work examines the extent to which HP (i.e., blazar)\nstate can endure in a FSRQ, despite these `frequent' state transitions. This is\nthe first attempt to verify, using purely opto-polarimetric data for a much\nenlarged sample of blazars, the recent curious finding that blazar state in\nindividual quasars persists for {\\it at least} a few decades, despite its\nchanging/swinging observed fairly commonly on year-like time scales.

Evidently, these relatively frequent transitions (in\neither direction) do not curtail the propensity of a radio quasar to retain its\nblazar (i.e., HP) state for at least a few decades.

In line with the cloudification and\nvirtualization in the open radio access networks (O-RAN), it is indisputable to\nenvision prospective cell-free infrastructure on top of the O-RAN architecture.\nO-RAN is the key enabler for the end-to-end management of cell-free massive\nMIMO. In this paper, we explore the performance and power consumption of\ndifferent radio technologies, i.e., cell-free massive MIMO and traditional\nsmall-cell systems, in the virtualized O-RAN architecture from an end-to-end\nperspective. We compare two different functional split options and different\nresource orchestration mechanisms, including the fully virtualized end-to-end,\nlocal cloud coordination-based, and radio-only resource allocation. In the\nend-to-end orchestration scheme, we aim to minimize the end-to-end power\nconsumption by jointly allocating the radio, optical fronthaul, and virtualized\ncloud processing resources. We compare end-to-end orchestration with two other\nschemes: i)``radio-only'' where radio resources are optimized independently\nfrom the cloud and ii)``local cloud coordination'' where orchestration is only\nallowed among a local cluster of radio units. The spectral efficiency (SE) is\neither considered as an optimization constraint for each user equipment or as a\nsum SE in the objective function. We develop several algorithms to solve the\nrespective end-to-end optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 19:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

However, the public's perception of cycling may be\ndriven by the ideologies and reporting standards of news agencies. For\ninstance, people may identify cyclists on the road as \"dangerous\" if news\nagencies overly report cycling accidents, limiting the number of people that\ncycle for transportation. Moreover, if fewer people cycle, there may be less\nfunding from the government to invest in safe infrastructure. In this paper, we\nexplore the perceived perception of cyclists within news headlines. To\naccomplish this, we introduce a new dataset, \"Bike Frames\", that can help\nprovide insight into how headlines portray cyclists and help detect\naccident-related headlines. Next, we introduce a multi-task (MT) regularization\napproach that increases the detection accuracy of accident-related posts,\ndemonstrating improvements over traditional MT frameworks. Finally, we compare\nand contrast the perceptions of cyclists with motorcyclist-related headlines to\nground the findings with another related activity for both male- and\nfemale-related posts.

We integrate a predictive dynamical model and a\nprescriptive optimization problem to compute the optimal locations of opioid\ntreatment facilities and the optimal treatment budget distribution in each US\nstate. Our predictive model is a differential equation-based epidemiological\nmodel that captures the dynamics of the opioid epidemic. We use neural ordinary\ndifferential equations to fit this model to opioid epidemic data for each state\nand obtain estimates for unknown parameters in the model. We then incorporate\nthis epidemiological model for each state into a corresponding mixed-integer\noptimization problem (MIP) for treatment facility location and resource\nallocation. Our MIPs aim to minimize the number of opioid overdose deaths and\nthe number of people with OUD, and to target socioeconomic equitability by\nconsidering social vulnerability (from the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index)\nand opioid prescribing rates in each county.

Unlike\ntraditional blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric\nuses the EOV model for transaction processing: the submitted transactions are\nexecuted by the endorsing peer, ordered and batched by the ordering services,\nand validated by the validating peers. Due to this EOV workflow, a\nwell-documented issue that arises is the multi-version concurrency control\nconflict. This happens when two transactions try to writes and read the same\nkey in the ledger at the same time.

In\nparticular, to support reflective rendering, existing methods have leveraged\ndeep learning models to estimate or have used physical light probes to capture\nphysical lighting, typically represented in the form of an environment map.\nHowever, these methods often fail to provide visually coherent details or\nrequire additional setups. For example, the commercial framework ARKit uses a\nconvolutional neural network that can generate realistic environment maps;\nhowever the corresponding reflective rendering might not match the physical\nenvironments. In this work, we present the design and implementation of a\nlighting reconstruction framework called LitAR that enables realistic and\nvisually-coherent rendering. LitAR addresses several challenges of supporting\nlighting information for mobile AR. First, to address the spatial variance\nproblem, LitAR uses two-field lighting reconstruction to divide the lighting\nreconstruction task into the spatial variance-aware near-field reconstruction\nand the directional-aware far-field reconstruction. The corresponding\nenvironment map allows reflective rendering with correct color tones. Second,\nLitAR uses two noise-tolerant data capturing policies to ensure data quality,\nnamely guided bootstrapped movement and motion-based automatic capturing.\nThird, to handle the mismatch between the mobile computation capability and the\nhigh computation requirement of lighting reconstruction, LitAR employs two\nnovel real-time environment map rendering techniques called multi-resolution\nprojection and anchor extrapolation. These two techniques effectively remove\nthe need of time-consuming mesh reconstruction while maintaining visual\nquality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 20:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

This leads to anisotropic excess conductivity\nabove Tc, and the transport measurements provide valuable information about the\nSC domain structure deep within the sample. In bulk samples, this anisotropic\nSC onset gives an approximate average shape of SC grains, while in thin samples\nit also indicates the average size of SC grains. In this work, both interlayer\nand intralayer resistivity are measured as a function of temperature in FeSe\nsamples of various thickness.

But what if we want to compute the Fourier transform of functions\ndefined over a $q$-ary alphabet? These types of functions arise naturally in\nmany areas including biology. A typical workaround is to encode the $q$-ary\nsequence in binary, however, this approach is computationally inefficient and\nfundamentally incompatible with the existing sparse Fourier transform\ntechniques.

The model\npredicts the probability distribution of surrounding vehicles' positions, which\nare used to estimate dynamic conflict risks. Next, a hybrid automaton is built\nto model the basic motions of a car, and the conflict risks are assessed for\nreal-time state-space transitions based on environmental information. Finally,\na BLSTM-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) is built to navigate vehicles\nthrough safe paths with the least predicted conflict risk.

It is also shown that if $X$ is\nHausdorff then $|X|\\leq 2^{d(X)w\\psi_c(X)}$, which appears to be new even in\nthe case where $w\\psi_c(X)$ is replaced with $\\psi_c(X)$.

In the literature, the\ndistribution steering problem governed by system dynamics is usually treated by\nassuming the distribution of the system states to be Gaussian. In our previous\npaper, we considered the distribution steering problem where the initial and\nterminal distributions are arbitrary (only required to have first several\norders of power moments), and proposed to use the moments to turn this problem\ninto a finite-dimensional one. We put forward a moment representation of the\nprimal system for control. However, the control law in that paper was an\nempirical one without optimization towards a design criterion, which doesn't\nalways ensure a most satisfactory solution. In this paper, which is a very\npreliminary version, we propose a convex optimization approach to the general\ndistribution steering problem of the first-order discrete-time linear system,\ni.e., an optimal control law for the corresponding moment system. The optimal\ncontrol inputs of the moment system are obtained by convex optimization, of\nwhich the convexity of the domain is proved. An algorithm of distribution\nsteering is then put forward by extending a realization scheme of control\ninputs using the Kullback-Leibler distance to one realization using the squared\nHellinger distance, of which the performance has been shown to be better than\nthe former one. Experiments on different types of cost functions are given to\nvalidate the performance of our proposed algorithm. Since the moment system is\na dimension-reduced counterpart of the primal system, and we are not optimizing\nthe cost function over all feasible control inputs, we call this solution a\nsub-optimal one to the primal general distribution steering problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 01:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

As potential low-frequency GW\nsources, neutron star/white dwarf (WD) ultra-compact X-ray binaries (UCXBs)\nhave been investigated extensively. Using the MESA code, we systematically\nexplored the evolution of black hole (BH)-main sequence star (MS) binaries to\ndiagnose whether their descendants can be detected by space-borne GW detectors.\nOur simulations show that BH-MS binaries with an initial orbital period less\nthan the bifurcation period can evolve into BH UCXBs that can be detected by\nLISA.

The maximum GW\nfrequency of BH UCXBs forming by BH-MS pathway is about 3 mHz, which is smaller\nthan the minimum GW frequency (6.4 mHz) of mass-transferring BH-WD originating\nfrom a dynamic process. Furthermore, we obtain an initial parameter space\n(donor-star masses and orbital periods) of progenitors of BH UCXB-GW sources,\nwhich can be applied to future population synthesis simulations.

For these types of\nexoskeletons, it is challenging to measure interaction forces as it is not\nfeasible to implement force/torque sensors at every contact between the user\nand the exoskeleton. Moreover, it is important to compensate for the\nexoskeleton's whole-body gravitational and dynamical forces. Previous works\neither simplified the dynamic model by treating the legs as independent double\npendulums, or they did not close the loop with interaction force feedback.\n  This paper presents a novel method to calculate interaction torques during\nthe complete gait cycle by using whole-body dynamics and joint torque\nmeasurements on a hip-knee exoskeleton. Furthermore, we propose a constrained\noptimization scheme combined with a virtual model controller to track desired\ninteraction torques in a closed loop while considering physical limits and\nsafety considerations. Together, we call this approach whole-exoskeleton\nclosed-loop compensation (WECC) control. We evaluated the haptic transparency\nand spring-damper rendering performance of WECC control on three subjects. We\nalso compared the performance of WECC with a controller based on a simplified\ndynamic model and a passive version of the exoskeleton with disassembled\ndrives. The WECC controller resulted in consistent interaction torque tracking\nduring the whole gait cycle for both zero and nonzero desired interaction\ntorques. On the contrary, the simplified controller failed to track desired\ninteraction torques during the stance phase. The proposed interaction force\ncontrol method is especially beneficial for heavy lower-limb exoskeletons where\nthe dynamics of the entire exoskeleton should be compensated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 03:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Almost all phase change\nmaterials (PCMs) exhibit density/volume changes during melting, solidification,\nboiling, or condensation, causing additional fluid flow during this transition.\nMost numerical works consider only two phase flows (either solid-liquid or\nliquid-gas) for modeling phase change phenomena and some also neglect\nvolume/density change of PCMs in the models. This paper presents a novel low\nMach enthalpy method for simulating solidification and melting problems with\nvariable thermophysical properties, including density. Additionally, this\nformulation allows coupling a solid-liquid PCM with a gas phase in order to\nsimulate the free surface dynamics of PCMs undergoing melting and\nsolidification. We revisit the two-phase Stefan problem involving a density\njump between two material phases. We propose a possible means to include the\nkinetic energy jump in the Stefan condition while still allowing for an\nanalytical solution. The new low Mach enthalpy method is validated against\nanalytical solutions for a PCM undergoing a large density change during its\nphase transition. Additionally, a few simple sanity checks are proposed to\nbenchmark computational fluid dynamics (CFD) algorithms that aim to capture the\nvolume change effects of PCMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 04:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

In this paper, we perform a systematic\nexperimental evaluation and based on the experimental results, we find two\nimportant facts: (1) the main factor limiting the accuracy of the GAT model as\nthe number of layers increases is the oversquashing phenomenon; (2) among the\nprevious improvements applied to the GNN model, only the residual connection\ncan significantly improve the GAT model performance.

Head pose and facial expression are always entangled in facial\nmotion and transferred simultaneously. However, the entanglement sets up a\nbarrier for these methods to be used in video portrait editing directly, where\nit may require to modify the expression only while maintaining the pose\nunchanged. One challenge of decoupling pose and expression is the lack of\npaired data, such as the same pose but different expressions. Only a few\nmethods attempt to tackle this challenge with the feat of 3D Morphable Models\n(3DMMs) for explicit disentanglement.

These alternative proofs are solely based\non a change of measure argument on the sets of conditionally or jointly typical\nsequences that result in a correct decision, and on the analysis of these\nmeasures in the asymptotic regime of infinite blocklengths. The paper also\npresents a new exponentially-strong converse for the K-hop hypothesis testing\nagainst independence problem with certain Markov chains and a strong converse\nfor the two-terminal Lround interactive compression problem with multiple\ndistortion constraints that depend on both sources and both reconstructions.\nThis latter problem includes as special cases the Wyner-Ziv problem, the\ninteractive function computation problem, and the compression with lossy common\nreconstruction problem. These new strong converse proofs are derived using\nsimilar change of measure arguments as described above and by additionally\nproving that certain Markov chains involving auxiliary random variables hold in\nthe asymptotic regime of infinite blocklengths.

Novelty adaptation is an\nagent's ability to improve its policy performance post-novelty. Most\nreinforcement learning (RL) methods assume that the world is a closed, fixed\nprocess. Consequentially, RL policies adapt inefficiently to novelties. To\naddress this, we introduce WorldCloner, an end-to-end trainable neuro-symbolic\nworld model for rapid novelty adaptation. WorldCloner learns an efficient\nsymbolic representation of the pre-novelty environment transitions, and uses\nthis transition model to detect novelty and efficiently adapt to novelty in a\nsingle-shot fashion. Additionally, WorldCloner augments the policy learning\nprocess using imagination-based adaptation, where the world model simulates\ntransitions of the post-novelty environment to help the policy adapt. By\nblending ''imagined'' transitions with interactions in the post-novelty\nenvironment, performance can be recovered with fewer total environment\ninteractions. Using environments designed for studying novelty in sequential\ndecision-making problems, we show that the symbolic world model helps its\nneural policy adapt more efficiently than model-based and model-based\nneural-only reinforcement learning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 07:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

In this paper, we develop a depth-averaged Material\nPoint Method (DAMPM) to efficiently simulate shallow landslides over complex\ntopography based on both material properties and terrain characteristics. DAMPM\nis an adaptation of MPM with classical shallow water assumptions, thus enabling\nlarge-deformation elasto-plastic modeling of landslides in a computationally\nefficient manner. The model is here demonstrated on the release of snow slab\navalanches, a specific type of shallow landslides which release due to crack\npropagation within a weak layer buried below a cohesive slab. Here, the weak\nlayer is considered as an external shear force acting at the base of an\nelastic-brittle slab. We validate our model against previous analytical\ncalculations and numerical simulations of the classical snow fracture\nexperiment known as Propagation Saw Test (PST). Furthermore, large scale\nsimulations are conducted to evaluate the shape and size of avalanche release\nzones over different topographies. Given the low computational cost compared to\n3D MPM, we expect our work to have important operational applications in hazard\nassessment, in particular for the evaluation of release areas, a crucial input\nfor geophysical mass flow models.

Furthermore, we introduce a new loss function to\nintegrate the error confusion set, which enables our model to distinguish\neasily misused tokens. Moreover, our model supports highly parallel decoding to\nmeet real application requirements. Experiments are conducted on widely used\nbenchmarks. Our model achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art\napproaches by a remarkable margin, on both the correction quality and\ncomputation speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 09:27:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 08:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

However, using their explainability in vision\ntasks has been limited due to the pixel representation of images. In this\npaper, we design Img2Tabs that classify images by concepts to harness the\nexplainability of tabular classifiers. Img2Tabs encode image pixels into\ntabular features by StyleGAN inversion. Since not all of the resulting features\nare class-relevant or interpretable due to their generative nature, we expect\nImg2Tab classifiers to discover class-relevant concepts automatically from the\nStyleGAN features. Thus, we propose a novel method using the Wasserstein-1\nmetric to quantify class-relevancy and interpretability simultaneously. Using\nthis method, we investigate whether important features extracted by tabular\nclassifiers are class-relevant concepts.

Finally, we combine these two values to calculate the\ntechnical debt principal.\n  To validate the approach, we conducted a case study and interviewed 16\npractitioners, from both open source and industry, and asked them about their\nopinions on the TD principal estimations for several smells detected in their\nprojects. The results show that for 71\\% of instances, practitioners agreed\nthat the estimations provided were \\emph{representative} of the effort\nnecessary to refactor the smell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 10:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

The\ncurrent is generated by the periodic asymmetric radiation intensity\ndistribution caused by the near-field diffraction at the edges of the antidots,\nwhich induces spatially inhomogeneous periodic electron gas heating, and a\nphase-shifted periodic asymmetric electrostatic force. The developed\nmicroscopic theory shows that the magnetization of the Co/Pt film results in a\nspin ratchet current caused by both the anomalous Hall and the anomalous Nernst\neffects. Additionally, we observed a polarization-dependent trigonal spin\nphotocurrent, which is caused by the scattering of electrons at the antidot\nboundaries resulting in a spin-polarized current due to the magnetization.\nMicroscopic theory of these effects reveals that the trigonal photocurrent is\ngenerated at the boundaries of the triangle antidots, whereas the spin ratchet\nis generated due to the spatially periodic temperature gradient over the whole\nfilm.

Such\nmaterial losses can be characterized through the measurement of planar\nsuperconducting resonators, which reflect losses through the resonance's\nquality factor $Q_l$. The resonance quality factor consists of both internal\n(material) losses as well as coupling losses when resonance photons escape back\ninto the measurement circuit. The combined losses are then described as\n$Q_l^{-1} = Q_c^{-1} + Q_i^{-1}$, where $Q_c$ and $Q_i$ reflect the coupling\nand internal quality factors of the resonator, respectively.

A theory for weakly nonlinear waves valid to second\norder in wave steepness is derived, and used to analyze statistical properties\nof surface waves; the theory extends the classic theory by Longuet-Higgins [J.\nFluid Mech. 12, 3 (1962)] to allow for an arbitrary depth-dependent background\nflow, $U(z)$, with $U$ the horizontal velocity along the main direction of wave\npropagation and $z$ the vertical axis. Numerical statistics are collected from\na large number of realisations of random, irregular sea-states following a\nJONSWAP spectrum, on linear and exponential model currents of varying\nstrengths. A number of statistical quantities are presented and compared to a\nrange of theoretical expressions from the literature; in particular the\ndistribution of wave surface elevation, surface maxima, and crest height; the\nexceedance probability including the probability of rogue waves; the maximum\ncrest height among $N_s$ waves, and the skewness of the surface elevation\ndistribution. We find that compared to no-shear conditions, opposing vertical\nshear ($U'(z)>0$) leads to increased wave height and increased skewness of the\nnonlinear-wave elevation distribution, while a following shear ($U'(z)<0$) has\nopposite effects. With the wave spectrum and velocity profile measured in the\nColumbia River estuary by Zippel & Thomson [J. Geophys.

Despite decades of research, the origin of\ncosmic rays (CRs) remains unclear, but jets launched by both supermassive black\nholes in the centre of galaxies and stellar-mass black holes harboured in X-ray\nbinaries (BHXBs) are among the candidate sources for CR acceleration. When CRs\naccelerate in astrophysical jets, they initiate particle cascades that form\n{\\gamma}-rays and neutrinos. In the so-called hadronic scenario, the population\nof accelerated CRs requires a significant amount of energy to properly explain\nthe spectral constraints similarly to a purely leptonic scenario. The amount of\nenergy required often exceeds the Eddington limit, or even the total energy\navailable within the jets. The exact energy source for the accelerated protons\nis unclear, but due to energy conservation along the jets, it is believed to\ncome from the jet itself via transfer of energy from the magnetic fields, or\nkinetic energy from the outflow. To address this hadronic energy issue and to\nself-consistently evolve the energy flux along the flows, we explore a novel\ntreatment for including hadronic content, in which instabilities along the\njet/wind border play a critical role.

To solve the stability and\ngeneralization problems, a simple-but-effective regularization method, termed\nas Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process\n(i.e., $\\beta$-DARTS). Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose\nconstraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters\nfrom being too large, thereby ensuring fair competition among architecture\nparameters and making the supernet less sensitive to the impact of input on the\noperation set.

Following this consideration, it is expected that the late-time evolution\nof the progenitor stars can leave important imprints in the circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM) of the FBOTs, due to the strong mass loss of the stars. The\ninteraction of the FBOT ejecta with the CSM can drive a long-lasting shock to\ngenerate radio emission, which thus enables us to probe the CSM properties\nthrough radio observation although such observations are still rare.

These models\noften fail to account for demand lost from occupied charging stations and\ncompetitors. The lost demand suggests that the actual demand is likely higher\nthan the charging records reflect, i.e., the true demand is latent\n(unobserved), and the observations are censored. As a result, machine learning\nmodels that rely on these observed records for forecasting charging demand may\nbe limited in their application in future infrastructure expansion and supply\nmanagement, as they do not estimate the true demand for charging. We propose\nusing censorship-aware models to model charging demand to address this\nlimitation. These models incorporate censorship in their loss functions and\nlearn the true latent demand distribution from observed charging records. We\nstudy how occupied charging stations and competing services censor demand using\nGPS trajectories from cars in Copenhagen, Denmark. We find that censorship\noccurs up to $61\\%$ of the time in some areas of the city. We use the observed\ncharging demand from our study to estimate the true demand and find that\ncensorship-aware models provide better prediction and uncertainty estimation of\nactual demand than censorship-unaware models.

Most of the current approach to AI alignment is\nto learn what humans value from their behavioural data. This paper proposes a\ndifferent way of looking at the notion of alignment, namely by introducing AI\nAlignment Dialogues: dialogues with which users and agents try to achieve and\nmaintain alignment via interaction. We argue that alignment dialogues have a\nnumber of advantages in comparison to data-driven approaches, especially for\nbehaviour support agents, which aim to support users in achieving their desired\nfuture behaviours rather than their current behaviours. The advantages of\nalignment dialogues include allowing the users to directly convey higher-level\nconcepts to the agent, and making the agent more transparent and trustworthy.\nIn this paper we outline the concept and high-level structure of alignment\ndialogues. Moreover, we conducted a qualitative focus group user study from\nwhich we developed a model that describes how alignment dialogues affect users,\nand created design suggestions for AI alignment dialogues. Through this we\nestablish foundations for AI alignment dialogues and shed light on what\nrequires further development and research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 13:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Remarkably, by reducing the illumination\nvolume below the characteristic receptor nanocluster sizes, we resolved\nmolecular diffusion within nanoclusters and distinguished it from nanocluster\ndiffusion. Spatiotemporal characterization of transient interactions between\nmolecules is crucial to understand how they communicate with each other to\nregulate cell function.

However, lateral oscillations, also known as wobble, occur when\nthese sphere-shaped robots operate at low speeds, leading to shaky camera\nfeedback. These oscillations in a pendulum-actuated spherical robot are caused\nby the coupling between the forward and steering motions due to nonholonomic\nconstraints. Designing a controller to limit wobbling in these robots is\nchallenging due to their underactuated nature. We propose a model-based\ncontroller to navigate a pendulum-actuated spherical robot using wobble-free\nturning maneuvers consisting of circular arcs and straight lines. The model is\ndeveloped using Lagrange-D'Alembert equations and accounts for the coupled\nforward and steering motions. The model is further analyzed to derive\nexpressions for radius of curvature, precession rate, wobble amplitude, and\nwobble frequency during circular motions. Finally, we design an input-output\nfeedback linearization-based controller to control the robot's heading\ndirection and wobble. Overall, the proposed controller enables a teleoperator\nto command a specific forward velocity and pendulum angle as per the desired\nturning radius while limiting the robot's lateral oscillations to enhance the\nquality of camera feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 13:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

In addressing this limitation, we\nponder that the feature statistics (mean and standard deviation), which carry\nthe domain characteristics of the training data, can be properly manipulated to\nimprove the generalization ability of deep learning models. Existing methods\ncommonly consider feature statistics as deterministic values measured from the\nlearned features and do not explicitly model the uncertain statistics\ndiscrepancy caused by potential domain shifts during testing. In this paper, we\nimprove the network generalization ability by modeling domain shifts with\nuncertainty (DSU), i.e., characterizing the feature statistics as uncertain\ndistributions during training. Specifically, we hypothesize that the feature\nstatistic, after considering the potential uncertainties, follows a\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution. During inference, we propose an\ninstance-wise adaptation strategy that can adaptively deal with the\nunforeseeable shift and further enhance the generalization ability of the\ntrained model with negligible additional cost.

However, these methods can\nonly be reliably used if they can be trained on high-quality and curated\ndatasets. Currently, no such dataset for the exploration of Plasmodium\nfalciparum protein antigen candidates exists. The parasite Plasmodium\nfalciparum causes the infectious disease malaria. Thus, identifying potential\nantigens is of utmost importance for the development of antimalarial drugs and\nvaccines. Since exploring antigen candidates experimentally is an expensive and\ntime-consuming process, applying machine learning methods to support this\nprocess has the potential to accelerate the development of drugs and vaccines,\nwhich are needed for fighting and controlling malaria. Results: We developed\nPlasmoFAB, a curated benchmark that can be used to train machine learning\nmethods for the exploration of Plasmodium falciparum protein antigen\ncandidates. We combined an extensive literature search with domain expertise to\ncreate high-quality labels for Plasmodium falciparum specific proteins that\ndistinguish between antigen candidates and intracellular proteins.\nAdditionally, we used our benchmark to compare different well-known prediction\nmodels and available protein localization prediction services on the task of\nidentifying protein antigen candidates. We show that available general-purpose\nservices are unable to provide sufficient performance on identifying protein\nantigen candidates and are outperformed by our models that were trained on this\ntailored data.

Our method allows for simulation of collections of 3D elastic\nfilaments, capable of full flexural and torsional deformations, coupled\nnon-locally via hydrodynamic interactions, and including multi-body\nmicrohydrodynamics of structures with arbitrary geometry. The method exploits\nthe exponential mapping of quaternions for tracking three-dimensional rotations\nof each interacting element in the system, allowing for computation times up to\n150 times faster than a direct quaternion implementation. Spheres are used as a\n`building block' of both filaments and solid micro-structures for\nstraightforward and intuitive construction of arbitrary three-dimensional\ngeometries present in the environment. We highlight the strengths of the method\nin a series of non-trivial applications including bi-flagellated swimming,\nsperm-egg scattering, and particle transport by cilia arrays.

To answer this question, we study the evolutionary prisoner's\ndilemma game on structured networks where agents can periodically switch their\nstrategy update rules. We accordingly develop a theoretical framework of this\nperiodically switched system, where the replicator equation corresponding to\neach specific microscopic update rule is used for describing the subsystem, and\nall the subsystems are activated in sequence. By utilizing switched system\ntheory, we identify the theoretical condition for the emergence of cooperative\nbehavior.

Mechanical circulatory support of HF\npatients can be achieved by implanting a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\ninto HF patients as a bridge to transplant, recovery or destination therapy and\ncan be controlled by measurement of normal and abnormal pulmonary arterial\nwedge pressure (PAWP). While there are no commercial long-term implantable\npressure sensors to measure PAWP, real-time non-invasive estimation of abnormal\nand normal PAWP becomes vital. In this work, first an improved Harris Hawks\noptimizer algorithm called HHO+ is presented and tested on 24 unimodal and\nmultimodal benchmark functions. Second, a novel fully Elman neural network\n(FENN) is proposed to improve the classification performance. Finally, four\nnovel 18-layer deep learning methods of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nwith multi-layer perceptron (CNN-MLP), CNN with Elman neural networks\n(CNN-ENN), CNN with fully Elman neural networks (CNN-FENN), and CNN with fully\nElman neural networks optimized by HHO+ algorithm (CNN-FENN-HHO+) for\nclassification of abnormal and normal PAWP using estimated HVAD pump flow were\ndeveloped and compared. The estimated pump flow was derived by a non-invasive\nmethod embedded into the commercial HVAD controller. The proposed methods are\nevaluated on an imbalanced clinical dataset using 5-fold cross-validation. The\nproposed CNN-FENN-HHO+ method outperforms the proposed CNN-MLP, CNN-ENN and\nCNN-FENN methods and improved the classification performance metrics across\n5-fold cross-validation. The proposed methods can reduce the likelihood of\nhazardous events like pulmonary congestion and ventricular suction for HF\npatients and notify identified abnormal cases to the hospital, clinician and\ncardiologist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 06:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

This paper proposes a novel Personalized\nFederated Recommendation (PFedRec) framework to learn many user-specific\nlightweight models to be deployed on smart devices rather than a heavyweight\nmodel on a server. Moreover, we propose a new dual personalization mechanism to\neffectively learn fine-grained personalization on both users and items. The\noverall learning process is formulated into a unified federated optimization\nframework. Specifically, unlike previous methods that share exactly the same\nitem embeddings across users in a federated system, dual personalization allows\nmild finetuning of item embeddings for each user to generate user-specific\nviews for item representations which can be integrated into existing federated\nrecommendation methods to gain improvements immediately. Experiments on\nmultiple benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of PFedRec and\nthe dual personalization mechanism.

For example, they can represent\ncommunities in social or citation networks, roles in corporate interactions, or\ncore-periphery structures in transportation networks. We usually detect\nmesoscale structures under the assumption of independence of interactions.\nStill, in many cases, the interactions invalidate this assumption by occurring\nin a specific order. Such patterns emerge in pathway data; to capture them, we\nhave to model the dependencies between interactions using higher-order network\nmodels. However, the detection of mesoscale structures in higher-order networks\nis still under-researched. In this work, we derive a Bayesian approach that\nsimultaneously models the optimal partitioning of nodes in groups and the\noptimal higher-order network dynamics between the groups.

We first classify the\nthree different conceptual schemes to achieve topological superconductor (TSC),\nenabled by real-space superconducting proximity effect, reciprocal-space\nsuperconducting proximity effect, and intrinsic TSC.

However, cyclists face growing risks,\nespecially when encountering semi-trailer trucks. This study aims to reduce the\nnumber of truck-cyclist collisions, which are often caused by semi-trailer\ntrucks making right-hook turns and poor driver attention to blind spots. To\nachieve this, we designed a visual-based blind spot warning system that can\ndetect cyclists for semi-trailer truck drivers using deep learning. First,\nseveral greater than 90% mAP cyclist detection models, such as the EfficientDet\nLite 1 and SSD MobileNetV2, were created using state-of-the-art lightweight\ndeep learning architectures fine-tuned on a newly proposed cyclist image\ndataset composed of a diverse set of over 20,000 images. Next, the object\ndetection model was deployed onto a Google Coral Dev Board mini-computer with a\ncamera module and analyzed for speed, reaching inference times as low as 15\nmilliseconds. Lastly, the end-to-end blind spot cyclist detection device was\ntested in real-time to model traffic scenarios and analyzed further for\nperformance and feasibility.
