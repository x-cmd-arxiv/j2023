The\nkey feature of RIS is to reconfigure the propagation environment via smart\nsignal reflections. In addition, active RIS schemes have been recently proposed\nto overcome the deep path loss attenuation inherent in the RIS-aided\ncommunication systems. Accordingly, this paper considers the secrecy\nperformance of up-link RIS-aided multiple users multiple-input single-output\n(MU-MISO) communication systems, in the presence of multiple passive\neavesdroppers. In contrast to the existing works, we investigate the impact of\nthe RIS phase shift errors on the secrecy performance. Taking into account the\ncomplex environment, where a general Rician channel model is adopted for all\nthe communication links, closed-form approximate expressions for the ergodic\nsecrecy rate are derived for three RIS configurations, namely, i) passive RIS,\nii) active RIS, iii) active RIS with energy harvesting (EH RIS). Then, based on\nthe derived expressions, we optimize the phase shifts at the RIS to enhance the\nsystem performance. In addition, the best RIS configuration selection is\nconsidered for a given target secrecy rate and amount of the power available at\nthe users. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are provided to verify the accuracy\nof the analysis, and the impact of different system parameters on the secrecy\nperformance is investigated. The results in this paper show that, an active RIS\nscheme can be implemented to enhance the secrecy performance of RIS-aided\ncommunication systems with phase shift errors, especially when the users have\nlimited transmission power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 19:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

Small bandwidth asymptotics offers an\nalternative, more general distributional approximation for kernel-based DWAD\nestimators that allows for, but does not require, asymptotic linearity. The\nresulting inference procedures based on small bandwidth asymptotics were found\nto exhibit superior finite sample performance in simulations, but no formal\ntheory justifying that empirical success is available in the literature.\nEmploying Edgeworth expansions, this paper shows that small bandwidth\nasymptotics lead to inference procedures with demonstrable superior\nhigher-order distributional properties relative to procedures based on\nasymptotic linear approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 19:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

The latter process has been hypothesized as a possible\nformation scenario for the unexpectedly high frequency of unbound gas giant\nexoplanets (free floating planets, FFP). Previous calculations with the EDTONS\nfixed grid three dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics code found that protoplanets\nwith masses from 0.01 $M_\\oplus$ to 3 $M_{Jup}$ could undergo chaotic orbital\nevolutions in MGU disks for $\\sim$ 1000 yrs without undergoing monotonic inward\nor outward migration. Here the Enzo 2.5 adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) 3D\nhydrodynamics code is used to follow the formation and orbital evolution of\nprotoplanets in MGU disks for up to 2000 yrs. The Enzo results confirm the\nbasic disk fragmentation results of the EDTONS code, as well as the absence of\nmonotonic inward or outward orbital migration. In addition, Enzo allows\nprotoplanet mergers to occur, unlike EDTONS, resulting in a significant\ndecrease in the number of protoplanets that survive for 1000 to 2000 yrs in the\nEnzo models. These models also imply that gas giants should be ejected\nfrequently in MGU disks that fragment into large numbers of protoplanets,\nsupporting ejection as a possible source mechanism for the observed FFPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2022 21:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

For example, compared to SOTA, we achieve up to\n19$\\times$ speedup and 77.1% memory savings on ImageNet classification with\nonly 0.1% accuracy loss. Finally, our method is easy to implement and deploy;\nover 20$\\times$ speedup and 90% energy savings have been observed compared to\nhighly optimized baselines in MKLDNN and CUDNN on NVIDIA Jetson Nano.\nConsequently, our approach opens up a new direction of research with a huge\npotential for on-device training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 02:33:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 02:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

In today's used textiles, the\nwater vapor transmission (WVT) depends primarily on the porosity and the\nwettability of the clothing layer next to the skin and is not adapting or\nresponsive on environmental conditions. The WVT is inevitably the same from\nboth sides of the membrane. In this study, we propose a novel approach by\ndevelopment of a thermoresponsive Janus membrane using electrospinning\nprocedures. We, therefore, targeted a membrane as a bilayer composite structure\nby use of PVDF as one layer and a blend of PVDF and PNIPAM as the second layer\nchanging wettability properties in the range of physiological temperatures.\nTailored electrospinning conditions led to a self-standing membrane\nincorporating fiber diameters of 400nm, porosities of 50% for both layers\nwithin the Janus membrane. The WVT studies revealed that the combined effects\nof the Janus membrane's directional wettability and the temperature-responsive\nproperty results in temperature-dependent vapor transport. The results show\nthat the membrane offers minimum resistance to WVT when the PVDF side faces the\nskin, which depicts the side with high humidity, over a range of temperatures.\nHowever, the same membrane shows a temperature-dependent WVT behavior when the\nblend side faces the skin. From room temperature of 25 C to an elevated\ntemperature of 35 C, there is a significant increase in the membrane's\nresistance to WVT. This behavior is attributed to the combined effect of the\nJanus construct and the thermoresponsive property. This temperature-controlled\ndifferential vapor transport offers ways to adapt vapor transport independence\nof environmental conditions leading to an enhanced wearing comfort and\nperformance to be applied in fields such as apparel or the packaging industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 05:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

We\nimposed three types of wall shear that may facilitate the single-roll, the\nhorizontally stacked double-roll, and the vertically stacked double-roll flow\nmodes, respectively. Direct numerical simulations are performed for fixed\nRayleigh number $Ra = 10^{8}$ and fixed Prandtl number $Pr = 5.3$, while the\nwall-shear Reynolds number ($Re_{w}$) is in the range $60 \\le Re_{w} \\le 6000$.\nGenerally, we found enhanced heat transfer efficiency and global flow strength\nwith the increase of $Re_{w}$. However, even with the same magnitude of global\nflow strength, the heat transfer efficiency varies significantly when the cells\nare under different types of wall shear. An interesting finding is that by\nincreasing the wall-shear strength, the thermal turbulence is relaminarized,\nand more surprisingly, the heat transfer efficiency in the laminar state is\nhigher than that in the turbulent state. We found that the enhanced heat\ntransfer efficiency at the laminar regime is due to the formation of more\nstable and stronger convection channels. We propose that the origin of thermal\nturbulence laminarization is the reduced amount of thermal plumes. Because\nplumes are mainly responsible for turbulent kinetic energy production, when the\ndetached plumes are swept away by the wall shear, the reduced number of plumes\nleads to weaker turbulent kinetic energy production.

One of the reasons is that the goal information is decoupled\nfrom the perception module and directly introduced as a condition of\ndecision-making, resulting in the goal-irrelevant features of the scene\nrepresentation playing an adversary role during the learning process. In light\nof this, we present a novel Goal-guided Transformer-enabled reinforcement\nlearning (GTRL) approach by considering the physical goal states as an input of\nthe scene encoder for guiding the scene representation to couple with the goal\ninformation and realizing efficient autonomous navigation. More specifically,\nwe propose a novel variant of the Vision Transformer as the backbone of the\nperception system, namely Goal-guided Transformer (GoT), and pre-train it with\nexpert priors to boost the data efficiency. Subsequently, a reinforcement\nlearning algorithm is instantiated for the decision-making system, taking the\ngoal-oriented scene representation from the GoT as the input and generating\ndecision commands. As a result, our approach motivates the scene representation\nto concentrate mainly on goal-relevant features, which substantially enhances\nthe data efficiency of the DRL learning process, leading to superior navigation\nperformance. Both simulation and real-world experimental results manifest the\nsuperiority of our approach in terms of data efficiency, performance,\nrobustness, and sim-to-real generalization, compared with other state-of-art\nbaselines.

Specifically, by treating the\nattack on each benign example as one task, we develop a meta-learning framework\nby training a meta-generator to produce perturbations conditioned on benign\nexamples. When attacking a new benign example, the meta generator can be\nquickly fine-tuned based on the feedback information of the new task as well as\na few historical attacks to produce effective perturbations. Moreover, since\nthe meta-train procedure consumes many queries to learn a generalizable\ngenerator, we utilize model-level adversarial transferability to train the\nmeta-generator on a white-box surrogate model, then transfer it to help the\nattack against the target model. The proposed framework with the two types of\nadversarial transferability can be naturally combined with any off-the-shelf\nquery-based attack methods to boost their performance, which is verified by\nextensive experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 07:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

To reduce discrepancy in feature distributions between two\ndomains, recent approaches achieve domain adaption through feature alignment in\ndifferent granularities via adversarial learning. However, they neglect the\nrelationship between multiple granularities and different features in\nalignment, degrading detection. Addressing this, we introduce a unified\nmulti-granularity alignment (MGA)-based detection framework for\ndomain-invariant feature learning. The key is to encode the dependencies across\ndifferent granularities including pixel-, instance-, and category-levels\nsimultaneously to align two domains. Specifically, based on pixel-level\nfeatures, we first develop an omni-scale gated fusion (OSGF) module to\naggregate discriminative representations of instances with scale-aware\nconvolutions, leading to robust multi-scale detection. Besides, we introduce\nmulti-granularity discriminators to identify where, either source or target\ndomains, different granularities of samples come from. Note that, MGA not only\nleverages instance discriminability in different categories but also exploits\ncategory consistency between two domains for detection. Furthermore, we present\nan adaptive exponential moving average (AEMA) strategy that explores model\nassessments for model update to improve pseudo labels and alleviate local\nmisalignment problem, boosting detection robustness. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple domain adaption scenarios validate the superiority of MGA over other\napproaches on FCOS and Faster R-CNN detectors.

Most existing methods are built on distribution\nmatching, e.g., adversarial domain adaptation, which tends to corrupt feature\ndiscriminability. In this paper, we propose Discriminative Radial Domain\nAdaptation (DRDA) which bridges source and target domains via a shared radial\nstructure. It's motivated by the observation that as the model is trained to be\nprogressively discriminative, features of different categories expand outwards\nin different directions, forming a radial structure. We show that transferring\nsuch an inherently discriminative structure would enable to enhance feature\ntransferability and discriminability simultaneously. Specifically, we represent\neach domain with a global anchor and each category a local anchor to form a\nradial structure and reduce domain shift via structure matching. It consists of\ntwo parts, namely isometric transformation to align the structure globally and\nlocal refinement to match each category. To enhance the discriminability of the\nstructure, we further encourage samples to cluster close to the corresponding\nlocal anchors based on optimal-transport assignment. Extensively experimenting\non multiple benchmarks, our method is shown to consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches on varied tasks, including the typical unsupervised\ndomain adaptation, multi-source domain adaptation, domain-agnostic learning,\nand domain generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 10:56:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 10:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Diverse user behaviors call for\npersonalized services with heterogeneous Machine Learning (ML) models on\ndifferent devices. Federated Multi-task Learning (FMTL) is proposed to train\nrelated but personalized ML models for different devices, whereas previous\nworks suffer from excessive communication overhead during training and neglect\nthe model heterogeneity among devices in MEC. Introducing knowledge\ndistillation into FMTL can simultaneously enable efficient communication and\nmodel heterogeneity among clients, whereas existing methods rely on a public\ndataset, which is impractical in reality. To tackle this dilemma, Federated\nMultI-task Distillation for Multi-access Edge CompuTing (FedICT) is proposed.\nFedICT direct local-global knowledge aloof during bi-directional distillation\nprocesses between clients and the server, aiming to enable multi-task clients\nwhile alleviating client drift derived from divergent optimization directions\nof client-side local models.

FPKD is\nproposed to reinforce the clients' fitting of local data by introducing prior\nknowledge of local data distributions. Moreover, LKA is proposed to correct the\ndistillation loss of the server, making the transferred local knowledge better\nmatch the generalized representation. Experiments on three datasets show that\nFedICT significantly outperforms all compared benchmarks in various data\nheterogeneous and model architecture settings, achieving improved accuracy with\nless than 1.2% training communication overhead compared with FedAvg and no more\nthan 75% training communication round compared with FedGKT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 11:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-03"}

To address this question, this paper presents a novel agent-based\nmodel of an organization that features bottom-up task allocation that can be\nmotivated by either long-term or short-term orientation on the agents' side.\nThe model also includes an incentive mechanism to guide the bottom-up task\nallocation process and create incentives that range from altruistic to\nindividualistic.

The issue of Airbnb's pricing has always been a problem worth\nstudying. While the previous studies achieve promising results, there are\nexists deficiencies to solve. Such as, (1) the feature attributes of rental are\nnot rich enough; (2) the research on rental text information is not deep\nenough; (3) there are few studies on predicting the rental price combined with\nthe point of interest(POI) around the house. To address the above challenges,\nwe proposes a multi-source information embedding(MSIE) model to predict the\nrental price of Airbnb. Specifically, we first selects the statistical feature\nto embed the original rental data. Secondly, we generates the word feature\nvector and emotional score combination of three different text information to\nform the text feature embedding. Thirdly, we uses the points of interest(POI)\naround the rental house information generates a variety of spatial network\ngraphs, and learns the embedding of the network to obtain the spatial feature\nembedding. Finally, this paper combines the three modules into multi source\nrental representations, and uses the constructed fully connected neural network\nto predict the price. The analysis of the experimental results shows the\neffectiveness of our proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2023 11:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

To tackle the challenges, we\nformulate the problem as a course representation learning task-based and\ndevelop an Information-aware Graph Representation Learning(IaGRL) for\nmulti-view MOOC quality evaluation. Specifically, We first build a MOOC\nHeterogeneous Network (HIN) to represent the interactions and relationships\namong entities in MOOC platforms.

The course representation learning can be further\nconverted to a multi-view graph representation task. Different from traditional\ngraph representation learning, the learned course representations are expected\nto match the following three types of validity: (1) the agreement on\nexpressiveness between the raw course portfolio and the learned course\nrepresentations; (2) the consistency between the representations in each view\nand the unified representations; (3) the alignment between the course and MOOC\nplatform representations. Therefore, we propose to exploit mutual information\nfor preserving the validity of course representations.

This kind of weed\nmanagement practice leads to excessive amounts of chemical herbicides being\napplied in a given field. The objective of this study was to perform\nsite-specific weed control (SSWC) in a corn field by 1) using an unmanned\naerial system (UAS) to map the spatial distribution information of weeds in the\nfield; 2) creating a prescription map based on the weed distribution map, and\n3) spraying the field using the prescription map and a commercial size sprayer.\nIn this study, we are proposing a Crop Row Identification (CRI) algorithm, a\ncomputer vision algorithm that identifies corn rows on UAS imagery. After being\nidentified, the corn rows were then removed from the imagery and the remaining\nvegetation fraction was classified as weeds. Based on that information, a\ngrid-based weed prescription map was created and the weed control application\nwas implemented through a commercial-size sprayer. The decision of spraying\nherbicides on a particular grid was based on the presence of weeds in that grid\ncell.
