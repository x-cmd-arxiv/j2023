In this study, we investigate the\nconditions for the emergence of these non-trivial topological structures in the\ncontext of human transportation in cities. We propose a minimal model for\nspatial networks generation, where a network lattice acts as a spatial\nsubstrate and edge velocities and distances define an effective temporal\ndistance which quantifies the efficiency in exploring the urban space. Complex\nnetwork topologies can be recovered from the optimization of joint network\npaths and we study how the interplay between a flow probability between two\nnodes in space and the associated travel cost influences the resulting optimal\nnetwork. In the perspective of urban transportation we simulate these flows by\nmeans of human mobility models to obtain Origin-Destination matrices. We find\nthat when using simple lattices, the obtained optimal topologies transition\nfrom tree-like structures to more regular networks, depending on the spatial\nrange of flows. Remarkably, we find that branches paired to large loops\nstructures appear as optimal structures when the network is optimized for an\ninterplay between heterogeneous mobility patterns of small range travels and\nlonger range ones typical of commuting.

Ground-based\ninstruments reach the high contrasts and small inner working angles needed to\nmonitor these faint companions, but their small fields-of-view lack\nsimultaneous photometric references to correct for non-astrophysical\nvariations. We present a novel approach for making ground-based light curves of\ndirectly imaged companions using high-cadence differential spectrophotometric\nmonitoring, where the simultaneous reference is provided by a double-grating\n360{\\deg} vector Apodizing Phase Plate (dgvAPP360) coronagraph. The dgvAPP360\nenables high-contrast companion detections without blocking the host star,\nallowing it to be used as a simultaneous reference. To further reduce\nsystematic noise, we emulate exoplanet transmission spectroscopy, where the\nlight is spectrally-dispersed and then recombined into white-light flux. We do\nthis by combining the dgvAPP360 with the infrared ALES integral field\nspectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer. To demonstrate,\nwe observed the red companion HD 1160 B (separation ~780 mas) for one night,\nand detect $8.8\\%$ semi-amplitude sinusoidal variability with a ~3.24 h period\nin its detrended white-light curve. We achieve the greatest precision in\nground-based high-contrast imaging light curves of sub-arcsecond companions to\ndate, reaching $3.7\\%$ precision per 18-minute bin. Individual wavelength\nchannels spanning 3.59-3.99 $\\mu$m further show tentative evidence of\nincreasing variability with wavelength. We find no evidence yet of a systematic\nnoise floor, hence additional observations can further improve the precision.\nThis is therefore a promising avenue for future work aiming to map storms or\nfind transiting exomoons around giant exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 17:19:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 11:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

One particular recent\ndevelopment has been searches for light dark matter (LDM), which is typically\ndefined as candidates with masses in the range of keV to GeV. In searches for\nLDM, eV-scale and below detector thresholds are needed to detect the small\namount of kinetic energy that is imparted to nuclei in a recoil. One such\ndetector technology that can be applied to LDM searches is that of\nTransition-Edge Sensors (TESs).

Assuming that the velocity of the trolley of the crane can\nbe commanded and is subject to limits, an optimal control problem is posed to\ndetermine the bang-off-bang control profile to transition the system from a\npoint of rest to the terminal states with no residual vibrations. Both undamped\nand underdamped systems are considered and the variation of the structure of\nthe optimal control profiles as a function of the final displacement is\nstudied. As the magnitude of the rigid body displacement is increased, the\ncollapse and birthing of switches in the optimal control profile are observed\nand explained. Robustness to uncertainties in modal parameters is accounted for\nby forcing the state sensitivities at the terminal time to zero. The\nobservation that the time-optimal control profile merges with the robust\ntime-optimal control is noted for specific terminal displacements and the\nmigration of zeros of the time-delay filter parameterizing the optimal control\nprofile are used to explain this counter intuitive result. A two degree of\nfreedom gantry crane system is used to experimentally validate the observations\nof the numerical studies and the tradeoff of increase in maneuver time to the\nreduction of residual vibrations is experimentally illustrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 18:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

Instead of studying the spectrum of a\ndifferential operator $L$ directly one usually studies its spectral functions,\nthat is, spectral traces of some functions of the operator, such as the\nspectral zeta function $\\zeta(s)=\\Tr L^{-s}$ and the heat trace\n$\\Theta(t)=\\Tr\\exp(-tL)$. The kernel $U(t;x,x')$ of the heat semigroup\n$\\exp(-tL)$, called the heat kernel, plays a major role in quantum field theory\nand quantum gravity, index theorems, non-commutative geometry, integrable\nsystems and financial mathematics. We review some recent progress in the study\nof spectral asymptotics. We study more general spectral functions, such as $\\Tr\nf(tL)$, that we call quantum heat traces. Also, we define new invariants of\ndifferential operators that depend not only on the their eigenvalues but also\non the eigenfunctions, and, therefore, contain much more information about the\ngeometry of the manifold. Furthermore, we study some new invariants, such as\n$\\Tr\\exp(-tL_+)\\exp(-sL_-)$, that contain relative spectral information of two\ndifferential operators. Finally we show how the convolution of the semigroups\nof two different operators can be computed by using purely algebraic methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 18:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

For 3D point cloud transformers, existing\nefforts focus primarily on pushing their accuracy to the state-of-the-art\nlevel. However, their latency lags behind sparse convolution-based models (3x\nslower), hindering their usage in resource-constrained, latency-sensitive\napplications (such as autonomous driving). This inefficiency comes from point\nclouds' sparse and irregular nature, whereas transformers are designed for\ndense, regular workloads. This paper presents FlatFormer to close this latency\ngap by trading spatial proximity for better computational regularity. We first\nflatten the point cloud with window-based sorting and partition points into\ngroups of equal sizes rather than windows of equal shapes. This effectively\navoids expensive structuring and padding overheads.

The SMC stars\nhave abundance ratios clearly distinct with respect to the Milky Way stars, in\nparticular for the elements produced by massive stars (like Na, $\\alpha$ and\nmost iron-peak elements) that have abundance ratios systematically lower than\nthose measured in our Galaxy. This points out that the massive stars\ncontributed less to the chemical enrichment of the SMC with respect to the\nMilky Way, according to the low star formation rate expected for this galaxy.\nFinally, we identified small systematic differences in the abundances of some\nelements (Na, Ti, V and Zr) in the two innermost fields, suggesting that the\nchemical enrichment history in the SMC has been not uniform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

However,\nthere are cases where such age estimates can be highly precise yet very\ninaccurate. An example is giants that have undergone mass loss or mass transfer\nevents that have significantly altered their mass. In this context, stars with\n\"apparent\" ages significantly higher than the age of the Universe are\ncandidates as stripped stars, or stars that have lost more mass than expected,\nmost likely via interaction with a companion star, or because of the poorly\nunderstood mass-loss mechanism along the red-giant branch. In this work we\nidentify examples of such objects among red giants observed by\n$\\textit{Kepler}$, both at low ([Fe/H] $ \\lesssim -0.5$) and solar metallicity.\nBy modelling their structure and pulsation spectra, we find a consistent\npicture confirming that these are indeed low-mass objects consisting of a He\ncore of $\\approx 0.5 \\, M_\\odot$ and an envelope of $\\approx 0.1 - 0.2 \\,\nM_\\odot$.

The\ncomplex pulsation spectra of these objects, if observed with sufficient\nfrequency resolution, hold detailed information about the structural properties\nof likely products of mass stripping, hence can potentially shed light on their\nformation mechanism. On the other hand, our tests highlight the difficulties\nassociated with measuring reliably the large frequency separation, especially\nin shorter datasets, with impact on the reliability of the inferred masses and\nages of low-mass Red Clump stars with e.g. K2 or TESS data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 19:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

It is usually measured with symmetric dependence\ncoefficients that do not depend on the order of the variables. In many cases,\nthere is a natural asymmetry between extreme observations that can not be\ncaptured by such coefficients. An example for such asymmetry are large\ndischarges at an upstream and a downstream stations on a river network: an\nextreme discharge at the upstream station will directly influence the discharge\nat the downstream station, but not vice versa. Simple measures for asymmetric\ndependence in extreme events have not yet been investigated. We propose the\nasymmetric tail Kendall's $\\tau$ as a measure for extremal dependence that is\nsensitive to asymmetric behaviour in the largest observations.

These equations are supposed to arise after vertical\nintegration of the full three-dimensional equations of hydrodynamics, under the\nassumption of a geometrically thin disk with mirror symmetry about the\nmidplane. But in the dynamical context, vertical dynamics are neglected by\nincorrectly assuming instantaneous vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. The\nresulting errors in the local disk height couple to the horizontal dynamics\nthrough some viscosity prescriptions and gravitational softening models.\nFurthermore, the viscous terms in the horizontal equations are only complete if\nthey are inserted after vertical integration, as if the system is actually\ntwo-dimensional. Since turbulence breaks mirror symmetry, it is more physically\ncorrect to insert a turbulence model at the three-dimensional level, and impose\nmirror symmetry only on average. Thus, some viscous terms are usually missing.\nWe revisit the vertical integration procedure, restricting to the regime of a\nNewtonian, non-self-gravitating disk. We obtain six evolution equations with\nonly horizontal dependence, which determine the local vertical position and\nvelocity of the disk surface, in addition to the usual fluid variables. This\n\"2.5-dimensional\" formulation opens the door to efficiently study vertical\noscillations of thin disks in dynamical settings, and to improve the treatment\nof unresolved turbulence.

We detect a forest\nof emission lines from molecules previously identified in infrared spectra of\nclassical T Tauri disks: H2O, OH, H2, HCN, C2H2, and CO2. The detection of\norganic molecules demonstrates that they are back after disappearing during the\nlarge outburst. Spectral lines from water and OH are for the first time\nde-blended and will provide a much improved characterization of their\ndistribution and density in the inner disk. The spectrum also shows broad\nemission bands from warm, sub-micron size amorphous silicate grains at 10 and\n18 um. During the outburst, in 2008, crystalline forsterite grains were\nannealed in the inner disk within 1 au, but their spectral signatures in the 10\num silicate band later disappeared.

However, collecting and\nlabeling sufficient student responses for training models is time and\ncost-consuming. Recent studies suggest that pre-trained language models can be\nadapted to downstream tasks without fine-tuning with prompts. However, no\nresearch has employed such a prompt approach in science education. As student\nresponses are presented with natural language, aligning the scoring procedure\nas the next sentence prediction task using prompts can skip the costly\nfine-tuning stage. In this study, we developed a zero-shot approach to\nautomatically score student responses via Matching Exemplars as Next Sentence\nPrediction (MeNSP). This approach employs no training samples. We first apply\nMeNSP in scoring three assessment tasks of scientific argumentation and found\nmachine-human scoring agreements, Cohen's Kappa ranges from 0.30 to 0.57, and\nF1 score ranges from 0.54 to 0.81. To improve the performance, we extend our\nresearch to the few-shots setting, either randomly selecting labeled student\nresponses or manually constructing responses to fine-tune the models. We find\nthat one task's performance is improved with more samples, Cohen's Kappa from\n0.30 to 0.38, and F1 score from 0.54 to 0.59; for the two others, scoring\nperformance is not improved. We also find that randomly selected few-shots\nperform better than the human expert-crafted approach. This study suggests that\nMeNSP can yield referable automatic scoring for student responses while\nsignificantly reducing the cost of model training. This method can benefit\nlow-stakes classroom assessment practices in science education.

The prediction and understanding of CMEs is of\nparticular importance due to the impact that they can have on Earth-based\nsatellite systems, and in extreme cases, ground-based electronics. CMEs often\noccur when long-lived magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) anchored to the solar surface\ndestabilize and erupt away from the Sun. One potential cause for these\neruptions is an ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instability such as the kink or\ntorus instability. Previous experiments on the Magnetic Reconnection eXperiment\n(MRX) revealed a class of MFRs that were torus-unstable but kink-stable, which\nfailed to erupt. These \"failed-tori\" went through a process similar to Taylor\nrelaxation where the toroidal current was redistributed before the eruption\nultimately failed. We have investigated this behavior through additional\ndiagnostics that measure the current distribution at the foot points and the\nenergy distribution before and after an event. These measurements indicate that\nideal MHD effects are sufficient to explain the energy distribution changes\nduring failed torus events. This excludes Taylor relaxation as a possible\nmechanism of current redistribution during an event. A new model that only\nrequires non-ideal effects in a thin layer above the electrodes is presented to\nexplain the observed phenomena. This work broadens our understanding of the\nstability of MFRs and the mechanism behind the failed torus through the\nimproved prediction of the torus instability and through new diagnostics to\nmeasure the energy inventory and current profile at the foot points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 19:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Recently,\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) have developed rapidly and have been applied to\nsocial media research. In this paper, we crawl a large-scale dataset of the\n2020 US presidential election and automatically label all users by manually\ntagged hashtags. Subsequently, we propose a bipartite graph neural network\nmodel, DoubleH, which aims to better utilize homogeneous and heterogeneous\ninformation in user stance detection tasks. Specifically, we first construct a\nbipartite graph based on posting and retweeting relations for two kinds of\nnodes, including users and tweets.

While one may design an SA system to default to\naccepting control from one or the other, such design choices can have\ncatastrophic consequences in safety-critical settings. For instance, the\nsensors an autonomous controller relies upon may provide incorrect information\nabout the environment due to tampering or natural wear. On the other hand, the\nhuman operator may also provide dangerous input. This begs an important\nquestion: Can we convert an existing SA system to make dynamic real-time\ncontrol decisions that are tolerant of erroneous/malicious input?\n  To explore this question in this paper, we investigate a specific application\nof an SA system that failed due to a static assignment of control authority.\nNamely, the well-publicized failure of the Boeing 737-MAX Maneuvering\nCharacteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) that caused the crashes of Lion Air\nFlight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.

Using these insights, we\npresent Semi-Autonomous MCAS (SA-MCAS), a new MCAS that both meets the intended\ngoals of MCAS and avoids the failure cases that plagued the original MCAS\ndesign.

Under mild assumptions, the treatment effect of interest\ncan be identified. We extend the approach to address censored outcome data. The\nproposed method is applied to a neoadjuvant clinical trial and its performance\nis evaluated via simulation studies.\n  In the second project, we propose a tree-based model averaging approach to\nimprove the estimation accuracy of conditional average treatment effects at a\ntarget site by leveraging models derived from other potentially heterogeneous\nsites, without them sharing subject-level data. The performance of this\napproach is demonstrated by a study of the causal effects of oxygen therapy on\nhospital survival rates and backed up by comprehensive simulations.\n  In the third project, we propose a robust individualized decision learning\nframework with sensitive variables to improve the worst-case outcomes of\nindividuals caused by sensitive variables that are unavailable at the time of\ndecision.

Mobile users' trajectories prediction\nbelongs to the task of temporal information processing and it is a mobility\nmanagement problem that is essential for self-organizing and autonomous 6G\nnetworks. Our aim is to accurately predict the future positions of mobile users\nin wireless networks using QRC. To do so, we use a real-world time series\ndataset to model mobile users' trajectories. The QRC approach has two\ncomponents: reservoir computing (RC) and quantum computing (QC). In RC, the\ntraining is more computational-efficient than the training of simple recurrent\nneural networks (RNN) since, in RC, only the weights of the output layer are\ntrainable. The internal part of RC is what is called the reservoir. For the RC\nto perform well, the weights of the reservoir should be chosen carefully to\ncreate highly complex and nonlinear dynamics. The QC is used to create such\ndynamical reservoir that maps the input time series into higher dimensional\ncomputational space composed of dynamical states. After obtaining the\nhigh-dimensional dynamical states, a simple linear regression is performed to\ntrain the output weights and thus the prediction of the mobile users'\ntrajectories can be performed efficiently. In this paper, we apply a QRC\napproach based on the Hamiltonian time evolution of a quantum system. We\nsimulate the time evolution using IBM gate-based quantum computers and we show\nin the experimental results that the use of QRC to predict the mobile users'\ntrajectories with only a few qubits is efficient and is able to outperform the\nclassical approaches such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) approach and the\necho-state networks (ESN) approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 20:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

In this work, we determine the exact conditions for guaranteed\nexecution path replicability of the tested transactions, and implement a\ntransaction testing tool, TxT, which reveals the actual outcomes of Ethereum\ntransactions. To ensure the correctness of testing, TxT deterministically\nverifies whether a given sequence of transactions ensues an identical execution\npath on the current state of blockchain. We analyze over 1.3 billion Ethereum\ntransactions and determine that 96.5% of them can be verified by TxT. We\nfurther show that TxT successfully reveals the suspicious behaviors associated\nwith 31 out of 37 vulnerabilities (83.8% coverage) in the smart contract\nweakness classification (SWC) registry. In comparison, the vulnerability\ncoverage of all the existing defense approaches combined only reaches 40.5%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 21:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

Current quantum annealing hardware is\nrelatively sparse and therefore requires graph minor embedding in order to map\nan arbitrarily structured problem onto the sparse, and relatively small,\nquantum annealing processor. This paper proposes a new minor embedding method\ncalled 4-clique minor embedding. This is in contrast to the standard minor\nembedding technique of using a path of linearly connected qubits in order to\nrepresent a logical variable state. The 4-clique minor embedding is possible\nbecause of Pegasus graph connectivity, which is the native hardware graph for\nsome of the current D-Wave quantum annealers. The Pegasus hardware graph has\nmany 4-cliques, and it is possible to form a graph composed entirely of paths\nof connected 4-cliques, on which a problem can be minor embedded. The 4-clique\nchains come at the cost of additional qubit usage on the hardware graph, but\nthey allow for stronger coupling within each chain thereby increasing chain\nintegrity and reducing chain breaks. This 4-clique minor embedding technique is\ndescribed in detail, and is compared against the standard linear path minor\nembedding with some experiments on two D-Wave quantum annealing processors with\nPegasus hardware graphs. 4-clique minor embeddings can use weak chain strengths\nwhile successfully carrying out the computation of minimizing random all-to-all\nspin glass problem instances, in contrast to the linear path minor embeddings\nwhich have high chain break frequencies for weak chain strengths. This work\nshows that non standard minor embedding methods could be useful. For future\nquantum annealing architectures, distributing minor embeddings over more\ndensely connected regions of hardware instead of linear paths may provide more\nrobust computations for minor embedding problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 21:26:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 08:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

A semi-discretization in time of the conservative\nSaint-Venant equations with bottom friction terms leads to its decomposition\ninto a first order hyperbolic subsystem containing the nonlinear convective\nterm and a second order wave equation for the pressure. For the spatial\ndiscretization of the free surface elevation an unstructured mesh of triangular\nsimplex elements is considered, whereas a dual grid of the edge-type is\nemployed for the computation of the depth-averaged momentum vector. The first\nstage of the proposed algorithm consists in the solution of the nonlinear\nconvective subsystem using an explicit Godunov-type FV method on the staggered\ngrid. Next, a classical continuous FE scheme provides the free surface\nelevation at the vertex of the primal mesh.

The target Y (e.g.,\ntext, speech, music, image, video) is usually high-dimensional and complex, and\ncontains information that does not exist in source data, which hinders\neffective and efficient learning on the source-target mapping. In this paper,\nwe present a learning paradigm called regeneration learning for data\ngeneration, which first generates Y' (an abstraction/representation of Y) from\nX and then generates Y from Y'. During training, Y' is obtained from Y through\neither handcrafted rules or self-supervised learning and is used to learn\nX-->Y' and Y'-->Y. Regeneration learning extends the concept of representation\nlearning to data generation tasks, and can be regarded as a counterpart of\ntraditional representation learning, since 1) regeneration learning handles the\nabstraction (Y') of the target data Y for data generation while traditional\nrepresentation learning handles the abstraction (X') of source data X for data\nunderstanding; 2) both the processes of Y'-->Y in regeneration learning and\nX-->X' in representation learning can be learned in a self-supervised way\n(e.g., pre-training); 3) both the mappings from X to Y' in regeneration\nlearning and from X' to Y in representation learning are simpler than the\ndirect mapping from X to Y.

Given that KGs are\nusually incomplete, neural models are proposed to answer the logical queries by\nparameterizing set operators with complex neural networks. However, such\nmethods usually train neural set operators with a large number of entity and\nrelation embeddings from the zero, where whether and how the embeddings or the\nneural set operators contribute to the performance remains not clear. In this\npaper, we propose a simple framework for complex query answering that\ndecomposes the KG embeddings from neural set operators. We propose to represent\nthe complex queries into the query graph. On top of the query graph, we propose\nthe Logical Message Passing Neural Network (LMPNN) that connects the local\none-hop inferences on atomic formulas to the global logical reasoning for\ncomplex query answering. We leverage existing effective KG embeddings to\nconduct one-hop inferences on atomic formulas, the results of which are\nregarded as the messages passed in LMPNN. The reasoning process over the\noverall logical formulas is turned into the forward pass of LMPNN that\nincrementally aggregates local information to finally predict the answers'\nembeddings. The complex logical inference across different types of queries\nwill then be learned from training examples based on the LMPNN architecture.\nTheoretically, our query-graph represenation is more general than the\nprevailing operator-tree formulation, so our approach applies to a broader\nrange of complex KG queries. Empirically, our approach yields the new\nstate-of-the-art neural CQA model.

Moreover, the available training samples for a given task are\ngenerally scarce and imbalanced. These conditions are not conducive for\nlearning effective deep neural models. Hence, it is common to 'transfer' neural\nnetworks trained on natural images to the medical image domain. However, this\nparadigm lacks in performance due to the large domain gap between the natural\nand medical image data. To address that, we propose a novel concept of Pre-text\nRepresentation Transfer (PRT). In contrast to the conventional transfer\nlearning, which fine-tunes a source model after replacing its classification\nlayers, PRT retains the original classification layers and updates the\nrepresentation layers through an unsupervised pre-text task. The task is\nperformed with (original, not synthetic) medical images, without utilizing any\nannotations. This enables representation transfer with a large amount of\ntraining data. This high-fidelity representation transfer allows us to use the\nresulting model as a more effective feature extractor. Moreover, we can also\nsubsequently perform the traditional transfer learning with this model. We\ndevise a collaborative representation based classification layer for the case\nwhen we leverage the model as a feature extractor. We fuse the output of this\nlayer with the predictions of a model induced with the traditional transfer\nlearning performed over our pre-text transferred model. The utility of our\ntechnique for limited and imbalanced data classification problem is\ndemonstrated with an extensive five-fold evaluation for three large-scale\nmodels, tested for five different class-imbalance ratios for CT based COVID-19\ndetection. Our results show a consistent gain over the conventional transfer\nlearning with the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2023 04:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

In this work, we develop a novel\nasynchronous strategy that leverages the advantages of both synchronous methods\nand asynchronous ones, named adaptive bounded staleness (ABS). The key enablers\nof ABS are two-fold. First, the number of workers that the PS waits for per\nround for gradient aggregation is adaptively selected to strike a\nstraggling-staleness balance. Second, the workers with relatively high\nstaleness are required to start a new round of computation to alleviate the\nnegative effect of staleness.

However, these assumptions\ndon't necessarily apply on the edge, especially when training neural networks\non streaming data in an online manner. Computing on the edge suffers from both\nsystems and statistical heterogeneity. Systems heterogeneity is attributed to\ndifferences in compute resources and bandwidth specific to each device, while\nstatistical heterogeneity comes from unbalanced and skewed data on the edge.\nDifferent streaming-rates among devices can be another source of heterogeneity\nwhen dealing with streaming data. If the streaming rate is lower than training\nbatch-size, device needs to wait until enough samples have streamed in before\nperforming a single iteration of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Thus,\nlow-volume streams act like stragglers slowing down devices with high-volume\nstreams in synchronous training. On the other hand, data can accumulate quickly\nin the buffer if the streaming rate is too high and the devices can't train at\nline-rate. In this paper, we introduce ScaDLES to efficiently train on\nstreaming data at the edge in an online fashion, while also addressing the\nchallenges of limited bandwidth and training with non-IID data. We empirically\nshow that ScaDLES converges up to 3.29 times faster compared to conventional\ndistributed SGD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2023 05:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

In this work, we propose a novel deep network architecture, i.e.,\nPolySnake, for contour-based instance segmentation. Motivated by the classic\nSnake algorithm, the proposed PolySnake achieves superior and robust\nsegmentation performance with an iterative and progressive contour refinement\nstrategy. Technically, PolySnake introduces a recurrent update operator to\nestimate the object contour iteratively. It maintains a single estimate of the\ncontour that is progressively deformed toward the object boundary. At each\niteration, PolySnake builds a semantic-rich representation for the current\ncontour and feeds it to the recurrent operator for further contour adjustment.\nThrough the iterative refinements, the contour finally progressively converges\nto a stable status that tightly encloses the object instance. Moreover, with a\ncompact design of the recurrent architecture, we ensure the running efficiency\nunder multiple iterations. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the\nmerits of our method, and the results demonstrate that the proposed PolySnake\noutperforms the existing contour-based instance segmentation methods on several\nprevalent instance segmentation benchmarks.

In order to model structured\nknowledge in the context and avoid these two problems, we propose to unify\nstructure reasoning and language model pre-training. It identifies four types\nof elementary knowledge structures from contexts to construct structured\nqueries, and utilizes the box embedding method to conduct explicit structure\nreasoning along queries during language modeling. To fuse textual and\nstructured semantics, we utilize contextual language representations of\nknowledge structures to initialize their box embeddings for structure\nreasoning.

Automated claim verification methods exist to validate\nclaims, but they lack foundational data and often use mainstream news as\nevidence sources that are strongly biased towards a specific agenda. Current\nclaim verification methods use deep neural network models and complex\nalgorithms for a high classification accuracy but it is at the expense of model\nexplainability. The models are black-boxes and their decision-making process\nand the steps it took to arrive at a final prediction are obfuscated from the\nuser. We introduce a novel claim verification approach, namely: ExClaim, that\nattempts to provide an explainable claim verification system with foundational\nevidence. Inspired by the legal system, ExClaim leverages rationalization to\nprovide a verdict for the claim and justifies the verdict through a natural\nlanguage explanation (rationale) to describe the model's decision-making\nprocess. ExClaim treats the verdict classification task as a question-answer\nproblem and achieves a performance of 0.93 F1 score. It provides subtasks\nexplanations to also justify the intermediate outcomes.

This problem is a natural\nextension of the Andersen & Lang cut improvement problem to the hypergraph\nsetting. We demonstrate the existence of efficient algorithms for approximately\nsolving this problem. These algorithms run in almost-linear time for the case\nof hypergraph expansion, and when the hypergraph rank is at most $O(1)$.\n  Next, we provide an efficient $O(\\log n)$-approximation algorithm for finding\nthe minimum ratio-cut of $G$. We generalize the cut-matching game framework of\nKhandekar et. al. to allow for the cut player to play unbalanced cuts, and\nmatching player to route approximate single-commodity flows.

One of the\npowerful tools to study influence of defects on charge capture and\nrecombination processes is thermoluminescence. The popular models behind\nthermoluminescence and carrier capture processes are semi-classic though. They\noffer good qualitative description, but implicitly exclude quantum nature of\nthe accompanying parameters, such as frequency factors and capture cross\nsections. As a consequence, results obtained for a specific host material\ncannot be successfully extrapolated to other materials. Thus, the main purpose\nof our work is to introduce a reliable analytical model that describes\nnon-radiative capture and release of electrons from/to the conduction band\n(CB). The proposed model is governed by Bose-Einstein statistics (for phonon\noccupation) and Fermi's golden rule (for resonant charge transfer between the\ntrap and the CB). The constructed model offers a physical interpretation of the\ncapture coefficients and frequency factors, and seamlessly includes the Coulomb\nneutral/attractive nature of traps. It connects the frequency factor to the\noverlap of wavefunctions of the delocalized CB and trap states, and suggests a\nstrong dependence on the density of charge distribution, i.e. the\nionicity/covalency of the chemical bonds within the host. Separation of the\nresonance condition from the accumulation/dissipation of phonons on the site\nleads to the conclusion that the capture cross-section does not necessarily\ndepend on the trap depth. The model is verified by comparison to reported\nexperimental data, showing good agreement. As such, the model generates\nreliable information about trap states whose exact nature is not completely\nunderstood and allows to do materials research in a more systematic way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2023 09:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

We consider the exponential sum approximation of a finite\ncompletely monotonic function based on the Gaussian quadrature with a variable\ntransformation. If the variable transformation is analytic on an open Bernstein\nellipse, the maximum absolute error decreases at least geometrically with\nrespect to the number of exponential functions. The error of the Gaussian\nquadrature is also expanded by basis functions associated with the variable\ntransformation. The basis functions form a Chebyshev system on the positive\nreal axis. The maximization of the decreasing rate of the error bound can be\nachieved by constructing a one-to-one mapping of an open Bernstein ellipse onto\nthe right half-plane.

It is shown that, as long as the\nanalysis is restricted to the system attractor, the PFO can be used to\ndifferentiate causality and coherence from simple correlation without\nperforming interventional experiments, and that the key difficulty remains\ncollecting enough data to populate the operator matrix. This is alleviated by\nlimiting the analysis to two-dimensional projections of the phase space, and\ndeveloping a series of indicators to choose the best parameter pairs from a\nlarge number of possibilities. The techniques thus developed are applied to the\nstudy of bursting in the inertial layer of the channel, with emphasis on the\nprocess by which bursts are reinitiated after they have decayed. Conditional\naveraging over phase-space trajectories suggested by the PFO shows, somewhat\ncounter-intuitively, that a key ingredient for the burst recovery is the\ndevelopment of a low-shear region near the wall, overlaid by a lifted shear\nlayer. This is confirmed by a computational experiment in which the control of\nthe mean velocity profile by the turbulence fluctuations is artificially\nrelaxed. The behaviour of the mean velocity profile is thus modified, but the\nassociation of low wall shear with the initiation of the bursts is maintained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2023 13:11:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

This is the case for the mono-chalcogenides which feature a number\nof lattice instabilities associated with their network of resonant bonds and a\nlarge tunability in their functional properties.

We demonstrate strong performance gains\nacross various inverse problems with structured noise, outperforming\ncompetitive baselines that use normalizing flows and adversarial networks. This\nopens up new opportunities and relevant practical applications of diffusion\nmodeling for inverse problems in the context of non-Gaussian measurement\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 23:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 13:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

One solution for state construction is to use\nrecurrent neural networks. Back-propagation through time (BPTT), and real-time\nrecurrent learning (RTRL) are two popular gradient-based methods for recurrent\nlearning. BPTT requires the complete sequence of observations before computing\ngradients and is unsuitable for online real-time updates. RTRL can do online\nupdates but scales poorly to large networks. In this paper, we propose two\nconstraints that make RTRL scalable. We show that by either decomposing the\nnetwork into independent modules, or learning the network incrementally, we can\nmake RTRL scale linearly with the number of parameters. Unlike prior scalable\ngradient estimation algorithms, such as UORO and Truncated-BPTT, our algorithms\ndo not add noise or bias to the gradient estimate. Instead, they trade-off the\nfunctional capacity of the network to achieve scalable learning.

It is not a comprehensive and\nunbiased compilation of all historic data and studies, but rather a focus on\ncompelling evidence leading to new physics. In particular, the largely\noverlooked nuances of different techniques applied in material and magnetic\ntrap experiments are clarified. Further detailed analysis shows that the\n``beam'' approach of neutron lifetime measurements is likely to give the\n``true'' $\\beta$-decay lifetime, while discrepancies in ``bottle'' measurements\nindicate new physics at play. The most feasible solution to these puzzles is a\nnewly proposed ordinary-mirror neutron ($n-n'$) oscillation model under the\nframework of mirror matter theory. This phenomenological model is reviewed and\nintroduced, and its explanations of the neutron lifetime anomaly and possible\nnon-unitarity of the CKM matrix are presented. Most importantly, various new\nexperimental proposals, especially lifetime measurements with small/narrow\nmagnetic traps or under super-strong magnetic fields, are discussed in order to\ntest the surprisingly large anomalous signals that are uniquely predicted by\nthis new $n-n'$ oscillation model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2023 04:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 18:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

One such popular\ndistributed file system is Lustre, which is extensively used in\nhigh-performance computing environments. Lustre offers parallel file access,\nallowing multiple clients to access and store data simultaneously. However, in\norder to ensure the security and integrity of data, auditing plays a crucial\nrole. Lustre auditing serves as a proof of security and enables the\nimplementation of robust security features such as authentication with\nKerberos, mandatory access control with SELinux, isolation, and more. Auditing\nhelps track and monitor file system activities, providing valuable insights\ninto user actions, system events, and potential security breaches. The\nobjective of this project is to explore Lustre auditing using CentOS, a popular\nLinux distribution, within a Lustre architecture.

Matrix factorization-based\nmodels are a representative of solving this problem. However, they assume that\nthe views share a dimension-fixed consensus coefficient matrix and\nview-specific base matrices, limiting their representability.
