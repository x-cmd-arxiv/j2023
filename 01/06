Most current state-of-the-art methods use latent variable\ngenerative models operating directly on the images. However, generative models\nhave been shown to mostly capture low-level features, s.a. pixel-intensities,\ninstead of rich semantic features, which also applies to their representations.\nWe circumvent this problem by proposing CRADL whose core idea is to model the\ndistribution of normal samples directly in the low-dimensional representation\nspace of an encoder trained with a contrastive pretext-task. By utilizing the\nrepresentations of contrastive learning, we aim to fix the over-fixation on\nlow-level features and learn more semantic-rich representations.

The combined law of thermodynamics derived by\nGibbs about 150 years ago laid the foundation of thermodynamics. In Gibbs\ncombined law, the entropy production due to internal processes was not\nincluded, and the 2nd law was thus practically removed from the Gibbs combined\nlaw, so it is only applicable to systems under equilibrium. Gibbs further\nderived the classical statistical thermodynamics in terms of the probability of\nconfigurations in a system. With the quantum mechanics (QM) developed, the\nQM-based statistical thermodynamics was established and connected to classical\nstatistical thermodynamics at the classical limit as shown by Landau. The\ndevelopment of density function theory (DFT) by Kohn and co-workers enabled the\nQM prediction of properties of the ground state of a system. On the other hand,\nthe entropy production due to internal processes in non-equilibrium systems was\nstudied separately by Onsager and Prigogine and co-workers. The digitization of\nthermodynamics was developed by Kaufman in the framework of the CALPHAD\nmodeling of individual phases. Our recently termed zentropy theory integrates\nDFT and statistical mechanics through the replacement of the internal energy of\neach individual configuration by its DFT-predicted free energy. Furthermore,\nthrough the combined law of thermodynamics with the entropy production as a\nfunction of internal degrees of freedom, it is shown that the kinetic\ncoefficient matrix of independent internal processes is diagonal with respect\nto the conjugate potentials in the combined law, and the cross phenomena\nrepresented by the phenomenological Onsager reciprocal relationships are due to\nthe dependence of the conjugate potential of the molar quantity in a flux on\nnonconjugate potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 16:20:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 22:10:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 07:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

One of the recent measures adopted by\nomnichannel retailers is to address the growth of online sales using in-store\npicking, which allows serving online orders using existing assets. However, it\ncomes with the downside of harming the offline customer experience. To achieve\npicking policies adapted to the dynamic customer flows of a retail store, we\nformalize a new problem called Dynamic In-store Picker Routing Problem (diPRP).\nIn this relevant problem - diPRP - a picker tries to pick online orders while\nminimizing customer encounters. We model the problem as a Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP) and solve it using a hybrid solution approach comprising\nmathematical programming and reinforcement learning components. Computational\nexperiments on synthetic instances suggest that the algorithm converges to\nefficient policies. Furthermore, we apply our approach in the context of a\nlarge European retailer to assess the results of the proposed policies\nregarding the number of orders picked and customers encountered. Our work\nsuggests that retailers should be able to scale the in-store picking of online\norders without jeopardizing the experience of offline customers. The policies\nlearned using the proposed solution approach reduced the number of customer\nencounters by more than 50% when compared to policies solely focused on picking\norders. Thus, to pursue omnichannel strategies that adequately trade-off\noperational efficiency and customer experience, retailers cannot rely on actual\nsimplistic picking strategies, such as choosing the shortest possible route.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 16:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

Although great progress has\nbeen made in designing face PAD methods, developing a model that can generalize\nwell to an unseen test domain remains a significant challenge. Moreover, due to\ndifferent types of spoofing attacks, creating a dataset with a sufficient\nnumber of samples for training deep neural networks is a laborious task. This\nwork addresses these challenges by creating synthetic data and introducing a\ndeep learning-based unified framework for improving the generalization ability\nof the face PAD. In particular, synthetic data is generated by proposing a\nvideo distillation technique that blends a spatiotemporal warped image with a\nstill image based on alpha compositing. Since the proposed synthetic samples\ncan be generated by increasing different alpha weights, we train multiple\nclassifiers by taking the advantage of a specific type of ensemble learning\nknown as a stacked ensemble, where each such classifier becomes an expert in\nits own domain but a non-expert to others. Motivated by this, a meta-classifier\nis employed to learn from these experts collaboratively so that when developing\nan ensemble, they can leverage complementary information from each other to\nbetter tackle or be more useful for an unseen target domain.

If the\nBrouwerian semilattice has a bottom element 0 then the relative\npseudocomplement with respect to 0 is called the pseudocomplement and it is\nconsidered as the connective negation in this logic. Our idea is to consider an\narbitrary meet-semilattice with 0 satisfying only the Ascending Chain\nCondition, which is trivially satisfied in finite semilattices, and introduce\nthe connective negation x^0 as the set of all maximal elements z satisfying\nx^z=0 and the connective implication x->y as the set of all maximal elements z\nsatisfying x^z\\le y. Such a negation and implication is \"unsharp\" since it\nassigns to one entry x or to two entries x and y belonging to the semilattice,\nrespectively, a subset instead of an element of the semilattice.

In this\npaper, we seek to unify the output space of visual tasks, so that we can also\nbuild a unified model for visual tasks. To this end, we demonstrate a single\nunified model that simultaneously handles two typical visual tasks of instance\nsegmentation and depth estimation, which have discrete/fixed-length and\ncontinuous/varied-length outputs, respectively.

Soft token can improve the accuracy of both the next token\ninference and decoding of the task output; 2) Mask augmentation.

In this work, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on matter\nclustering at $z=0$ using a large library of power spectra from the Cosmology\nand Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project, containing\nthousands of $(25\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc})^3$ volume realizations with varying\ncosmology, initial random field, stellar and AGN feedback strength, sub-grid\nmodel implementation, and (magneto)-hydrodynamics methods. We show that\nbaryonic physics can profoundly affect matter clustering on scales $k \\gtrsim\n0.1\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and the magnitude of this effect is highly dependent\non the details of the galaxy formation implementation and variations of\ncosmological and astrophysical parameters. Increasing AGN feedback strength\ndecreases halo baryon fractions and yields generally stronger suppression of\npower relative to N-body simulations, while stronger stellar feedback often\nresults in weaker overall effects by suppressing black hole growth and\ntherefore the impact of AGN feedback. We find a broad correlation between mean\nbaryon fraction of massive halos ($M_{\\rm 200c} > 10^{13.5}$ M$_\\odot\\,h^{-1}$)\nand suppression of matter clustering but with significant scatter compared to\nprevious work owing to wider exploration of feedback parameters and cosmic\nvariance effects.

With the arrival of cavity and circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics we can now achieve strong light-matter couplings which form the\nbasis of most implementations of quantum technology. But quantum information\nprocessing also has high demands requiring total error rates of fractions of\npercentage in order to be scalable (fault-tolerant) to useful applications.\nSince errors can also arise from modelling, this has brought into center stage\none of the key approximations of quantum theory, the Rotating Wave\nApproximation (RWA) of the quantum Rabi model, leading to the Jaynes-Cummings\nHamiltonian. While the RWA is often very good and incredibly useful to\nunderstand light-matter interactions, there is also growing experimental\nevidence of regimes where it is a bad approximation. Here, we ask and answer a\nharder question: for which experimental parameters is the RWA, although perhaps\nqualitatively adequate, already not good enough to match the demands of\nscalable quantum technology? For example, when is the error at least, and when\nat most, 1\\%? To answer this, we develop rigorous non-perturbative bounds\ntaming the RWA.\n  We find that these bounds not only depend, as expected, on the ratio of the\ncoupling strength and the oscillator frequency, but also on the average number\nof photons in the initial state. This confirms recent experiments on\nphoton-dressed Bloch-Siegert shifts. We argue that with experiments reporting\ncontrollable cavity states with hundreds of photons and with quantum error\ncorrecting codes exploring more and more of Fock space, this state-dependency\nof the RWA is increasingly relevant for the field of quantum computation, and\nour results pave the way towards a better understanding of those experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 19:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

The perpendicularly pressure balanced polarization of NP\nmodes produces an excess of perpendicular pressure over parallel pressure in\nregions where the plasma $\\beta$ is increased. For mode amplitudes $\\delta\nB/B_0 \\gtrsim 0.3$, this excess excites the mirror instability. Particle\nscattering off these micro-scale mirrors frustrates the nonlinear saturation of\ntransit-time damping, ensuring that large-amplitude NP modes continue their\ndecay to small amplitudes. At asymptotically large wavelengths, we predict that\nthe mirror-induced scattering will be large enough to interrupt transit-time\ndamping entirely, isotropizing the pressure perturbations and morphing the\ncollisionless NP mode into the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) entropy mode.

This implies\nthat the parties are not able to extract the information completely via local\noperations and classical communication (LOCC) while it might be possible via\nLOCC when the parties share entanglement. In this work, we consider an\ninformation distribution protocol using orthogonal states for m >= 3 spatially\nseparated parties such that even if any k <= (m-1) parties collaborate still\nthe information cannot be revealed completely. Such a protocol is useful to\nunderstand up to what extent the encoded information remains locked. However,\nif required, the parties can share entanglement and extract the information\ncompletely by LOCC. To make the process resource efficient, it should consume\nless number of entangled states. We show that though the set of states, which\nare locally indistinguishable across every bipartition, are sufficient for the\nabove protocol, they may consume higher number of entangled states when aiming\nfor complete information extraction. We establish this by constructing a class\nof locally indistinguishable sets of orthogonal states which can be employed to\naccomplish the above protocol and these sets consume less number of entangled\nstates, compared to the former sets, for complete information extraction. In\nfact, this difference in the number of required entangled states for complete\ninformation extraction grows linearly with the number of parties. This study\nsheds light on suitable use of local indistinguishability property of quantum\nstates as resource and thus, we demonstrate an efficient way of information\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 20:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 07:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

To achieve this, rapid transit will be required to\nbring crucial cargo. Current missions to Mars take 150 days, which would be too\nlong for emergencies or urgent needs. Therefore, we propose the use of a\ncutting-edge technology that could allow 20-day transit times: laser energy\ndriven light sails. This propulsion method uses a ground-based laser array to\npropel a spacecraft attached to a light sail to high speeds, enabling missions\nthat are much faster than current missions. By utilizing a MATLAB model and a\nlaser propulsion tool, we visualize and determine optimal trajectories and\ndeparture windows for such missions. We discuss and show that these missions\nare possible during specific launch windows in a 27-month timeframe between\n2030-2032, but also have practical challenges. During solar conjunction, such\nmissions are limited by solar proximity, but are possible during all orbital\nphases if the transit time requirement is relaxed. Laser arrays capable of\ngenerating 13 GW are necessary to enable 20-day missions with a 5 kg spacecraft\nnear conjunction, but only 0.55 GW is required near opposition. The spacecraft\nhas a hyperbolic trajectory and is not bound to the solar system during\ntransit. A challenge for future work involves the deceleration and entry,\ndescent, and landing phases. A laser array on Mars could address some of this\nchallenge. Spacecraft mass capabilities can be increased by optimizing the\nlaser array and sail properties. Multiple spacecraft may be boosted\nsimultaneously to carry more payload at lower costs. This work is intended to\nserve as proof of concept that lightweight payloads can be transported via such\nmissions. Technologies enabling 20-day missions can be developed in the future\nand be applied to advanced missions to celestial bodies and interstellar space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 23:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

Usually, the methodologies used to analyze multivariate time series\nare based on adapting approaches for univariate settings or on assumptions and\nparameters for specific problems. A different strategy uses complex network to\nobtain an additional and reduced representation of temporal and causal\nproperties of the time series data. Recent strategies involve mapping\nmultivariate time series into high-level network structures, specifically into\nmultiplex networks representing interconnections between contemporary\ntimestamps of different time series components. In this work, we propose a new\nmapping method that takes advantage of the entire structure of multilayer\nnetworks.

We provide an\nextensive experimental evaluation, where we explore the proposed topological\nmeasures, showing that the inter-layer edges based on cross-horizontal\nvisibility preserve more information about the time series data after the\nmappings, information that would inevitably be lost using mapping methods that\nresult in single-layer and multiplex structures.

Poisoning attacks could be designed to influence the\nmodel's suggestions at run time for chosen contexts, such as inducing the model\ninto suggesting insecure code payloads. To achieve this, prior poisoning\nattacks explicitly inject the insecure code payload into the training data,\nmaking the poisoning data detectable by static analysis tools that can remove\nsuch malicious data from the training set. In this work, we demonstrate two\nnovel data poisoning attacks, COVERT and TROJANPUZZLE, that can bypass static\nanalysis by planting malicious poisoning data in out-of-context regions such as\ndocstrings. Our most novel attack, TROJANPUZZLE, goes one step further in\ngenerating less suspicious poisoning data by never including certain\n(suspicious) parts of the payload in the poisoned data, while still inducing a\nmodel that suggests the entire payload when completing code (i.e., outside\ndocstrings). This makes TROJANPUZZLE robust against signature-based\ndataset-cleansing methods that identify and filter out suspicious sequences\nfrom the training data.

Performance and productivity present possibly conflicting objectives:\ntracking accuracy, path speed, and motion uniformity. Industrial robots are\nprogrammed through motion primitives consisting of waypoints connected by\npre-defined motion segments, with specified parameters such as path speed and\nblending zone. The actual executed robot motion depends on the robot joint\nservo controller and joint motion constraints (velocity, acceleration, etc.)\nwhich are largely unknown to the users. Programming a robot to achieve the\ndesired performance today is time-consuming and mostly manual, requiring tuning\na large number of coupled parameters in the motion primitives. The performance\nalso depends on the choice of additional parameters: possible redundant degrees\nof freedom, location of the target curve, and the robot configuration. This\npaper presents a systematic approach to optimize the robot motion primitives\nfor performance. The approach first selects the static parameters, then the\nmotion primitives, and finally iteratively update the waypoints to minimize the\ntracking error. The ultimate performance objective is to maximize the path\nspeed subject to the tracking accuracy and speed uniformity constraints over\nthe entire path. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in\nsimulation for ABB and FANUC robots for two challenging example curves, and\nexperimentally for an ABB robot.

However, the\ndebonding interface between casing/cement or cement/formation has not been\naddressed profoundly. A further investigation should inspect how pressure,\ntemperature, and chemical reaction affect the micro-annuli of casing/cement or\ncement/formation. Also, a mathe-matical model should be established to predict\nthe corrosion rate in geological CO2 storage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 02:00:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 16:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

To cope with the high computation demands of these\napplications, heterogeneous architectures featuring both FPGA and dedicated\nASIC accelerators have emerged as promising platforms. For example, the\nAMD/Xilinx Versal ACAP architecture combines general-purpose CPU cores and\nprogrammable logic with AI Engine processors optimized for AI/ML. With 400\nAIEs, it provides up to 6.4 TFLOPs performance for 32-bit floating-point data.\nHowever, machine learning models often contain both large and small MM\noperations. While large MM operations can be parallelized efficiently across\nmany cores, small MM operations typically cannot. We observe that executing\nsome small MM layers from the BERT natural language processing model on a\nlarge, monolithic MM accelerator in Versal ACAP achieved less than 5% of the\ntheoretical peak performance. Therefore, one key question arises: How can we\ndesign accelerators to fully use the abundant computation resources under\nlimited communication bandwidth for applications with multiple MM layers of\ndiverse sizes? We identify the biggest system throughput bottleneck resulting\nfrom the mismatch of massive computation resources of one monolithic\naccelerator and the various MM layers of small sizes in the application. To\nresolve this problem, we propose the CHARM framework to compose multiple\ndiverse MM accelerator architectures working concurrently towards different\nlayers in one application. We deploy the CHARM framework for four different\napplications, including BERT, ViT, NCF, MLP, on the AMD Versal ACAP VCK190\nevaluation board. Our experiments show that we achieve 1.46 TFLOPs, 1.61\nTFLOPs, 1.74 TFLOPs, and 2.94 TFLOPs inference throughput for BERT, ViT, NCF\nand MLP, which obtain 5.40x, 32.51x, 1.00x and 1.00x throughput gains compared\nto one monolithic accelerator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 02:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

Additionally, severe channel\nfading in high-frequency bands constitutes another crucial issue that limits\nthe practical application of the cell-free network. In order to address the\nabove challenges, we amalgamate the cell-free system with another emerging\ntechnology, namely reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which can provide\nhigh spectrum and energy efficiency with low hardware cost by reshaping the\nwireless propagation environment intelligently. To this end, we formulate a\nweighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem for RIS-assisted cell-free systems\nby jointly optimizing the BS precoding matrix and the RIS reflection\ncoefficient vector.

To understand the role of nature\nversus nurture in sculpting the final (mass) architecture of a system, we apply\nour architecture framework to synthetic planetary systems -- formed via\ncore-accretion -- using the Bern model. General patterns emerge in the\nformation pathways of the four architecture classes. Almost all planetary\nsystems emerging from protoplanetary disks whose initial solid mass was less\nthan one Jupiter mass are similar. Systems emerging from heavier disks may\nbecome mixed, anti-ordered, or ordered. Increasing dynamical interactions\n(planet-planet, planet-disk) tends to shift a system's architecture from mixed\nto anti-ordered to ordered.

This framework allows us to\ncharacterise, quantify, and classify the architecture of an individual\nplanetary system. Our aim in this endeavour is to generate a systematic method\nto study the arrangement and distribution of various planetary quantities\nwithin a single planetary system. We propose that the space of planetary system\narchitectures be partitioned into four classes: similar, mixed, anti-ordered,\nand ordered. We applied our framework to observed and synthetic multi-planetary\nsystems, thereby studying their architectures of mass, radius, density, core\nmass, and the core water mass fraction. We explored the relationships between a\nsystem's (mass) architecture and other properties. Our work suggests that: (a)\nsimilar architectures are the most common outcome of planet formation; (b)\ninternal structure and composition of planets shows a strong link with their\nsystem architecture; (c) most systems inherit their mass architecture from\ntheir core mass architecture; (d) most planets that started inside the ice line\nand formed in-situ are found in systems with a similar architecture; and (e)\nmost anti-ordered systems are expected to be rich in wet planets, while most\nobserved mass ordered systems are expected to have many dry planets. We find,\nin good agreement with theory, that observations are generally biased towards\nthe discovery of systems whose density architectures are similar, mixed, or\nanti-ordered. This study probes novel questions and new parameter spaces for\nunderstanding theory and observations. Future studies may utilise our framework\nto not only constrain the knowledge of individual planets, but also the\nmulti-faceted architecture of an entire planetary system. We also speculate on\nthe role of system architectures in hosting habitable worlds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 04:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

This phenomenal success can be partly attributed\nto DRL encouraging intelligent agents to sufficiently explore the environment\nand collect diverse experiences during the agent training process. Therefore,\nexploration plays a significant role in accessing an optimal policy for DRL.\nDespite recent works making great progress in continuous control tasks,\nexploration in these tasks has remained insufficiently investigated. To\nexplicitly encourage exploration in continuous control tasks, we propose CCEP\n(Centralized Cooperative Exploration Policy), which utilizes underestimation\nand overestimation of value functions to maintain the capacity of exploration.\nCCEP first keeps two value functions initialized with different parameters, and\ngenerates diverse policies with multiple exploration styles from a pair of\nvalue functions. In addition, a centralized policy framework ensures that CCEP\nachieves message delivery between multiple policies, furthermore contributing\nto exploring the environment cooperatively. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that CCEP achieves higher exploration capacity. Empirical analysis\nshows diverse exploration styles in the learned policies by CCEP, reaping\nbenefits in more exploration regions. And this exploration capacity of CCEP\nensures it outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods across multiple\ncontinuous control tasks shown in experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 04:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

The second subnetwork\nfurther has two tightly coupled components, a traditional CNN-based U-Net and a\ngraph U-Net. Cross-network multi-scale feature fusion is performed between\nthese two U-shaped networks to effectively support high-quality vessel\nsegmentation. The entire cascaded network can be trained from end to end. The\ngraph in the second subnetwork is constructed according to a vessel probability\nmap as well as appearance and semantic similarities in the original CT volume.\nTo tackle the challenges caused by the sparsity and anisotropy of vessels, a\nhigher percentage of graph nodes are distributed in areas that potentially\ncontain vessels while a higher percentage of edges follow the orientation of\npotential nearbyvessels.

These\nfluids are often associated with various complex flow phenomena due to the\npresence of non-linear elastic stresses, originating due to the stretching and\nrelaxation phenomena of microstructure (such as polymer molecules in the case\nof a viscoelastic polymer solution) in a deformed flow field. One such\nphenomenon is elastic instability (EI) which emerges due to the interaction\nbetween elastic stresses and streamline curvature present in a flow system at\nsmall values of the Renolds number (ratio of the inertial to that of the\nviscous forces) when the Weissenberg number (ratio of the microstructure\nrelaxation time to that of the rate of flow deformation) exceeds a critical\nvalue. On further increasing this Weissenberg number to higher values, the\nunstable flow field caused due to this elastic instability transits to a more\nchaotic and turbulent-like flow structure called elastic turbulence (ET). Over\nthe last two decades or so, an extensive investigation has been performed on\nthis particular topic in the complex fluids research community. Some excellent\narticles recently present this ET phenomenon's development, understanding, and\nprogress in the literature. This article focuses on the application\nperspectives of this phenomenon. In particular, this article aims to provide a\ncomprehensive review of the investigations conducted so far in the literature\nto demonstrate the potential of these EI and ET phenomena in three main\napplication areas, namely, microfluidic mixing, microscale heat transfer, and\nchemically enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process.

Glitches that directly\noverlap astrophysical signals hinder their detection and worsen parameter\nestimation errors. As the fraction of data occupied by detectable astrophysical\nsignals will be higher in next generation detectors, such problematic overlaps\ncould become more frequent. These adverse effects of glitches can be mitigated\nby estimating and subtracting them out from the data, but their unpredictable\nwaveforms and large morphological diversity pose a challenge. Subtraction of\nglitches using data from auxiliary sensors as predictors works but not for the\nmajority of cases. Thus, there is a need for nonparametric glitch mitigation\nmethods that do not require auxiliary data, work for a large variety of\nglitches, and have minimal effect on astrophysical signals in the case of\noverlaps. In order to cope with the high rate of glitches, it is also desirable\nthat such methods be computationally fast. We show that adaptive spline\nfitting, in which the placement of free knots is optimized to estimate both\nsmooth and non-smooth curves in noisy data, offers a promising approach to\nsatisfying these requirements for broadband short-duration glitches, the type\nthat appear quite frequently.

Code blocks are linear and live in the global namespace; therefore,\nit is hard to develop large projects that require modularization in Jupyter. As\na result, large-code projects are still developed in traditional text files,\nand Jupyter is only used as a surface presentation. We present Codepod, a\nnamespace-aware Jupyter that is suitable for interactive development at scale.\nInstead of linear code blocks, Codepod models code blocks as hierarchical code\npods, and provides a simple yet powerful module system for namespace-aware\nincremental evaluation.

However,\ndeep code models are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks. As source code is\ndiscrete and has to strictly stick to the grammar and semantics constraints,\nthe adversarial attack techniques in other domains are not applicable.\nMoreover, the attack techniques specific to deep code models suffer from the\neffectiveness issue due to the enormous attack space. In this work, we propose\na novel adversarial attack technique (i.e., CODA). Its key idea is to use the\ncode differences between the target input and reference inputs (that have small\ncode differences but different prediction results with the target one) to guide\nthe generation of adversarial examples. It considers both structure differences\nand identifier differences to preserve the original semantics. Hence, the\nattack space can be largely reduced as the one constituted by the two kinds of\ncode differences, and thus the attack process can be largely improved by\ndesigning corresponding equivalent structure transformations and identifier\nrenaming transformations. Our experiments on 10 deep code models (i.e., two pre\ntrained models with five code-based tasks) demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of CODA, the naturalness of its generated examples, and its\ncapability of defending against attacks after adversarial fine-tuning. For\nexample, CODA improves the state-of-the-art techniques (i.e., CARROT and ALERT)\nby 79.25% and 72.20% on average in terms of the attack success rate,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 08:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

The\naccretion spot alone is not enough to explain the shallow photospheric IR lines\nin accreting systems, suggesting that another source is contributing to the\nveiling in the NIR. The inner disk is often quoted as the additional emitting\nsource meant to explain the IR veiling. In this work, we aim to measure and\ndiscuss the NIR veiling to understand its origins and variability timescale,\nusing a sample of 14 accreting stars observed with the CFHT/SPIRou\nspectrograph, within the framework of the SPIRou Legacy Survey. We compared the\nveiling measurements with accretion and inner disk diagnostics. The measured\nveiling grows from the Y to the K band for most of the targets in our sample.\nThe IR veiling agrees with NIR emission excess obtained using photometric data.\nHowever, we also find a linear correlation between the veiling and the\naccretion properties of the system, showing that accretion contributes to the\ninner disk heating and, consequently, to the inner disk emission excess. We\nalso show a connection between the NIR veiling and the system's inclination\nwith respect to our line of sight. This is probably due to the reduction of the\nvisible part of the inner disk edge, where the NIR emission excess is expected\nto arise, as the inclination of the system increases. The NIR veiling appears\nvariable on a timescale of a day, showing the night-by-night dynamics of the\noptical veiling variability. In the long term, the mean NIR veiling seems to be\nstable for most of the targets on timescales of a month to a few years.\nHowever, during occasional episodes of high accretion, which affect the\nsystem's dynamic, the veiling also seems to be much more prominent at such\ntimes, as we found in the case of the target RU Lup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 10:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

To explain this gradient, several studies have investigated\nthe radial transport of trace species and the effect of icelines on the\nabundance profiles of solids and vapors formed in the disk. However, these\nmodels only consider the presence of solids in the forms of pure condensates or\namorphous ice during the evolution of the protosolar nebula. They usually\nneglect the possible crystallization and destabilization of clathrates, along\nwith the resulting interplay between the abundance of water and those of these\ncrystalline forms. This study is aimed at pushing this kind of investigation\nfurther by considering all possible solid phases together in the protosolar\nnebula: pure condensates, amorphous ice, and clathrates. To this end, we used a\none-dimensional (1D) protoplanetary disk model coupled with modules describing\nthe evolution of trace species in the vapor phase, as well as the dynamics of\ndust and pebbles. Eleven key species are considered here, including H$_2$O, CO,\nCO$_2$, CH$_4$, H$_2$S, N$_2$, NH$_3$, Ar, Kr, Xe, and PH$_3$. Two sets of\ninitial conditions are explored for the protosolar nebula. In a first scenario,\nthe disk is initially filled with icy grains in the forms of pure condensates.\nIn this case, we show that clathrates can crystallize and form enrichment peaks\nup to about ten times the initial abundances at their crystallization lines. In\na second scenario, the volatiles were delivered to the protosolar nebula in the\nforms of amorphous grains. In this case, the presence of clathrates is not\npossible because there is no available crystalline water ice in their formation\nregion. Enrichment peaks of pure condensates also form beyond the snowline up\nto about seven times the initial abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 12:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

To address the above\nissues, we propose a hashing algorithm based on auto-encoders for multi-view\nbinary clustering, which dynamically learns affinity graphs with low-rank\nconstraints and adopts collaboratively learning between auto-encoders and\naffinity graphs to learn a unified binary code, called Graph-Collaborated\nAuto-Encoder Hashing for Multi-view Binary Clustering (GCAE).

The VoLTE/NR protocols rely on\nthe security features of the underlying LTE/5G network to protect users'\nprivacy such that nobody can monitor calls and learn details about call times,\nduration, and direction. In this paper, we introduce a new privacy attack which\nenables adversaries to analyse encrypted LTE/5G traffic and recover any\nVoLTE/NR call details. We achieve this by implementing a novel mobile-relay\nadversary which is able to remain undetected by using an improved physical\nlayer parameter guessing procedure. This adversary facilitates the recovery of\nencrypted configuration messages exchanged between victim devices and the\nmobile network. We further propose an identity mapping method which enables our\nmobile-relay adversary to link a victim's network identifiers to the phone\nnumber efficiently, requiring a single VoLTE protocol message.

The general idea of multi-task learning is designing kinds of global\nparameter sharing mechanism and task-specific feature extractor to improve the\nperformance of all tasks. However, challenge still remains in balancing the\ntrade-off of various tasks since model performance is sensitive to the\nrelationships between them. Less correlated or even conflict tasks will\ndeteriorate the performance by introducing unhelpful or negative information.\nTherefore, it is important to efficiently exploit and learn fine-grained\nfeature representation corresponding to each task. In this paper, we propose an\nAdaptive Pattern Extraction Multi-task (APEM) framework, which is adaptive and\nflexible for large-scale industrial application. APEM is able to fully utilize\nthe feature information by learning the interactions between the input feature\nfields and extracted corresponding tasks-specific information. We first\nintroduce a DeepAuto Group Transformer module to automatically and efficiently\nenhance the feature expressivity with a modified set attention mechanism and a\nSqueeze-and-Excitation operation.

Most recently, code models were revealed\nto be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. A code model that is backdoor-attacked\ncan behave normally on clean examples but will produce pre-defined malicious\noutputs on examples injected with triggers that activate the backdoors.\nExisting backdoor attacks on code models use unstealthy and easy-to-detect\ntriggers. This paper aims to investigate the vulnerability of code models with\nstealthy backdoor attacks. To this end, we propose AFRAIDOOR (Adversarial\nFeature as Adaptive Backdoor). AFRAIDOOR achieves stealthiness by leveraging\nadversarial perturbations to inject adaptive triggers into different inputs. We\nevaluate AFRAIDOOR on three widely adopted code models (CodeBERT, PLBART and\nCodeT5) and two downstream tasks (code summarization and method name\nprediction). We find that around 85% of adaptive triggers in AFRAIDOOR bypass\nthe detection in the defense process. By contrast, only less than 12% of the\ntriggers from previous work bypass the defense. When the defense method is not\napplied, both AFRAIDOOR and baselines have almost perfect attack success rates.\nHowever, once a defense is applied, the success rates of baselines decrease\ndramatically to 10.47% and 12.06%, while the success rate of AFRAIDOOR are\n77.05% and 92.98% on the two tasks. Our finding exposes security weaknesses in\ncode models under stealthy backdoor attacks and shows that the state-of-the-art\ndefense method cannot provide sufficient protection. We call for more research\nefforts in understanding security threats to code models and developing more\neffective countermeasures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 13:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

For example, if a student\nis predicted to fail a course, then counterfactual explanations can provide the\nstudent with alternate ways so that they would be predicted to pass. The\napplications are many. However, CEs are currently generated from machine\nlearning models that do not necessarily take into account the true causal\nstructure in the data. By doing this, bias can be introduced into the CE\nquantities. I propose in this study to test the CEs using Judea Pearl's method\nof computing counterfactuals which has thus far, surprisingly, not been seen in\nthe counterfactual explanation (CE) literature. I furthermore evaluate these\nCEs on three different causal structures to show how the true underlying causal\nstructure affects the CEs that are generated. This study presented a method of\nevaluating CEs using Pearl's method and it showed, (although using a limited\nsample size), that thirty percent of the CEs conflicted with those computed by\nPearl's method.

This\nseparation is found whenever there is more than one sender, and also when there\nis just a single sender who has a shared phase reference with the receiver.\nExperimentally, we demonstrate such quantum advantage in single-particle\ncommunication by implementing a multi-port interferometer with messages being\nencoded along the different trajectories. Specifically, we consider a\ntwo-sender communication protocol built by a three-port optical interferometer.\nIn this scenario, the rate sum achievable with a classical particle is upper\nbounded by one bit, while we experimentally observe a rate sum of\n$1.0152\\pm0.0034$ bits in the quantum setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 14:01:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

Individual nanoflares are difficult to detect with the\ncurrent generation instruments; however, their presence can be inferred through\nindirect techniques such as a Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis.\nHere we employ this technique to investigate the possibility of nanoflare\nheating of the quiet corona during the minimum of solar cycle 24. During this\nminimum, active regions (ARs) were absent on the solar-disk for extended\nperiods. In the absence of ARs, X-ray bright points (XBP) are the dominant\ncontributor to disk-integrated X-rays. We estimate the DEM of the XBPs using\nobservations from the Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) onboard the Chandrayaan-2\norbiter and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamic\nObservatory. XBPs consist of small-scale loops associated with bipolar magnetic\nfields. We simulate such XBP loops using the EBTEL hydrodynamic code. The\nlengths and magnetic field strengths of these loops are obtained through a\npotential field extrapolation of the photospheric magnetogram. Each loop is\nassumed to be heated by random nanoflares having an energy that depends on the\nloop properties. The composite nanoflare energy distribution for all the loops\nhas a power-law slope close to -2.5. The simulation output is then used to\nobtain the integrated DEM. It agrees remarkably well with the observed DEM at\ntemperatures above 1 MK, suggesting that the nanoflare distribution, as\npredicted by our model, can explain the XBP heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 14:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a novel\nsystem (SAIDS) that predicts the sentiment, sarcasm and dialect of Arabic\ntweets. SAIDS uses its prediction of sarcasm and dialect as known information\nto predict the sentiment. It uses MARBERT as a language model to generate\nsentence embedding, then passes it to the sarcasm and dialect models, and then\nthe outputs of the three models are concatenated and passed to the sentiment\nanalysis model.

These ultrashort bursts of light are\ngenerated when a strong laser field interacts with matter and high-order\nharmonics of the driving source are produced. In this work, we propose a way to\ntwist attosecond pulse trains. In our scheme, each of the attosecond pulses in\nthe train has a well-defined linear polarization, but with a different\npolarization angle between them. To achieve this goal, we consider an infrared\npulse with a particular polarization state, called amplitude polarization. This\nkind of pulse was experimentally synthesized in previous works.

However, our\nunderstanding of such aortic expansion in cTBAD remains weak. In the present\npaper, we propose to use numerical simulations to study the role of growth and\nremodeling (G\\&R) in aneurysmal dilatation after cTBAD. We set up a 3D\nfinite-element model of G\\&R for aortic dissection within an open-source code.\nConstitutive equations, momentum balance equations, and equations related to\nthe mechanobiology of the artery were formulated based on the homogenized\nconstrained mixture theory. The model was first applied to idealized aortic\ngeometries with cylindrical and toric shapes to demonstrate its feasibility and\nefficiency. The model was then applied to a patient-specific aortic segment to\nshow its potential in more relevant and complex patient-specific clinical\napplications. It was found that the G\\&R tends to naturally trigger the\naneurysmal dilatation after dissection, in order to restore its tensional\nequilibrium. Our results indicated that the value of the gain parameter,\nrelated to collagen G\\&R, plays an important role in the stability of aortic\nexpansion after cTBAD. A small gain parameter will induce an excessive\naneurysmal degeneration whilst a large gain parameter helps to recover a\nstabilized state of the artery after dissection. Finally, it was found that\nother mechanobiology-related parameters, such as the circumferential length of\nthe dissection, as well as the pressure in the false lumen, may also be\ndeterminant for the stability of aneurysmal dilatation after cTBAD. Both a wide\ntear and an elevated false lumen pressure favor an unstable development of\naortic expansion after cTBAD. As future work, the present model will be\nvalidated through predictions of aneurysmal dilatation in patient-specific\nclinical cases, in comparison with datasets followed over a significant period\nof time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 14:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

Instead of discrete turn-taking between a human and robot,\nLILAC splits agency between the human and robot: language is an input to a\nlearned model that produces a meaningful, low-dimensional control space that\nthe human can use to guide the robot. Each real-time correction refines the\nhuman's control space, enabling precise, extended behaviors - with the added\nbenefit of requiring only a handful of demonstrations to learn. We evaluate our\napproach via a user study where users work with a Franka Emika Panda\nmanipulator to complete complex manipulation tasks. Compared to existing\nlearned baselines covering both open-loop instruction following and single-turn\nshared autonomy, we show that our corrections-aware approach obtains higher\ntask completion rates, and is subjectively preferred by users because of its\nreliability, precision, and ease of use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 15:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

Mainstream 3D object detectors often build dense feature maps, where\nthe cost is quadratic to the perception range, making them hardly scale up to\nthe long-range settings. To enable efficient long-range detection, we first\npropose a fully sparse object detector termed FSD. FSD is built upon the\ngeneral sparse voxel encoder and a novel sparse instance recognition (SIR)\nmodule. SIR groups the points into instances and applies highly-efficient\ninstance-wise feature extraction. The instance-wise grouping sidesteps the\nissue of the center feature missing, which hinders the design of the fully\nsparse architecture. To further enjoy the benefit of fully sparse\ncharacteristic, we leverage temporal information to remove data redundancy and\npropose a super sparse detector named FSD++. FSD++ first generates residual\npoints, which indicate the point changes between consecutive frames. The\nresidual points, along with a few previous foreground points, form the super\nsparse input data, greatly reducing data redundancy and computational overhead.\nWe comprehensively analyze our method on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset,\nand state-of-the-art performance is reported.

Particle filters are used in domains like data\nassimilation, probabilistic programming, neural networkoptimization,\nlocalization and navigation. Particle filters estimate the\nprobabilitydistribution of model states by running a large number of model\ninstances, the so called particles. The ability to handle a very large number\nof particles is critical for high dimensional models.This paper proposes a\nnovel paradigm to run very large ensembles of parallel model instances on\nsupercomputers. The approach combines an elastic and fault tolerant\nrunner/server model minimizing data movementswhile enabling dynamic load\nbalancing. Particle weights are computed locally on each runner andtransmitted\nwhen available to a server that normalizes them, resamples new particles based\non their weight, and redistributes dynamically the work torunners to react to\nload imbalance.

To help people appropriately rely on AI aids, we propose showing\nthem behavior descriptions, details of how AI systems perform on subgroups of\ninstances. We tested the efficacy of behavior descriptions through user studies\nwith 225 participants in three distinct domains: fake review detection,\nsatellite image classification, and bird classification. We found that behavior\ndescriptions can increase human-AI accuracy through two mechanisms: helping\npeople identify AI failures and increasing people's reliance on the AI when it\nis more accurate. These findings highlight the importance of people's mental\nmodels in human-AI collaboration and show that informing people of high-level\nAI behaviors can significantly improve AI-assisted decision making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 00:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

This binary bias, seen in the ubiquity of pair-wise networks\nand formal operations of two arguments in mathematical models, limits our\ncapacity to faithfully capture irreducible polyadic interactions in\nhigher-order systems. A paradigmatic example of a higher-order interaction is\nthe Borromean link of three interlocking rings. In this paper we propose a\nmathematical framework via hypergraphs and hypermatrix algebras that allows to\nformalize such forms of higher-order bonding and connectivity in a parsimonious\nway. Our framework builds on and extends current techniques in higher-order\nnetworks -- still mostly rooted in binary structures such as adjacency matrices\n-- and incorporates recent developments in higher-arity structures to\narticulate the compositional behavior of adjacency hypermatrices. Irreducible\nhigher-order interactions turn out to be a widespread occurrence across natural\nsciences and socio-cultural knowledge representation. We demonstrate this by\nreviewing recent results in computer science, physics, chemistry, biology,\necology, social science, and cultural analysis through the conceptual lens of\nirreducible higher-order interactions. We further speculate that the general\nphenomenon of emergence in complex systems may be characterized by\nspatio-temporal discrepancies of interaction arity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 22:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

Researchers and\npractitioners extensively proposed various neural network architectures for\nsearching and modeling feature interactions. However, we observe that different\ndatasets favor different neural network architectures and feature interaction\ntypes, suggesting that different feature interaction learning methods may have\ntheir own unique advantages. Inspired by this observation, we propose\nAdaEnsemble: a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts (SparseMoE) architecture that\ncan leverage the strengths of heterogeneous feature interaction experts and\nadaptively learns the routing to a sparse combination of experts for each\nexample, allowing us to build a dynamic hierarchy of the feature interactions\nof different types and orders. To further improve the prediction accuracy and\ninference efficiency, we incorporate the dynamic early exiting mechanism for\nfeature interaction depth selection. The AdaEnsemble can adaptively choose the\nfeature interaction depth and find the corresponding SparseMoE stacking layer\nto exit and compute prediction from. Therefore, our proposed architecture\ninherits the advantages of the exponential combinations of sparsely gated\nexperts within SparseMoE layers and further dynamically selects the optimal\nfeature interaction depth without executing deeper layers. We implement the\nproposed AdaEnsemble and evaluate its performance on real-world datasets.\nExtensive experiment results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of\nAdaEnsemble over state-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 12:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}

Central in the\nconstruction of VISM is an interface separating the solute and the solvent.\nCompared with sharp-interface models, diffuse-interface VISMs have shown some\ninitial success in improving the efficiency and accuracy of the solvation\nenergy estimation of biomolecules. However, on a theoretical level, several\nquestions concerning the diffuse-interface VISMs remain open: (1) What is the\nphysical meaning of a diffuse interface? (2) What energy does a\ndiffuse-interface VISM predict? This work aims at addressing the above\nquestions. Our research reveals the relationship between a diffuse interface\ndefinition and the random movement of the solute-solvent interface due to\nthermal fluctuations. Then, we use this diffuse interface setting to construct\na VISM that is capable of capturing ensemble average solvation energy, which is\nan experimentally observable quantity in solvation processes. The\nwell-posedness and variational analysis of the model are further investigated.\nOur work is the first step towards estimating ensemble average solvation energy\nby using diffuse-interface VISMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 01:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-23"}
