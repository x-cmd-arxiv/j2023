The HTSS formulation exposes deep networks to a larger and\npreviously unexplored aggregation of information that can potentially enhance\nsemantic segmentation in three directions: i) performance: increased\nsegmentation metrics on seen datasets, ii) generalization: improved\nsegmentation metrics on unseen datasets, and iii) knowledgeability: increased\nnumber of recognizable semantic concepts.

Recent works have demonstrated that\nvariants of local learning can lead to efficient training of modern deep\nnetworks.

While cooling down the\nsample, a characteristic temperature T* is obtained from the R(T) at which\nsuperconducting fluctuations start to appear. The upturn in R(T) above T*\ncorresponds to weak localization (WL) and/or EEI. By the temperature and field\ndependences of the observed resistance, we show that the upturn in R(T)\noriginates mainly from EEI with a negligible contribution from WL. Further, we\nhave used the modified Larkins electron-electron attraction strength\nbeta(T/Tc), containing a field induced pair breaking parameter, in the\nMaki-Thompson (MT) superconducting fluctuation term. Here, the temperature\ndependence of the beta(T/Tc) obtained from the magnetoresistance analysis shows\na diverging behavior close to Tc and it remains almost constant at higher\ntemperature within the limit of ln(T/Tc) < 1. Interestingly, the variation of\nbeta(T/Tc) on the reduced temperature (T/Tc) offers a common trend which has\nbeen closely followed by all the concerned samples presented in this study.\nFinally, the temperature dependence of inverse phase scattering time , as\nobtained from the magnetoresistance analysis, clearly shows two different\nregimes; the first one close to Tc follows the Ginzburg-Landau relaxation rate\n, whereas, the second one at high temperature varies almost linearly with\ntemperature indicating the dominance of inelastic electron-electron scattering\nfor the dephasing mechanism.

In the WPE algorithm, a prediction delay is required to reduce the\ncorrelation between the prediction signals and the direct component in the\nreference microphone signal. In compact arrays with closely-spaced microphones,\nthe prediction delay is often chosen microphone-independent. In acoustic sensor\nnetworks with spatially distributed microphones, large\ntime-differences-of-arrival (TDOAs) of the speech source between the reference\nmicrophone and other microphones typically occur. Hence, when using a\nmicrophone-independent prediction delay the reference and prediction signals\nmay still be significantly correlated, leading to distortion in the\ndereverberated output signal. In order to decorrelate the signals, in this\npaper we propose to apply TDOA compensation with respect to the reference\nmicrophone, resulting in microphone-dependent prediction delays for the WPE\nalgorithm. We consider both optimal TDOA compensation using crossband filtering\nin the short-time Fourier transform domain as well as band-to-band and integer\ndelay approximations. Simulation results for different reverberation times\nusing oracle as well as estimated TDOAs clearly show the benefit of using\nmicrophone-dependent prediction delays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 16:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

A neutral host infrastructure, where a third-party\ncompany provides RAN services to mobile operators through network\nvirtualization and slicing techniques, is seen as a promising solution to\ndecrease these costs. Currently, however, neutral host providers lack automated\nand virtualized pipelines for onboarding new tenants and to provide elastic and\non-demand allocation of resources matching operator's demands. To address this\ngap, this paper presents NeutRAN, a zero-touch framework based on the O-RAN\narchitecture to support applications on neutral hosts and automatic operator\nonboarding, that enables multiple tenants to access a shared RAN\ninfrastructure. The NeutRAN architecture builds upon two key components: (i) an\noptimization engine to guarantee coverage and meet quality of service\nrequirements while accounting for the limited amount of shared spectrum and RAN\nnodes, and (ii) a fully virtualized and automated infrastructure that converts\nthe output of the optimization engine into deployable micro-services to be\nexecuted at RAN nodes and cell sites. NeutRAN was prototyped on an OpenShift\ncluster and on a programmable testbed with 4 base stations and 10 users from 3\ndifferent tenants. We evaluated the benefits of NeutRAN compared to a\ntraditional license-based RAN where each tenant has dedicated physical and\nspectrum resources. Experimental results show that NeutRAN can deploy a fully\noperational neutral host-based cellular network in around 10 seconds, and it\nincreases the cumulative network throughput by 2.18x and the per-user average\nthroughput by 1.73x with shared spectrum blocks of 30 MHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 16:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

While identifiability of\nthe causal estimand in such models has been obtained from a range of\nassumptions, it is widely and implicitly assumed that the underlying\nassumptions are satisfied for all time periods both pre- and post-intervention.\nThis is a strong assumption, as synthetic control models can only be learned in\npre-intervention period. In this paper we address this challenge, and prove\nidentifiability can be obtained without the need for this assumption, by\nshowing it follows from the principle of invariant causal mechanisms. Moreover,\nfor the first time, we formulate and study synthetic control models in Pearl's\nstructural causal model framework.

Since the duration of a BBH merger in\nband ($\\sim\\!1~{\\rm s}$) is much shorter than the expected separation between\nneighboring mergers ($\\sim\\!10^3~{\\rm s}$), the observed signal will be\n\"popcorn-like\" or intermittent with duty cycles of order $10^{-3}$. However,\nthe standard cross-correlation search for stochastic GWBs currently performed\nby the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration is based on a continuous-Gaussian signal\nmodel, which does not take into account the intermittent nature of the\nbackground. The latter is better described by a Gaussian mixture-model, which\nincludes a duty cycle parameter that quantifies the degree of intermittence.\nBuilding on an earlier paper by Drasco and Flanagan, we propose a\nstochastic-signal-based search for intermittent GWBs. For such signals, this\nsearch performs better than the standard continuous cross-correlation search.\nWe present results of our stochastic-signal-based approach for intermittent\nGWBs applied to simulated data for some simple models, and compare its\nperformance to the other search methods, both in terms of detection and signal\ncharacterization. Additional testing on more realistic simulated data sets,\ne.g., consisting of astrophysically-motivated BBH merger signals injected into\ncolored detector noise containing noise transients, will be needed before this\nmethod can be applied with confidence on real gravitational-wave data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 17:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

This, however, is typically associated with high channel\nacquisition/beam sweeping overhead that scales with the number of antennas.\nMachine and deep learning represent promising approaches to overcome these\nchallenges thanks to their powerful ability to learn from prior observations\nand side information. Training machine and deep learning models, however,\nrequires large-scale datasets that are expensive to collect in deployed\nsystems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel direction that utilizes\ndigital replicas of the physical world to reduce or even eliminate the MIMO\nchannel acquisition overhead. In the proposed digital twin aided communication,\n3D models that approximate the real-world communication environment are\nconstructed and accurate ray-tracing is utilized to simulate the site-specific\nchannels. These channels can then be used to aid various communication tasks.\nFurther, we propose to use machine learning to approximate the digital replicas\nand reduce the ray tracing computational cost. To evaluate the proposed digital\ntwin based approach, we conduct a case study focusing on the position-aided\nbeam prediction task. The results show that a learning model trained solely\nwith the data generated by the digital replica can achieve relatively good\nperformance on the real-world data. Moreover, a small number of real-world data\npoints can quickly achieve near-optimal performance, overcoming the modeling\nmismatches between the physical and digital worlds and significantly reducing\nthe data acquisition overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 18:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

In this\npaper, we reanalyze this problem by considering some massive neutrinos which\nare mixed with light neutrinos but they either participate incoherently or are\ndecoupled in the production and detection processes. In fact, neutrinos whose\nmasses are larger than the upper bound on the mass uncertainty to be compatible\nwith the coherence conditions (we will see it is about 1 keV) must be treated\nincoherently. Very heavy neutrinos whose masses are much larger than the\nneutrino energy in the neutrino production process are decoupled. Under these\nconditions, the created neutrino-antineutrino state as well as the states of\ndetected neutrino and antineutrino is mixed. We see that the oscillation\npattern cannot be observed for incoherent neutrinos and the standard\noscillation pattern is recovered if the light neutrino masses are ignored in\nthe production and detection processes.

We aim to tackle the vehicle optimization problem from the\nlast mile logistic scenario application, with a perspective from the classical\nand quantum approaches, and providing a solution which combines both, also\nknown as hybrid solution. Finally, we provide the results of the analysis and\nproposal for the consideration of applications in a near term business case\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 18:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

At high redshifts star formation occurs in a series of short\nand intense bursts, while at low redshifts star formation proceeds at a steady\nrate with a transition from one mode to another at times ranging from 3 to 7\nGyr ago for different galaxies. We analyse how the mode of star formation\naffects iron and alpha-element abundance. We find that the early bursty regime\nimprints a measurable pattern in stellar elemental abundances in the form of a\n\"sideways chevron\" shape on the [Fe/H] - [O/Fe] plane and the scatter in [O/Fe]\nat a given stellar age is higher than when a galaxy is in the steady regime.\nThat suggests that the evolution of [O/Fe] scatter with age provides an\nestimate of the end of the bursty phase. We investigate the feasibility of\nobserving of this effect by adding mock observational errors to a simulated\nstellar survey and find that the transition between the bursty and steady phase\nshould be detectable in the Milky Way, although larger observational\nuncertainties make the transition shallower.

This minute tumor-to-normal area ratio in a MIL bag inhibits the\nattention mechanism from properly weighting the areas corresponding to minor\ntumor lesions. To overcome this challenge, we propose salient instance\ninference MIL (SiiMIL), a weakly-supervised MIL model for WSI classification.\nOur method initially learns representations of normal WSIs, and it then\ncompares the normal WSIs representations with all the input patches to infer\nthe salient instances of the input WSI. Finally, it employs attention-based MIL\nto perform the slide-level classification based on the selected patches of the\nWSI. Our experiments imply that SiiMIL can accurately identify tumor instances,\nwhich could only take up less than 1% of a WSI, so that the ratio of tumor to\nnormal instances within a bag can increase by two to four times.

We describe the use of the time\ndelays between multiple SN images as a way to measure cosmological distances\nand thus constrain cosmological parameters, particularly the Hubble constant,\nwhose value is currently under heated debates. New methods for measuring the\ntime delays in lensed SNe have been developed, and the sample of lensed SNe\nfrom the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is\nexpected to provide competitive cosmological constraints. Lensed SNe are also\npowerful astrophysical probes. We review the usage of lensed SNe to constrain\nSN progenitors, acquire high-z SN spectra through lensing magnifications, infer\nSN sizes via microlensing, and measure properties of dust in galaxies. The\ncurrent challenge in the field is the rarity and difficulty in finding lensed\nSNe. We describe various methods and ongoing efforts to find these spectacular\nexplosions, forecast the properties of the expected sample of lensed SNe from\nupcoming surveys particularly the LSST, and summarize the observational\nfollow-up requirements to enable the various scientific studies.

In the quantum setting, it is also natural to consider\na different notion of complexity, namely the complexity of physically preparing\na certain quantum state. We study the relation between two such state\ncomplexity classes: statePSPACE, which contains states that can be generated by\nspace-uniform polynomial-space quantum circuits, and stateQIP, which contains\nstates that a polynomial-time quantum verifier can generate by interacting with\nan all-powerful untrusted quantum prover. The latter class was recently\nintroduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), who proved that statePSPACE\n$\\subseteq$ stateQIP.\n  Our main result is the reverse inclusion, stateQIP $\\subseteq$ statePSPACE,\nthereby establishing equality of the two classes and providing a natural\nstate-complexity analogue to the celebrated QIP = PSPACE theorem of Jain, et\nal. (J. ACM 2011). To prove this, we develop a polynomial-space quantum\nalgorithm for solving a large class of exponentially large \"PSPACE-computable\"\nsemidefinite programs (SDPs), which also prepares an optimiser encoded in a\nquantum state. Our SDP solver relies on recent block-encoding techniques from\nquantum algorithms, demonstrating that these techniques are also useful for\ncomplexity theory.\n  Using similar techniques, we also show that optimal prover strategies for\ngeneral quantum interactive protocols can be implemented in quantum polynomial\nspace. We prove this by studying an algorithmic version of Uhlmann's theorem\nand establishing an upper bound on the complexity of implementing Uhlmann\ntransformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 19:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 17:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

Measurements of the occultation of an exoplanet at visible\nwavelengths allow us to determine the reflective properties of a planetary\natmosphere. The observed occultation depth can be translated into a geometric\nalbedo. This in turn aids in characterising the structure and composition of an\natmosphere by providing additional information on the wavelength-dependent\nreflective qualities of the aerosols in the atmosphere.\n  Aims. Our aim is to provide a precise measurement of the geometric albedo of\nthe gas giant HD 189733b by measuring the occultation depth in the broad\noptical bandpass of CHEOPS (350 - 1100 nm).\n  Methods. We analysed 13 observations of the occultation of HD 189733b\nperformed by CHEOPS utilising the Python package PyCHEOPS. The resulting\noccultation depth is then used to infer the geometric albedo accounting for the\ncontribution of thermal emission from the planet. We also aid the analysis by\nrefining the transit parameters combining observations made by the TESS and\nCHEOPS space telescopes.\n  Results. We report the detection of an $24.7 \\pm 4.5$ ppm occultation in the\nCHEOPS observations. This occultation depth corresponds to a geometric albedo\nof $0.076 \\pm 0.016$. Our measurement is consistent with models assuming the\natmosphere of the planet to be cloud-free at the scattering level and\nabsorption in the CHEOPS band to be dominated by the resonant Na doublet.\nTaking into account previous optical-light occultation observations obtained\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope, both measurements combined are consistent with\na super-stellar Na elemental abundance in the dayside atmosphere of HD 189733b.\nWe further constrain the planetary Bond albedo to between 0.013 and 0.42 at\n3$\\sigma$ confidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 19:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 10:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

We use ratios of these lines ([Ne V]/[Ne III]\n= Ne53 and [Ne III]/[O II]), which are closely separated in wavelength, and\nmitigates effects of dust attenuation and uncertainties in flux calibration. We\nmake predictions from photoionization models constructed from Cloudy that use a\nbroad range of stellar populations and black hole accretion models to explore\nthe sensitivity of these line ratios to changes in the ionizing spectrum. We\ncompare our models to observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and James\nWebb Space Telescope of galaxies with strong high-ionization emission lines at\nz ~ 0, z ~ 2, and z ~ 7. We show that the Ne53 ratio can separate galaxies with\nionization from 'normal' stellar populations from those with AGN and even\n'exotic' Population III models. We introduce new selection methods to identify\ngalaxies with photoionization driven by Population III stars or\nintermediate-mass black hole accretion disks that could be identified in\nupcoming high-redshift spectroscopic surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 19:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

The Dirac\nelectrons couple to the spins through a spin-dependent effective Zeeman field.\nThe out-of-plane effective Zeeman field therefore serves as a Dirac mass that\ngaps the electronic spectrum. Once a spin is flipped, it creates a surrounding\ndomain in which the sign of the Dirac mass is opposite to that of the rest of\nthe sample. Therefore, an electronic bound state appears on the domain wall, as\npredicted by Jackiw and Rebbi. However, in a quantum magnet, a localized spin\nflip does not produce an eigenstate. Instead, the eigenstates correspond to\ndelocalized spin waves (magnons). As in the case of the single flipped spin,\nthe delocalized magnon also binds an in-gap electronic state. We name this\nexcitation a `Jackiw-Rebbi-Magnon' (JRM) and study its signature in the dynamic\nspin susceptibility. When the sample is tunnel-coupled to an electronic\nreservoir, a magnon produced in a system without any electrons hybridizes with\na JRM (which binds a single electron), producing magnon-JRM polaritons.

We find that\ngenetic diversity is highly non-monotone in the selection strength and, in\ncontrast with the common intuition, our model predicts that genetic diversity\nis typically higher in the strong selection regime. This apparent paradox is\nresolved by observing that a higher selection strength increases the absolute\nfitness of the wave, but typically generate lower relative fitness between\nindividuals within the wave. These findings entail that inferring the magnitude\nof natural selection from genetic data may raise some serious conceptual\nissues.\n  Along the way, we uncover a new phase transition in front propagation.\nNamely, we show that the transition from weak to strong selection can be\nreformulated in terms of a transition from fully-pulled to semi-pulled waves.\nThis transition is the pulled analog to the semi-pushed to fully-pushed regimes\nobserved in noisy-FKPP travelling waves in the presence of Allee effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 19:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

Hence, a novel\ndeep reinforcement learning agent (DRL), integrated with an automated\nhyperparameter selection feature, is proposed in this study for the real-time\nscheduling of a multi-energy system coupled with CDRT.

We then trained four (4) SAC agents, equivalent to the\nnumber of considered case studies, using optimised hyperparameter values and\ndeployed them in real time for evaluation. The results show that the proposed\nDRL agent can meet the prosumers' multi-energy demand and schedule the CDRT\nenergy demand economically without specified constraints violation.

While recent observations from\nstacking large numbers of Cosmic Web filaments have yielded statistically\nsignificant detections, direct measurements of single objects remain scarce.\nThe lack of such a sample currently prevents a robust analysis of the cosmic\nbaryon content composed of the hot WHIM, which could help solve the\ncosmological missing baryons problem. To improve the search for the missing\nbaryons, we used the EAGLE simulation. Our aim is to understand the metal\nenrichment and distribution of highly ionised metals in the Cosmic Web. We\ndetected the filaments by applying the Bisous formalism to the simulated\ngalaxies, and characterised the spatial distributions as well as mass and\nvolume fractions of the filamentary oxygen and OVII. We then constructed OVII\ncolumn density maps and determined their detectability with Athena X-IFU.\nHowever, the oxygen and OVII number densities drop fast beyond the virial radii\nof haloes, falling below detectable levels at 700 kpc. Thus, only ~1% of the\nfilament volumes are filled with OVII at detectable densities. This\nnon-homogeneous distribution of the OVII complicates its usage for tracing the\nmissing baryons. Instead, OVII forms narrow envelopes around haloes. This\nlocalised nature results in a low chance (10-20% per sight line) of detecting\nintergalactic OVII with Athena X-IFU within the SDSS catalogue of filaments.\nWith future filament samples from the 4MOST survey, the chances increase up to\na level of ~50%. Nonetheless, based on EAGLE results, this would not be enough\nto conclusively solve the missing baryon problem, as it would be limited to a\nfew times the virial radii of haloes. Fortunately, the volumes around haloes\nare dense in hot WHIM, and tracing it could reduce the content of baryons still\nmissing by ~25%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 20:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Used in the context of\nsecurity properties such as noninterference, symbolic execution is precise when\nlooking for counterexample pairs of traces when insecure information flows are\nfound, however it is sound only up to a bound thus it does not allow to prove\nthe correctness of programs with executions beyond the given bound.

Full-waveform inversion\n(FWI)-based image reconstruction methods account for the relevant wave physics\nto produce high spatial resolution images of the acoustic properties of the\nbreast tissues. A practical USCT design employs a circular ring-array comprised\nof elevation-focused ultrasonic transducers, and volumentric imaging is\nachieved by translating the ring-array orthogonally to the imaging plane. In\ncommonly deployed slice-by-slice (SBS) reconstruction approaches, the\nthree-dimensional (3D) volume is reconstructed by stacking together\ntwo-dimensional (2D) images reconstructed for each position of the ring-array.\nA limitation of the SBS reconstruction approach is that it does not account for\n3D wave propagation physics and the focusing properties of the transducers,\nwhich can result in significant image artifacts and inaccuracies. To perform 3D\nimage reconstruction when elevation-focused transducers are employed, a\nnumerical description of the focusing properties of the transducers should be\nincluded in the forward model. To address this, a 3D computational model of an\nelevation-focused transducer is developed to enable 3D FWI-based reconstruction\nmethods to be deployed in ring-array-based USCT. The focusing is achieved by\napplying a spatially varying temporal delay to the ultrasound pulse (emitter\nmode) and recorded signal (receiver mode).

This critical gap may be\naddressed through the development of \"Lifelong Learning\" systems that are\ncapable of 1) Continuous Learning, 2) Transfer and Adaptation, and 3)\nScalability. Unfortunately, efforts to improve these capabilities are typically\ntreated as distinct areas of research that are assessed independently, without\nregard to the impact of each separate capability on other aspects of the\nsystem. We instead propose a holistic approach, using a suite of metrics and an\nevaluation framework to assess Lifelong Learning in a principled way that is\nagnostic to specific domains or system techniques. Through five case studies,\nwe show that this suite of metrics can inform the development of varied and\ncomplex Lifelong Learning systems. We highlight how the proposed suite of\nmetrics quantifies performance trade-offs present during Lifelong Learning\nsystem development - both the widely discussed Stability-Plasticity dilemma and\nthe newly proposed relationship between Sample Efficient and Robust Learning.\nFurther, we make recommendations for the formulation and use of metrics to\nguide the continuing development of Lifelong Learning systems and assess their\nprogress in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 21:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

In this paper, we study the ramifications of allowing the sensor\nattack injections to be unbounded and correlated. These malicious sensor\nattacks may bypass the conventional attack-detection methods and compromise the\ncooperative performance and even stability of the distributed networked MAS.\nMoreover, the attackers may gain access to the actuation computing channels and\nmanipulate the control input commands. To this end, we consider the resilient\ncontainment control problem of general linear heterogeneous MAS in the face of\ncorrelated and unbounded sensor attacks, as well as general unbounded actuator\nattacks. We propose an attack-resilient control framework to guarantee the\nuniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical systems and preserve\nthe bounded containment performance.

By using the Higgs strahlung process,\nit is possible to explore up to the region of tens of TeV in terms of the\nKaluza-Klein (KK) mass. We also show that the sign of the bulk mass of a lepton\nmultiplet in the GHU model can be determined by examining the deviation of the\nleft-right symmetry of the $e^-e^+\\to Zh$ process from the SM. The\ncontributions to the cross sections of the $e^-e^+\\to \\nu\\bar{\\nu}h$ and\n$e^-e^+\\to e^-e^+h$ processes via the $Z'$ and $W'$ bosons are relatively small\ncompared to that for $e^-e^+\\to Zh$ at least for $\\sqrt{s}\\leq 1$ TeV. As is\nthe same as in the SM, the $e^-e^+\\to\\nu\\bar{\\nu}h$ process gives a main\ncontribution to the single Higgs boson production processes for\n$\\sqrt{s}\\gtrsim 500$ GeV, but large deviations from the SM are only observed\non energy scales close to the masses of the first KK gauge bosons or higher.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 00:31:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 23:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Thanks to above\ninnovations, MV-Adapter can achieve on-par or better performance than standard\nfine-tuning with negligible parameters overhead. Notably, on five widely used\nVTR benchmarks (MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, DiDemo, and ActivityNet), MV-Adapter\nconsistently outperforms various competing methods in V2T/T2V tasks with large\nmargins.

However, most existing BEV solutions either suffer from\nmodest performance or require considerable resources to execute on-vehicle\ninference. This paper proposes a simple yet effective framework, termed\nFast-BEV, which is capable of performing real-time BEV perception on the\non-vehicle chips. Towards this goal, we first empirically find that the BEV\nrepresentation can be sufficiently powerful without expensive view\ntransformation or depth representation. Starting from M2BEV baseline, we\nfurther introduce (1) a strong data augmentation strategy for both image and\nBEV space to avoid over-fitting (2) a multi-frame feature fusion mechanism to\nleverage the temporal information (3) an optimized deployment-friendly view\ntransformation to speed up the inference.

In this paper we aim to explore the way tidal heating affects the\nstellar structure. We used the TIDES code, which solves the equations of motion\nof the three-dimensional (3D) grid of volume elements that conform multiple\nlayers of a rotating binary star to obtain an instantaneous value for the\nangular velocity, $\\omega''$, as a function of position in the presence of\ngravitational, centrifugal, Coriolis, gas pressure, and viscous forces. The\nreleased energy, $\\dot{E,}$ was computed using a prescription for turbulent\nviscosity that depends on the instantaneous velocity gradients. The $\\dot{E}$\nvalues for each radius were injected into a MESA stellar structure calculation.\nThe method is illustrated for a 1.0+0.8 M$_\\odot$ binary system, with an\norbital period of $P$=1.44d and departures from synchronous rotation of 5% and\n10%. We find that heated models have a larger radius and surface luminosity, a\nsmaller surface convection zone, and lower nuclear reaction rates than the\nequivalent standard stellar models, and their evolutionary tracks extend to\nhigher temperatures. The magnitude of these effects depends on the amount of\ninjected energy, which, for a fixed set of stellar, rotation and orbital\nparameters, depends on the perturbed star's density structure and turbulent\nviscosity. Tidal heating offers a possible alternative for describing phenomena\nsuch as bloated or overluminous binary components, age discrepancies, and\naspherical mass ejection, as well as the extended main sequence turnoff in\nclusters. However, establishing its actual role requires 3D stellar structure\nmodels commensurate with the nonspherically symmetric properties of tidal\nperturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 04:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Using\ndensity functional theory and Boltzmann transport equation calculations for bcc\nFe, hcp Co, and bcc FeCo alloys, we show that UAMR can be accounted by the\nmagnetization-dependent spin-orbit interactions (SOI): Magnetization-dependent\nSOI modifies electron energy bands that, in turn, changes resistance. A\nphenomenological model reveals the intrinsic connection between SOI and\norder-parameters. Such a mechanism is confirmed by the strong biaxial stain\neffect on UAMR.

Hence, we reformulate\nthe problem to perform the Bayesian estimation exclusively on the NN predicting\nseismic velocity, while the NN predicting travel time is used only for\ndeterministic travel time calculations, with the help of the adjoint method.\nFurthermore, we perform BNN by introducing a function-space Stein variational\ngradient descent (SVGD), which performs particle-based variational inference in\nthe space of the function predicted by the NN (i.e., seismic velocity), instead\nof in the traditional weight space.

The temperature dependence of the $\\eta/s$ has a\nminimum only at low average densities of $\\rho<0.3\\rho_0$. The present study\nserves as a rigorous baseline calculation of the $\\eta/s$ in nuclear systems\nwith clusters, and helps to understand the relation between the shear viscosity\nand the nuclear phase diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 07:11:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 00:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Under MGIN channel, classical\ncommunication signal schemes and corresponding detection methods usually can\nnot achieve desirable performance as they are optimized with respect to WGN.\nMoreover, as the widely adopted IN model has no analytical and general\nclosed-form expression of probability density function (PDF), it is extremely\nhard to obtain optimal communication signal and corresponding detection schemes\nbased on classical stochastic signal processing theory. To circumvent these\ndifficulties, we propose a data-driven end-to-end framework to address the\ncommunication signal design and detection under MGIN channel in this paper. In\nthis proposed framework, a channel noise simulator (CNS) is elaborately\ndesigned based on an improved generative adversarial net (GAN) to simulate the\nMGIN without requirement of any analytical PDF.

While different approaches are developed to find contrasts; these\nmethods do not all deal with mutability and attainability constraints.\n  In this work, we present a novel approach to locally contrast the prediction\nof any classifier. Our Contrastive Entropy-based explanation method, CEnt,\napproximates a model locally by a decision tree to compute entropy information\nof different feature splits. A graph, G, is then built where contrast nodes are\nfound through a one-to-many shortest path search. Contrastive examples are\ngenerated from the shortest path to reflect feature splits that alter model\ndecisions while maintaining lower entropy. We perform local sampling on\nmanifold-like distances computed by variational auto-encoders to reflect data\ndensity. CEnt is the first non-gradient-based contrastive method generating\ndiverse counterfactuals that do not necessarily exist in the training data\nwhile satisfying immutability (ex. race) and semi-immutability (ex. age can\nonly change in an increasing direction). Empirical evaluation on four\nreal-world numerical datasets demonstrates the ability of CEnt in generating\ncounterfactuals that achieve better proximity rates than existing methods\nwithout compromising latency, feasibility, and attainability. We further extend\nCEnt to imagery data to derive visually appealing and useful contrasts between\nclass labels on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. Finally, we show how CEnt can\nserve as a tool to detect vulnerabilities of textual classifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 08:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

Most previous works mainly focus on long-term temporal\nrelation modeling based on high-level spatial representations, without\nconsidering the crucial low-level spatial features and short-term temporal\nrelations. Actually, the former feature could bring rich local semantic\ninformation, and the latter feature could represent motion characteristics of\nadjacent frames, respectively. In this paper, we propose SloshNet, a new\nframework that revisits the spatial and temporal modeling for few-shot action\nrecognition in a finer manner. First, to exploit the low-level spatial\nfeatures, we design a feature fusion architecture search module to\nautomatically search for the best combination of the low-level and high-level\nspatial features. Next, inspired by the recent transformer, we introduce a\nlong-term temporal modeling module to model the global temporal relations based\non the extracted spatial appearance features. Meanwhile, we design another\nshort-term temporal modeling module to encode the motion characteristics\nbetween adjacent frame representations. After that, the final predictions can\nbe obtained by feeding the embedded rich spatial-temporal features to a common\nframe-level class prototype matcher.

The fundamental challenge in\ntraffic flow prediction is to effectively model the complex spatial-temporal\ndependencies in traffic data. Spatial-temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN)\nmodels have emerged as one of the most promising methods to solve this problem.\nHowever, GNN-based models have three major limitations for traffic prediction:\ni) Most methods model spatial dependencies in a static manner, which limits the\nability to learn dynamic urban traffic patterns; ii) Most methods only consider\nshort-range spatial information and are unable to capture long-range spatial\ndependencies; iii) These methods ignore the fact that the propagation of\ntraffic conditions between locations has a time delay in traffic systems. To\nthis end, we propose a novel Propagation Delay-aware dynamic long-range\ntransFormer, namely PDFormer, for accurate traffic flow prediction.\nSpecifically, we design a spatial self-attention module to capture the dynamic\nspatial dependencies.

A vesicle is\nrepresented by a dynamically triangulated membrane, while the adhesive active\nparticles are modelled as active Brownian particles (ABPs) that interact with\nthe membrane via the Lennard-Jones potential. Phase diagrams of dynamic vesicle\nshapes as a function of ABP activity and particle volume fraction inside the\nvesicle are constructed for different strengths of adhesive interactions.

By this means, color manipulation can\nbe conducted by altering the color components of the palette directly. To\nsupport efficient palette-based editing, the color of each layer needs to be as\nrepresentative as possible. In the end, the problem is formulated as an\noptimization problem, where the layers and their blending weights are jointly\noptimized with the NeRF itself. Extensive experiments show that our\njointly-optimized layer decomposition can be used against multiple backbones\nand produce photo-realistic recolored novel-view renderings. We demonstrate\nthat RecolorNeRF outperforms baseline methods both quantitatively and\nqualitatively for color editing even in complex real-world scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 09:18:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 15:53:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Reasoning techniques for concurrent programs, like\nOwicki-Gries-style proof calculi, have to be based on such a semantics, and\nhence need to be freshly developed for every new memory model. Recently, a more\nuniform approach to reasoning has been proposed which builds correctness proofs\non the basis of a number of core axioms. This allows to prove program\ncorrectness independent of memory models, and transfers proofs to specific\nmemory models by showing these to instantiate all axioms required in a proof.\nThe axiomatisation is built on the notion of thread views as first class\nelements in the semantics. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of\nthis form of axiomatic reasoning to the Partial Store Order (PSO) memory model.\nAs the standard semantics for PSO is not based on views, we first of all\nprovide a view-based semantics for PSO and prove it to coincide with the\nstandard semantics. We then show the new view-based semantics to satisfy all\nbut one axiom. The missing axiom refers to message-passing (MP) abilities of\nmemory models, which PSO does not guarantee. As a consequence, only proofs\nwithout usage of the MP axiom are transferable to PSO. We illustrate the\nreasoning technique by proving correctness of a litmus test employing a fence\nto ensure message passing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 09:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

These models are able to\ncapture sophisticated patterns and structures in the data, and can generate\nsamples that are highly diverse and representative of the underlying\ndistribution. However, one of the main limitations of diffusion models is the\ncomplexity of sample generation, since a large number of inference timesteps is\nrequired to faithfully capture the data distribution. In this paper, we present\nMMD-DDM, a novel method for fast sampling of diffusion models. Our approach is\nbased on the idea of using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to finetune the\nlearned distribution with a given budget of timesteps. This allows the\nfinetuned model to significantly improve the speed-quality trade-off, by\nsubstantially increasing fidelity in inference regimes with few steps or,\nequivalently, by reducing the required number of steps to reach a target\nfidelity, thus paving the way for a more practical adoption of diffusion models\nin a wide range of applications.

The hierarchical HODMD\n(h-HODMD) performs a reduction of the model order, followed by the iterative\nselection of the best reconstructed variables thus creating clusters of\nfeatures which can eventually be associated with distinct dynamical phenomena.\nFirstly, h-HODMD is combined with different data pre-processing techniques to\nassess their influence on the algorithm in terms of reconstruction error.\nAfterwards, the algorithm is applied to analyze three different databases\nobtained from numerical simulations of a non-premixed co-flow methane flame,\nand its performance are compared with the standard HODMD in terms of the\nachievable degree of reduction as well as in terms of reconstruction error.\nResults show that h-HODMD improves the reconstruction for all the variables\nwhen compared to the standard HODMD algorithm. This condition is achieved\nthanks to the iterative variables' clustering: finding dedicated modes for a\nspecific group of features does in fact lead to a better reconstruction of the\ndynamics with respect to the case when the same (global) modes are used to\nreconstruct the entire set of variables.

In fact, it allows for the possibility to formulate inexpensive\nreduced dynamical models for predicting flames liftoff, as well as for\nidentifying the formation of local extinction and blowout conditions, to\nformulate accurate reduced models to describe the formation of pollutants in\naviation, and for control purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 10:13:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 05:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

However, to\nidentify the necessary investments in energy conversion and storage\ntechnologies to leverage demand response (DR) potentials, companies need to\nassess the value of flexibility. Therefore, this study quantifies the\nflexibility value of a production company's MES by optimizing the synthesis,\ndesign, and operation of a decarbonizing MES considering self-consumption\noptimization, peak shaving, and integrated DR based on hourly prices and carbon\nemission factors (CEFs). The detailed case study of a beverage company in\nnorthern Germany considers vehicle-to-X of powered industrial trucks,\npower-to-heat on multiple temperatures, wind turbines, photovoltaic systems,\nand energy storage systems (thermal energy, electricity, and hydrogen).

The results also suggest\nthat a net-zero operational carbon emission MES requires flexibility, which, in\nan economic case, is provided by a combination of different flexible\ntechnologies and storage systems that complement each other.

It has been\nhypothesized that the time scale of cortical activity encoding each linguistic\nunit is commensurate with the time scale of that linguistic unit in speech.\nEvidence for the hypothesis originally comes from studies using the\nfrequency-tagging paradigm that presents each linguistic unit at a constant\nrate, and more recently extends to studies on natural speech. For natural\nspeech, it is sometimes assumed that neural encoding of different levels of\nlinguistic units is captured by the neural response tracking speech envelope in\ndifferent frequency bands (e.g., around 1 Hz for phrases, around 2 Hz for\nwords, and around 4 Hz for syllables). Here, we analyze the coherence between\nspeech envelope and idealized responses, each of which tracks a single level of\nlinguistic unit. Four units, i.e., phones, syllables, words, and sentences, are\nseparately considered.

The time profiles were then fitted with a linear combination of\nGaussians to decompose the time profile. From the Gaussian decomposition, key\ncharacteristics such as the periodicity, full width at half maximum (FWHM),\ntime evolution, and amplitude can be derived.\n  Results: We present the outcome of applying this method to four M and X\nGOES-class flares from the first year of Solar Orbiter science operations.

We implement a filament finder\nalgorithm which allows the detection of bright elongated structures in\npolarized intensity maps. We analyse the sky at 23 and 30 GHz as observed\nrespectively by WMAP and Planck. We identify 19 filaments, 13 of which have\nbeen previously observed. For each filament, we study the polarization\nfraction, finding values typically larger than for the areas outside the\nfilaments, excluding the Galactic plane, and a fraction of about 30% is reached\nin two filaments. We study the polarization spectral indices of the filaments,\nand find a spectral index consistent with the values found in previous analysis\n(about -3.1) for more diffuse regions. Decomposing the polarization signals\ninto the $E$ and $B$ families, we find that most of the filaments are detected\nin $P_E$, but not in $P_B$. We then focus on understanding the statistical\nproperties of the diffuse regions of the synchrotron emission at 23 GHz. Using\nMinkowski functionals and tensors, we analyse the non-Gaussianity and\nstatistical isotropy of the polarized intensity maps. For a sky coverage\ncorresponding to 80% of the fainter emission, and on scales smaller than 6\ndegrees ($\\ell > 30$), the deviations from Gaussianity and isotropy are\nsignificantly higher than 3$\\sigma$. The level of deviation decreases for\nsmaller scales, however, it remains significantly high for the lowest analised\nscale ($\\sim 1.5^\\circ$). When 60% sky coverage is analysed, we find that the\ndeviations never exceed 3$\\sigma$.

Supplying that information\nhas two main challenges: how to represent this information in a form that is\nfeedable to the GANs and how to effectively feed the representation to the GAN.\nTo address these issues, we developed a suitable representation of CNN\narchitectures by cumulatively averaging intermediate interpretation maps. We\nalso propose two alternative approaches to feed the representations to the GAN\nand to choose an effective training strategy. Our approach learned the general\naspects of CNNs and was agnostic to datasets and CNN architectures. The study\nincludes both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and compares the\nproposed GANs with state-of-the-art approaches. We found that the initial\nlayers of CNNs and final layers are equally crucial for interpreting CNNs upon\ninterpreting the proposed GAN.

However, the existing infrared and visible image fusion\nmethods rarely explore how to handle multi-spectral/channel data directly and\nachieve high color fidelity. This paper addresses the above issue by proposing\na novel method with diffusion models, termed as Dif-Fusion, to generate the\ndistribution of the multi-channel input data, which increases the ability of\nmulti-source information aggregation and the fidelity of colors. In specific,\ninstead of converting multi-channel images into single-channel data in existing\nfusion methods, we create the multi-channel data distribution with a denoising\nnetwork in a latent space with forward and reverse diffusion process. Then, we\nuse the the denoising network to extract the multi-channel diffusion features\nwith both visible and infrared information. Finally, we feed the multi-channel\ndiffusion features to the multi-channel fusion module to directly generate the\nthree-channel fused image. To retain the texture and intensity information, we\npropose multi-channel gradient loss and intensity loss. Along with the current\nevaluation metrics for measuring texture and intensity fidelity, we introduce a\nnew evaluation metric to quantify color fidelity. Extensive experiments\nindicate that our method is more effective than other state-of-the-art image\nfusion methods, especially in color fidelity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 13:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

To\naddress this gap, we combined an empirical expression (Bernhardt law) to\ndescribe the ISE with ML to develop a framework that incorporates the symbolic\nlaw representing the domain reasoning in ML, namely Symbolic Reasoning-Informed\nML Procedure (SRIMP).

The method is based on projection onto a block\nrational Krylov subspace, with two key contributions with respect to the\nstate-of-the-art. First, we show how to maintain the last pole equal to\ninfinity throughout the iteration, by means of pole reodering. This allows for\na cheap evaluation of the true residual at every step. Second, we extend the\nconvergence analysis in [Beckermann B., An error analysis for rational Galerkin\nprojection applied to the Sylvester equation, SINUM, 2011] to the block case.\nThis extension allows to link the convergence with the problem of minimizing\nthe norm of a small rational matrix over the spectra or field-of-values of the\ninvolved matrices. This is in contrast with the non-block case, where the\nminimum problem is scalar, instead of matrix-valued. Replacing the norm of the\nobjective function with an easier to evaluate function yields several adaptive\npole selection strategies, providing a theoretical analysis for known\nheuristics, as well as effective novel techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 14:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

The spectropolarimetry at +3 d\nshows increasing polarisation degree P towards the redder wavelengths and\nexhibits signs of axial symmetry, but at +29 d P=0 throughout the spectrum\nimplying that the photosphere of SN 2017gci evolved from a slightly aspherical\nconfiguration to a more spherical one in the first month post-peak. However, an\nincrease of P to 0.5% at +55 d accompanied by a different orientation of the\naxial symmetry compared to +3 d implies the presence of additional sources of\npolarisation at this phase. The increase in polarisation is possibly caused by\ninteraction with circumstellar matter as already suggested by a knee in the\nlight curve and a possible detection of broad Ha emission. We also analysed the\nsample of all 16 SLSNe-I with polarimetry to date. The data taken during the\nearly spectroscopic phase show consistently low P indicating spherical\nphotospheres. No clear relation between the polarimetry and spectral phase was\nseen when the spectra resemble Type Ic SNe during the photospheric and nebular\nphases.

It is highly challenging to resolve this competition with quantitative\nnumerics for the group of quasi-two-dimensional materials such as the cuprates.\nThis is the case even for the simplified minimal models of these materials, the\ndoped 2D Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, where clusters of\nsufficient size to determine the phase in the thermodynamic limit can be\nhard-to-impossible to treat in practice. The present work shows how\nquasi-one-dimensional systems, 2D and 3D arrays of weakly coupled 1D correlated\nelectrons, are much more amenable to resolve the competition between SC and\ninsulating orders on an equal footing using matrix-product states (MPS).

Focusing on basic model systems, 3D\narrays of negative-U Hubbard chains with additional nearest-neighbor\ninteraction V, we show that despite the MF component of the MPS+MF technique we\ncan reproduce the expected coexistence of SC and charge-density wave at V=0 for\ndensity n=1.

This problem arises in many areas of\nradio astronomy, such as in the study of galaxy clusters, which may host\nMpc-scale diffuse synchrotron sources in the form of radio halos. In clusters\nwhere no radio halos are detected, owing to intrinsic absence of emission or\nextrinsic (instrumental and/or observational) effects, it is possible to\ndetermine upper limits. We consider a sample of Planck galaxy clusters from the\nSecond Data Release of the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2) where no\nradio halos are detected. We use this sample to test the capabilities of LOFAR\nto recover diffuse extended emission and derive upper limits. Through the\ninjection technique, we simulate radio halos with various surface brightness\nprofiles. We then predict the corresponding visibilities and image them along\nwith the real visibilities. This method allows us to test the fraction of flux\ndensity losses owing to inadequate uv-coverage and obtain thresholds at which\nthe mock emission becomes undetectable by visual inspection. The dense\nuv-coverage of LOFAR at short spacings allows to recover $\\gtrsim90\\%$ of the\nflux density of targets with sizes up to $\\sim 15'$. We find a relation that\nprovides upper limits based on the image noise and extent (in terms of number\nof beams) of the mock halo. This relation can be safely adopted to obtain upper\nlimits without injecting when artifacts introduced by the subtraction of the\ndiscrete sources are negligible in the central region of the cluster.\nOtherwise, the injection process and visual inspection of the images are\nnecessary to determine more reliable limits. Through these methods, we obtain\nupper limits for 75 clusters to be exploited in ongoing statistical studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 15:24:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 11:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Our\ndesign is a remarkably good fit for efficient inference on large images due to\nnegligible computational overhead over the closed-set baseline.

The pandemic's seriousness made people vocal\non social media, especially on microblogs such as Twitter. Researchers have\nbeen collecting and sharing large-scale datasets of COVID-19 tweets since the\nearly days of the outbreak. Sharing raw Twitter data with third parties is\nrestricted; users need to hydrate tweet identifiers in a public dataset to\nre-create the dataset locally. Large-scale datasets that include original\ntweets, retweets, quotes, and replies have tweets in billions which takes\nmonths to hydrate. The existing datasets carry issues related to proportion and\nredundancy. We report that more than 500 million tweet identifiers point to\ndeleted or protected tweets. In order to address these issues, this paper\nintroduces an enriched global billion-scale English-language COVID-19 tweets\ndataset, BillionCOV, that contains 1.4 billion tweets originating from 240\ncountries and territories between October 2019 and April 2022. Importantly,\nBillionCOV facilitates researchers to filter tweet identifiers for efficient\nhydration. This paper discusses associated methods to fetch raw Twitter data\nfor a set of tweet identifiers, presents multiple tweets' distributions to\nprovide an overview of BillionCOV, and finally, reviews the dataset's potential\nuse cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 20:11:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 00:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

While these models were\noriginally designed with a UNet backbone, they may also potentially benefit\nfrom the incorporation of vision transformer techniques. However, we discovered\nthat simply combining these two approaches resulted in subpar performance. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel transformer-based conditional UNet framework, as\nwell as a new Spectrum-Space Transformer (SS-Former) to model the interaction\nbetween noise and semantic features. This architectural improvement leads to a\nnew diffusion-based medical image segmentation method called MedSegDiff-V2,\nwhich significantly improves the performance of MedSegDiff. We have verified\nthe effectiveness of MedSegDiff-V2 on eighteen organs of five segmentation\ndatasets with different image modalities. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat MedSegDiff-V2 outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a\nconsiderable margin, further proving the generalizability and effectiveness of\nthe proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 03:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

It is\npossible that a tree terminates without all the variables self-contradicting\nthemselves. In this case the pertaining formula is still a tautology, but not a\ntruth-relevant tautology.

The study explores the scheme of band\nengineering of ST12-Ge by inducing process-stress into it as a function of the\ngrowth temperature and film thickness. In the present work, ST12-Ge films are\ngrown at 180 C - 250 C to obtain thicknesses of ~4.5-7.5 nm, which possess\nextremely good thermal stability up to a temperature of ~350 C. Micro-Raman\nstudy shows the stress induced in such ST12-Ge films to be compressive in\nnature and vary in the range of ~0.5-7.5 GPa. The measured direct band gap is\nobserved to vary within 0.688 eV to 0.711 eV for such stresses, and four\nindirect band gaps are obtained to be 0.583 eV, 0.614-0.628 eV, 0.622-0.63 eV\nand 0.623-0.632 eV, accordingly. The corresponding band structures for\nunstrained and strained ST12-Ge are calculated by performing DFT simulation,\nwhich shows that a compressive stress transforms the fundamental band gap at\nM-G valley from indirect to direct one. Henceforth, the possible route of\nstrain induced band engineering in ST12-Ge is explored by analyzing all the\ntransitions in strained and unstrained band structures along with\nsubstantiation of the experimental results and theoretical calculations. The\ninvestigation shows that unstrained ST12-Ge is a natural n-type semiconductor\nwhich transforms into p-type upon incorporation of a compressive stress of ~5\nGPa, with the in-plane electron effective mass components at M-G band edge to\nbe ~0.09 me. Therefore, such band engineered ST12-Ge exhibits superior mobility\nalong with its thermal stability and compatibility with Si, which can have\npotential applications to develop high-speed MOS devices for advanced CMOS\ntechnology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 11:20:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 10:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Small deficits in movement are often the first sign\nof an underlying neurological problem. The objective of this research is to\ndevelop a new end-to-end, deep learning-based system, Rapid-Motion-Track (RMT)\nthat can track the fastest human movement accurately when webcams or laptop\ncameras are used.\n  Materials and Methods We applied RMT to finger tapping, a well-validated test\nof motor control that is one of the most challenging human motions to track\nwith computer vision due to the small keypoints of digits and the high\nvelocities that are generated. We recorded 160 finger tapping assessments\nsimultaneously with a standard 2D laptop camera (30 frames/sec) and a\nhigh-speed wearable sensor-based 3D motion tracking system (250 frames/sec).\nRMT and a range of DLC models were applied to the video data with tapping\nfrequencies up to 8Hz to extract movement features.\n  Results The movement features (e.g. speed, rhythm, variance) identified with\nthe new RMT system exhibited very high concurrent validity with the\ngold-standard measurements (97.3\\% of RMT measures were within +/-0.5Hz of the\nOptotrak measures), and outperformed DLC and other advanced computer vision\ntools (around 88.2\\% of DLC measures were within +/-0.5Hz of the Optotrak\nmeasures). RMT also accurately tracked a range of other rapid human movements\nsuch as foot tapping, head turning and sit-to -stand movements.\n  Conclusion: With the ubiquity of video technology in smart devices, the RMT\nmethod holds potential to transform access and accuracy of human movement\nassessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 22:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}
