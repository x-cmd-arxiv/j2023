We consider wireless networks with mobile agents that aim to\nlocalize themselves by performing pairwise measurements amongst agents and\nexchanging their location information. Belief propagation (BP) is a\nstate-of-the-art Bayesian method for CL. In CL, particle-based implementations\nof BP often are employed that can cope with non-linear measurement models and\nstate dynamics. However, particle-based BP algorithms are known to suffer from\nparticle degeneracy in large and dense networks of mobile agents with\nhigh-dimensional states.\n  This paper derives the messages of BP for CL by means of particle flow,\nleading to the development of a distributed particle-based message-passing\nalgorithm which avoids particle degeneracy. Our combined particle flow-based BP\napproach allows the calculation of highly accurate proposal distributions for\nagent states with a minimal number of particles. It outperforms conventional\nparticle-based BP algorithms in terms of accuracy and runtime. Furthermore, we\ncompare the proposed method to a centralized particle flow-based\nimplementation, known as the exact Daum-Huang filter, and to sigma point BP in\nterms of position accuracy, runtime, and memory requirement versus the network\nsize.

The low-mass cTTs DK Tau is\nsuspected of being among them. It is also an excellent subject to investigate\nthe interaction between stellar magnetic fields and material accreting from the\ncircumstellar disk, as it presents clear signatures of accretion. The goal of\nthis paper is to study DK Tau's average line-of-sight magnetic field (Blos) in\nboth photospheric absorption lines and emission lines linked to accretion,\nusing spectropolarimetric observations, as well as to examine inconsistencies\nregarding its rotation axis. We used data collected with the ESPaDOnS and\nNARVAL spectropolarimeters, probing two distinct epochs (2010 and 2012). We\nfirst determined the stellar parameters, such as effective temperature and v\nsin i. Next, we removed the effect of veiling from the spectra, then obtained\nleast-squares deconvolution profiles of the absorption lines, before\ndetermining the Blos. We also investigated emission lines, the 587.6 nm HeI\nline and the CaII infrared triplet, as tracers of the magnetic fields present\nin the accretion shocks. We find that DK Tau experiences accretion onto a\nmagnetic pole at an angle of about 30 degrees from the pole of its rotation\naxis, with a positive field at the base of the accretion funnels. In 2010 we\nfind a magnetic field of up to 1.77kG, and in 2012 up to 1.99kG. Additionally,\nusing our derived values of period, v sin i and stellar radius, we find a value\nof 58 degrees (+18)(-11) for the inclination of the stellar rotation axis,\nwhich is significantly different from the outer disk axis inclination of 21\ndegrees given in the literature. We find that DK Tau's outer disk axis is\nlikely misaligned compared to its rotation axis by 37 degrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 16:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

The field coefficients are evaluated using a modal Green's function\nwhich can be evaluated using well-known recursions for the Legendre function of\nthe second kind, and whose derivatives can be found recursively using the\nLaplace equation in cylindrical coordinates. The principal difference between\nthe cylindrical and Cartesian problems is the lack of translation invariance in\nthe evaluation of local interactions, leading to an increase in computational\neffort for the axisymmetric domain. Results are presented for solution accuracy\nand convergence and for computation time compared to direct evaluation. The\nmethod is found to converge well, with ten digit accuracy being achieved for\nthe test cases presented.

Unfortunately,\nautomatically analyzing screen recordings presents serious challenges, due to\ntheir graphical nature, compared to other types of (textual) artifacts. To\naddress these challenges, this paper introduces V2S+, an automated approach for\ntranslating video recordings of Android app usages into replayable scenarios.\nV2S+ is based primarily on computer vision techniques and adapts recent\nsolutions for object detection and image classification to detect and classify\nuser gestures captured in a video, and convert these into a replayable test\nscenario. Given that V2S+ takes a computer vision-based approach, it is\napplicable to both hybrid and native Android applications.

A model trained on this\nsmaller distilled dataset can attain comparable performance to a model trained\non the original training dataset. However, the existing dataset distillation\ntechniques mainly aim at achieving the best trade-off between resource usage\nefficiency and model utility. The security risks stemming from them have not\nbeen explored. This study performs the first backdoor attack against the models\ntrained on the data distilled by dataset distillation models in the image\ndomain. Concretely, we inject triggers into the synthetic data during the\ndistillation procedure rather than during the model training stage, where all\nprevious attacks are performed. We propose two types of backdoor attacks,\nnamely NAIVEATTACK and DOORPING. NAIVEATTACK simply adds triggers to the raw\ndata at the initial distillation phase, while DOORPING iteratively updates the\ntriggers during the entire distillation procedure. We conduct extensive\nevaluations on multiple datasets, architectures, and dataset distillation\ntechniques. Empirical evaluation shows that NAIVEATTACK achieves decent attack\nsuccess rate (ASR) scores in some cases, while DOORPING reaches higher ASR\nscores (close to 1.0) in all cases. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive\nablation study to analyze the factors that may affect the attack performance.\nFinally, we evaluate multiple defense mechanisms against our backdoor attacks\nand show that our attacks can practically circumvent these defense mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 16:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

The\ninclusion of the clutch state in a model predictive control structure is not\ntrivial because the underlying optimization problem becomes a mixed-integer\nprogram as a consequence. Using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle and a simplified\nvehicle model, it is possible to prove that a drive cycle-dependent critical\npower request Pcrit exists, which uniquely separates the optimal driving mode.\nBased on this result, a learning algorithm is proposed to determine Pcrit\nduring the operation of the vehicle.

We discuss four challenges that impede\nthe use of FAIR knowledge graphs and propose semantic units as their potential\nsolution. Semantic units structure a knowledge graph into identifiable and\nsemantically meaningful subgraphs. Each unit is represented by its own\nresource, instantiates a corresponding semantic unit class, and can be\nimplemented as a FAIR Digital Object and a nanopublication in RDF/OWL and\nproperty graphs. We distinguish statement and compound units as basic\ncategories of semantic units. Statement units represent smallest, independent\npropositions that are semantically meaningful for a human reader. They consist\nof one or more triples and mathematically partition a knowledge graph. We\ndistinguish assertional, contingent (prototypical), and universal statement\nunits as basic types of statement units and propose representational schemes\nand formal semantics for them (including for absence statements, negations, and\ncardinality restrictions) that do not involve blank nodes and that translate\nback to OWL. Compound units, on the other hand, represent semantically\nmeaningful collections of semantic units and we distinguish various types of\ncompound units, representing different levels of representational granularity,\ndifferent types of granularity trees, and different frames of reference.\nSemantic units support making statements about statements, can be used for\ngraph-alignment, subgraph-matching, knowledge graph profiling, and for managing\naccess restrictions to sensitive data. Organizing the graph into semantic units\nsupports the separation of ontological, diagnostic (i.e., referential), and\ndiscursive information, and it also supports the differentiation of multiple\nframes of reference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 17:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

As such,\nunderstanding mobile app bug reports is imperative to drive the continued\nadvancement of report management techniques.

Focusing on this information, we\ncharacterize failure types, identify the modality used to report the\ninformation, and characterize the quality of the information within the\nreports. We find that bugs are reported in a multi-modal fashion, the\nenvironment is not always provided, and S2Rs often contain missing or\nnon-specific enough information.

Global metrics such as betweenness centrality exploit\nthe information of the whole network structure at the cost of a very high\ncomputational complexity. Recent works have shown that combining multiple\nmetrics is a promising strategy to quantify the node's influential ability. Our\nwork is in this line. In this paper, we introduce a multi-attributes centrality\nmeasure called M-Centrality that combines the information on the position of\nthe node in the network with the local information on its nearest neighborhood.\nThe position is measured by the K-shell decomposition, and the degree variation\nin the neighborhood of the node quantifies the influence of the local context.\nIn order to examine the performances of the proposed measure, we conduct\nexperiments on small and large scale real-world networks from the perspectives\nof transmission dynamics and network connectivity. According to the empirical\nresults, the M-Centrality outperforms its alternatives in identifying both\ninfluential spreaders and nodes essential to maintain the network connectivity.\nIn addition, its low computational complexity makes it easily applied to large\nscale networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 17:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

We wish\nto constrain the orbital inclination and the true mass of long-period single\ncompanions. Methods. We used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting\nalgorithm to combine RV measurements with absolute astrometry and, when\navailable, relative astrometry data. Results.

This arrangement enables\nthe ballistic transport of cargo bound to microtubules, both dynein mediated\ntransport towards the MTOC and kinesin mediated transport away from it,\ninterspersed with diffusion for unbound cargo-motor complexes. Spatial and\ntemporal positioning of the MTOC allows for bidirectional transport towards and\naway from specific organelles and locations within the cell and also the\nsequestering and subsequent dispersal of dynein transported cargo. The general\nprinciples governing dynamics, efficiency and tunability of such transport in\nthe MTOC vicinity is not fully understood. To address this, we develop a\none-dimensional model that includes advective transport towards an attractor\n(such as the MTOC), and diffusive transport that allows particles to reach\nabsorbing boundaries (such as cellular membranes). We calculated the mean first\npassage time (MFPT) for cargo to reach the boundaries as a measure of the\neffectiveness of sequestering (large MFPT) and diffusive dispersal (low MFPT).\nThe MFPT experiences a dramatic growth in magnitude, transitioning from a low\nto high MFPT regime (dispersal to sequestering) over a window of cargo\nattachment/detachment rates that is close to in vivo values. We find that\nincreasing either the attachment or detachment rate, while fixing the other,\ncan result in optimal dispersal when the attractor is placed asymmetrically.\nFinally, we describe a rare event regime, where the escape location is\nexponentially sensitive to the attractor positioning. Our results suggest that\nstructures such as the MTOC allow for the sensitive control of the spatial and\ntemporal features of transport and corresponding function under physiological\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 18:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

Exciting these tides comes at the expense of the star's orbital\nenergy, which leads to the naive conclusion that a smaller pericenter (i.e., a\ncloser encounter between the star and SMBH) always yields a more tightly bound\nstar to the SMBH. However, once the pericenter distance is small enough that\nthe star is partially disrupted, morphological asymmetries in the mass lost by\nthe star can yield an \\emph{increase} in the orbital energy of the surviving\ncore, resulting in its ejection -- not capture -- by the SMBH. Using\nsmoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations, we show that the combination of\nthese two effects -- tidal excitation and asymmetric mass loss -- result in a\nmaximum amount of energy lost through tides of $\\sim 2.5\\%$ of the binding\nenergy of the star, which is significantly smaller than the theoretical maximum\nof the total stellar binding energy.

In one\napproach, the wake vortices and bound vortexlets form the nodes of the network\nwith the edges defined by induced velocity. In the other approach, coherent\nstructures (fluid modes) contributing to the kinetic energy of the flow and\nstructural modes contributing to the kinetic energy of the compliant structure\nconstitute the network nodes. The energy transfers between the modes are\nextracted using a perturbation approach. The network structure of the FSI\nsystem is further simplified using the community detection algorithm in the\nvortical approach and by selecting dominant modes in the modal approach.\nNetwork measures are used to reveal the temporal behavior of the individual\nnodes within the simplified FSI system.

We\nconsider a generalization of this problem wherein the agents are placed along\nthe vertices of a graph (corresponding to a social network), and each agent can\nonly experience envy towards its neighbors. Our goal is to minimize the\naggregate envy among the agents as a natural fairness objective, i.e., the sum\nof all pairwise envy values over all edges in a social graph.\n  When agents have identical and evenly-spaced valuations, our problem reduces\nto the well-studied problem of linear arrangements. For identical valuations\nwith possibly uneven spacing, we show a number of deep and surprising ways in\nwhich our setting is a departure from this classical problem. More broadly, we\ncontribute several structural and computational results for various classes of\ngraphs, including NP-hardness results for disjoint unions of paths, cycles,\nstars, or cliques, and fixed-parameter tractable (and, in some cases,\npolynomial-time) algorithms for paths, cycles, stars, cliques, and their\ndisjoint unions.

CapsNets, which were inspired by the\ninformation processing of the human brain, are considered to have more\ninductive bias than CNNs, whereas ViTs are considered to have less inductive\nbias than CNNs. All three classification models have received great attention\nsince they can serve as backbones for various downstream tasks. However, these\nmodels are far from being perfect. As pointed out by the community, there are\ntwo weaknesses in standard Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). One of the limitations\nof DNNs is the lack of explainability. Even though they can achieve or surpass\nhuman expert performance in the image classification task, the DNN-based\ndecisions are difficult to understand. In many real-world applications,\nhowever, individual decisions need to be explained. The other limitation of\nDNNs is adversarial vulnerability. Concretely, the small and imperceptible\nperturbations of inputs can mislead DNNs. The vulnerability of deep neural\nnetworks poses challenges to current visual classification models. The\npotential threats thereof can lead to unacceptable consequences. Besides,\nstudying model adversarial vulnerability can lead to a better understanding of\nthe underlying models. Our research aims to address the two limitations of\nDNNs.

We analyzed spectrophotometry and spectroscopy\ncapturing both impacts using two independent analyses: 1) a least-squares\nsearch over a grid of candidate mineral species to determine the composition of\nimpact residue and 2) a radiative transfer analysis to derive atmospheric\ninformation.

However,\nTarjan-Vishkin is not widely used in practice. We believe the reason is the\nspace-inefficiency (it generates an auxiliary graph with $O(m)$ edges). In\npractice, existing parallel implementations are based on breath-first search\n(BFS). Since BFS has span proportional to the diameter of the graph, existing\nparallel BCC implementations suffer from poor performance on large-diameter\ngraphs and can be even slower than the sequential algorithm on many real-world\ngraphs.\n  We propose the first parallel biconnectivity algorithm (FAST-BCC) that has\noptimal work, polylogarithmic span, and is space-efficient.

In this work we propose a Gaussian Ansatz for the\nstudy of the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum spin systems. Within our\napproach, the quantum spins are mapped onto Holstein-Primakoff bosons, such\nthat a coherent spin state -- chosen as the initial state of the dynamics --\nrepresents the bosonic vacuum. The state of the system is then postulated to\nremain a bosonic Gaussian state at all times, an assumption which is exact when\nthe bosonic Hamiltonian is quadratic; and which is justified in the case of a\nnonlinear Hamiltonian if the boson density remains moderate. We test the\naccuracy of such an Ansatz in the paradigmatic case of the $S=1/2$\ntransverse-field Ising model, in one and two dimensions, initialized in a state\naligned with the applied field. We show that the Gaussian Ansatz, when applied\nto the bosonic Hamiltonian with nonlinearities truncated to quartic order, is\nable to reproduce faithfully the evolution of the state, including its\nrelaxation to the equilibrium regime, for fields larger than the critical field\nfor the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the ground state. In\nparticular the spatio-temporal pattern of correlations reconstructed via the\nGaussian Ansatz reveals the dispersion relation of quasiparticle excitations,\nexhibiting the softening of the excitation gap upon approaching the critical\nfield.

Under the assumption of unit-sum\nvaluation functions, Christodoulou et al. proved that the price of anarchy is\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$ in the one-sided matching problem for both the Random\nPriority and Probabilistic Serial mechanisms. Whilst both Random Priority and\nProbabilistic Serial are ordinal mechanisms, these approximation guarantees are\nthe best possible even for the broader class of cardinal mechanisms.\n  To extend these results to the general setting there are two technical\nobstacles.

We detect the central complex of SMGs at\n2.2\\,GHz with a luminosity of L_2.2=(4.42pm0.56)x10^{25} W/Hz. The ASKAP also\ndetects the source at 888 MHz, constraining the radio spectral index to\nalpha=-1.6pm0.3, consistent with ATCA non-detections at 5.5 and 9GHz, and\nimplying L_1.4(rest)=(2.4pm0.3)x10^{26}W/Hz. This radio luminosity is about 100\ntimes higher than expected from star formation, assuming the usual FIR-radio\ncorrelation, which is a clear indication of an AGN driven by a forming\nbrightest cluster galaxy (BCG). None of the SMGs in SPT2349-56 show signs of\nAGN in any other diagnostics available to us (notably 12CO out to J=16,\nOH163um, CII/IR, and optical spectra), highlighting the radio continuum as a\npowerful probe of obscured AGN in high-z protoclusters. No other significant\nradio detections are found amongst the cluster members, consistent with the\nFIR-radio correlation. We compare these results to field samples of radio\nsources and SMGs, along with the 22 SPT-SMG gravitational lenses also observed\nin the ATCA program, as well as powerful radio galaxies at high redshifts. Our\nresults allow us to better understand the effects of this gas-rich, overdense\nenvironment on early supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth and cluster\nfeedback. We estimate that (3.3pm0.7)x10^{38} W of power are injected into the\ngrowing ICM by the radio-loud AGN, whose energy over 100Myr is comparable to\nthe binding energy of the gas mass of the central halo.

This is because prior works found that\negocentric models are difficult to train from scratch and that transferring\nfrom exocentric representations leads to improved accuracy. However, in this\npaper, we revisit this common belief.

GRB 211211A recently made headlines as the first\nlong-duration burst purportedly generated by an NSM. The evidence for an NSM\norigin was excess optical and near-infrared emission consistent with the\nkilonova observed after the gravitational wave-detected NSM GW170817. Kilonovae\nderive their unique electromagnetic signatures from the properties of the heavy\nelements synthesized by rapid neutron capture (the r-process) following the\nmerger.

However, in\nmany tasks the agent might have access to offline data from related tasks in\nthe same target environment. While offline data is increasingly being used to\naid policy optimization via offline RL, our observation is that it can be a\nsurprisingly rich source of information for preference learning as well. We\npropose an approach that uses an offline dataset to craft preference queries\nvia pool-based active learning, learns a distribution over reward functions,\nand optimizes a corresponding policy via offline RL. Crucially, our proposed\napproach does not require actual physical rollouts or an accurate simulator for\neither the reward learning or policy optimization steps. To test our approach,\nwe first evaluate existing offline RL benchmarks for their suitability for\noffline reward learning. Surprisingly, for many offline RL domains, we find\nthat simply using a trivial reward function results good policy performance,\nmaking these domains ill-suited for evaluating learned rewards. To address\nthis, we identify a subset of existing offline RL benchmarks that are well\nsuited for offline reward learning and also propose new offline apprenticeship\nlearning benchmarks which allow for more open-ended behaviors. When evaluated\non this curated set of domains, our empirical results suggest that combining\noffline RL with learned human preferences can enable an agent to learn to\nperform novel tasks that were not explicitly shown in the offline data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2023 23:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

To meet this\nrequirement without relying on additional $2C - 2$ manual annotations per\ninstance, we propose a method that automatically generates additional noisy\nlabels by estimating the noisy label distribution based on nearest neighbours.\nThese additional noisy labels enable us to apply the Expectation-Maximisation\nalgorithm to estimate the posterior probabilities of clean labels, which are\nthen used to train the model of interest.

While much is currently known about\nthe underlying mechanisms governing detachment of detrital particles, including\ndetachment criteria at the pore scale and its upscaling for the core scale, a\ncritical gap exists due to absence of this knowledge for authigenic fines.\nIntegrating 3D Timoshenkos beam theory of elastic cylinder deformation with\nCFD-based model for viscous flow around the attached particle and with strength\nfailure criteria for particle-rock bond, we developed a novel theory for fines\ndetachment by breakage at the pore scale. The breakage criterium derived\nincludes analytical expressions for tensile and shear stress maxima along with\ntwo geometric diagrams which allow determining the breaking stress. This leads\nto an explicit formula for the breakage flow velocity. Its upscaling yields a\nmathematical model for fines detachment by breakage, expressed in the form of\nthe maximum retained concentration of attached fines versus flow velocity --\nmaximum retention function (MRF) for breakage. We performed corefloods with\npiecewise constant increasing flow rates, measuring breakthrough concentration\nand pressure drop across the core. The behaviour of the measured data is\nconsistent with two-population colloidal transport, attributed to detrital and\nauthigenic fines migration. Indeed, the laboratory data show high match with\nthe analytical model for two-population colloidal transport, which validates\nthe proposed mathematical model for fines detachment by breakage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 03:21:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

With this foundation, we establish functorial\nmappings between regulatory networks and other mathematical models in\nbiochemistry. We construct a functor from reaction networks, modeled as Petri\nnets with signed links, to regulatory networks, enabling us to precisely define\nwhen a reaction network could be a physical mechanism underlying a regulatory\nnetwork.

For unimodal and multimodal potential\nfunctions, the tail distributions of the coupling times are shown to have\nqualitatively different dependency on the noise magnitude. More specifically,\nfor a single-well potential function that is strongly convex, the exponential\ntail of the coupling time distribution is independent of noise and uniformly\nbounded away from zero by the convexity parameter; while for a multi-well\npotential function, the exponential tail is exponentially small with respect to\nthe noise magnitude with the exponents determined by the essential barrier\nheight, a quantity proposed in this paper which, in a sense, characterizes the\n``non-convexity\" of the potential function.

To address this issue,\nthis article proposes a new scheme, channel reciprocity (CR) based quantum key\ndistribution (QKD) CR-QKD, which accomplishes the goal of secret key sharing by\ncombining emerging techniques of QKD and CR-based key generation (CRKG).\nExploiting laws of quantum physics and properties of wireless channels, the\nproposed scheme is able to ensure the secrecy of the key, even against\ncomputationally unbounded adversaries.

In addition, to make CR-QKD more\npractical, some enhancement strategies are studied to reduce the time delay and\nto improve the secret key generation rate in a secure manner.

In this study, the UOSTrack is proposed,\nwhich involves the use of underwater images and open-air sequence hybrid\ntraining (UOHT), and motion-based post-processing (MBPP). The UOHT training\nparadigm is designed to train the sample-imbalanced underwater tracker. In\nparticular, underwater object detection (UOD) images are converted into image\npairs through customised data augmentation, such that the tracker is exposed to\nmore underwater domain training samples and learns the feature expressions of\nunderwater objects. The MBPP paradigm is proposed to exclude similar objects\nnear the target. In particular, it employs the estimation box predicted using a\nKalman filter and the candidate boxes in each frame to reconfirm the tracked\ntarget that is hidden in the candidate area when it has been lost. UOSTrack\nprovides an average performance improvement of 3.5 % compared to OSTrack on\nsimilar object challenge attribute in UOT100 and UTB180. The average\nperformance improvements provided by UOSTrack are 1 % and 3 %, respectively.\nThe results from two UOT benchmarks demonstrate that UOSTrack sets a new\nstate-of-the-art benchmark, and the effectiveness of UOHT and MBPP, and the\ngeneralisation and applicability of the MBPP for use in UOT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 08:22:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 02:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 05:34:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 06:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

(2004) in salinity-induced stratification. Both\nexperiments and numerical simulations are carried out. In our experiments,\nilluminated by a laser sheet on the central plane of the particle, its bouncing\nbehaviour is well captured. We find that the bouncing process starts after the\nwake detaches from the particle. The PIV results show that an upward jet is\ngenerated at the central axis behind the particle after the wake breaks. By\nconducting a force decomposition procedure, we quantify the enhanced drag\ncaused by the buoyancy of the wake ($F_{sb}$) and the flow structure\n($F_{sj}$). It is noted that $F_{sb}$ contributes primarily to the enhanced\ndrag at the early stage, which becomes less dominant after the detachment of\nthe wake. In contrast, $F_{sj}$ plays a pivotal role in reversing the\nparticle's motion. We conjecture that the jet flow is a necessary condition for\nthe occurrence of bouncing motion. Then, we examine the minimal velocities\n(negative values when bounce occurs) of the particle by varying the lower\nReynolds number $Re_l$, the Froude number $Fr$ and the upper Reynolds number\n$Re_u$ within the ranges $1 \\leq Re_l\\leq 125$, $115 \\leq Re_u\\leq 356$ and $2\n\\leq Fr\\leq 7$. We find that the bouncing behaviour is primarily determined by\n$Re_l$. In our experiments, the bouncing motion is found to occur below a\ncritical lower Reynolds number around $Re^ \\ast _{l}=30$.

The\nscattered light images reveal the presence of a complex environment composed of\na bright forward scattering rim of the disk's surface that is seen at very high\ninclination, a dark lane of the disk midplane, bipolar outflows, and streamer\nfeatures likely tracing infalling material from the surrounding birth cloud\nonto the disk. The analysis of the light curve suggests the star is a binary\nwith a period of 29.6yrs. The comparison of the scattered light images with\nALMA continuum and 12CO line emission shows the disk is in keplerian rotation,\nwith the northern side of the outflowing material receding, while the southern\nside approaching the observer.

Further, the topological\nconfiguration of transitions between states near such bifurcations ensures\nrobust operation, making the machine less sensitive to fabrication errors and\nnoise. To design such machines, we develop and implement a new efficient\nalgorithm that searches for interactions between the machine components that\ngive rise to energy landscapes with these bifurcation structures.

In\nparticular, we address the problem of computing a controller that provides\nprobabilistic guarantees on safely reaching a target, while also avoiding\nunsafe regions of the state space. First, we abstract the continuous control\nsystem into a finite-state model that captures noise by probabilistic\ntransitions between discrete states. As a key contribution, we adapt tools from\nthe scenario approach to compute probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds on\nthese transition probabilities, based on a finite number of samples of the\nnoise. We capture these bounds in the transition probability intervals of a\nso-called interval Markov decision process (iMDP). This iMDP is, with a\nuser-specified confidence probability, robust against uncertainty in the\ntransition probabilities, and the tightness of the probability intervals can be\ncontrolled through the number of samples. We use state-of-the-art verification\ntechniques to provide guarantees on the iMDP and compute a controller for which\nthese guarantees carry over to the original control system. In addition, we\ndevelop a tailored computational scheme that reduces the complexity of the\nsynthesis of these guarantees on the iMDP.

In this model, agents arrive in an unspecified sequential order, and\nthe prices can be updated between two agent-arrivals.

In 1973, Mather showed that the set of proper\n$C^0$-stable mappings is dense in the set of all proper mappings, which implies\nthat the set of $C^0$-stable mappings is dense in the set of all mappings if\nthe source manifold is compact. The aim of this paper is to complement Mather's\nresult and to provide new information to the subject.

They are motivated by the pattern recognition system in\nthe human brain, where complex objects are decomposed into a hierarchy of\nsimpler object parts. Such a hierarchy is referred to as a parse-tree.\nConceptually, capsule neural networks have been defined to realize such\nparse-trees. The capsule neural network (CapsNet), by Sabour, Frosst, and\nHinton, is the first actual implementation of the conceptual idea of capsule\nneural networks. CapsNets achieved state-of-the-art performance on simple image\nrecognition tasks with fewer parameters and greater robustness to affine\ntransformations than comparable approaches. This sparked extensive follow-up\nresearch. However, despite major efforts, no work was able to scale the CapsNet\narchitecture to more reasonable-sized datasets. Here, we provide a reason for\nthis failure and argue that it is most likely not possible to scale CapsNets\nbeyond toy examples. In particular, we show that the concept of a parse-tree,\nthe main idea behind capsule neuronal networks, is not present in CapsNets. We\nalso show theoretically and experimentally that CapsNets suffer from a\nvanishing gradient problem that results in the starvation of many capsules\nduring training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 12:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

The observed signatures of superfluorescence are a\nreduction of the intrinsic emitter lifetime, a narrower linewidth, and a\ndistinct redshift.

We study the formation of dust in the winds of intermediate mass (M\n$\\geq 4 M_{\\odot}$) stars of solar metallicity while evolving through the AGB\nphase. We tested the different treatments of the mass-loss mechanism by this\nclass of stars, with the aim of assessing their contribution to the general\nenrichment of silicates of the interstellar medium of galaxies. We consider a\nsub-sample of AGB stars, whose SED is characterised by deep absorption features\nat $10$ and $18\\mu$m, which can be regarded as the class of stars providing the\nmost relevant contribution to the silicates' production across the Universe.\nResults from stellar evolution and dust formation modelling were used to fit\nthe observed SED and to reproduce, at the same time, the detected pulsation\nperiods and the derived surface chemical composition. This analysis leads to\nthe derivation of tight constraints on the silicates' production rates\nexperienced by these sources during the final AGB stages. Two out of the four\nsources investigated are interpreted as stars currently undergoing HBB,\nevolving through phases close to the stage when the mass-loss rate is largest.\nThe remaining two stars are likely evolving through the very final AGB phases,\nafter HBB was turned off by the gradual consumption of the convective mantle.\nMass-loss rates of the order of $1-2\\times 10^{-4} M_{\\odot}/$yr are required\nwhen looking for consistency with the observational evidence. These results\nindicate the need for a revision of the silicate yields by intermediate mass\nstars, which are found to be $\\sim 3$ times higher than previously determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 14:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

To understand the effects of non-thermal energy\ndeposition in the chromosphere during flares, we analysed LyC profiles from a\ngrid of field-aligned radiative hydrodynamic models generated using the RADYN\ncode as part of the F-CHROMA project. The spectral response of LyC, the\ntemporal evolution of the departure coefficient of hydrogen, $b_1$, and the\ncolor temperature, $T_c$, in response to a range of non-thermal electron\ndistribution functions, were investigated. The LyC intensity was seen to\nincrease by 4-5.5 orders of magnitude during solar flares, responding most\nstrongly to the non-thermal electron flux of the beam. Generally, $b_1$\ndecreased from $10^2$-$10^3$ to closer to unity during solar flares, indicating\na stronger coupling to local conditions, while $T_c$ increased from $8$-$9$kK\nto $10$-$16$kK. $T_c$ was found to be approximately equal to the electron\ntemperature of the plasma when $b_1$ was at a minimum. Both optically thick and\noptically thin components of LyC were found in agreement with the\ninterpretation of recent observations. The optically thick layer forms deeper\nin the chromosphere during a flare compared to quiescent periods, whereas the\noptically thin layers form at higher altitudes due to chromospheric\nevaporation, in low-temperature, high-density regions propagating upwards.

To provide reference limit solutions, we derive new analytical\nexpressions for small-amplitude oscillations of a viscous droplet in a viscous\nambient fluid in two dimensions. We probe the sharp-interface limit of the\nNavier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard equations by means of an adaptive finite-element\nmethod, in which the refinements are guided by an a-posteriori error-estimation\nprocedure. The adaptive-refinement procedure enables us to consider\ndiffuse-interface thicknesses that are significantly smaller than other\nrelevant length scales in the droplet-oscillation problem, allowing an\nexploration of the asymptotic regime. For two distinct modes of oscillation, we\ndetermine the optimal scaling relation between the diffuse-interface thickness\nparameter and the mobility parameter. Additionally, we examine the effect of\ndeviations from the optimal scaling of the mobility parameter on the approach\nof the diffuse-interface solution to the sharp-interface solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 15:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

For example, classification, clustering, and data\nvisualization methods all require a quantification of differences in the\nobserved values. We can refer to the quantification of such differences, as\ndistance. An appropriate definition of a distance depends on the nature of the\ndata and the problem at hand. For distances between numerical variables, there\nexist many definitions that depend on the size of the observed differences. For\ncategorical data, the definition of a distance is more complex, as there is no\nstraightforward quantification of the size of the observed differences.\nConsequently, many proposals exist that can be used to measure differences\nbased on categorical variables. In this paper, we introduce a general framework\nthat allows for an efficient and transparent implementation of distances\nbetween observations on categorical variables. We show that several existing\ndistances can be incorporated into the framework. Moreover, our framework quite\nnaturally leads to the introduction of new distance formulations and allows for\nthe implementation of flexible, case and data specific distance definitions.\nFurthermore, in a supervised classification setting, the framework can be used\nto construct distances that incorporate the association between the response\nand predictor variables and hence improve the performance of distance-based\nclassifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 13:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

In the last decades, the\ninteraction of multiple factors, such as environmental and climate variability,\nhas influenced increments in incidence and geographical spread of the virus. In\nCosta Rica, a country characterized by multiple microclimates separated by\nshort distances, dengue has been endemic since its introduction in 1993.\nUnderstanding the role of climatic and environmental factors in the seasonal\nand inter-annual variability of disease spread is essential to develop\neffective surveillance and control efforts. In this study, we conducted a\nwavelet time series analysis of weekly climate, local environmental variables,\nand dengue cases (2001-2019) from 32 cantons in Costa Rica to identify\nsignificant periods (e.g., annual, biannual) in which climate and environmental\nvariables co-varied with dengue cases. Wavelet coherence analysis was used to\ncharacterize seasonality, multi-year outbreaks, and relative delays between the\ntime series. Results show that dengue outbreaks occurring every 3 years in\ncantons located in the country's Central, North, and South Pacific regions were\nhighly coherent with the Oceanic Ni\\~no 3.4 and the Tropical North Caribbean\nIndex (TNA). Dengue cases were in phase with El Ni\\~no 3.4 and TNA, with El\nNi\\~no 3.4 ahead of dengue cases by roughly nine months and TNA ahead by less\nthan three months.

Manually assessing the veracity of\nsocial media messages is a very time-consuming task that can be much helped by\nmachine learning. Most message veracity verification methods only exploit\ntextual contents and metadata. Very few take both textual and visual contents,\nand more particularly images, into account. Moreover, prior works have used\nmany classical machine learning models to detect rumors. However, although\nrecent studies have proven the effectiveness of ensemble machine learning\napproaches, such models have seldom been applied. Thus, in this paper, we\npropose a set of advanced image features that are inspired from the field of\nimage quality assessment, and introduce the Multimodal fusiON framework to\nassess message veracIty in social neTwORks (MONITOR), which exploits all\nmessage features by exploring various machine learning models.

These stars were extensively studied during last few decades, however\ntheir photometric variability and mass loss are still poorly constrained. The\natmospheres of evolved stars are characterized by complex dynamics due to\ndifferent interacting processes, such as convection, pulsation, formation of\nmolecules and dust, and the development of mass loss. These dynamical processes\nimpact the formation of spectral lines producing their asymmetries and Doppler\nshifts. Thus, by studying the line-profile variations on spatial and temporal\nscales it is possible to reconstruct atmospheric motions in stars and link them\nto the photometric variability and mass loss. The tomographic method, which is\nbased on the cross-sectioning through the stellar atmosphere and recovering the\nvelocity field for each atmospheric slice, is an ideal technique for this\npurpose. We present the tomographic method and its application to spectroscopic\nand spectro-interferometric observations of giant and supergiant stars as well\nas to state-of-the-art three-dimensional numerical simulations to constrain\ntheir atmospheric motions on spatial and temporal scales and better understand\nrespective mechanisms responsible for their photometric variability and mass\nloss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 13:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}
