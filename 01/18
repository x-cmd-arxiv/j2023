In this work, we propose a\nDecentralized Blocklist Protocol (DBP) based on inter-robot accusations.\nAccusations are made on the basis of locally-made observations of misbehavior,\nand once shared by cooperative robots across the network are used as input to a\ngraph matching algorithm that computes a blocklist. DBP generalizes to\napplications not implemented via LCP, is adaptive to the number of Byzantine\nrobots, and allows for fast information propagation through the multi-robot\nsystem while simultaneously reducing the required network connectivity relative\nto W-MSR. On LCP-type applications, DBP reduces the worst-case connectivity\nrequirement of W-MSR from (2F+1)-connected to (F+1)-connected and the number of\ncooperative observers required to propagate new information from F+1 to just 1\nobserver. We demonstrate empirically that our approach to Byzantine resilience\nscales to hundreds of robots on cooperative target tracking, time\nsynchronization, and localization case studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 16:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

An issue with\nquantum optimization algorithms such as QAOA is that they scale linearly with\nproblem size. In this paper, we build upon a proprietary methodology which\nscales logarithmically with problem size - opening an avenue for treating\noptimization problems of unprecedented scale on gate-based quantum computers.\nIn order to test the performance of the algorithm, we first find a way to apply\nit to a handful of NP-hard problems: Maximum Cut, Minimum Partition, Maximum\nClique, Maximum Weighted Independent Set.

Various methods of evaporative self-assembly are of particular\ninterest. The paper describes a mathematical model of mass transfer in a\ndroplet drying on a substrate based on the lubrication approximation. The model\ntakes into account the transfer of a dissolved or suspended substance by a\ncapillary flow, the diffusion of this substance, the evaporation of liquid, the\nformation of solid deposit, the dependence of the viscosity and the vapor flux\ndensity on the admixture concentration. The case with pinning of the\nthree-phase boundary is considered here. Explicit and implicit\nfinite-difference schemes have been developed for the model equations. A\nmodification of the numerical method is proposed, in which splitting by\nphysical processes, the iterative method of explicit relaxation and Thomas\nalgorithm are combined. A practical recipe for suppressing sawtooth\noscillations is described using the example of a specific problem. A software\nmodule in C++ has been developed, which can be used for evaporative lithography\nproblems in the future. With the help of this module, numerical calculations\nwere carried out, the results of which were compared with the results obtained\nin the Maple package. Numerical simulation predicted the case in which the\ndirection of the capillary flow changes to the opposite over time due to a\nchange in the sign of the gradient of the vapor flux density. This can lead to\na slowdown in the transfer of the substance to the periphery, which as a result\nwill contribute to the formation of a more or less uniform precipitation over\nthe entire contact area of the droplet with the substrate.

Yet learning online from few examples and efficiently\ngeneralizing across domains remains elusive. In humans such learning proceeds\nvia declarative memory formation and is closely associated with consciousness.\nPredictive processing has been advanced as a principled Bayesian inference\nframework for understanding the cortex as implementing deep generative\nperceptual models for both sensory data and action control. However, predictive\nprocessing offers little direct insight into fast compositional learning or the\nmystery of consciousness. Here we propose that through implementing online\nlearning by hierarchical binding of unpredicted inferences, a predictive\nprocessing system may flexibly generalize in novel situations by forming\nworking memories for perceptions and actions from single examples, which can\nbecome short- and long-term declarative memories retrievable by associative\nrecall. We argue that the contents of such working memories are unified yet\ndifferentiated, can be maintained by selective attention and are consistent\nwith observations of masking, postdictive perceptual integration, and other\nparadigm cases of consciousness research. We describe how the brain could have\nevolved to use perceptual value prediction for reinforcement learning of\ncomplex action policies simultaneously implementing multiple survival and\nreproduction strategies. 'Conscious experience' is how such a learning system\nperceptually represents its own functioning, suggesting an answer to the meta\nproblem of consciousness.

Alas,\ndissipation and dephasing phenomena generated by couplings to various\nuncontrollable environments yield a practical limiting factor to their\nutilization. To quantify this in detail, we present here the primary\nconsequences of single-transmon dissipation and dephasing to the many-body\ndynamics of transmon arrays.

We develop a coarse-grained\nspring network model, which describes the mechanical response of metallic\nglasses using an equivalent series network of springs, which can break and\nre-form to mimic atomic rearrangements during deformation. To validate the\nmodel, we perform simulations of quasistatic, uniaxial tension of Lennard-Jones\nand embedded atom method (EAM) potentials for Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50}$ metallic\nglasses. We consider samples prepared using a wide range of cooling rates and\nwith different amounts of crystalline order. We show that both the\nLennard-Jones and EAM models possess qualitatively similar stress $\\sigma$\nversus strain $\\gamma$ curves. By specifying five parameters in the spring\nnetwork model (ultimate strength, strain at ultimate strength, slopes of\n$\\sigma(\\gamma)$ at $\\gamma=0$ and at large strain, and strain at fracture\nwhere $\\sigma=0$), we can accurately describe the form of the stress-strain\ncurves during uniaxial tension for the computational studies of\nCu$_{50}$Zr$_{50}$, as well as recent experimental studies of several Zr-based\nmetallic glasses. For the computational studies of Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50}$, we find\nthat the yield strain distribution is shifted to larger strains for slowly\ncooled glasses compared to rapidly cooled glasses. In addition, the average\nnumber of new springs and their rate of formation decreases with decreasing\ncooling rate. These effects offset each other at large strains, causing the\nstress-strain curve to become independent of the sample preparation protocol in\nthis regime. In future studies, we will extract the parameters that define the\nspring network model directly from atomic rearrangements that occur during\nuniaxial deformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 17:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Therefore, identification of out-of-body\nscenes in endoscopic videos is of major importance to preserve the privacy of\npatients and operating room staff. Methods: A deep learning model was trained\nand evaluated on an internal dataset of 12 different types of laparoscopic and\nrobotic surgeries.

All images extracted from the video datasets were annotated as\ninside or out-of-body.

This work, thus, critically\ninvestigates the role of probe labelling configuration on the performance of\nSERS based bioassays for miRNA quantitation. To this aim, highly efficient SERS\nsubstrates based on Ag-decorated porous silicon/PDMS membranes are\nfunctionalized according to two different bioassays relying on a one-step or\ntwo-step hybridization of the target miRNA with oligonucleotide probes. The\ndetection configuration is varied, exploring the impact of the position of the\nRaman reporter along the oligo sequence and of the reporter identity on\nbioassay sensitivity. In the high miRNA concentration regime(100-10 nM), a\nsignificantly increased SERS intensity is detected when the reporters are\nlocated closer to the plasmonic surface compared to farther probe labelling\npositions. Counterintuitively, a levelling-off of the SERS intensity from the\ntwo configuration is instead recorded at low miRNA concentration. Such effect\nis explained by an increased contribution of Raman hot spot to the whole SERS\nsignal, as confirmed by simulations of the electric near field for a simplified\nmodel of the Ag nanostructures. The beneficial effect of reducing the\nreporter-to-surface distance is however partially retained for the two-step\nhybridization assay thanks to the less sterically hindered environment in which\nthe second hybridization occurs.

We characterize when transformer/attention\narchitecture provably obeys the stability condition and also provide empirical\nverification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify an inductive bias\nphenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task\ncomplexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner. Finally,\nwe provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed\nimplement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d.\nand dynamic data, (2) provide insights on stability, and (3) verify our\ntheoretical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 18:31:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 08:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

In particular, these materials exhibit a highly nonlinear response\nto optical fields owing to the induced ultrafast electron dynamics, which is\nhowever poorly understood on such mesoscopic length scales. Here, we reveal a\nnew mechanism that controls the nonlinear optical response of thin metallic\nfilms, dominated by ultrafast electronic heat transport when the thickness is\nsufficiently small.

However, recent work finds that models can\nperform surprisingly well when given intentionally irrelevant or misleading\nprompts. Such results may be interpreted as evidence that model behavior is not\n\"human like\". In this study, we challenge a central assumption in such work:\nthat humans would perform badly when given pathological instructions. We find\nthat humans are able to reliably ignore irrelevant instructions and thus, like\nmodels, perform well on the underlying task despite an apparent lack of signal\nregarding the task they are being asked to do. However, when given deliberately\nmisleading instructions, humans follow the instructions faithfully, whereas\nmodels do not. Thus, our conclusion is mixed with respect to prior work. We\nargue against the earlier claim that high performance with irrelevant prompts\nconstitutes evidence against models' instruction understanding, but we\nreinforce the claim that models' failure to follow misleading instructions\nraises concerns. More broadly, we caution that future research should not\nidealize human behaviors as a monolith and should not train or evaluate models\nto mimic assumptions about these behaviors without first validating humans'\nbehaviors empirically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 18:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Errors due to\ncoupling to a thermal bath result in the multi-qubit gate being CP-divisible\n(Markovian), deviating from a unitary.

Here we show that jets launched by accreting black holes\nmerging in an AGN disk can be detected as peculiar transients by infrared,\noptical, and X-ray observatories We further show that this emission mechanism\ncan explain the possible associations between gravitational wave events and the\noptical transient ZTF19abanrhr and the proposed gamma-ray counterparts\nGW150914-GBM and LVT151012-GBM. We demonstrate how these associations, if\ngenuine, can be used to reconstruct the properties of these events'\nenvironments. Searching for infrared and X-ray counterparts to similar\nelectromagnetic transients in the future, once host galaxies are localized by\noptical observations, could provide a smoking gun signature of the mergers' AGN\norigin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 15:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Investigation through different experimental techniques indicate the\npresence of two magnetic transitions in the system. As verified experimentally\nand theoretically, the high-temperature transition T$_H$ ~ 140 K is associated\nwith the development of ferromagnetic interaction between itinerant Co moments,\nwhereas the low-temperature transition at T$_L$ ~ 6.5 K is due to the coupling\namong Nd-4f and Co-3d moments, which is antiferromagnetic in nature. Detailed\nstudies of temperature-dependent dc magnetic susceptibility, field dependence\nof isothermal magnetization, non-equilibrium dynamical behavior, viz. magnetic\nrelaxation, aging effect, magnetic-memory effect, and temperature dependence of\nheat capacity, along with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, suggest\nthat the ground state is magnetically frustrated spin-glass in nature, having\ncompeting magnetic interactions of equivalent energies. DFT results further\nreveal that the 3d/5d-conduction carriers are blocked in the system and act as\na barrier for the 4f-4f RKKY interactions, resulting in spin-frustration.\nPresence of vacancy defects in the crystal are also conducive to the\nspin-frustration. This is an unique mechanism of magnetic frustration, not\nemphasized so far in any of the ternary R$_2$TX$_3$ (R=rare-earth, T=transition\nelements and X=Si, Ge, In) type compounds. Due to the competing character of\nthe itinerant 3d and localized 4f moments, the compound exhibits anomalous\nfield dependence of magnetic coercivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 19:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

People who identify as women, in particular, can be\nsubjected to a wide range of abusive behavior online, with gender-specific\nexperiences cited broadly in recent literature across fields such as blogging,\npolitics, and journalism. In response to this rise in abusive content,\nplatforms have been found to largely employ \"individualistic moderation\"\napproaches, aiming to protect users from harmful content through the screening\nand management of singular interactions or accounts. Yet, previous work\nperformed by the author of this paper has shown that in the cases of women in\nparticular, these approaches can often be ineffective; failing to protect users\nfrom multi-dimensional abuse spanning prolonged time periods, different\nplatforms, and varying interaction types. In recognition of its increasing\ncomplexity, platforms are beginning to outsource content moderation to users in\na new and decentralized approach. The goal of this research is to examine the\nfeasibility of using multidimensional abuse indicators in a Twitter-based\nmoderation algorithm aiming to protect women from female-targeted online abuse.\nThis research outlines three indicators of multidimensional abuse, explores how\nthese indicators can be extracted as features from Twitter data, and proposes a\ntechnical framework for deploying an end-to-end moderation algorithm using\nthese features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 19:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

On social media platforms where individual communities moderate\ntheir own activities, the responsibility to address user appeals falls on\nvolunteers from within the community. While there is a growing body of work\ndevoted to understanding and supporting the volunteer moderators' workload,\nlittle is known about their practice of handling user appeals. Through a\ncollaborative and iterative design process with Reddit moderators, we found\nthat moderators spend considerable effort in investigating user ban appeals and\ndesired to directly engage with users and retain their agency over each\ndecision. To fulfill their needs, we designed and built AppealMod, a system\nthat asks users to put more effort in their appeals, by providing additional\ninformation, before their appeals are reviewed by human moderators. In addition\nto giving moderators more information, we expected the friction in the appeal\nprocess would lead to a selection effect among users, with many insincere and\ntoxic appeals being abandoned before getting any attention from human\nmoderators. To evaluate our system, we conducted a field experiment in a Reddit\ncommunity of over 29 million users that lasted for four months. As a result of\nthe selection effect, moderators viewed only 30\\% of initial appeals and less\nthan 10\\% of the toxically worded appeals; yet they granted roughly the same\nnumber of appeals. Overall, our system is effective at reducing moderator\nworkload and minimizing their exposure to toxic content while honoring their\npreference for direct engagement and agency in appeals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 20:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

Nonetheless, in the presence of a large\ndata set with size $n\\gg 1,$ the KRR estimator has the drawback to require an\nintensive computational load. Recently, scalable KRR approaches have been\nproposed with the aims to reduce the computational complexity of the KRR, while\nmaintaining its superb convergence rate. In this work, we study a new scalable\nKRR based\n  approach for nonparametric regression. Our truncated kernel ridge regression\n(TKRR) approach is simple. It is based on substituting the full $n\\times n$\nrandom kernel or Gram matrix $B_n,$ associated with a Mercer's kernel $\\mathbb\nK,$ by its main $n\\times N$ sub-matrix $A_N,$ where usually $N \\ll n.$ Also, we\nshow that the TKRR works with $d-$dimensional random sampling data following an\nunknown probability law. To do so, we give a spectral analysis for the compact\nkernel integral operator, associated with a probability measure, different from\nits usual probability measure. This decay estimate is then extended to the\ndecay of the tail of the trace of the associated random Gram matrix. A special\ninterest is devoted to develop rules for the optimal choices of the involved\ntruncation order $N$ and the value for regularization parameter $\\lambda >0.$\nThe proposed rules are based on the behavior and the decay rate of the spectrum\nof the positive integral operator, associated with the kernel $\\mathbb K.$\nThese optimal values of the parameters ensure that in terms of the empirical\nrisk error, the TKRR and the full KRR estimators have the same optimal\nconvergence rate. Finally, we provide the reader with some numerical\nsimulations that illustrate the performance of our proposed TKRR estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 20:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

Previous studies have shown that the evolution of\nthe warp is crucially regulated by the internal flow fields established by the\nundulating geometry. These are typically modelled as laminar horizontal,\nshearing flows which oscillate back and forth at approximately the orbital\nfrequency. However this shearing motion is known to be susceptible to a\nhydrodynamic, parametric instability of inertial waves which might modify the\nwarped dynamics. Whilst the linear growth phase is well understood, the\nsubsequent nonlinear saturation combined with the self-consistent feedback onto\nthe warp has not been studied. In this work, we implement a novel numerical\nsetup using the recent ring model framework of Fairbairn and Ogilvie, within\nthe Lagrangian code GIZMO. We formally identify several locally growing modes\nin the simulation, as predicted by a three-mode coupling analysis of the\ninstability, and find decent agreement with the theoretical growth rates. We\nunderstand the saturation mechanism as a wave breaking process which suppresses\nthe growth of shorter wavelength parametric couplings first, whilst allowing\nthe longest mode to dominate the final quasi-steady, wavelike turbulence. The\nReynolds stresses, transporting energy from the warp to the small scales, can\nbe effectively modelled using a time-dependent, anisotropic viscous alpha model\nwhich closely captures the amplitude and phase evolution of the warp.\nConsequently, this model might help inform future global studies which are\ncommonplace but typically don't resolve the parametric instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 20:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

Four very young (~3-6 Myr) but lower mass (< 10^4\nMsun) clusters are detected in Halpha within a few arcsec of the nuclei, but\nproduce less than 1% of the line emission. We see little evidence for a\npopulation of massive clusters younger than 100Myr anywhere in Arp 220.

However, when training artificial neural\nnetworks on a set of tasks, typically, no mechanism is employed for selectively\nproducing anything analogous to these neuronal ensembles. Further, artificial\nneural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the network's\nperformance rapidly deteriorates as tasks are learned sequentially. By\ncontrast, sequential learning is possible for a range of biological organisms.\nWe introduce Learned Context Dependent Gating (LXDG), a method to flexibly\nallocate and recall `artificial neuronal ensembles', using a particular network\nstructure and a new set of regularization terms. Activities in the hidden\nlayers of the network are modulated by gates, which are dynamically produced\nduring training. The gates are outputs of networks themselves, trained with a\nsigmoid output activation. The regularization terms we have introduced\ncorrespond to properties exhibited by biological neuronal ensembles. The first\nterm penalizes low gate sparsity, ensuring that only a specified fraction of\nthe network is used. The second term ensures that previously learned gates are\nrecalled when the network is presented with input from previously learned\ntasks. Finally, there is a regularization term responsible for ensuring that\nnew tasks are encoded in gates that are as orthogonal as possible from\npreviously used ones. We demonstrate the ability of this method to alleviate\ncatastrophic forgetting on continual learning benchmarks. When the new\nregularization terms are included in the model along with Elastic Weight\nConsolidation (EWC) it achieves better performance on the benchmark `permuted\nMNIST' than with EWC alone. The benchmark `rotated MNIST' demonstrates how\nsimilar tasks recruit similar neurons to the artificial neuronal ensemble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 20:52:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 21:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Traditionally, neural network potentials\nrely on a local description of atomic environments to achieve this scalability.\nThese local descriptions result in short range models that neglect long range\ninteractions necessary for processes like dielectric screening in polar\nliquids. Several approaches to including long range electrostatic interactions\nwithin neural network models have appeared recently, and here we investigate\nthe transferability of one such model, the self consistent neural network\n(SCFNN), which focuses on learning the physics associated with long range\nresponse. By learning the essential physics, one can expect that such a neural\nnetwork model should exhibit at least partial transferability. We illustrate\nthis transferability by modeling dielectric saturation in a SCFNN model of\nwater. We show that the SCFNN model can predict non-linear response at high\nelectric fields, including saturation of the dielectric constant, without\ntraining the model on these high field strengths and the resulting liquid\nconfigurations. We then use these simulations to examine the nuclear and\nelectronic structure changes underlying dielectric saturation. Our results\nsuggest that neural network models can exhibit transferability beyond the\nlinear response regime and make genuine predictions when the relevant physics\nis properly learned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 21:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

This growing use of\ncollaborative robots has been enabled in part due to the availability of\nend-user robot programming methods that allow users who are not robot\nprogrammers to teach robots task actions. Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is\none such end-user programming method that enables users to bypass the\ncomplexities of specifying robot motions using programming languages by instead\ndemonstrating the desired robot behavior. Demonstrations are often provided by\nphysically guiding the robot through the motions required for a task action in\na process known as kinesthetic teaching. Kinesthetic teaching enables users to\ndirectly demonstrate task behaviors in the robot's configuration space, making\nit a popular end-user robot programming method for collaborative robots known\nfor its low cognitive burden. However, because kinesthetic teaching restricts\nthe programmer's teaching to motion demonstrations, it fails to leverage\ninformation from other modalities that humans naturally use when providing\nphysical task demonstrations to one other, such as gaze and speech.\nIncorporating multimodal information into the traditional kinesthetic\nprogramming workflow has the potential to enhance robot learning by\nhighlighting critical aspects of a program, reducing ambiguity, and improving\nsituational awareness for the robot learner and can provide insight into the\nhuman programmer's intent and difficulties.

AR is accompanied by an also sharp symmetrical\nantiresonance P(-) whose both N/S tailing harmonics P(-17) are the well-known\nPR=~154-day Rieger period dominating planetary dynamics and space weather.\nUnlike a resonating motor restrained from separating its casing, the freely\nresonating Sun exhausts the wind in an axial shake-off beyond L1 at highly\ncoherent discrete wave modes generated in the Sun, so to understand solar-type\nstars, only global decadal scales matter. The result verified against remote\ndata and the experiment, so it instantly replaces dynamo with magnetoalternator\nand advances Standard Stellar Models, improving fundamental understanding of\nbillions of trillions of solar-type stars.

Recent observations in the W43 molecular complex\nof top-heavy CMFs, with an excess of high-mass cores compared to the canonical\nmass distribution, raise questions about our understanding of the star\nformation processes and their evolution in space and time. We aim to compare\npopulations of protostellar and prestellar cores in three regions imaged in the\nALMA-IMF Large Program. We created an homogeneous core catalogue in W43,\ncombining a new core extraction in W43-MM1 with the catalogue of W43-MM2&MM3\npresented in a previous work. Our detailed search for protostellar outflows\nenabled us to identify between 23 and 30 protostellar cores out of 127 cores in\nW43-MM1 and between 42 and 51 protostellar cores out of 205 cores in\nW43-MM2&MM3. Cores with neither outflows nor hot core emission are classified\nas prestellar candidates. We found a similar fraction of cores which are\nprotostellar in the two regions, about 35%. This fraction strongly varies in\nmass, from 15-20% at low mass, between 0.8 and 3$M_{\\odot} $ up to about 80%\nabove 16$M_{\\odot}$. Protostellar cores are found to be, on average, more\nmassive and smaller in size than prestellar cores. Our analysis also revealed\nthat the high-mass slope of the prestellar CMF in W43,\n$\\alpha=-1.46_{-0.19}^{+0.12}$, is consistent with the Salpeter slope, and thus\nthe top-heavy form measured for the global CMF, $\\alpha=-0.96$, is due to the\nprotostellar core population. Our results could be explained by clump-fed\nmodels in which cores grow in mass, especially during the protostellar phase,\nthrough inflow from their environment. The difference between the slopes of the\nprestellar and protostellar CMFs moreover implies that high-mass cores grow\nmore in mass than low-mass cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 00:28:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 00:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

This approach is particularly important for\nmachine learning-based control, where the AI controller can be trained with\narbitrary conditional averages of observables, including the full density\nmatrix, to quickly and accurately learn control strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 01:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

To this end, we forecast the detectability of a\nmixed warm and cold dark matter scenario using the anomalous flux ratio method\nfrom strong gravitational lensed images. The halo mass function of the mixed\ndark matter scenario is suppressed relative to cold dark matter but still\npredicts numerous low-mass dark matter halos relative to warm dark matter.\nSince the strong lens signal is a convolution over a range of dark matter halo\nmasses and since the signal is sensitive to the specific configuration of dark\nmatter halos, not just the halo mass function, degeneracies between different\nforms of suppression in the halo mass function, relative to cold dark matter,\ncan arise.

It is significant in an application-oriented context\ninvolving data privacy. Converting noise vectors into synthetic samples through\na generator is a popular data-free quantization method, which is called\ngenerative data-free quantization. However, there is a difference in attention\nbetween synthetic samples and authentic samples. This is always ignored and\nrestricts the quantization performance. First, since synthetic samples of the\nsame class are prone to have homogenous attention, the quantized network can\nonly learn limited modes of attention. Second, synthetic samples in eval mode\nand training mode exhibit different attention. Hence, the batch-normalization\nstatistics matching tends to be inaccurate. ACQ is proposed in this paper to\nfix the attention of synthetic samples. An attention center position-condition\ngenerator is established regarding the homogenization of intra-class attention.\nRestricted by the attention center matching loss, the attention center position\nis treated as the generator's condition input to guide synthetic samples in\nobtaining diverse attention. Moreover, we design adversarial loss of paired\nsynthetic samples under the same condition to prevent the generator from paying\novermuch attention to the condition, which may result in mode collapse. To\nimprove the attention similarity of synthetic samples in different network\nmodes, we introduce a consistency penalty to guarantee accurate BN statistics\nmatching. The experimental results demonstrate that ACQ effectively improves\nthe attention problems of synthetic samples. Under various training settings,\nACQ achieves the best quantization performance.

The most famous method for finding\ncausal anomalies is RCA, but there are many problems that cannot be ignored.\nThey used the AutoRegressive eXogenous (ARX) model to create a time-invariant\ncorrelation network as a machine profile, and then use this profile to track\nthe causal anomalies by means of a method called fault propagation. There are\ntwo major problems in describing the behavior of a machine by using the\ncorrelation network established by ARX: (1) It does not take into account the\ndiversity of states (2) It does not separately consider the correlations with\ndifferent time-lag.

P-Path is evaluated on two\ncomprehensive case studies: the mid-size transit system of the Ann Arbor\nYpsilanti region in Michigan (which was studied by Basciftci and Van Hentenryck\n(2022)) and the large-scale transit system for the city of Atlanta. The\nexperimental results show that P-Path solves the Michigan ODMTS-DA instances in\na few minutes, bringing more than two orders of magnitude improvements compared\nto the existing approach. For Atlanta, the results show that P-Path can solve\nlarge-scale ODMTS-DA instances (about 17 millions of variables and 37 millions\nof constraints) optimally in a few hours or in a few days. These results show\nthe tremendous computational benefits of P-Path which provides a scalable\napproach to the design of on-demand multimodal transit systems with latent\ndemand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 03:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

However, the excitation and control of\nantiferromagnetic magnons remains challenging, especially when compared to\nferromagnetic counterparts. A middle ground is found with synthetic\nantiferromagnet metamaterials, where acoustic and optical magnons exist at GHz\nfrequencies. In these materials, the magnon energy spectrum can be tuned by\nstatic symmetry-breaking external fields or dipolar interactions hybridizing\noptical and acoustic magnon branches. Here, we experimentally measure the\nmagnon energy spectrum of synthetic antiferromagnetic tetralayers, and discover\navoided energy level crossings in the energy spectrum that are unexplained by\nthe antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling. We explain our experimental results\nusing a phenomenological model incorporating both fieldlike and dampinglike\ntorques generated by spin pumping in noncollinear magnetic multilayers\nseparated by normal-metal spacers. We show that an asymmetry in the fieldlike\ntorques acting on different magnetic layers can lift the spectral degeneracies\nof acoustic and optical magnon branches and yield symmetry-breaking induced\nmagnon-magnon interactions.

One prominent auto-bidding format is the target cost-per-acquisition\n(tCPA) which maximizes the volume of conversions subject to a\nreturn-of-investment constraint. From an auction theoretic perspective however,\nthis trend seems to go against foundational results that postulate that for\nprofit-maximizing bidders, it is optimal to use a classic bidding system like\nmarginal CPA (mCPA) bidding rather than using strategies like tCPA.\n  In this paper we rationalize the adoption of such seemingly sub-optimal\nbidding within the canonical quasi-linear framework. The crux of the argument\nlies in the notion of commitment. We consider a multi-stage game where first\nthe auctioneer declares the auction rules; then bidders select either the tCPA\nor mCPA bidding format and then, if the auctioneer lacks commitment, it can\nrevisit the rules of the auction (e.g., may readjust reserve prices depending\non the observed bids). Our main result is that so long as a bidder believes\nthat the auctioneer lacks commitment to follow the rule of the declared auction\nthen the bidder will make a higher profit by choosing the tCPA format over the\nmCPA format.\n  We then explore the commitment consequences for the auctioneer. In a\nsimplified version of the model where there is only one bidder, we show that\nthe tCPA subgame admits a credible equilibrium while the mCPA format does not.\nThat is, when the bidder chooses the tCPA format the auctioneer can credibly\nimplement the auction rules announced at the beginning of the game. We also\nshow that, under some mild conditions, the auctioneer's revenue is larger when\nthe bidder uses the tCPA format rather than mCPA. We further quantify the value\nfor the auctioneer to be able to commit to the declared auction rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 05:23:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 18:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

Cooperative Driving\nAutomation~(CDA) has been considered a pivotal solution to next-generation\nautomated driving and intelligent transportation. Though CDA has attracted much\nattention from both academia and industry, exploration of its potential is\nstill in its infancy. In industry, companies tend to build their in-house data\ncollection pipeline and research tools to tailor their needs and protect\nintellectual properties. Reinventing the wheels, however, wastes resources and\nlimits the generalizability of the developed approaches since no standardized\nbenchmarks exist. On the other hand, in academia, due to the absence of\nreal-world traffic data and computation resources, researchers often\ninvestigate CDA topics in simplified and mostly simulated environments,\nrestricting the possibility of scaling the research outputs to real-world\nscenarios. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish an open-source\necosystem~(OSE) to address the demands of different communities for CDA\nresearch, particularly in the early exploratory research stages, and provide\nthe bridge to ensure an integrated development and testing pipeline that\ndiverse communities can share.

Heterogeneous computing environments provide a\ntheoretical possibility to accelerate the cross-matching, but the performance\nadvantages of heterogeneous computing resources have not been fully utilized.\nTo meet the challenge of cross-matching for substantial increasing amount of\nastronomical observation data, this paper proposes\nHeterogeneous-computing-enabled Large Catalogue Cross-matcher (HLC2), a\nhigh-performance cross-matching framework based on spherical position deviation\non CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing platforms.

However, the use of a `background' embedding\nduring training in these methods is problematic as the resulting model tends to\nover-learn and assign all unseen classes as the background class instead of\ntheir correct labels. Furthermore, they ignore the semantic relationship of\ntext embeddings, which arguably can be highly informative for zero-shot\nprediction as seen classes may have close relationship with unseen classes. To\nthis end, this paper proposes novel class enhancement losses to bypass the use\nof the background embbedding during training, and simultaneously exploit the\nsemantic relationship between text embeddings and mask proposals by ranking the\nsimilarity scores. To further capture the relationship between seen and unseen\nclasses, we propose an effective pseudo label generation pipeline using\npretrained vision-language model. Extensive experiments on several benchmark\ndatasets show that our method achieves overall the best performance for\nzero-shot semantic segmentation. Our method is flexible, and can also be\napplied to the challenging open-vocabulary semantic segmentation problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 06:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

To effectively\nleverage the unlabeled data, pseudo labeling, along with the teacher-student\nframework, is widely adopted in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Though\nproved to be effective, this paradigm suffers from incorrect pseudo labels\nwhich inevitably exist and are taken as auxiliary training data. To alleviate\nthe negative impact of incorrect pseudo labels, we delve into the current\nSemi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation frameworks. We argue that the unlabeled\ndata with pseudo labels can facilitate the learning of representative features\nin the feature extractor, but it is unreliable to supervise the mask predictor.\nMotivated by this consideration, we propose a novel framework, Gentle Teaching\nAssistant (GTA-Seg) to disentangle the effects of pseudo labels on feature\nextractor and mask predictor of the student model. Specifically, in addition to\nthe original teacher-student framework, our method introduces a teaching\nassistant network which directly learns from pseudo labels generated by the\nteacher network. The gentle teaching assistant (GTA) is coined gentle since it\nonly transfers the beneficial feature representation knowledge in the feature\nextractor to the student model in an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) manner,\nprotecting the student model from the negative influences caused by unreliable\npseudo labels in the mask predictor. The student model is also supervised by\nreliable labeled data to train an accurate mask predictor, further facilitating\nfeature representation.

The\nbarrier is defined as the crossing point of two free-energy surfaces which are\nattributed to the reactant and product of the reaction.

Unfortunately, mapping the target-domain distribution to the\nsource-domain unconditionally may distort the essential structural information\nof the target-domain data, leading to inferior performance. To address this\nissue, we firstly propose to introduce active sample selection to assist domain\nadaptation regarding the semantic segmentation task. By innovatively adopting\nmultiple anchors instead of a single centroid, both source and target domains\ncan be better characterized as multimodal distributions, in which way more\ncomplementary and informative samples are selected from the target domain. With\nonly a little workload to manually annotate these active samples, the\ndistortion of the target-domain distribution can be effectively alleviated,\nachieving a large performance gain. In addition, a powerful semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation strategy is proposed to alleviate the long-tail distribution\nproblem and further improve the segmentation performance. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on public datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins and achieves\nsimilar performance to the fully-supervised upperbound, i.e., 71.4% mIoU on\nGTA5 and 71.8% mIoU on SYNTHIA.

The new approach not only\nremoves some drawbacks of previous methods but also has some remarkable\nadvantages. We combine the well-known Gaussian linear model with a neural\nnetwork and introduce a procedure for the reconstruction of an arbitrary\nfunction. In the scenario, the neural network produces some arbitrary base\nfunctions which subsequently are fed to the Gaussian linear model. Given a\nprior distribution on the free parameters, the Gaussian linear model provides a\nclose form for the posterior distribution as well as the Bayesian evidence.

So far, only 2D dynamic observations of straining exercises at\nexcretion are available in the clinics and the understanding of\nthree-dimensional pelvic organs mechanical defects is not yet achievable. In\nthis context, we proposed a complete methodology for the 3D representation of\nthe non-reversible bladder deformations during exercises, directly combined\nwith synthesized 3D representation of the location of the highest strain areas\non the organ surface. Methods: Novel image segmentation and registration\napproaches have been combined with three geometrical configurations of\nup-to-date rapid dynamic multi-slices MRI acquisition for the reconstruction of\nreal-time dynamic bladder volumes. Results: For the first time, we proposed\nreal-time 3D deformation fields of the bladder under strain from in-bore forced\nbreathing exercises.

DTs are able to replicate IoT devices and adapt over time to\ntheir behavioral changes. However, DTs in IoT are typically tailored to a\nspecific use case, without the possibility to seamlessly adapt to different\nscenarios. Further, the fragmentation of IoT poses additional challenges on how\nto deploy DTs in heterogeneous scenarios characterized by the usage of multiple\ndata formats and IoT network protocols. In this paper, we propose the\nRelativistic Digital Twin (RDT) framework, through which we automatically\ngenerate general purpose DTs of IoT entities and tune their behavioral models\nover time by constantly observing their real counterparts. The framework relies\non the object representation via the Web of Things (WoT), to offer a\nstandardized interface to each of the IoT devices as well as to their DTs.

The comprehensive simulations, supported by experiments with a\nRetarding Field Analyser (RFA), reveal that the longitudinal and transverse\nenergy spread of the extracted beams are strongly affected by the electrostatic\nfocusing effects, namely the extraction geometry and plasma beam boundary, to\nthe extent that the electrostatic effects dominate over the magnetic field\ninduced rotation of the beam or the effect of plasma potential and ion\ntemperature. The dominance of the electrostatic focusing effect over the\nmagnetic field induced rotation complicates parametric studies of the\ntransverse emittance as a function of the magnetic field strength, and\ncomparison of emittance values obtained with different ion sources having\ndifferent extraction designs. Our results demonstrate that the full ion beam\nenergy spread, relevant for the downstream accelerator, can be measured with\nthe RFA only when all ions are collected. On the contrary, studying the effect\nof plasma properties (plasma potential and ion temperature) on the longitudinal\nenergy spread requires heavy collimation of the beam accepting only ions near\nthe symmetry axis of the beam for which the electrostatic and magnetic effects\nare suppressed.

However, many questions about the\nphysical conditions at shock fronts, such as the magnetic-field morphology\nclose to the particle acceleration sites, remain open. Here we report the\ndetection of a localized polarization signal from some synchrotron X-ray\nemitting regions of Tycho's supernova remnant made by the Imaging X-ray\nPolarimetry Explorer. The derived polarization degree of the X-ray synchrotron\nemission is 9+/-2% averaged over the whole remnant, and 12+/-2% at the rim,\nhigher than the 7-8% polarization value observed in the radio band. In the west\nregion the polarization degree is 23+/-4%. The X-ray polarization degree in\nTycho is higher than for Cassiopeia A, suggesting a more ordered magnetic-field\nor a larger maximum turbulence scale. The measured tangential polarization\ndirection corresponds to a radial magnetic field, and is consistent with that\nobserved in the radio band. These results are compatible with the expectation\nof turbulence produced by an anisotropic cascade of a radial magnetic-field\nnear the shock, where we derive a magnetic-field amplification factor of\n3.4+/-0.3. The fact that this value is significantly smaller than those\nexpected from acceleration models is indicative of highly anisotropic\nmagnetic-field turbulence, or that the emitting electrons either favor regions\nof lower turbulence, or accumulate close to where the magnetic-field\norientation is preferentially radially oriented due to hydrodynamical\ninstabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 09:52:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 14:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

In the paper\nwe propose a hierarchical structure for the determination of the classes. This\nenables us to have control over the size of classes and to compare the\nperformance of the classification for different numbers of classes. In\nparticular, the class probabilities in the two-class case can be computed\neither directly by the two-class classification or by summing probabilities of\nchildren classes in multi-class classification.

It can\nrapidly control the output voltage and even contribute to voltage shaping of\nthe inverter. Based upon the rapid development of low-voltage transistors and\nmodular circuit topologies in the recent years, the proposed technology uses\nrecent 48 V power electronics to achieve higher-voltage output and reduce\nlosses in electric vehicle (EV) drive trains. The fast switching capability and\nlow loss of low-voltage field effect transistors (FET) allow sharing the\nmodulation with the main drive inverter. As such, the slower insulated-gate\nbipolar transistors (IGBT) of the inverter can operate at ideal duty cycle and\naggressively reduced switching, while the adaptive dc battery provides an\nadjustable voltage and all common-mode contributions at the dc link with lower\nloss. Up to 2/3 of the switching of the main inverter is avoided. At high drive\nspeeds and thus large modulation indices, the proposed converter halves the\ntotal loss compared to using the inverter alone; at lower speeds and thus\nsmaller modulation indices, the advantage is even more prominent because of the\ndynamically lowered dc-link voltage. Furthermore, it can substantially reduce\nthe distortion, particularly at lower modulation indices, e.g., down to 1/2\ncompared to conventional space-vector modulation and even 1/3 for discontinuous\npulse-width modulation with hard-wired battery. Other benefits include\nalleviated insulation stress for motor windings, active battery balancing, and\neliminating the vulnerability of large hard-wired battery packs to weak cells.\nWe demonstrate the proposed motor drive on a 3-kW setup with eight battery\nmodules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 10:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

Not all of the TDEs inhabit\nregions of parameter space where the model is valid, or have sufficient data\nfor a detailed analysis, and physically interpretable parameters for a\nsub-sample of 11 TDEs are determined. These sources have thermal (power-law\nfree) X-ray spectra. The radial sizes measured from these spectra lie at values\nconsistent with the inner-most stable circular orbit of black holes with masses\ngiven by the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relationship, and can be used as an\nindependent measurement of $M_{\\rm BH}$. The bolometric disc luminosity can\nalso be inferred from X-ray data. All of the TDEs have luminosities which are\nsub-Eddington ($L_{\\rm bol, disc} \\lesssim L_{\\rm edd}$), and larger than the\ntypical hard-state transitional luminosity of X-ray binary discs ($L_{\\rm bol,\ndisc} \\gtrsim 0.01 L_{\\rm edd}$). The {\\it peak} bolometric luminosity is found\nto be linearly correlated with the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ mass. The TDE\nX-ray-to-bolometric correction can reach values up to $\\sim 100$, and grows\nexponentially at late times, resolving the missing energy problem. We show that\nthe peak disc luminosities of some TDEs are smaller than their observed optical\nluminosities, implying that not all of the early time optical emission can be\nsourced from reprocessed disc emission. Our results are supportive of the\nhypothesis that thermal X-ray bright TDEs are in accretion states analogous to\nthe ``soft'' accretion state of X-ray binaries, and that black hole accretion\nprocesses are scale (mass) invariant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 10:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

However, little attention is paid to how to\nobtain the complete salient object in cluttered background, where the targets\nare usually similar in color and texture to the background. To handle this\ncomplex scene, we propose a sharp eyes network (SENet) that first seperates the\nobject from scene, and then finely segments it, which is in line with human\nvisual characteristics, i.e., to look first and then focus. Different from\nprevious methods which directly integrate edge or skeleton to supplement the\ndefects of objects, the proposed method aims to utilize the expanded objects to\nguide the network obtain complete prediction. Specifically, SENet mainly\nconsists of target separation (TS) brach and object segmentation (OS) branch\ntrained by minimizing a new hierarchical difference aware (HDA) loss. In the TS\nbranch, we construct a fractal structure to produce saliency features with\nexpanded boundary via the supervision of expanded ground truth, which can\nenlarge the detail difference between foreground and background. In the OS\nbranch, we first aggregate multi-level features to adaptively select\ncomplementary components, and then feed the saliency features with expanded\nboundary into aggregated features to guide the network obtain complete\nprediction. Moreover, we propose the HDA loss to further improve the structural\nintegrity and local details of the salient objects, which assigns weight to\neach pixel according to its distance from the boundary hierarchically. Hard\npixels with similar appearance in border region will be given more attention\nhierarchically to emphasize their importance in completeness prediction.\nComprehensive experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively\nand qualitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 11:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

The destruction of HCOOH by reaction with HCO+ in the gas phase leads to\nthree isomers of the cation HC(OH)2+. The most abundant cation can react in a\nsecond step with other abundant molecules of the ISM like NH3 to form back\nc-HCOOH and t-HCOOH. This mechanism explains the formation of c-HCOOH in dark\nmolecular clouds. Considering this mechanism, the fraction of c-HCOOH with\nrespect t-HCOOH is 25.7%.

This work introduces a\nnovel text-video localization pre-text task to enable fine-grained temporal and\nsemantic alignment such that the trained model can accurately perceive temporal\nboundaries in videos given the text description. Specifically, text-video\nlocalization consists of moment retrieval, which predicts start and end\nboundaries in videos given the text description, and text localization which\nmatches the subset of texts with the video features. To produce temporal\nboundaries, frame features in several videos are manually merged into a long\nvideo sequence that interacts with a text sequence.

Our presentation relies on consistent notations for a wide range of\nmodels. As such, we reveal many new connections between latent structure\nlearning strategies, showing how most consist of the same small set of\nfundamental building blocks, but use them differently, leading to substantially\ndifferent applicability and properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 12:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

To overcome these\nchallenges, we present a unique curvilinear structure segmentation framework\nbased on an oriented derivative of stick (ODoS) filter and a deep learning\nnetwork for curvilinear object segmentation in medical images. Currently, a\nlarge number of deep learning models emphasize developing deep architectures\nand ignore capturing the structural features of curvilinear objects, which may\nlead to unsatisfactory results. Consequently, a new approach that incorporates\nan ODoS filter as part of a deep learning network is presented to improve the\nspatial attention of curvilinear objects. Specifically, the input image is\ntransfered into four-channel image constructed by the ODoS filter. In which,\nthe original image is considered the principal part to describe various image\nappearance and complex background illumination conditions, a multi-step\nstrategy is used to enhance the contrast between curvilinear objects and their\nsurrounding backgrounds, and a vector field is applied to discriminate thin and\nuneven curvilinear structures.

Consequently, existing\nframeworks capable of efficiently training large GNN models usually incur a\nsignificant accuracy degradation because of the inevitable shortcuts involved.\nTo address these limitations, we instead propose ReFresh, a general-purpose GNN\nmini-batch training framework that leverages a historical cache for storing and\nreusing GNN node embeddings instead of re-computing them through fetching raw\nfeatures at every iteration. Critical to its success, the corresponding cache\npolicy is designed, using a combination of gradient-based and staleness\ncriteria, to selectively screen those embeddings which are relatively stable\nand can be cached, from those that need to be re-computed to reduce estimation\nerrors and subsequent downstream accuracy loss. When paired with complementary\nsystem enhancements to support this selective historical cache, ReFresh is able\nto accelerate the training speed on large graph datasets such as\nogbn-papers100M and MAG240M by 4.6x up to 23.6x and reduce the memory access by\n64.5% (85.7% higher than a raw feature cache), with less than 1% influence on\ntest accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 12:51:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 03:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-20"}

Three typical kinds of the proximate ensemble: one-dimensional\nparticle chain, two-dimensional square-lattice particle plane and particle\ngrating, are considered by using the many-body radiative heat transfer theory.\nWhen increasing the proximate particle size, the effect of many-body\ninteraction on NFRHT will experience a radical change from inhibition to\nenhancement.

The energy delivered by the Moon-forming impact induced a deep magma\nocean on the young Earth, corresponding to the last episode of core-mantle\nequilibration. The crystallization of this magma ocean led to the outgassing of\nvolatiles initially present in the Earth's mantle, resulting in the formation\nof a secondary atmosphere. During outgassing, the magma ocean acts as a\nchemical buffer for the atmosphere via the oxygen fugacity, set by the\nequilibrium between ferrous- and ferric-iron oxides in the silicate melts. By\ntracking the evolution of the oxygen fugacity during magma ocean\nsolidification, we model the evolving composition of a C-O-H atmosphere. We use\nthe atmosphere composition to calculate its thermal structure and radiative\nflux. This allows us to calculate the lifetime of the terrestrial magma ocean.\nWe find that, upon crystallizing, the magma ocean evolves from a mildly\nreducing to a highly oxidized redox state, thereby transiting from a CO- and\nH2-dominated atmosphere to a CO2- and H2O-dominated one. We find the overall\nduration of the magma ocean crystallization to depend mostly on the bulk H\ncontent of the mantle, and to remain below 1.5 millions years for up to 9\nEarth's water oceans' worth of H. Our model also suggests that reduced\natmospheres emit lower infrared radiation than oxidized ones, despite of the\nlower greenhouse effect of reduced species, resulting in a longer magma ocean\nlifetime in the former case. Although developed for a deep magma ocean on\nEarth, the framework applies to all terrestrial planet and exoplanet magma\noceans, depending on their volatile budgets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 13:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

The suggested explanation is\nthrough the temporal variation of the solar rotation with latitude. This issue\nis deeper developed due to an accurate knowledge of the long-term variations in\nsolar differential rotation regarding solar activity. Here we analyze solar\ncycles 12-24, investigating the long-term temporal variations in solar\ndifferential rotation. It is shown that J2 exhibits a net modulation over the\n13 studied cycles of approximately (89.6 +- 0.1) yr, with a peak-to-peak\namplitude of approximately 0.1 x 10-7 for a reference value of 2.07 x 10-7).\nMoreover, J2 exhibits a positive linear trend in the period of minima solar\nactivity (sunspot number up to around 40) and a marked declining trend in the\nperiod of maxima (sunspot number above 50). In absolute magnitude, the mean\nvalue of J2 is more significant during periods of minimum than in periods of\nmaximum. These findings are based on observational results that are not free of\nerrors and can be refined further by considering torsional oscillations for\nexample. They are comforted by identifying a periodic variation of the J2 term\nevidenced through the analysis of the perihelion precession of planetary orbits\neither deduced from ephemerides or computed in the solar equatorial coordinate\nsystem instead of the ecliptic coordinate one usually used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 13:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

One of\nthe major challenges in text-to-SQL parsing is domain generalization, i.e., how\nto generalize well to unseen databases. Recently, the pre-trained text-to-text\ntransformer model, namely T5, though not specialized for text-to-SQL parsing,\nhas achieved state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks targeting\ndomain generalization. In this work, we explore ways to further augment the\npre-trained T5 model with specialized components for text-to-SQL parsing. Such\ncomponents are expected to introduce structural inductive bias into text-to-SQL\nparsers thus improving model's capacity on (potentially multi-hop) reasoning,\nwhich is critical for generating structure-rich SQLs. To this end, we propose a\nnew architecture GRAPHIX-T5, a mixed model with the standard pre-trained\ntransformer model augmented by some specially-designed graph-aware layers.\nExtensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of GRAPHIX-T5\nacross four text-to-SQL benchmarks: SPIDER, SYN, REALISTIC and DK.

Using fundamental causal models such\nas directed acyclic graphs, one can rigorously express, and partially validate,\ncausal hypotheses; and then use the causal information to guide the\nconstruction of a statistical model that captures genuine causal relations --\nsuch that correlation does imply causation.\n  We apply these ideas to analyzing public data about programmer performance in\nCode Jam, a large world-wide coding contest organized by Google every year.\nSpecifically, we look at the impact of different programming languages on a\nparticipant's performance in the contest. While the overall effect associated\nwith programming languages is weak compared to other variables -- regardless of\nwhether we consider correlational or causal links -- we found considerable\ndifferences between a purely statistical and a causal analysis of the very same\ndata.

In this paper, we use Hamilton's principle of least action to derive\nthe averaged stress tensor of discrete granular assemblies subjected to\nhydraulic force fields, as well as rigorous conditions for a proper definition\nof the Representative Volume Element (RVE). The main goal behind our efforts is\nto upscale particle physics into a sound stress tensor for systems involving\nthe complex interaction between grains and water. We identify the contributions\nfrom the unbalanced forces, hydraulic forces, gravity, external forces, and\nparticle fluctuation to the mean stress tensor. In doing so, it is convenient\nto separate the influence of different force fields when the granular system is\nsubjected to complex environments, e.g., subaqueous conditions. The obtained\nformula is then validated by triaxial test simulations of dry and saturated\ngranular systems using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the\nLattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM). The results show that the deduced formula can\naccurately calculate the stress tensor of discrete assemblies with various\nbody-force fields. We used validated DEM-LBM simulations of submerged granular\ncolumn collapses to explore the physics happening at the grain scale with this\nmathematical formalism and showcase its potential. We provide a new perspective\nbased on the granular assembly scale to pursue the fluid-solid interaction.

The key idea is\nutilizing 2D images as a bridge to connect the point cloud and the language\nmodalities. The proposed Text4Point follows the pre-training and fine-tuning\nparadigm. During the pre-training stage, we establish the correspondence of\nimages and point clouds based on the readily available RGB-D data and use\ncontrastive learning to align the image and point cloud representations.\nTogether with the well-aligned image and text features achieved by CLIP, the\npoint cloud features are implicitly aligned with the text embeddings. Further,\nwe propose a Text Querying Module to integrate language information into 3D\nrepresentation learning by querying text embeddings with point cloud features.\nFor fine-tuning, the model learns task-specific 3D representations under\ninformative language guidance from the label set without 2D images.

When image data of particles exhibiting a wide range of shapes and\nsizes is considered, traditional image segmentation methods, such as the\nclassic watershed algorithm, struggle to recognize particles with satisfying\naccuracy. Thus, more advanced methods of machine learning must be utilized for\nimage segmentation to improve the validity of subsequent analyzes. Moreover, CT\ndata does not include information about the mineralogical composition of\nparticles and, therefore, additional SEM-EDS image data has to be acquired. In\nthis paper, micro-CT image data of a particle system mostly consisting of\nzinnwaldite-quartz composites is considered.

Although the phenomenon of organic epitaxy has been\nknown for decades, computational methods for structure prediction of epitaxial\norganic interfaces have lagged far behind the existing methods for their\ninorganic counterparts. We present a method for structure prediction of\nepitaxial organic interfaces based on lattice matching followed by surface\nmatching, implemented in the open-source Python package, Ogre. The lattice\nmatching step produces domain-matched interfaces, where commensurability is\nachieved with different integer multiples of the substrate and film unit cells.\nIn the surface matching step, Bayesian optimization (BO) is used to find the\ninterfacial distance and registry between the substrate and film. The BO\nobjective function is based on dispersion corrected deep neural network\ninteratomic potentials, shown to be in excellent agreement with density\nfunctional theory (DFT). The application of Ogre is demonstrated for an\nepitaxial interface of 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) on\ntetrathiafulvalene (TTF), whose electronic structure has been probed by\nultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS), but whose structure had been\nhitherto unknown [Organic Electronics 48, 371 (2017)].

The goal of such models is to efficiently solve\nfor the underlying field by combining measurements with known physical laws. As\nmany systems contain unknown elements, such as missing parameters, noisy data,\nor incomplete physical laws, this is widely approached as an uncertainty\nquantification problem. The common techniques to handle all the variables\ntypically depend on the numerical scheme used to approximate the posterior, and\nit is desirable to have a method which is independent of any such\ndiscretization. Information field theory (IFT) provides the tools necessary to\nperform statistics over fields that are not necessarily Gaussian. We extend IFT\nto physics-informed IFT (PIFT) by encoding the functional priors with\ninformation about the physical laws which describe the field. The posteriors\nderived from this PIFT remain independent of any numerical scheme and can\ncapture multiple modes, allowing for the solution of problems which are\nill-posed.

The complexity is generated by the\nkinematics of the blade rotation which generates a curved relative flow, a\nnon-sinusoidal variation of relative flow speed and angle of attack, and the\nnecessity of travelling through its own wake. These kinematic variations have\nchallenged traditional predictors of dynamic stall such as pitch rate, pitching\nmoment or relative angle of attack. Proper orthogonal decomposition of velocity\nfields from a large-eddy simulation is employed to analyze the spatio-temporal\nevolution of the dominant flow features. The modes' time development\ncoefficients capture the trend of relative flow velocity magnitude and lift\ngeneration on the blade, along with critical events such as vortex formation\nand detachment. These correlations are examined across two tip-speed ratios,\nrevealing a stronger correlation at the higher rotation rate. To demonstrate\nthe application of modal analysis, a non-constant rotation rate (intracycle\ncontrol or angular velocity) that enhances power generation by 40\\% is analyzed\nand directly compared to the constant velocity rotation. By extracting common\nmodes between the two simulations it is seen that the modified stall behavior\nis responsible for the additional power extraction, correlating with enhanced\ntorque generation. Finally, flow curvature, history effects, and flow induction\nare identified as significant factors that modify the force and moment curves\nas compared to pitching or plunging foils.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 15:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

The open interfaces and especially the possibilities\nfor network-wide control protocols via the Near-Real Time RAN Intelligent\nController provide a significant amount of opportunities to implement newly\nproposed algorithms from state-of-the-art research. O-RAN follows the trend\ntowards disaggregation of network functionalities which is especially\ninteresting to deploy Cell-Free Massive MIMO in realistic distributed networks.\nMany attractive solutions have been proposed for the physical layer in\nCell-Free Massive MIMO networks. Unfortunately, only limited work has been\nperformed to map these solutions to the Next Generation of Radio Access\nNetworks, especially also considering the existing control plane interfaces and\nthe impact on network-level resource allocation and handover. In this work, we\npropose a realistic and elegant method of modelling the temporal evolution of\nthe channel in cell-free Massive MIMO. We then build clustering and handover\nstrategies and provide numerical results for multiple deployment scenarios. To\nrealistically evaluate handovers and dynamic clustering for cell-free in O-RAN,\nwe consider a fixed clustering strategy, which computes the ideal cluster\nwhenever a handover threshold is exceeded, and an opportunistic clustering\nstrategy, where serving units are added opportunistically as the user moves.\nAdditionally, we map an uplink detection method from the current cell-free\nMassive MIMO state-of-the-art to the O-RAN architecture. We study how the\nageing of the channel and especially the user-centric cluster around the UE\nlimits the performance of Cell-Free algorithms. We identify what is currently\npossible and propose the few needed extensions to O-RAN to fully exploit\nstate-of-the-art cell-free processing schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 15:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-19"}

For decades\ndesigners have relied on rough estimates of dynamic load currents that\nstimulate a designed Power Delivery Network (PDN). The consequences of\ninaccurate load-current characterization can range from excessive PDN cost and\nlengthened development schedules to poor performance or functional failure.\nThis paper will introduce and describe a method to precisely determine\ntimedomain current waveforms from a pair of measured timedomain voltage\nwaveforms. This NonInvasive Current Estimation (NICE) method is based on\nestablished twoport network theory along with component and board modeling\ntechniques that have been validated through measurements on demonstrative\ncircuits. This paper will show that the NICE method works for any transient\nevent that can be captured on a digital oscilloscope. Limitations of the method\nand underlying measurements are noted where appropriate. The method is applied\nto a simple PDN with an arbitrary load, and the NICE-derived current waveform\nis verified against an independent measurement by sense resistor. With careful\ncomponent and board modeling, it is possible to calculate current waveforms\nwith a root mean square error of less than five percent compared to the\nreference measurement. Current transients that were previously difficult or\nimpossible to characterize by any means can now be calculated and displayed\nwithin seconds of an oscilloscope-trigger event by using NICE.

This original board design was then rebuilt using a\ndifferent fabricator, and the test results revealed a significant decrease in\nthe bandwidth of the vias. These results led to the development of a set of\ndesign specifications that PCB vendors can easily validate, which will ensure\nthat the use of high layer-count boards with PTH technology are viable for\nemerging 112 Gb/s PAM-4 links.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 19:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

However, the obstacles related to quantum software development are an\nactual challenge to overcome. In particular, there is a discrepant lack of\ntrained and skilled workforce to implement new quantum software on the recent\nquantum hardware. In this scenario, this work presents a didactic\nimplementation of the quantum search algorithm in Atos Quantum Assembly\nLanguage (AQASM). In addition, we present the creation of a virtual quantum\nprocessor whose configurable architecture allows the analysis of induced\nquantum noise effects on the quantum algorithms. The codes are available\nthroughout the manuscript so that readers, even those with little scientific\ncomputing experience, can replicate them and apply the methods discussed in\nthis article to solve their own quantum computing projects. The presented\nresults are consistent with theoretical predictions and demonstrate that AQASM\nand myQLM are powerful tools for teaching quantum computing and building,\nimplementing, and simulating quantum hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 22:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

In particular, we have introduced\n(in a 2012 DesignCon paper) a zero sum (ZS) signaling method which uses\nbalanced or nearly-balanced coding to reduce simultaneous switching noise (SSN)\nin a single-ended bus to a level comparable to that of differential signaling.\nWhile several balanced coding schemes are known, few papers exist that describe\nthe necessary digital hardware implementations of (known) balanced coding\nschemes, and no algorithms had previously been developed for nearly-balanced\ncoding. In this work, we extend a known balanced coding scheme to accommodate\nnearly-balanced coding and demonstrate a range of coding and decoding circuits\nthrough synthesis in 65 nm CMOS.
