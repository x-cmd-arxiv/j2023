First, the deformable mixer encoder contains two types of operators:\nthe channel-aware mixing operator leveraged to allow communication among\ndifferent channels ($i.e.,$ efficient channel location mixing), and the\nspatial-aware deformable operator with deformable convolution applied to\nefficiently sample more informative spatial locations (i.e., deformed\nfeatures). Second, the task-aware transformer decoder consists of the task\ninteraction block and task query block. The former is applied to capture task\ninteraction features via self-attention. The latter leverages the deformed\nfeatures and task-interacted features to generate the corresponding\ntask-specific feature through a query-based Transformer for corresponding task\npredictions. Extensive experiments on two dense image prediction datasets,\nNYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context, demonstrate that our model uses fewer GFLOPs and\nsignificantly outperforms current Transformer- and CNN-based competitive models\non a variety of metrics.

The rate of volcanism\ndepends on the interior evolution and on numerous feedback processes between\natmosphere and interior, which continuously shape atmospheric composition,\npressure, and temperature.

We find that the\nMahalanobis distance is unable to distinguish between different morphologies,\nand that the initial conditions of the N-body simulations cannot be constrained\nusing only the Mahalanobis distance or density. Furthermore, we find that the\nmore dimensions in the phase space the less effective the Mahalanobis density\nis at distinguishing between different initial conditions. We show that a\ncombination of the mean three-dimensional (x, y, z) Mahalanobis density and the\nQ-parameter for a region can constrain its initial virial state.

A pivotal assumption for this framework\nis that the servers are exchangeable. However, modern data-centers have data\nlocality constraints, where tasks of a particular type can only be routed to a\nsmall subset of servers. An emerging line of research, therefore, considers\nload balancing algorithms on bipartite graphs where vertices in the two\npartitions represent the task types and servers, respectively, and an edge\nrepresents the server's ability to process the corresponding task type. Due to\nthe lack of exchangeability in this model, the mean-field techniques\nfundamentally break down. Recent progress has been made by considering graphs\nwith strong edge-expansion properties, i.e., where any two large subsets of\nvertices are well-connected. However, data locality often leads to spatial\nconstraints, where edges are local. As a result, these bipartite graphs do not\nhave strong expansion properties.\n  In this paper, we consider the power-of-$d$ choices algorithm and develop a\nnovel coupling-based approach to establish mean-field approximation for a large\nclass of graphs that includes spatial graphs. As a corollary, we also show\nthat, as the system size becomes large, the steady-state occupancy process for\narbitrary regular bipartite graphs with diverging degrees, is indistinguishable\nfrom a fully flexible system on a complete bipartite graph. The method extends\nthe scope of mean-field analysis far beyond the classical full-flexibility\nsetup. En route, we prove that, starting from suitable states, the occupancy\nprocess becomes close to its steady state in a time that is independent of $N$.\nSuch a large-scale mixing-time result might be of independent interest.\nNumerical experiments are conducted, which positively support the theoretical\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 16:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Aided by the graph-theoretic tools,\ntime-varying graph models have the ability to capture the underlying structure\nof the data associated with multiple nodes of a graph -- a feat that is hard to\naccomplish using standard signal processing approaches. The aim of this\ncontribution is to propose a method for the decomposition of time-varying graph\nsignals into a set of graph modes. The graph modes can be interpreted in terms\nof their temporal, spectral and topological characteristics. From the temporal\n(spectral) viewpoint, the graph modes represent the finite number of\noscillatory signal components (output of multiple band-pass filters whose\ncenter frequencies and bandwidths are learned in a fully data-driven manner),\nsimilar in properties to those obtained from the empirical mode decomposition\nand related approaches.

In order to estimate the graph modes, a\nvariational optimization formulation is designed that includes necessary\ntemporal, spectral and topological requirements relevant to the graph modes. An\nefficient method to solve that problem is developed which is based on the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the primal-dual\noptimization approach.

However, external cues can be unreliable or too costly to\nuse. We consider an alternative strategy where organisms exploit internal\nsources of information. Even without sensing environmental cues, their internal\nstates may become correlated with the environment as a result of selection,\nwhich then form a memory that helps predict future conditions. To demonstrate\nthe adaptive value of such internal memory in varying environments, we revisit\nthe classic example of seed dormancy in annual plants. Previous studies have\nconsidered the germination fraction of seeds and its dependence on\nenvironmental cues. In contrast, we consider a model of germination fraction\nthat depends on the seed age, which is an internal state that can serve as a\nmemory. We show that, if the environmental variation has temporal structure,\nthen age-dependent germination fractions will allow the population to have an\nincreased long-term growth rate.

Diverse digital resources, including identities,\ncontents, services, and supporting data, are key components of the\nsub-metaverse. Therefore, a Domain Name System (DNS)-like system is necessary\nfor efficient management and resolution. However, the legacy DNS was designed\nwith security vulnerabilities and trust risks due to centralized issues.\nBlockchain is used to mitigate these concerns due to its decentralized\nfeatures. Additionally, it supports identity management as a default feature,\nmaking it a natural fit for the metaverse. While there are several DNS\nalternatives based on the blockchain, they either manage only a single type of\nidentifiers or isolate identities from other sorts of identifiers, making it\ndifficult for sub-metaverses to coexist and connect with each other. This paper\nproposes a Multi-Identifier management and resolution System (MIS) in the\nmetaverse, supporting the registration, resolution, and inter-translation\nfunctions. The basic MIS is portrayed as a four-tier architecture on a\nconsortium blockchain due to its manageability, enhanced security, and\nefficiency properties.

The resource data is\nencrypted based on the attributes of the sub-metaverse in the storage tier for\nprivacy protection and access control.

It operates\nby seeding faults into the programs under test and asking developers to write\ntests that reveal these faults.

To this end, mutation testing should seed faults that are\nboth \"natural\" in a sense easily understood by developers and strong (have high\nchances to reveal faults). To achieve this we propose using pre-trained\ngenerative language models (i.e. CodeBERT) that have the ability to produce\ndeveloper-like code that operates similarly, but not exactly, as the target\ncode. This means that the models have the ability to seed natural faults,\nthereby offering opportunities to perform mutation testing.

However, distribution of\nthe Neumann data on subsets of a side is not well understood, and elementary\nmethods do not appear to give enough information to draw conclusions.\n  In the present note, we first show that an ``obvious'' conjecture fails even\nfor the simplest right isosceles triangle using only Fourier series. We then\nuse a result of Marklof-Rudnick \\cite{Marklof-Rudnick} in which the authors\nshow an interior {\\it spatial} equidistribution law for a density-one\nsubsequence of eigenfunctions to give an estimate on energy distribution of\neigenfunctions on the interior. Finally we present some numerical computations\nsuggesting the behaviour of eigenfunctions on almost isosceles triangles is\nquite complicated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 18:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

In this work we implant Er$^{3+}$ into CaWO$_4$, a material that\ncombines a non-polar site symmetry, low decoherence from nuclear spins, and is\nfree of background rare earth ions, to realize significantly reduced optical\nspectral diffusion. For shallow implanted ions coupled to nanophotonic cavities\nwith large Purcell factor, we observe single-scan optical linewidths of 150 kHz\nand long-term spectral diffusion of 63 kHz, both close to the Purcell-enhanced\nradiative linewidth of 21 kHz. This enables the observation of Hong-Ou-Mandel\ninterference between successively emitted photons with high visibility,\nmeasured after a 36 km delay line.

Motivated by\nthis inconsistency, we propose an NAG method that unifies the existing ones for\nthe convex and strongly convex cases. We first design a Lagrangian function\nthat continuously extends the first Bregman Lagrangian to the strongly convex\nsetting. As a specific case of the Euler--Lagrange equation for this\nLagrangian, we derive an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, which we\ncall the unified NAG ODE, that bridges the gap between the ODEs that model NAG\nfor convex and strongly convex objective functions. We then design the unified\nNAG, a novel momentum method whereby the continuous-time limit corresponds to\nthe unified ODE. The coefficients and the convergence rates of the unified NAG\nand unified ODE are continuous in the strong convexity parameter $\\mu$ on $[0,\n+\\infty)$. Unlike the existing popular algorithm and ODE for strongly convex\nobjective functions, the unified NAG and the unified NAG ODE always have\nsuperior convergence guarantees compared to the known algorithms and ODEs for\nnon-strongly convex objective functions. This property is beneficial in\npractical perspective when considering strongly convex objective functions with\nsmall $\\mu$. Furthermore, we extend our unified dynamics and algorithms to the\nhigher-order setting. Last but not least, we propose the unified NAG-G ODE, a\nnovel ODE model for minimizing the gradient norm of strongly convex objective\nfunctions. Our unified Lagrangian framework is crucial in the process of\nconstructing this ODE. Fascinatingly, using our novel tool, called the\ndifferential kernel, we observe that the unified NAG ODE and the unified NAG-G\nODE have an anti-transpose relationship.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 18:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Building on previous work where the\ndriving radiation field is static, we compute a time-dependent radiation flux\nfrom the local, variable accretion rate of the disc. We find that prior to the\nestablishment of a steady state in the disc, variations of ~ 15% in disc\nluminosity correlate with variations of ~ 2-3 in the mass flux of the wind.\nAfter a steady state is reached, when luminosity variations drop to ~ 3%, these\ncorrelations vanish as the variability in the mass flux is dominated by the\nintrinsic variability of the winds. This is especially evident in lower\nluminosity runs where intrinsic variability is higher due to a greater\nprevalence of failed winds. The changing mass flux occurs primarily due to the\nformation of clumps and voids near the disc atmosphere that propagate out into\nthe low velocity part of the flow, a process that can be influenced by local\nvariations in disc intensity. By computing the normalised standard deviation of\nthe mass outflow, we show that the impact of luminosity variations on mass\noutflow is more visible at higher luminosity. However, the absolute change in\nmass outflow due to luminosity increases is larger for lower luminosity models\ndue to the luminosity-mass flux scaling relation becoming steeper.

Prior works in vehicle anomaly\ndetection have shown that modeling interactions between agents improves\ndetection accuracy, but certain abnormal behaviors where structured road\ninformation is paramount are poorly identified, such as wrong-way and off-road\ndriving. We propose a novel unsupervised framework for highway anomaly\ndetection named Structural Attention-Based Recurrent VAE (SABeR-VAE), which\nexplicitly uses the structure of the environment to aid anomaly identification.\nSpecifically, we use a vehicle self-attention module to learn the relations\namong vehicles on a road, and a separate lane-vehicle attention module to model\nthe importance of permissible lanes to aid in trajectory prediction.\nConditioned on the attention modules' outputs, a recurrent encoder-decoder\narchitecture with a stochastic Koopman operator-propagated latent space\npredicts the next states of vehicles. Our model is trained end-to-end to\nminimize prediction loss on normal vehicle behaviors, and is deployed to detect\nanomalies in (ab)normal scenarios. By combining the heterogeneous vehicle and\nlane information, SABeR-VAE and its deterministic variant, SABeR-AE, improve\nabnormal AUPR by 18% and 25% respectively on the simulated MAAD highway dataset\nover STGAE-KDE. Furthermore, we show that the learned Koopman operator in\nSABeR-VAE enforces interpretable structure in the variational latent space.

Although the tool is currently limited to GPUs, it can be extended to\nsupport other OpenMP-capable devices. The tool has two modes: Training mode and\nPrediction mode. The training mode must be executed on the target hardware. It\ntakes benchmark codes as input, generates and executes every variant of the\ncode that could possibly run on the target device, and then collects data from\nall of the executed codes to train an ML-based cost model for use in prediction\nmode. However, in prediction mode the tool does not need any interaction with\nthe target device.

The event was associated\nwith an M1.6 flare, a coronal mass ejection (CME) and a shock wave. During the\nevent, high-energy protons and electrons were recorded by multiple instruments\nlocated within a narrow longitudinal cone. An interesting aspect of the event\nwas the multi-stage particle energization during the flare impulsive phase and\nalso what appears to be a separate phase of electron acceleration detected at\nSolO after the flare maximum. We aim to investigate and identify the multiple\nsources of energetic electron acceleration. We utilize SEP electron\nobservations from the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) and hard X-ray (HXR)\nobservations from the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on-board\nSolO, in combination with radio observations at a broad frequency range. We\nfocus on establishing an association between the energetic electrons and the\ndifferent HXR and radio emissions associated with the multiple acceleration\nepisodes. We have found that the flare was able to accelerate electrons for at\nleast 20 minutes during the nonthermal phase observed in the form of five\ndiscrete HXR pulses. We also show evidence that the shock wave has contributed\nto the electron acceleration during and after the impulsive flare phase. The\ndetailed analysis of EPD electron data shows that there was a time difference\nin the release of low- and high-energy electrons, with the high-energy release\ndelayed. Also, the observed electron anisotropy characteristics suggest\ndifferent connectivity during the two phases of acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 19:42:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 08:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

One drawback of the traditional attribute hierarchy\nmethod is that its parameter complexity varies substantially with the\nhierarchy's graph structure, lacking statistical parsimony.

While this effect has been\nstudied in galaxy pairs, the frequency of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in fully\ncoalesced post-merger systems is poorly constrained due to the limited size or\nimpurity of extant post-merger samples. Previously, we combined convolutional\nneural network (CNN) predictions with visual classifications to identify a\nhighly pure sample of 699 post-mergers in deep r-band imaging. In the work\npresented here, we quantify the frequency of AGN in this sample using three\nmetrics: optical emission lines, mid-infrared (mid- IR) colour, and radio\ndetection of low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs). We also compare the\nfrequency of AGN in post-mergers to that in a sample of spectroscopically\nidentified galaxy pairs.

Typically,\napproximately 10 - 20 % of all clusters detected in spiral galaxies can have\nages that are incorrect by a factor of ten or more. In this paper we present a\npilot study for four galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1433, NGC 1365, and NGC 3351) from\nthe PHANGS-HST survey. We describe methods to correct the age-dating for old\nglobular clusters, by first identifying candidates using their colors, and then\nreassigning ages and reddening based on a lower metallicity solution. We find\nthat young $`$interlopers$'$ can be identified from their Halpha flux. CO (2-1)\nintensity or the presence of dust can also be used, but our tests show that\nthey do not work as well.

Atom-like emitters in diamond have emerged as a leading\nsystem for optically networked quantum memories, motivating the development of\nvisible-spectrum, multi-channel photonic integrated circuit (PIC) systems for\nscalable atom control. However, it has remained an open challenge to realize\noptical programmability with a qubit layer that can achieve high optical\ndetection probability over many optical channels. Here, we address this problem\nby introducing a modular architecture of piezoelectrically-actuated\natom-control PICs (APICs) and artificial atoms embedded in diamond\nnanostructures designed for high-efficiency free-space collection. The\nhigh-speed 4-channel APIC is based on a splitting tree mesh with triple-phase\nshifter Mach-Zehnder interferometers.

There exist many mathematical proofs, but they tend to involve several\nanalytical steps or geometrical constructions, making them unintuitive and hard\nto understand. Here, a simpler explanation is presented which only requires\nfollowing the paths of light rays, and examining local paths that move from one\npoint on a conic to a nearby one. First, a light-ray is followed as it runs\nalong one of the legs of an isosceles triangle, and then reflects off a mirror\nthat is parallel to the triangle's base. It bounces back along the path of the\ntriangle's other leg. Next, a path is examined, moving from an arbitrary point\non a conic section curve to a nearby point on the same curve. This path\nconsists of two equal-length straight line steps, with each step following one\nof the constraints that defines the curve. For example, on an ellipse, defined\nby the sum of the distances to the two foci remaining constant, the path starts\nat a point on the ellipse, moves a distance delta directly away from one focus,\nthen makes a second equal-length step directly towards the second focus. These\ntwo steps form the legs of precisely the sort of isosceles triangle described\nabove, with its base running along the path of the curve. A light ray following\nthe legs of that triangle gets reflected directly from one focus to the other.\nAs the triangle shrinks towards zero, the reflection point converges onto the\nactual curve. Exactly the same argument also explains the reflections of\nparabolas and hyperbolas. Surprisingly, this explanation does not seem to have\nappeared previously in the long history of writings about conics. It is hoped\nthat it will help to make the reflective properties of conic sections easier to\nunderstand and to explain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 21:53:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 18:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Double truncation generally induces a sampling bias on the target\nvariable, so proper corrections of ordinary estimation and inference procedures\nmust be used. Unfortunately, the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of\na doubly truncated distribution has several drawbacks, like potential\nnon-existence and non-uniqueness issues, or large estimation variance.\nInterestingly, no correction for double truncation is needed when the sampling\nbias is ignorable, which may occur with interval sampling and other sampling\ndesigns. In such a case the ordinary empirical distribution function is a\nconsistent and fully efficient estimator that generally brings remarkable\nvariance improvements compared to the nonparametric maximum likelihood\nestimator. Thus, identification of such situations is critical for the simple\nand efficient estimation of the target distribution. In this paper we introduce\nfor the first time formal testing procedures for the null hypothesis of\nignorable sampling bias with doubly truncated data. The asymptotic properties\nof the proposed test statistic are investigated. A bootstrap algorithm to\napproximate the null distribution of the test in practice is introduced.

An element sensitivity correction scheme\nwas also performed to further improve the image quality of PD images using NSI.\nFirst, a microbubble trace experiment was performed to quantitatively evaluate\nthe performance of NSI based PD. Then, both contrast-enhanced and contrast free\nultrasound data were collected from a rat brain. Higher spatial resolution and\nimage quality were observed from the NSI-based PD microvessel images compared\nto microvessel images generated by traditional DAS-based beamforming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2023 23:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

We\npropose a new algorithm, SAFFE, that makes fair allocations with respect to the\nentire demands revealed over the horizon by accounting for expected future\ndemands at each arrival time. The algorithm introduces regularization which\nenables the prioritization of current revealed demands over future potential\ndemands depending on the uncertainty in agents' future demands.

Such vulnerability provides new security breaches to\nmalicious devices for hampering wireless network security, such as\nmalfunctioning geofencing or asset management. The prior adversarial attack on\nlocalization DNNs uses additive perturbations on channel state information\n(CSI) measurements, which is impractical in Wi-Fi transmissions.

While this generally improves performance on average,\nthe extra neurons do not yield a consistent improvement for all instances. This\nis because some hidden neurons are redundant, and the noise mixed in input\nneurons tends to distract the model. Previous work mainly focuses on\nextrinsically reducing low-utility neurons by additional post- or\npre-processing, such as network pruning and context selection, to avoid this\nproblem. Beyond that, can we make the model reduce redundant parameters and\nsuppress input noise by intrinsically enhancing the utility of each neuron? If\na model can efficiently utilize neurons, no matter which neurons are ablated\n(disabled), the ablated submodel should perform no better than the original\nfull model. Based on such a comparison principle between models, we propose a\ncross-model comparative loss for a broad range of tasks. Comparative loss is\nessentially a ranking loss on top of the task-specific losses of the full and\nablated models, with the expectation that the task-specific loss of the full\nmodel is minimal.

Data science represents a field\nseeing an exponential rise in papers, and increasingly drawing on and being\napplied in numerous diverse disciplines.

Existing methods model sessions as\ngraphs or sequences to estimate user interests based on their interacted items\nto make recommendations. In recent years, graph-based methods have achieved\noutstanding performance on SBR. However, none of these methods consider\ntemporal information, which is a crucial feature in SBR as it indicates\ntimeliness or currency. Besides, the session graphs exhibit a hierarchical\nstructure and are demonstrated to be suitable in hyperbolic geometry. But few\npapers design the models in hyperbolic spaces and this direction is still under\nexploration. In this paper, we propose Time-aware Hyperbolic Graph Attention\nNetwork (TA-HGAT) - a novel hyperbolic graph neural network framework to build\na session-based recommendation model considering temporal information. More\nspecifically, there are three components in TA-HGAT. First, a hyperbolic\nprojection module transforms the item features into hyperbolic space. Second,\nthe time-aware graph attention module models time intervals between items and\nthe users' current interests. Third, an evolutionary loss at the end of the\nmodel provides an accurate prediction of the recommended item based on the\ngiven timestamp. TA-HGAT is built in a hyperbolic space to learn the\nhierarchical structure of session graphs. Experimental results show that the\nproposed TA-HGAT has the best performance compared to ten baseline models on\ntwo real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 04:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

Hence, the actual stop sequences chosen by an\nexperienced human driver may be potentially preferable to the theoretical\nshortest-distance routing under real-life operational conditions. Thus, being\nable to predict the actual stop sequence that a human driver would follow can\nhelp to improve route planning in last-mile delivery. This paper proposes a\npair-wise attention-based pointer neural network for this prediction task using\ndrivers' historical delivery trajectory data. In addition to the commonly used\nencoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence prediction, we propose a\nnew attention mechanism based on an alternative specific neural network to\ncapture the local pair-wise information for each pair of stops. To further\ncapture the global efficiency of the route, we propose a new iterative sequence\ngeneration algorithm that is used after model training to identify the first\nstop of a route that yields the lowest operational cost.

It is based on\nalgebraic approach where the starting point is an associative algebra with\ninvolution and states are defined as positive linear functionals on this\nalgebra and on geometric approach where the starting point is a set of states\nconsidered as a convex subset of linear space. The exposition does not depend\non textbooks in quantum mechanics. Standard formulas for quantum probabilities\nare derived from decoherence. This derivation allows us to go beyond quantum\ntheory in geometric approach. Particles are defined as elementary excitations\nof ground state (and quasiparticles as elementary excitations of any\ntranslation invariant state). It follows from this definition that the notion\nof identical particles is very natural. The scattering of particles is analyzed\nin the framework of generalization of Haag-Ruelle theory. The conventional\nscattering matrix does not work for quasiparticles (and even for particles if\nthe theory does not have particle interpretation). The analysis of scattering\nin these cases is based on the notion of inclusive scattering matrix, closely\nrelated to inclusive cross-sections. It is proven that the conventional\nscattering matrix can be expressed in terms of Green functions (LSZ formula)\nanf inclusive scattering matrix can be expressed in terms of generalized Green\nfunctions that appear in the Keldysh formalism of non-equilibrium statistical\nphysics. It is shown that generalized Green functions and inclusive scattering\nmatrices appear also in the formalism of L-functionals that can be identified\nwith positive functionals on Weyl or Clifford algebras. The derivation of the\nexpression of the evolution operator and other physical quantities in terms of\nfunctional integrals is based on the notion of symbol of operator; these\narguments can be applied also in geometric approach. This result can be used,\nin particular, to give a simple derivation of diagram technique for generalized\nGreen functions. The notion of inclusive scattering matrix makes sense in\ngeometric approach (but it seems that one cannot give a definition of\nconventional scattering matrix in this situation).

We formulate the probability of each individual's\narrival time at a destination based on their path choice behavior, and estimate\ncorresponding path choice model parameters as a maximum likelihood estimation\nproblem.

We\nintegrate the polydisperse pebble accretion numerically for the MRN\ndistribution, finding a slight decrease (by an exact factor 3/7) in the Hill\nregime compared to the monodisperse case. In contrast, in the Bondi regime, we\nfind 1-2 orders of magnitude higher accretion rates compared to monodisperse,\nalso extending the onset of pebble accretion to 1-2 order of magnitude lower in\nmass. We find Myr-timescales, within the disk lifetime, for Bondi accretion on\ntop of planetary seeds of masses $10^{-6}-10^{-4} M_\\oplus$, over a significant\nrange of the parameter space. This mass range overlaps with the high mass end\nof the planetesimal initial mass function, and thus pebble accretion is\npossible directly following formation by streaming instability. This alleviates\nthe need for mutual planetesimal collisions as a major contribution to\nplanetary growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 07:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

While such adversarial approaches achieve\ndomain-level alignment, they ignore the class (label) shift. When\nclass-conditional data distributions are significantly different between the\nsource and target domain, it can generate ambiguous features near class\nboundaries that are more likely to be misclassified.

While the adversarial\ncomponent facilitates domain-level alignment, two-stage contrastive learning\nexploits class information to achieve higher intra-class compactness across\ndomains resulting in well-separated decision boundaries. Furthermore, the\nproposed contrastive framework is designed as a plug-and-play module that can\nbe easily embedded with existing adversarial methods for domain adaptation.

To this end, many works dedicate to integrate diverse information\nfrom consecutive frames to enhance the features for prediction, where a feature\nalignment procedure via estimated optical flow is usually required. However,\nthe optical flow would inevitably suffer from inaccuracy, and then introduce\nnoises in feature fusion and further result in unsatisfactory segmentation\nresults. In this paper, to tackle the misalignment issue, we propose a\nspatial-temporal fusion (STF) module to model dense pairwise relationships\namong multi-frame features. Different from previous methods, STF uniformly and\nadaptively fuses features at different spatial and temporal positions, and\navoids error-prone optical flow estimation. Besides, we further exploit feature\nrefinement within a single frame and propose a novel memory-augmented\nrefinement (MAR) module to tackle difficult predictions among semantic\nboundaries. Specifically, MAR can store the boundary features and prototypes\nextracted from the training samples, which together form the task-specific\nmemory, and then use them to refine the features during inference. Essentially,\nMAR can move the hard features closer to the most likely category and thus make\nthem more discriminative.

Long reads that can span repeat regions, along\nwith an accurate alignment of these long reads play an important role in\nidentifying novel SVs. Long read sequencers such as nanopore sequencing can\naddress this problem by providing very long reads but with high error rates,\nmaking accurate alignment challenging. Many errors induced by nanopore\nsequencing have a bias because of the physics of the sequencing process and\nproper utilization of these error characteristics can play an important role in\ndesigning a robust aligner for SV detection problems. In this paper, we design\nand evaluate HQAlign, an aligner for SV detection using nanopore sequenced\nreads. The key ideas of HQAlign include (i) using basecalled nanopore reads\nalong with the nanopore physics to improve alignments for SVs (ii)\nincorporating SV specific changes to the alignment pipeline (iii) adapting\nthese into existing state-of-the-art long read aligner pipeline, minimap2\n(v2.24), for efficient alignments.\n  Results: We show that HQAlign captures about 4%-6% complementary SVs across\ndifferent datasets which are missed by minimap2 alignments while having a\nstandalone performance at par with minimap2 for real nanopore reads data. For\nthe common SV calls between HQAlign and minimap2, HQAlign improves the start\nand the end breakpoint accuracy for about 10%-50% of SVs across different\ndatasets.

This shortcut learning behaviour is detrimental to a network's ability\nto generalize to an unknown test-time distribution in which the spurious\ncorrelations do not hold anymore. Debiasing methods were developed to make\nnetworks robust to such spurious biases but require to know in advance if a\ndataset is biased and make heavy use of minority counterexamples that do not\ndisplay the majority bias of their class. In this paper, we argue that such\nsamples should not be necessarily needed because the ''hidden'' causal\ninformation is often also contained in biased images. To study this idea, we\npropose 3 publicly released synthetic classification benchmarks, exhibiting\npredictive classification shortcuts, each of a different and challenging\nnature, without any minority samples acting as counterexamples. First, we\ninvestigate the effectiveness of several state-of-the-art strategies on our\nbenchmarks and show that they do not yield satisfying results on them. Then, we\npropose an architecture able to succeed on our benchmarks, despite their\nunusual properties, using an entropic adversarial data augmentation training\nscheme.

A precise control\nof the information destroyed, via a disentangling process, enables us to remove\nthe shortcut and leave everything else intact. Furthermore, results competitive\nwith the state-of-the-art on the BAR dataset ensure the applicability of our\nmethod in real-life situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 08:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

Can data\nfrom LCS be used to identify hotspots and generate generalizable pollutant\nconcentration maps? To help address these questions we deployed low-cost PM2.5\nsensors (Alphasense OPC-N3) and a research-grade instrument (TSI DustTrak) in a\nmobile laboratory in Boston, MA, USA. We first collocated these instruments\nwith stationary PM2.5 reference monitors at nearby regulatory sites.

Along this line, researchers have considered fair versions of\ntraditional optimization problems including clustering, regression, ranking and\nvoting. However, most of the efforts have been channeled into designing\nheuristic algorithms, which often do not provide any guarantees on the quality\nof the solution. In this work, we study matching problems with the notion of\nproportional fairness. Proportional fairness is one of the most popular notions\nof group fairness where every group is represented up to an extent proportional\nto the final selection size. Matching with proportional fairness or more\ncommonly, proportionally fair matching, was introduced in [Chierichetti et al.,\nAISTATS, 2019], where the problem was studied with only two groups. However, in\nmany practical applications, the number of groups -- although often a small\nconstant -- is larger than two. In this work, we make the first step towards\nunderstanding the computational complexity of proportionally fair matching with\nmore than two groups. We design exact and approximation algorithms achieving\nreasonable guarantees on the quality of the matching as well as on the time\ncomplexity. Our algorithms are also supported by suitable hardness bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 09:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

One of the most reported technical challenges for\nweb-based tests concerns how to reliably locate a web element used by a test\nscript. This paper proposes the novel concept of Visually Overlapping Nodes\n(VON) that reduces fragility by utilizing the phenomenon that visual web\nelements (observed by the user) are constructed from multiple web-elements in\nthe Document Object Model (DOM) that overlaps visually. We demonstrate the\napproach in a tool, VON Similo, which extends the state-of-the-art\nmulti-locator approach (Similo) that is also used as the baseline for an\nexperiment. In the experiment, a ground truth set of 1163 manually collected\nweb element pairs, from different releases of the 40 most popular websites on\nthe internet, are used to compare the approaches' precision, recall, and\naccuracy.

Recent\nresearch has seen a significant effort around black-box recommender based\napproaches such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These advances have led,\ntogether with the increasing concerns around users' data collection and\nprivacy, to a strong interest in building responsible recommender systems. A\nkey element of a successful music recommender system is modelling how users\ninteract with streamed content. By first understanding these interactions,\ninsights can be drawn to enable the construction of more transparent and\nresponsible systems. An example of these interactions is skipping behaviour, a\nsignal that can measure users' satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or lack of\ninterest. In this paper, we study the utility of users' historical data for the\ntask of sequentially predicting users' skipping behaviour. To this end, we\nadapt DRL for this classification task, followed by a post-hoc explainability\n(SHAP) and ablation analysis of the input state representation. Experimental\nresults from a real-world music streaming dataset (Spotify) demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach in this task by outperforming state-of-the-art\nmodels. A comprehensive analysis of our approach and of users' historical data\nreveals a temporal data leakage problem in the dataset. Our findings indicate\nthat, overall, users' behaviour features are the most discriminative in how our\nproposed DRL model predicts music skips. Content and contextual features have a\nlesser effect. This suggests that a limited amount of user data should be\ncollected and leveraged to predict skipping behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 10:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

However, since the inception\nof such numerical approaches, it is well known that bias might affect both the\nestimation of errors on these tallies and the tallies themselves. In\nparticular, stochastic modeling approaches developed in the past decade have\nshed light on the prominent role played by spatial correlations through a\nphenomenon called neutron clustering. This effect is particularly of great\nsignificance when simulating loosely coupled systems (i.e., with a high\ndominance ratio). In order to tackle this problem, this paper proposes to\nrecast the power iteration technique of Monte Carlo criticality codes into a\nvariance reduction technique called Adaptative Multilevel Splitting. The\ncentral idea is that iterating over neutron generations can be seen as pushing\na sub-population of neutrons towards a generational detector (instead of a\nspatial detector as variance reduction techniques usually do). While both\napproaches allow for neutron population control, the former blindly removes or\nsplits neutrons. In contrast, the latter optimizes spatial, generational, and\nspectral attributes of neutrons when they are removed or split through an\nadjoint flux estimation, hence tempering both generational and spatial\ncorrelations. This is illustrated in the present article with a simple case of\na bare slab reactor in the one speed theory on which the Adaptive Multilevel\nSplitting was applied and compared to variations of the Monte Carlo power\niteration method used in neutron transport. Besides looking at the resulting\nefficiency of the methods, this work also aims at highlighting the main\nmechanisms of the Adaptive Multilevel Splitting in criticality calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 10:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

Our analysis rests upon the\nHubble tension (HT), which is a discrepancy between the observational\ndetermination of the Hubble parameter via data from the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae, respectively. While the latter\napproach is model-independent, the former highly depends on the model used to\ndescribe the physics of the early Universe. Motivated by the HT, we take into\naccount two recently introduced cosmological models as test frameworks of the\npre-CMB era. These settings involve local Lorentz and diffeomorphism violation\nparameterized by nondynamical SME background fields $s_{00}$ and $s^{ij}$,\nrespectively. We aim at explaining the tension in the measured results of the\ncosmic expansion rate in early and late epochs by resorting to these two\nmodified cosmologies as potential descriptions of the pre-CMB era. As long as\nthe HT does not turn out to be a merely systematic effect, it can serve as a\ncriterion for exploring regions of the parameter space in certain pre-CMB\nnew-physics candidates such as SME cosmologies. By setting extracted limits on\nSME coefficients into perspective with already existing bounds in the\nliterature, we infer that none of the aforementioned models are suitable\npre-CMB candidates for fixing the HT. In this way, new physics arising from the\nparticular realizations of Lorentz and diffeomorphism violation studied in this\npaper does not explain the HT.

Then,\nthe director network is trained to have the ability to discriminate high and\nlow quality actions and guide the actor network to reduce the repetitive\nexploration of low quality actions in the early stage of training.

BTB capacity is crucial for performance as a sufficiently large\nBTB enables the front-end to accurately resolve the upcoming execution path and\nsteer instruction fetch appropriately. Moreover, it also enables highly\neffective fetch-directed instruction prefetching that can eliminate a large\nportion L1-I misses. For these reasons, commercial processors allocate vast\namounts of storage capacity to BTBs.\n  This work aims to reduce BTB storage requirements by optimizing the\norganization of BTB entries. Our key insight is that storing branch target\noffsets, instead of full or compressed targets, can drastically reduce BTB\nstorage cost as the vast majority of dynamic branches have short offsets\nrequiring just a handful of bits to encode. Based on this insight, we size the\nways of a set associative BTB to hold different number of target offset bits\nsuch that each way stores offsets within a particular range. Doing so enables a\ndramatic reduction in storage for target addresses. Our final design, called\nBTB-X, uses an 8-way set associative BTB with differently sized ways that\nenables it to track about 2.24x more branches than a conventional BTB and 1.3x\nmore branches than a storage-optimized state-of-the-art BTB organization,\ncalled PDede, with the same storage budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 10:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

The cutwidth of\nan ordering is the maximum cutwidth of any vertex with respect to this\nordering. We are interested in finding the cutwidth of a graph, that is, the\nminimum cutwidth over all orderings, which is an NP-hard problem. In order to\napproximate the cutwidth of a given graph, we present a semidefinite\nrelaxation. We identify several classes of valid inequalities and equalities\nthat we use to strengthen the semidefinite relaxation. These classes are on the\none hand the well-known 3-dicycle equations and the triangle inequalities and\non the other hand we obtain inequalities from the squared linear ordering\npolytope and via lifting the linear ordering polytope. The solution of the\nsemidefinite program serves to obtain a lower bound and also to construct a\nfeasible solution and thereby having an upper bound on the cutwidth.\n  In order to evaluate the quality of our bounds, we perform numerical\nexperiments on graphs of different sizes and densities.

The ``MALTA-Czochralski (MALTA-Cz)'' full size DMAPS sensor has\nbeen developed with the goal to demonstrate a radiation hard, thin CMOS sensor\nwith high granularity, high hit-rate capability, fast response time and\nsuperior radiation tolerance. The small pixel size ($36.4\\times\n36.4$~$\\mu$m$^2$) provides high spatial resolution. Its asynchronous readout\narchitecture is designed for high hit-rates and fast time response in triggered\nand trigger-less detector applications. The readout architecture is designed to\nstream all hit data to the multi-channel output which allows an off-sensor\ntrigger formation and the use of hit-time information for event tagging.\n  The sensor manufacturing has been optimised through process adaptation and\nspecial implant designs to allow the manufacturing of small electrode DMAPS on\nthick high-resistivity p-type Czochralski substrate. The special processing\nensures excellent charge collection and charge particle detection efficiency\neven after a high level of radiation. Furthermore the special implant design\nand use of a Czochralski substrate improves the sensor's time resolution. This\npaper presents a summary of sensor design optimisation through process and\nimplant choices and TCAD simulation to model the signal response. Beam and\nlaboratory test results on unirradiated and irradiated sensors have shown\nexcellent detection efficiency after a dose of $2\\times10^{15}$ 1 MeV\nn$_{eq}$/cm$^{2}$.

We present a\nconsensus algorithm-based phase identification mechanism which uses multiple\nthree-phase reference points to improve the prediction of phases.

To utilize\nstrongly correlated measurements, the DN is clustered into zones. We observe\nthose reference measurements located in the same zone as the single-phase\nconsumer leads to accurate prediction of DN phases. Four consensus algorithms\nare developed and compared.

The foils' surface roughness is altered by changing the distribution\nof spherical-cap shaped elements over the propulsor area. We find that the\naddition of surface roughness does not improve the performance compared to a\nsmooth surface over the Re range considered. The analysis of the flow fields\nshows near identical wakes regardless of the foil's surface roughness. The\nperformance reduction mainly occurs due to an increase in profile drag.\nHowever, we find that the drag penalty due to roughness is reduced from 76% for\na static foil to 16% for a flapping foil at the same mean angle of attack, with\nthe strongest decrease measured at the highest Re. Our findings highlight that\nthe effect of roughness on dynamic systems is very different than that on\nstatic systems, thereby, cannot be accounted for by only using information\nobtained from static cases.

However, in practice, one often receives\nchronologically new reports, which may be related to previously unseen\nlibraries. Under this practical setting, we observe that the performance of\ncurrent XML techniques declines substantially, e.g., F1 decreased from 0.7 to\n0.24 under experiments without and with consideration of chronological order of\nvulnerability reports.\n  We propose a practical library identification approach, namely CHRONOS, based\non zero-shot learning. The novelty of CHRONOS is three-fold. First, CHRONOS\nfits into the practical pipeline by considering the chronological order of\nvulnerability reports. Second, CHRONOS enriches the data of the vulnerability\ndescriptions and labels using a carefully designed data enhancement step.\nThird, CHRONOS exploits the temporal ordering of the vulnerability reports\nusing a cache to prioritize prediction of...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 12:57:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 12:48:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 07:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Most available solutions only deal with a\nspecific picking scenario, e.g., picking only a single variety of fruit in\nisolation. Nonetheless, most economically viable (e.g. high-yielding and/or\ndisease-resistant) varieties of strawberry are grown in dense clusters. The\ncurrent perception technology in such use cases is inefficient. In this work,\nwe developed a novel system capable of harvesting strawberries with several\nunique features. The features allow the system to deal with very complex\npicking scenarios, e.g. dense clusters. Our concept of a modular system makes\nour system reconfigurable to adapt to different picking scenarios. We designed,\nmanufactured, and tested a picking head with 2.5 DOF (2 independent mechanisms\nand 1 dependent cutting system) capable of removing possible occlusions and\nharvesting targeted strawberries without contacting fruit flesh to avoid damage\nand bruising. In addition, we developed a novel perception system to localise\nstrawberries and detect their key points, picking points, and determine their\nripeness.

Recent years have witnessed\nan evolution from matching networks to pre-trained language models (PrLMs). In\ncontrast to the plain-text modeling as the focus of the PrLMs, dialogue texts\ninvolve multiple speakers and reflect special characteristics such as topic\ntransitions and structure dependencies between distant utterances. However, the\nrelated PrLM models commonly represent dialogues sequentially by processing the\npairwise dialogue history as a whole. Thus the hierarchical information on\neither utterance interrelation or speaker roles coupled in such representations\nis not well addressed. In this work, we propose compositional learning for\nholistic interaction across the utterances beyond the sequential\ncontextualization from PrLMs, in order to capture the utterance-aware and\nspeaker-aware representations entailed in a dialogue history. We decouple the\ncontextualized word representations by masking mechanisms in Transformer-based\nPrLM, making each word only focus on the words in current utterance, other\nutterances, and two speaker roles (i.e., utterances of sender and utterances of\nthe receiver), respectively. In addition, we employ domain-adaptive training\nstrategies to help the model adapt to the dialogue domains.

From their inception onwards, they have\nalways had a strong relation to dynamic algorithms maintaining information,\ne.g., on planarity and triconnectivity, under edge insertion and, later on,\nalso deletion. In this paper, we focus on a special kind of dynamic update, the\nexpansion of vertices into arbitrary biconnected graphs, while maintaining the\nSPQR-tree and further information. This will also allow us to efficiently merge\ntwo SPQR-trees by identifying the edges incident to two vertices with each\nother. We do this working along an axiomatic definition lifting the SPQR-tree\nto a stand-alone data structure that can be modified independently from the\ngraph it might have been derived from. Making changes to this structure, we can\nnow observe how the graph represented by the SPQR-tree changes, instead of\nhaving to reason which updates to the SPQR-tree are necessary after a change to\nthe represented graph.\n  Using efficient expansions and merges allows us to improve the runtime of the\nSynchronized Planarity algorithm by Bl\\\"asius et al.

To avoid\ntransferring erroneous pseudo labels between these submodels, a high threshold\nis usually used to filter out a large number of low-confidence predictions for\nunlabeled data. However, such filtering can not fully exploit unlabeled data\nwith low prediction confidence. To overcome this problem, in this work, we\npropose a mutual learning framework based on pseudo-negative labels. Negative\nlabels are those that a corresponding data item does not belong. In each\niteration, one submodel generates pseudo-negative labels for each data item,\nand the other submodel learns from these labels. The role of the two submodels\nexchanges after each iteration until convergence. By reducing the prediction\nprobability on pseudo-negative labels, the dual model can improve its\nprediction ability. We also propose a mechanism to select a few pseudo-negative\nlabels to feed into submodels. In the experiments, our framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on several main benchmarks.

SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical\nTerms), Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and Gene Ontology (GO) are\npopular ontologies from the healthcare domain. SNOMED CT and UMLS capture\nconcepts such as disease, symptoms and diagnosis and GO is the world's largest\nsource of information on the functions of genes. Healthcare has been dealing\nwith an explosion in information about different types of drugs, diseases, and\nprocedures. This paper argues that using Knowledge Graphs is not the best\nsolution for solving problems in this domain. We present experiments using LLMs\nfor the healthcare domain to demonstrate that language models provide the same\nfunctionality as knowledge graphs, thereby making knowledge graphs redundant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 14:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

While prior work showed that in vanilla FL a malicious\nserver can extract users' private data from the model updates, in this work we\ntake it further and demonstrate that a malicious server can reconstruct user\ndata even in hardened versions of the protocol.

Our attack method is based on the introduction of\nsybil devices that deviate from the protocol to expose individual users' data\nfor reconstruction by the server. The underlying root cause for the\nvulnerability to our attack is a power imbalance: the server orchestrates the\nwhole protocol and users are given little guarantees about the selection of\nother users participating in the protocol. Moving forward, we discuss\nrequirements for privacy guarantees in FL. We conclude that users should only\nparticipate in the protocol when they trust the server or they apply local\nprimitives such as local DP, shifting power away from the server.

During discharge, parts\nof the lithium are not stripped reversibly and remain isolated from the current\ncollector. This isolated lithium is trapped in the insulating remaining\nsolid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) shell and contributes to the capacity loss.\nHowever, a fundamental understanding of why isolated lithium forms and how it\ncan be mitigated is lacking. In this article, we perform a combined theoretical\nand experimental study to understand isolated lithium formation during\nstripping. We derive a thermodynamic consistent model of lithium dissolution\nand find that the interaction between lithium and SEI leads to locally\npreferred stripping and isolated lithium formation. Based on a cryogenic\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM) setup, we reveal that these local\neffects are particularly pronounced at kinks of lithium whiskers. We find that\nlithium stripping can be heterogeneous both on a nanoscale and on a larger\nscale. Cryo TEM observations confirm our theoretical prediction that isolated\nlithium occurs less at higher stripping current densities. The origin of\nisolated lithium lies in local effects, such as heterogeneous SEI, stress\nfields, or the geometric shape of the deposits. We conclude that in order to\nmitigate isolated lithium, a uniform lithium morphology during plating and a\nhomogeneous SEI is indispensable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 15:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

We built a laboratory fault model from high resolution surface scans\nand micro-CT imaging. Our results show that under quasi-static shear loading,\nthe fault surface experiences local dynamic seismic activities. We found that\nthe seismic activity is related to the stress concentration on interlocking\nasperities. This interlocking behavior (i) causes stress concentration at the\nregion of contact that could reach the compressive strength, and (ii) produces\ntensile stress up to the tensile strength in the region adjacent to the contact\narea. Thus, different failure mechanisms and damage patterns including crushing\nand sub-vertical fracturing are observed on the rough surface. Asperity failure\ncreates rapid local slips resulting in significant stress perturbations that\nalter the overall stress condition and may trigger the slip of adjacent\ncritically stressed asperities.

To automatically generate such\ntype of map from a set of images captured by a vehicle, most works formulate\nthis mapping as a segmentation problem, which implies heavy post-processing to\nobtain the final vectorized representation. Alternative techniques have the\nability to generate an HD map in an end-to-end manner but rely on\ncomputationally expensive auto-regressive models. To bring camera-based to an\napplicable level, we propose InstaGraM, a fast end-to-end network generating a\nvectorized HD map via instance-level graph modeling of the map elements. Our\nstrategy consists of three main stages: top-view feature extraction, road\nelements' vertices and edges detection, and conversion to a semantic vector\nrepresentation. After top-down feature extraction, an encoder-decoder\narchitecture is utilized to predict a set of vertices and edge maps of the road\nelements. Finally, these vertices along with edge maps are associated through\nan attentional graph neural network generating a semantic vectorized map.\nInstead of relying on a common segmentation approach, we propose to regress\ndistance transform maps as they provide strong spatial relations and\ndirectional information between vertices.

An emerging technology that has the potential to\nsubstantially increase the efficiency of the multifaceted and interconnected\nport processes is the digital twin. Although digital twins have been\nsuccessfully integrated in many industries, there is still a lack of\ncross-domain understanding of what constitutes a digital twin. Furthermore, the\nimplementation of the digital twin in complex systems such as the port is still\nin its infancy. This paper attempts to fill this research gap by conducting an\nextensive cross-domain literature review of what constitutes a digital twin,\nkeeping in mind the extent to which the respective findings can be applied to\nthe port. It turns out that the digital twin of the port is most comparable to\ncomplex systems such as smart cities and supply chains, both in terms of its\nfunctional relevance as well as in terms of its requirements and\ncharacteristics. The conducted literature review, considering the different\nport processes and port characteristics, results in the identification of three\ncore requirements of a digital port twin, which are described in detail. These\ninclude situational awareness, comprehensive data analytics capabilities for\nintelligent decision making, and the provision of an interface to promote\nmulti-stakeholder governance and collaboration. Finally, specific operational\nscenarios are proposed on how the port's digital twin can contribute to energy\nsavings by improving the use of port resources, facilities and operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 15:22:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 13:55:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

It is well known that cluster experiments allow studying the\nfundamental reactive behavior of catalytic materials in an environment that\navoids the complications present in extended solid-phase research. In\nphysicochemical terms, the question that arises is the chemical reduction of\nmetallic clusters could be affected by the presence of H$_{_{2}}$ molecules,\nthat is, by the probability of encounter that these small metal atomic\nagglomerates can have with these reducing species. Therefore, we consider the\nstochastic movement of $N$ molecules of hydrogen in a cubic box containing $M$\nmetallic atomic clusters in a confined region of the box. We use a Wiener\nprocess to simulate the stochastic process, with $\\sigma$ given by the\nMaxwell-Boltzmann relationships, which enabled us to obtain an analytical\nexpression for the probability density function.

The detection of moving objects in\nvideo captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) has been extensively\nresearched so far, and is used in a wide array of applications including\ntraffic monitoring. Unlike the fixed traffic cameras, UAVs can be used to\nmonitor the traffic at work zones in real-time and also in a more\ncost-effective way. This study presents a method as a proof of concept for\ndetecting End-of-Queue (EOQ) of traffic by processing the real-time video\nfootage of a highway work zone captured by UAV. EOQ is detected in the video by\nimage processing which includes background subtraction and blob detection\nmethods. This dynamic localization of EOQ of vehicles will enable faster and\nmore accurate relocation of work zone warning signs for drivers and thus will\nreduce work zone fatalities. The method can be applied to detect EOQ of\nvehicles and notify drivers in any other roads or intersections too where\nvehicles are rapidly accumulating due to special events, traffic jams,\nconstruction, or accidents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

Because of limited labelled\nHSI data, earlier studies primarily adopted a patch-based classification\nframework, which divides images into overlapping patches for training and\ntesting. However, this approach results in redundant computations and possible\ninformation leakage. In this study, we propose an objective evaluation-based\nhigh-efficiency learning framework for tiny HSI classification. This framework\ncomprises two main parts: (i) a leakage-free balanced sampling strategy, and\n(ii) a modified end-to-end fully convolutional network (FCN) architecture that\noptimizes the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The leakage-free\nbalanced sampling strategy generates balanced and non-overlapping training and\ntesting data by partitioning an HSI and the ground truth image into small\nwindows, each of which corresponds to one training or testing sample. The\nproposed high-efficiency FCN exhibits a pixel-to-pixel architecture with\nmodifications aimed at faster inference speed and improved parameter\nefficiency. Experiments conducted on four representative datasets demonstrated\nthat the proposed sampling strategy can provide objective performance\nevaluation and that the proposed network outperformed many state-of-the-art\napproaches with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff.

Calving sign detection from a camera, which is a\nnon-contact sensor, is expected to enable more efficient livestock management.\nAs large-scale, well-developed data cannot generally be assumed when\nestablishing calving detection systems, the basis for making the prediction\nneeds to be presented to farmers during operation, so black-box modeling (also\nknown as end-to-end modeling) is not appropriate. For practical operation of\ncalving detection systems, the present study aims to incorporate expert\nknowledge into a deep neural network. To this end, we propose a multi-stream\ncalving sign detection network in which multiple calving-related features are\nextracted from the corresponding feature extraction networks designed for each\nattribute with different characteristics, such as a cow's posture, rotation,\nand movement, known as calving signs, and are then integrated appropriately\ndepending on the cow's situation. Experimental comparisons conducted using\nvideos of 15 cows demonstrated that our multi-stream system yielded a\nsignificant improvement over the end-to-end system, and the multi-stream\narchitecture significantly contributed to a reduction in detection errors. In\naddition, the distinctive mixture weights we observed helped provide\ninterpretability of the system's behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 09:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}
