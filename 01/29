Instead of estimating and recovering the complete\noptimal offer set, decision-makers may only be interested in testing whether a\ngiven property holds true for the optimal assortment, such as whether they\nshould include several products of interest in the optimal set, or how many\ncategories of products the optimal set should include.

However, the transfer pricing problem has\nbeen developed in the context where managers are fully individual rational\nutility maximizers. The underlying assumptions are rather heroic and, in\nparticular, how managers process information under uncertainty, do not\nperfectly match with human decision-making behavior. Therefore, this paper\nrelaxes key assumptions and studies whether cognitively bounded agents achieve\nthe same results as fully rational utility maximizers and, in particular,\nwhether the recommendations on managerial-compensation arrangements and\nbargaining infrastructures are designed to maximize headquarters' profit in\nsuch a setting. Based on an agent-based simulation with fuzzy Q-learning\nagents, it is shown that in case of symmetric marginal cost parameters, myopic\nfuzzy Q-learning agents invest only as much as in the classic hold-up problem,\nwhile non-myopic fuzzy Q-learning agents invest optimally.

The theoretical estimation\nof this temperature is difficult for some types of materials, especially\nsilicates and borates. In these materials, self-diffusion as a function of the\ntemperature $T$ is reproduced by the Arrhenius law, where the activation\nbarrier practically independent on the temperature $T$. The purpose of the\npresent work was to establish the relationship between the Arrhenius crossover\ntemperature $T_{A}$ and the physical properties of liquids directly related to\ntheir glass-forming ability. Using a machine learning model, the crossover\ntemperature $T_{A}$ was calculated for silicates, borates, organic compounds\nand metal melts of various compositions. The empirical values of the glass\ntransition temperature $T_{g}$, the melting temperature $T_{m}$, the ratio of\nthese temperatures $T_{g}/T_{m}$ and the fragility index $m$ were applied as\ninput parameters. It has been established that the temperatures $T_{g}$ and\n$T_{m}$ are significant parameters, whereas their ratio $T_{g}/T_{m}$ and the\nfragility index $m$ do not correlate much with the temperature $T_{A}$. An\nimportant result of the present work is the analytical equation relating the\ntemperatures $T_{g}$, $T_{m}$ and $T_{A}$, and that, from the algebraic point\nof view, is the equation for a second-order curved surface. It was shown that\nthis equation allows one to correctly estimate the temperature $T_{A}$ for a\nlarge class of materials, regardless of their compositions and glass-forming\nabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2023 18:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

Results: The two-model solution\npermits putting the limited body of OSA patient data to productive use.\nRelative to a single-Transformer solution using only a third of the\nhigh-quality patient data, the solution with two models improved the prediction\nperformance's $R^{2}$ from 88.8% to 97.5%. Even using baseline models with the\nmodel-augmented data improved the $R^{2}$ considerably, from 61.6% to 81.9%.\nConclusion: The proposed method makes prediction with the most of the available\nhigh-quality data by carefully exploiting details, which are not directly\nrelevant for answering the question of the next year's likely expenditure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2023 20:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

This might severely limit AI's clinical adoption. A certain number of\nAI models need to be assembled non-trivially to match the diagnostic process of\na human reading a CT scan. In this paper, we construct a Unified Tumor\nTransformer (UniT) model to detect (tumor existence and location) and diagnose\n(tumor characteristics) eight major cancer-prevalent organs in CT scans. UniT\nis a query-based Mask Transformer model with the output of multi-organ and\nmulti-tumor semantic segmentation. We decouple the object queries into organ\nqueries, detection queries and diagnosis queries, and further establish\nhierarchical relationships among the three groups. This clinically-inspired\narchitecture effectively assists inter- and intra-organ representation learning\nof tumors and facilitates the resolution of these complex, anatomically related\nmulti-organ cancer image reading tasks. UniT is trained end-to-end using a\ncurated large-scale CT images of 10,042 patients including eight major types of\ncancers and occurring non-cancer tumors (all are pathology-confirmed with 3D\ntumor masks annotated by radiologists). On the test set of 631 patients, UniT\nhas demonstrated strong performance under a set of clinically relevant\nevaluation metrics, substantially outperforming both multi-organ segmentation\nmethods and an assembly of eight single-organ expert models in tumor detection,\nsegmentation, and diagnosis. Such a unified multi-cancer image reading model\n(UniT) can significantly reduce the number of false positives produced by\ncombined multi-system models. This moves one step closer towards a universal\nhigh-performance cancer screening tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2023 20:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

The accuracy of conventional maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE)\ndepends highly on initialisation. Unfavourable choices could result in\nsuboptimal parameter estimates. Current methods to address this issue, such as\ngrid search (GS) can increase computation time substantially. Methods: We\npropose a machine learning (ML) informed MLE approach that combines\nconventional MLE with ML approaches synergistically. ML-based methods have been\ndeveloped recently to improve the speed and precision of parameter estimation.\nHowever, they can generate high systematic bias in estimated parameters when\nSNR is low.

My aim is to get clear on this situation. I argue that it is indeed\nreasonable to speak of \"variants\" here. Orch OR is not a complete model of\nreality but a work in progress. At its core, it claims that wavefunction\ncollapse is a real physical event that has something to do with gravity (\"OR\")\nand that consciousness depends on orchestrated collapses in microtubules\n(\"Orch\"). There are many ways one could make these base ideas precise hence\nmany \"variants\". Furthermore, the ways that HP aim to make these ideas precise\nare radical and incomplete. If they don't work out, Orch OR will need to fall\nback on another variant. Thus, I believe the significance of [1-2] for Orch OR\nis that it cuts out a small class of possible variants and leaves behind\nquestions and challenges for the rest, including the variant preferred by HP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2023 23:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

The Multi-stack Fuel Cell System (MFCS),\nwhich is an assembly of FC stacks, can be a remedy for obstacles in high-power\napplications. However, the output voltage of FC stacks varies dramatically\nunder variable load conditions; hence, in order for MFCS to be efficiently\noperated and guarantee an appropriate load-current sharing among the FC stacks,\nadvanced converter controllers for power conditioning need to be designed. An\naccurate circuit model is essential for controller design, which accounts for\nthe fact that the parameters of some converter components may change due to\naging and repetitive stress in long-term operations. Existing control\nframeworks and parametric and non-parametric system identification techniques\ndo not consider the aforementioned challenges. Thus, this paper investigates\nthe potential of a data-driven method that, without system identification,\ndirectly implements control on paralleled converters using raw data. Based on\npre-collected input/output trajectories, a non-parametric representation of the\noverall circuit is produced for implementing predictive control.

To reduce the high consumption of memory\nand computation, we come up with FPRformer by sharing parameters between the\nsuccessive blocks.

The network dismantling task focuses on how to efficiently select\nthe least such critical nodes. Most existing approaches focus on measuring\nnodes' importance from either functional or topological viewpoint. Different\nfrom theirs, we argue that nodes' importance can be measured from both of the\ntwo complementary aspects: The functional importance can be based on the nodes'\ncompetence in relaying network information; While the topological importance\ncan be measured from nodes' regional structural patterns. In this paper, we\npropose an unsupervised learning framework for network dismantling, called\nDCRS, which encodes and fuses both node diffusion competence and role\nsignificance.

The DCRS converts and fuses the two\nencodings to output a final ranking score for selecting critical nodes.\nExperiments on both real-world networks and synthetic networks demonstrate that\nour scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors for its\nmostly requiring much fewer nodes to dismantle a network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2023 04:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

Correspondingly, in order to\nmaximize caching utilization, it becomes essential to devise an effective\npopularity prediction method. In that regard, predicting popularity with\ndynamic graph neural network (DGNN) models achieve remarkable performance.\nHowever, DGNN models still suffer from tackling sparse datasets where most\nusers are inactive. Therefore, we propose a reformative temporal graph network,\nnamed semantics-enhanced temporal graph network (STGN), which attaches extra\nsemantic information into the user-content bipartite graph and could better\nleverage implicit relationships behind the superficial topology structure. On\ntop of that, we customize its temporal and structural learning modules to\nfurther boost the prediction performance.

We use the\ntemperature record to assess if trends in temperature are due to NAT or A.G.W\neffects. The method requires long records like the 362-year Central England\ntemperature (C.E.T) record. The C.E.T was divided into a 262 year-long early\npart when only NAT was significant, and a 100 year-long later part. The early\npart was decomposed into eight components in the spectral range 15 to 257 years\nand the components were forward projected to the next 100 years. The projected\nNAT replicated the recorded cooling from 1950 to 1980 and the rapid increase\nfrom 1980 to 2010, indicating that the recent strong 50-year trend in C.E.T was\nprimarily NAT.

In this paper, we propose a novel topic-aware\nGlobal-Local Centrality (GLC) model to help select the salient context from all\nsub-topics. The centralities are constructed at both the global and local\nlevels. The global one aims to identify vital sub-topics in the dialogue and\nthe local one aims to select the most important context in each sub-topic.\nSpecifically, the GLC collects sub-topic based on the utterance\nrepresentations.

However, we found that the majority of computations\nin ensemble methods are redundant. For instance, over 77% of samples in\nCIFAR-100 dataset can be correctly classified with only a single ResNet-18\nmodel, which indicates that only around 23% of the samples need an ensemble of\nextra models. To this end, we propose an inference efficient ensemble learning\nmethod, to simultaneously optimize for effectiveness and efficiency in ensemble\nlearning. More specifically, we regard ensemble of models as a sequential\ninference process and learn the optimal halting event for inference on a\nspecific sample. At each timestep of the inference process, a common selector\njudges if the current ensemble has reached ensemble effectiveness and halt\nfurther inference, otherwise filters this challenging sample for the subsequent\nmodels to conduct more powerful ensemble. Both the base models and common\nselector are jointly optimized to dynamically adjust ensemble inference for\ndifferent samples with various hardness, through the novel optimization goals\nincluding sequential ensemble boosting and computation saving. The experiments\nwith different backbones on real-world datasets illustrate our method can bring\nup to 56\\% inference cost reduction while maintaining comparable performance to\nfull ensemble, achieving significantly better ensemble utility than other\nbaselines.

We selected nearly\n1.5 million main sequence stars with a signal-to-noise ratio larger than ten in\nthe twelve J-PLUS passbands and available low-resolution (R = 20-80) spectrum\nfrom the blue and red photometers (BP/RP) in Gaia DR3. We compared the\nsynthetic photometry from BP/RP spectra with the J-PLUS instrumental\nmagnitudes, after correcting for the magnitude and color terms between both\nsystems, to obtain an homogeneous photometric solution for J-PLUS. To\ncircumvent the current limitations in the absolute calibration of the BP/RP\nspectra, the absolute color scale was derived using the locus of 109 white\ndwarfs closer than 100 pc with a negligible interstellar extinction. Finally,\nthe absolute flux scale was anchored to the Panoramic Survey Telescope and\nRapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) photometry in the r band. The precision of\nthe J-PLUS photometric calibration, estimated from duplicated objects observed\nin adjacent pointings and by comparison with the spectro-photometric standard\nstar GD 153, is ~12 mmag in u, J0378, and J0395; and ~7 mmag in J0410, J0430,\ng, J0515, r, J0660, i, J0861, and z. The estimated accuracy in the calibration\nalong the surveyed area is better than 1% for all the passbands. The Gaia BP/RP\nspectra provide a high-quality, homogeneous photometric reference in the\noptical range across the full-sky, in spite of their current limitations as an\nabsolute reference. The calibration method for J-PLUS DR3 reaches an absolute\nprecision and accuracy of 1% in the twelve optical filters within an area of\n3284 square degrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2023 09:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

We also present\nDeltaSpec, an approach that combines test generation and dynamic specification\ninference to automatically compute commit-relevant specifications from given\ncommits. We evaluate DeltaSpec on two datasets that include a total of 57\ncommits (63 classes and 797 methods).

That we work predicatively\nmeans that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work\nis constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the\naxiom of (countable) choice. Domain theory studies so-called directed complete\nposets (dcpos) and Scott continuous maps between them and has applications in\nprogramming language semantics, higher-type computability and topology. A\ncommon approach to deal with size issues in a predicative foundation is to work\nwith information systems, abstract bases or formal topologies rather than\ndcpos, and approximable relations rather than Scott continuous functions. In\nour type-theoretic approach, we instead accept that dcpos may be large and work\nwith type universes to account for this. A priori one might expect that complex\nconstructions of dcpos result in a need for ever-increasing universes and are\npredicatively impossible.

Analyzing phage proteins is indispensable\nfor understanding phages' functions and roles in microbiomes. High-throughput\nsequencing enables us to obtain phages in different microbiomes with low cost.\nHowever, compared to the fast accumulation of newly identified phages, phage\nprotein classification remains difficult. In particular, a fundamental need is\nto annotate virion proteins, the structural proteins such as major tail,\nbaseplate etc. Although there are experimental methods for virion protein\nidentification, they are too expensive or time-consuming, leaving a large\nnumber of proteins unclassified. Thus, there is a great demand to develop a\ncomputational method for fast and accurate phage virion protein classification.\nResults: In this work, we adapted the state-of-the-art image classification\nmodel, Vision Transformer, to conduct virion protein classification. By\nencoding protein sequences into unique images using chaos gaming\nrepresentation, we can leverage Vision Transformer to learn both local and\nglobal features from sequence ``images''. Our method, PhaVIP, has two main\nfunctions: classifying PVP and non-PVP sequences and annotating the types of\nPVP, such as capsid and tail. We tested PhaVIP on several datasets with\nincreasing difficulty and benchmarked it against alternative tools. The\nexperimental results show that PhaVIP has superior performance. After\nvalidating the performance of PhaVIP, we investigated two applications that can\nuse the output of PhaVIP: phage taxonomy classification and phage host\nprediction.

The streamflow discharge is one such example that\ncan be reasonably described as an aggregated stochastic process of randomized\naffine processes where the probability measure, we call it reversion measure,\nfor the randomization is not directly observable. Accurate identification of\nthe reversion measure is critical because of its omnipresence in the aggregated\nstochastic process.

One approach to this issue is to evaluate the upper\nand lower bounds of a statistic of interest subject to ambiguity of the\nreversion measure.

Various techniques have thus been proposed\nto address the overfitting problem. Among them, leveraging deep learning\napproaches to predict patch correctness is emerging along with the available\nlarge-scale patch benchmarks recently. However, existing learning-based\ntechniques mainly rely on manually-designed code features, which can be\nextremely costly and challenging to construct in practice.

As problem scales increase,\non the one hand, the encoding spaces (i.e., dimensions of the decision vectors)\nare intrinsically larger; on the other hand, EC algorithms often require\ngrowing numbers of function evaluations (and probably larger population sizes\nas well) to work properly. To meet such emerging challenges, not only does it\nrequire delicate algorithm designs, but more importantly, a high-performance\ncomputing framework is indispensable.

Existing research works have demonstrated the potential of using\na transformer model for robotic grasping, which can efficiently learn both\nglobal and local features. However, such methods are still limited in grasp\ndetection on a 2D plane. In this paper, we extend a transformer model for\n6-Degree-of-Freedom (6-DoF) robotic grasping, which makes it more flexible and\nsuitable for tasks that concern safety. The key designs of our method are a\nserialization module that turns a 3D voxelized space into a sequence of feature\ntokens that a transformer model can consume and skip-connections that merge\nmultiscale features effectively. In particular, our method takes a Truncated\nSigned Distance Function (TSDF) as input. After serializing the TSDF, a\ntransformer model is utilized to encode the sequence, which can obtain a set of\naggregated hidden feature vectors through multi-head attention. We then decode\nthe hidden features to obtain per-voxel feature vectors through deconvolution\nand skip-connections. Voxel feature vectors are then used to regress parameters\nfor executing grasping actions. On a recently proposed pile and packed grasping\ndataset, we showcase that our transformer-based method can surpass existing\nmethods by about 5% in terms of success rates and declutter rates. We further\nevaluate the running time and generalization ability to demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2023 15:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}
