However, when $U_2>U_4$, anti-Klein tunneling increases with $U_2$.\nThe transmission probability exhibits an interesting oscillatory behavior when\n$U_3>U_2=U_4$ and $U_3 <U_2=U_4$.

However, the diverse landscape of manufacturing presents a\nchallenge for successfully solving problems in industry using time-series\npattern recognition.

Towards this goal, we\nfirst empirically find that the BEV representation can be sufficiently powerful\nwithout expensive transformer based transformation nor depth representation.\nOur Fast-BEV consists of five parts, We novelly propose (1) a lightweight\ndeployment-friendly view transformation which fast transfers 2D image feature\nto 3D voxel space, (2) an multi-scale image encoder which leverages multi-scale\ninformation for better performance, (3) an efficient BEV encoder which is\nparticularly designed to speed up on-vehicle inference.

Here, we offer an alternative approach that begins with bottom-up\ndiscovery of $\\mu$-topics called pincepts. The discovery process itself\nconnects these $\\mu$-topics dynamically with relevant queries, pins, and users\nat high precision, automatically adapting to shifting interests. Pincepts cover\nall areas of user interest and automatically adjust to the specificity of user\ninterests and are thus suitable for the creation of various kinds of\ntaxonomies.

However, the\nlack of large labeled datasets and the inherent complexity of remote sensing\nproblems have made it difficult to train deep CNNs for dense prediction\nproblems. To solve this issue, ImageNet pretrained weights have been used as a\nstarting point in various dense predictions tasks. Although this type of\ntransfer learning has led to improvements, the domain difference between\nnatural and remote sensing images has also limited the performance of deep\nCNNs. On the other hand, self-supervised learning methods for learning visual\nrepresentations from large unlabeled images have grown substantially over the\npast two years.

One important class\nof treatment policies for practice, namely multi-stage stationary treatment\npolicies, prescribe treatment assignment probabilities using the same decision\nfunction over stages, where the decision is based on the same set of features\nconsisting of both baseline variables (e.g., demographics) and time-evolving\nvariables (e.g., routinely collected disease biomarkers). Although there has\nbeen extensive literature to construct valid inference for the value function\nassociated with the dynamic treatment policies, little work has been done for\nthe policies themselves, especially in the presence of high dimensional feature\nvariables. We aim to fill in the gap in this work. Specifically, we first\nestimate the multistage stationary treatment policy based on an augmented\ninverse probability weighted estimator for the value function to increase the\nasymptotic efficiency, and further apply a penalty to select important feature\nvariables. We then construct one-step improvement of the policy parameter\nestimators. Theoretically, we show that the improved estimators are\nasymptotically normal, even if nuisance parameters are estimated at a slow\nconvergence rate and the dimension of the feature variables increases with the\nsample size. Our numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed method has\nsatisfactory performance in small samples, and that the performance can be\nimproved with a choice of the augmentation term that approximates the rewards\nor minimizes the variance of the value function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2023 22:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 03:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Here we demonstrate the growth of Sb thin films on a\nlattice-matching and amorphous substrates using pulsed laser deposition (PLD).\nC-axis out-of-plane textured Sb thin films were successfully deposited on\nSb$_2$Te$_3$ and SiO$_2$\\Si$_3$N$_4$ substrates. In the case of growth on\nSb$_2$Te$_3$, we show that an intermediate phase is formed at the\nSb$_2$Te$_3$-Sb interface playing a crucial role in forming a solid coupling\nand thus maintaining epitaxy leading to the production of high-quality Sb thin\nfilms. A 3 - 4 nm amorphous Sb seed layer was used to induce texture and\nsuitable surface termination for the growth of Sb thin films on amorphous\nsubstrates.

Label Smoothing has been proposed as a solution to the\nover-confidence problem and works by softening hard targets during training,\ntypically by distributing part of the probability mass from a `one-hot' label\nuniformly to all other labels. However, neither model nor human confidence in a\nlabel are likely to be uniformly distributed in this manner, with some labels\nmore likely to be confused than others. In this paper we integrate notions of\nmodel confidence and human confidence with label smoothing, respectively\n\\textit{Model Confidence LS} and \\textit{Human Confidence LS}, to achieve\nbetter model calibration and generalization. To enhance model generalization,\nwe show how our model and human confidence scores can be successfully applied\nto curriculum learning, a training strategy inspired by learning of `easier to\nharder' tasks. A higher model or human confidence score indicates a more\nrecognisable and therefore easier sample, and can therefore be used as a\nscoring function to rank samples in curriculum learning.

The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire\n(SSQ), and its variant, the Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire (VRSQ) are\ntwo tools that measure cybersickness. However, both tools suffer from important\nlimitations, which raises concerns about their suitability. Two versions of the\nCybersickness in VR Questionnaire (CSQ-VR), a paper-and-pencil and a 3D-VR\nversion, were developed. Validation and comparison of CSQ-VR against SSQ and\nVRSQ were performed. Thirty-nine participants were exposed to three rides with\nlinear and angular accelerations in VR. Assessments of cognitive and\npsychomotor skills were performed at baseline and after each ride. The validity\nof both versions of CSQ-VR was confirmed. Notably, CSQ-VR demonstrated\nsubstantially better internal consistency than both SSQ and VRSQ. Also, CSQ-VR\nscores had significantly better psychometric properties in detecting a\ntemporary decline in performance due to cybersickness. Pupil size was a\nsignificant predictor of cybersickness intensity. In conclusion, the CSQ-VR is\na valid assessment of cybersickness, with superior psychometric properties to\nSSQ and VRSQ. The CSQ-VR enables the assessment of cybersickness during VR\nexposure, and it benefits from examining pupil size, a biomarker of\ncybersickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 00:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

However, the ultrafast switching on/off of the driving field comes\nwith questions regarding the limits of validity of the Floquet formalism, which\nis defined for an infinite periodic drive, and to what extent the transient\nchanges can be driven adibatically. Experimentally addressing these questions\nhas been difficult, in large part due to the absence of an established\ntechnique to measure coherent dynamics through the duration of the pulse. Here,\nusing multidimensional coherent spectroscopy we explicitly excite, control, and\nprobe a coherent superposition of excitons in the $K$ and $K^\\prime$ valleys in\nmonolayer WS$_2$. With a circularly polarized, red-detuned, pump pulse, the\ndegeneracy of the $K$ and $K^\\prime$ excitons can be lifted and the phase of\nthe coherence rotated. We demonstrate phase rotations during the 100 fs driving\npulse that exceed $\\pi$, and show that this can be described by a combination\nof the AC-Stark shift of excitons in one valley and Bloch-Siegert shift of\nexcitons in the opposite valley. Despite showing a smooth evolution of the\nphase that directly follows the intensity envelope of the pump pulse, the\nprocess is not perfectly adiabatic. By measuring the magnitude of the\nmacroscopic coherence as it evolves before, during, and after the pump pulse we\nshow that there is additional decoherence caused by power broadening in the\npresence of the pump. This non-adiabaticity may be a problem for many\napplications, such as manipulating q-bits in quantum information processing,\nhowever these measurements also suggest ways such effects can be minimised or\neliminated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 01:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

A\nsharp two-phase interface is sustained before substantial heating of the\nliquid. Thus, two-phase dynamics has been shown to drive the early\nthree-dimensional deformation and atomisation. A recent study of a\ntranscritical liquid jet shows distinct deformation features caused by\ninterface thermodynamics, low surface tension, and intraphase diffusive mixing.\nIn the present work, the vortex identification method ${\\lambda}_{\\rho}$, which\nconsiders the fluid compressibility, is used to study the vortex dynamics in a\ncool liquid n-decane transcritical jet surrounded by a hotter oxygen gaseous\nstream at supercritical pressures. The relationship between vortical structures\nand the liquid surface evolution is detailed, along with the vorticity\ngeneration mechanisms, including variable-density effects. The roles of hairpin\nand roller vortices in the early deformation of lobes, the layering and tearing\nof liquid sheets, and the formation of fuel-rich gaseous blobs are analysed. At\nthese high pressures, enhanced intraphase mixing and ambient gas dissolution\naffect the local liquid structures (i.e., lobes). Thus, liquid breakup differs\nfrom classical sub-critical atomisation. Near the interface, liquid density and\nviscosity drop by up to 10% and 70%, respectively, and the liquid is more\neasily affected by the vortical motion (e.g., liquid sheets wrap around\nvortices). Despite the variable density, compressible vorticity generation\nterms are smaller than the vortex stretching and tilting. Layering traps and\naligns the vortices along the streamwise direction while mitigating the\ngeneration of new rollers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 01:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

One major challenge in cellular networks is a\ndynamic change in the number of users and their usage of telecommunication\nservice which results in overloading at certain base stations. One class of\nsolution to deal with this overloading issue is the deployment of drones that\ncan act as temporary base stations and offload the traffic from the overloaded\nbase station. There are two main challenges in the development of this\nsolution. Firstly, the drone is expected to be present around the base station\nwhere an overload would occur in the future thus requiring a prediction of\ntraffic overload. Secondly, drones are highly constrained in their resources\nand can only fly for a few minutes. If the affected base station is really far,\ndrones can never reach there. This requires the initial placement of drones in\nsectors where overloading can occur thus again requiring a traffic forecast but\nat a different spatial scale.

However,\nthe lack of evaluation benchmark and metrics have led to siloed progress within\nthese various methods, with very little work comparing them and highlighting\ntheir strengths and weaknesses. The reason for this discrepancy is the\ndifficulty of creating ground truth datasets, for example, many neurons within\na given model may learn the same phenomena, and hence there may not be one\ncorrect answer. Moreover, a learned phenomenon may spread across several\nneurons that work together -- surfacing these to create a gold standard\nchallenging. In this work, we propose an evaluation framework that measures the\ncompatibility of a neuron analysis method with other methods.

One of the key problems of current spatial\naudio rendering methods is the lack of personalization based on different\nanatomies of individuals, which is essential to produce accurate sound source\npositions. In this work, we address this problem from an interdisciplinary\nperspective. The rendering of spatial audio is strongly correlated with the 3D\nshape of human bodies, particularly ears. To this end, we propose to achieve\npersonalized spatial audio by reconstructing 3D human ears with single-view\nimages. First, to benchmark the ear reconstruction task, we introduce\nAudioEar3D, a high-quality 3D ear dataset consisting of 112 point cloud ear\nscans with RGB images. To self-supervisedly train a reconstruction model, we\nfurther collect a 2D ear dataset composed of 2,000 images, each one with manual\nannotation of occlusion and 55 landmarks, named AudioEar2D. To our knowledge,\nboth datasets have the largest scale and best quality of their kinds for public\nuse. Further, we propose AudioEarM, a reconstruction method guided by a depth\nestimation network that is trained on synthetic data, with two loss functions\ntailored for ear data. Lastly, to fill the gap between the vision and acoustics\ncommunity, we develop a pipeline to integrate the reconstructed ear mesh with\nan off-the-shelf 3D human body and simulate a personalized Head-Related\nTransfer Function (HRTF), which is the core of spatial audio rendering.

A sharp extended Urysohn's type inequality for quasiconcave\nfunctions is then derived.\n  Using inner linearizations from convex optimization, an analogue of polytopes\ninscribed in a convex body is studied for log concave functions: Given a log\nconcave function, we consider log-affine minorants defined in terms of the\ninner linearizations of the corresponding convex base function. As an\napplication of the functional Minkowski symmetrizations, it is shown that any\nfunctional defined on the class of log concave functions which satisfies\ncertain conditions is maximized by the reflectional hypo-symmetrization.

Although various SPM methods have been\ninvestigated, most of these focus on mining all of the patterns.

Since sequential rule mining can make better use of the\nresults of SPM, and obtain better recommendation performance, this paper\naddresses the issue of maximal co-occurrence nonoverlapping sequential rule\n(MCoR) mining and proposes the MCoR-Miner algo-rithm. To improve the efficiency\nof support calculation, MCoR-Miner employs depth-first search and backtracking\nstrategies equipped with an indexing mechanism to avoid the use of sequential\nsearching. To obviate useless support calculations for some sequences,\nMCoR-Miner adopts a filtering strategy to prune the sequences without the\nprefix pattern. To reduce the number of candidate patterns, MCoR-Miner applies\nthe frequent item and binomial enumeration tree strategies. To avoid searching\nfor the maximal rules through brute force, MCoR-Miner uses a screening\nstrategy.

We decompose the SGS stress into two parts to observe the role of\nSGS stress in turbulent shear flows in addition to the energy transfer between\ngrid-scale (GS or resolved scale) and SGS. One is the isotropic eddy-viscosity\nterm, which contributes to energy transfer, and the other is the residual\nanisotropic term, which is separated from the energy transfer. We investigate\nthe budget equation for GS Reynolds stress in turbulent channel flows\naccompanied by the SGS stress decomposition. In addition, we examine the medium\nand coarse filter length cases; the conventional eddy-viscosity models can\nfairly predict the mean velocity profile for the medium filter case and fails\nfor the coarse filter case. The budget for GS turbulent kinetic energy shows\nthat the anisotropic SGS stress has a negligible contribution to energy\ntransfer.

The total radiative luminosity\ninside $\\sim$20 $r_{\\rm g}$ is about 1% to 30% the Eddington limit, with a\nradiative efficiency of about 6% and 3%, respectively, in the sub- and\nnear-critical accretion regimes. In both cases, self-consistent turbulence\ngenerated by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) leads to angular momentum\ntransfer, and the disk is supported by magnetic pressure. Outflows from the\ncentral low-density funnel with a terminal velocity of $\\sim$0.1$c$ are seen\nonly in the near-critical runs. We conclude that these magnetic pressure\ndominated disks are thermally stable and thicker than the $\\alpha$ disk, and\nthe effective temperature profiles are much flatter than that in the $\\alpha$\ndisks. The magnetic pressure of these disks are comparable within an order of\nmagnitude with the previous analytical magnetic pressure dominated disk model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 05:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Modern malware\ndetectors rely on machine learning algorithms. Now, the adversarial objective\nis to devise alterations to the malware code to decrease the chance of being\ndetected whilst preserving the functionality and realism of the malware.\nAdversarial learning is effective in improving robustness but generating\nfunctional and realistic adversarial malware samples is non-trivial. Because:\ni) in contrast to tasks capable of using gradient-based feedback, adversarial\nlearning in a domain without a differentiable mapping function from the problem\nspace (malware code inputs) to the feature space is hard; and ii) it is\ndifficult to ensure the adversarial malware is realistic and functional. This\npresents a challenge for developing scalable adversarial machine learning\nalgorithms for large datasets at a production or commercial scale to realize\nrobust malware detectors. We propose an alternative; perform adversarial\nlearning in the feature space in contrast to the problem space. We prove the\nprojection of perturbed, yet valid malware, in the problem space into feature\nspace will always be a subset of adversarials generated in the feature space.\nHence, by generating a robust network against feature-space adversarial\nexamples, we inherently achieve robustness against problem-space adversarial\nexamples. We formulate a Bayesian adversarial learning objective that captures\nthe distribution of models for improved robustness. We prove that our learning\nmethod bounds the difference between the adversarial risk and empirical risk\nexplaining the improved robustness. We show that adversarially trained BNNs\nachieve state-of-the-art robustness. Notably, adversarially trained BNNs are\nrobust against stronger attacks with larger attack budgets by a margin of up to\n15% on a recent production-scale malware dataset of more than 20 million\nsamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 06:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

The problem is formulated\nas an optimal control problem with a joint chance constraint that forces the\nadversary to avoid detection throughout a given time period. Due to the joint\nconstraint, the optimal control policy depends not only on the current state,\nbut also on the entire history, leading to an explosion of the search space and\nmaking the problem generally intractable. However, we discover that the current\nstate and whether an alarm has been triggered, or not, is sufficient for\nspecifying the optimal decision at each time step. This information, which we\nrefer to as the alarm flag, can be added to the state space to create an\nequivalent optimal control problem that can be solved with existing numerical\napproaches using a Markov policy. Additionally, we note that the formulation\nresults in a policy that does not avoid detection once an alarm has been\ntriggered.

However, these codes assign\ndense linear combinations of submatrices to the worker nodes. When the input\nmatrices are sparse, these approaches increase the number of non-zero entries\nin the encoded matrices, which in turn adversely affects the worker computation\ntime.

It is however known that undecidability does\nnot hold for various classes of systems: if robustness is defined as the fact\nthat reachability relation is stable under infinitesimal perturbation, then\ntheir reachability relation is decidable. In other words, undecidability\nimplies sensitivity under infinitesimal perturbation, a property usually not\nexpected in systems considered in practice, and hence can be seen (somehow\ninformally) as an artefact of the theory, that always assumes exactness. In a\nsimilar vein, it is known that, while undecidability holds for logical formulas\nover the reals, it does not hold when considering delta-undecidability: one\nmust determine whether a property is true, or $\\delta$-far from being true. We\nfirst extend the previous statements to a theory for general (discrete time,\ncontinuous-time, and even hybrid) dynamical systems, and we relate the two\napproaches.

We prove that assuming robustness to polynomial perturbations on time or\nlength of trajectories leads to similar statements, but with PTIME. It has been\nrecently unexpectedly shown that the length of a solution of a polynomial\nordinary differential equation corresponds to a time of computation: PTIME\ncorresponds to solutions of polynomial differential equations of polynomial\nlength.

Our approach\nrelies on the fact that physical laws are independent of the coordinate choice,\nso the change in the coordinate system preserves the type of a parametric PDE\nand only changes PDE's data (e.g., initial conditions, diffusion coefficient).\nFor tried neural networks and partial differential equations, proposed\naugmentation improves test error by 23% on average. The worst observed result\nis a 17% increase in test error for multilayer perceptron, and the best case is\na 80% decrease for dilated residual network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:55:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 17:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

In contrast, the higher abundances of the light\nrare-earth elements make their alloys highly appealing for magnetocaloric\nhydrogen liquefaction.

An optimal plan will curb an epidemic with\nminimal loss of life, disease burden, and economic cost. Finding an optimal\nplan is an intractable computational problem in realistic settings.\nPolicy-makers, however, would greatly benefit from tools that can efficiently\nsearch for plans that minimize disease and economic costs especially when\nconsidering multiple possible interventions over a continuous and complex\naction space given a continuous and equally complex state space.

Towards IRC+10216, we identify 17 lines from\nJ=27-26 up to J=43-42; their frequencies are also in harmonic relation,\nproviding B=582.6827+/-0.00085 MHz and D=3.31+/-0.31 Hz. The nearly exact\ncoincidence of the rotational and distortion constants in both sources points\nunambiguously to a common molecular carrier. Taking into account the chemical\npeculiarities of both sources, the carrier could be a radical or an anion. The\nradical can be discarded, as the observed lines belong to a singlet species.\nHence, the most plausible carrier is an anion. High-level ab initio\ncalculations indicate that C7N-, for which we compute a rotational constant of\nB=582.0 MHz and a dipole moment of 7.5 D, is the carrier of the lines in both\nsources. We predict the neutral C7N to have a ground electronic state 2Pi and a\ndipole moment around 1 D. Because of this low dipole moment value and to its\nmuch larger rotational partition function, its lines are expected to be well\nbelow the sensitivity of our data for both sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 12:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 13:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Therefore, safeguarding face\nrecognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing\nlearning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding\ndetection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer\nsignificant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies\nseek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the\npresentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these\nmethods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth\nand infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity\nmobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when\neither modality is missing or of poor quality.

As we show, though, attackers can easily evade detection by\nengineering their announcements.\n  This paper presents Oscilloscope, an approach to accurately detect BGP\nhijacks by relying on real-time traffic analysis. As hijacks inevitably change\nthe characteristics of the diverted traffic, the key idea is to track these\nchanges in real time and flag them. The main challenge is that \"normal\"\nInternet events (e.g., network reconfigurations, link failures, load balancing)\nalso change the underlying traffic characteristics - and they are way more\nfrequent than hijacks. Naive traffic analyses would hence lead to too many\nfalse positives.\n  We observe that hijacks typically target a subset of the prefixes announced\nby Internet service providers and only divert a subset of their traffic. In\ncontrast, normal events lead to more uniform changes across prefixes and\ntraffic. Oscilloscope uses this observation to filter out non-hijack events by\nchecking whether they affect multiple related prefixes or not.\n  Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Oscilloscope quickly and\naccurately detects hijacks in realistic traffic traces containing hundreds of\nevents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 12:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

Here, we\nconsider the topological surface code, with both stochastic noise and coherent\nnoise on the multi-qubit entanglement gates during stabilizer measurements in\nboth initial state preparation and error detection. We map a multi-round error\ndetection protocol to a three-dimensional statistical mechanical model\nconsisting of Z_2 gauge interactions and related the error threshold to its\nphase transition point. Specifically, two error thresholds are identified\ndistinguishing different error correction performances. Below a finite error\nthreshold, in stark contrast to the case with only stochastic errors,\nunidentifiable measurement errors can cause the failure of QEC in the large\ncode distance limit. This problem can only be fixed at the perfect initial\nstate preparation point. For a finite or small code with distance d, we find\nthat if the preparation error rate is below a crossover scale ~1/\\log(d), the\nlogical errors can still be suppressed. We conclude that this type of\nunavoidable coherent noise has a significant impact on QEC performance, and\nbecomes increasingly detrimental as the code distance increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 13:12:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 14:03:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 15:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

A variety of tip mechanisms has been proposed by the robotics\ncommunity, among them rounded caps of relatively complex construction that are\nnot always compatible with functional hardware, such as sensors or navigation\npouches, integrated with the main eversion structure. Moreover, many tip\ndesigns incorporate rigid materials, reducing the robot's flexibility and\nconsequent ability to navigate through narrow openings.

However, larger\nbatch sizes may also result in longer response time, and thus it requires a\njudicious design. This paper aims to provide a dynamic batching policy that\nstrikes a balance between efficiency and latency. The GPU-based inference\nservice is modeled as a batch service queue with batch-size dependent\nprocessing time. Then, the design of dynamic batching is a continuous-time\naverage-cost problem, and is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process\n(SMDP) with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of average response\ntime and average power consumption. The optimal policy is acquired by solving\nan associated discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) problem with finite\nstate approximation and \"discretization\". By introducing an abstract cost to\nreflect the impact of \"tail\" states, the space complexity and the time\ncomplexity of the procedure can decrease by 63.5% and 98%, respectively.

However, the re-distribution\nfrom larger grains towards smaller sizes especially by means of rotational\ndisruption is poorly understood. Aims: We aim to study the dynamics of porous\ngrain aggregates under accelerated ration. Especially, we determine the\ndeformation of the grains and the maximal angular velocity up to the rotational\ndisruption event by caused by centrifugal forces. Methods: We pre-calculate\naggregates my means of ballistic aggregation analogous to the interstellar dust\nas input for subsequent numerical simulations. In detail, we perform\nthree-dimensional N-body simulations mimicking the radiative torque spin-up\nprocess up to the point where the grain aggregates become rotationally\ndisrupted. Results: Our simulations results are in agreement with theoretical\nmodels predicting a characteristic angular velocity $\\omega_{\\mathrm{disr}}$ of\nthe order of ${ 10^8 - 10^9\\ \\mathrm{rad\\ s^{-1}} }$, where grains become\nrotationally disrupted. In contrast to theoretical predictions, we show that\nfor large porous aggregates ($< 300\\ \\mathrm{nm}$) $\\omega_{\\mathrm{disr}}$\nreaches a lower asymptotic value. Hence, such grains can withstand an\naccelerated ration more efficiently up to a factor of 10 because the\ndisplacement of mass by centrifugal forces and the subsequent mechanical\ndeformation supports the buildup of new connections within the aggregate.\nFurthermore, we report that the rapid rotation of grains deforms an ensemble\nwith initially 50:50 prolate and oblate shapes, respectively, preferentially\ninto oblate shapes. Finally, we present a best fit formula to predict the\naverage rotational disruption of an ensemble of porous dust aggregates\ndependent on internal grain structure, total number of monomers, and applied\nmaterial properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 13:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

In this first paper of the HOWLS series we compute the\nnon-tomographic ($\\Omega_{\\rm m}$, $\\sigma_8$) Fisher information for one-point\nprobability distribution function, peak counts, Minkowski functionals, Betti\nnumbers, persistent homology Betti numbers and heatmap, and scattering\ntransform coefficients, and compare them to the shear and convergence two-point\ncorrelation functions in the absence of any systematic bias. We also include\nforecasts for three implementations of higher-order moments, but these cannot\nbe robustly interpreted as the Gaussian likelihood assumption breaks down for\nthese statistics. Taken individually, we find that each HOS outperforms the\ntwo-point statistics by a factor of around $2$ in the precision of the\nforecasts with some variations across statistics and cosmological parameters.\nWhen combining all the HOS, this increases to a $4.5$ times improvement,\nhighlighting the immense potential of HOS for cosmic shear cosmological\nanalyses with $Euclid$.

We\nfind that in networks with moderately strong connections, the mutual\ninformation $I$ is approximately a monotonic transformation of the\nroot-mean-square averaged Pearson correlations between neuron-pairs, a quantity\nthat can be efficiently computed even in large systems. Furthermore,\nevolutionary maximization of $I\\left[\\vec{x}(t),\\vec{x}(t\\!+\\!1)\\right]$\nreveals a general design principle for the weight matrices enabling the\nsystematic construction of systems with a high spontaneous information flux.\nFinally, we simultaneously maximize information flux and the mean period length\nof cyclic attractors in the state space of these dynamical networks.

Despite extensive research on generating adversarial attacks and\nbuilding defense systems, there has been limited research on understanding\nadversarial attacks from an input-data perspective. This work introduces the\nnotion of sample attackability, where we aim to identify samples that are most\nsusceptible to adversarial attacks (attackable samples) and conversely also\nidentify the least susceptible samples (robust samples). We propose a\ndeep-learning-based method to detect the adversarially attackable and robust\nsamples in an unseen dataset for an unseen target model. Experiments on\nstandard image classification datasets enables us to assess the portability of\nthe deep attackability detector across a range of architectures. We find that\nthe deep attackability detector performs better than simple model\nuncertainty-based measures for identifying the attackable/robust samples. This\nsuggests that uncertainty is an inadequate proxy for measuring sample distance\nto a decision boundary. In addition to better understanding adversarial attack\ntheory, it is found that the ability to identify the adversarially attackable\nand robust samples has implications for improving the efficiency of\nsample-selection tasks, e.g. active learning in augmentation for adversarial\ntraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 13:58:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 11:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

However, the\nparameter-grouping patterns vary widely across different models, making\narchitecture-specific pruners, which rely on manually-designed grouping\nschemes, non-generalizable to new architectures. In this work, we study a\nhighly-challenging yet barely-explored task, any structural pruning, to tackle\ngeneral structural pruning of arbitrary architecture like CNNs, RNNs, GNNs and\nTransformers. The most prominent obstacle towards this goal lies in the\nstructural coupling, which not only forces different layers to be pruned\nsimultaneously, but also expects all removed parameters to be consistently\nunimportant, thereby avoiding structural issues and significant performance\ndegradation after pruning. To address this problem, we propose a general and\n{fully automatic} method, \\emph{Dependency Graph} (DepGraph), to explicitly\nmodel the dependency between layers and comprehensively group coupled\nparameters for pruning.

Both the\npolarization degree and angle also show a variation with the spin phase, and\nthe former is almost anti-correlated with the source counts in the 2-8 keV and\n2-4 keV bands. We discuss the possible implications and interpretations, based\non a joint analysis of the spectral, polarization and pulsation properties of\nthe source. A scenario in which the surface temperature is not homogeneous,\nwith a hotter cap covered by a gaseous atmosphere and a warmer region in a\ncondensed state, provides a satisfactory description of both the phase- and\nenergy-dependent spectro-polarimetric data. The (comparatively) small size of\nthe two emitting regions, required to explain the observed pulsations, does not\nallow to reach a robust conclusion about the presence of vacuum birefringence\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 14:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

But what is the nature of these deviations, and\nhow do they relate to gains in generalization? We investigate these questions\nthrough a series of experiments across image and language classification\ndatasets. First, we observe that distillation consistently deviates in a\ncharacteristic way: on points where the teacher has low confidence, the student\nachieves even lower confidence than the teacher. Secondly, we find that\ndeviations in the initial dynamics of training are not crucial -- simply\nswitching to distillation loss in the middle of training can recover much of\nits gains.

We\npropose methods to allow for prior information to be incorporated into DLNMs.\nFirst, we impose a monotonicity constraint in the exposure-response at lagged\ntime periods which matches with knowledge on how biological mechanisms respond\nto increased levels of exposures.

When applied to the analysis of texts, n-grams\nusually take the form of sequences of words. But if we try to apply this model\nto the analysis of Sanskrit texts, we are faced with the arduous task of,\nfirstly, resolving sandhi to split a phrase into words, and, secondly,\nsplitting long compounds into their components. This paper presents a simpler\nmethod of tokenizing a Sanskrit text for n-grams, by using n-aksaras, or\ncontiguous sequences of aksaras. This model reduces the need for sandhi\nresolution, making it much easier to use on raw text. It is also possible to\nuse this model on Sanskrit-adjacent texts, e.g., a Tamil commentary on a\nSanskrit text. As a test case, the commentaries on Amarakosa 1.0.1 have been\nmodelled as n-aksaras, showing patterns of text reuse across ten centuries and\nnine languages.

However, the\ndata distribution among clients is naturally non-i.i.d., which leads to severe\ndegradation of the learnt model. The primary goal of this paper is to develop a\nrobust federated learning algorithm to address feature shift in clients'\nsamples, which can be caused by various factors, e.g., acquisition differences\nin medical imaging. To reach this goal, we propose FedFA to tackle federated\nlearning from a distinct perspective of federated feature augmentation. FedFA\nis based on a major insight that each client's data distribution can be\ncharacterized by statistics (i.e., mean and standard deviation) of latent\nfeatures; and it is likely to manipulate these local statistics globally, i.e.,\nbased on information in the entire federation, to let clients have a better\nsense of the underlying distribution and therefore alleviate local data bias.\nBased on this insight, we propose to augment each local feature statistic\nprobabilistically based on a normal distribution, whose mean is the original\nstatistic and variance quantifies the augmentation scope. Key to our approach\nis the determination of a meaningful Gaussian variance, which is accomplished\nby taking into account not only biased data of each individual client, but also\nunderlying feature statistics characterized by all participating clients.

However, polynomials do not provide\nthe best approximation for some problems, with other approximation spaces being\nmore appropriate.

Indirect noise is\ncaused by the acceleration of flow inhomogeneities through a nozzle.\nHigh-fidelity simulations showed that some flow inhomogeneities can be\nchemically reacting when they leave the combustor and enter the nozzle (Giusti\net al., 2019). The state-of-art models, however, are limited to chemically\nnon-reacting (frozen) flows. In this work, first, we propose a low-order model\nto predict indirect noise in nozzle flows with reacting inhomogeneities.\nSecond, we identify the physical sources of sound, which generate indirect\nnoise via two physical mechanisms: (i) chemical reaction generates\ncompositional perturbations, thereby adding to compositional noise; and (ii)\nexothermic reaction generates entropy perturbations.

Advanced-Glycation\nEndproducts (AGEs), one particular type of cross-links, have been shown to\naccumulate and impair the mechanical properties of collageneous tissues,\nwhereas enzymatic cross-links (ECLs) are known for stabilizing the structure of\nthe fibril. However, the reasons for whether a given type of cross-link\nimproves or impairs the material properties remain unknown. Here, we use\ncoarse-grained steered molecular models to evaluate the effect of AGEs and ECLs\ncross-links content on the deformation and failure properties of collagen\nfibrils. Our simulations show that the collagen fibrils stiffen at high strain\nlevels when the AGEs content exceeds a critical value. In addition, the\nstrength of the fibril increases with AGEs accumulation. By analyzing the\nforces within the different types of cross-links (AGEs and ECLs) as well as\ntheir failure, we demonstrate that a change of deformation mechanism is at the\norigin of these observations. A high AGEs content reinforces force transfer\nthrough AGEs cross-links rather than through friction between sliding\ntropocollagen molecules. We show that this failure mechanism, which is\nassociated with lower energy dissipation, results in more abrupt failure of the\ncollagen fibril. Our results provide a direct and causal link between increased\nAGEs content, inhibited intra-fibrillar sliding, increased stiffness, and\nabrupt fibril fracture.

First, we reveal\nthat the normalization statistics in test-time BN are completely affected by\nthe currently received test samples, resulting in inaccurate estimates. Second,\nwe show that during test-time adaptation, the parameter update is biased\ntowards some dominant classes.

This article contains research on novel decentralized\napproaches to said lending services without intermediaries by using liquidity\npools and its associated heuristics, creating an Automated Market Maker. In our\napproach, the contributed collateral and the invoice trades with risk is\nmeasured with a formula: The Kelly criterion is used to calculate the optimal\npremium to be contributed to a liquidity pool in the funding of the said\ninvoices. The behavior of the algorithm is studied in several scenarios of\nstreams of invoices with representative amounts, collaterals, payment delays,\nand nonpayments rates or mora.

The infrared\nspectra are dominated by two Lorentzian bands with maxima around 4 000\ncm$^{-1}$ and 12 000 cm$^{-1}$ which, from a comparison with calculations based\non a H\\\"uckel model are assigned to intra-molecular excitations of $\\pi$\nelectrons of the anionic p-terphenyl molecules.

A dc resistivity of about 0.3 $\\Omega$ cm\nat 300 K is deduced from the IR data, comparable to values measured by\nelectrical resistivity on a twin sample. The analysis of the temperature\ndependence of the low-frequency response reveals a gradual decrease of the\nplasma frequency and the scattering rate of the Drude peak below 300 K that\ngets anomalously enhanced below 90 K. The corresponding missing spectral weight\nof the Drude peak appears blue-shifted towards the Lorentz-band at 220\ncm$^{-1}$. This characteristic blue-shift signifies an enhanced localization of\nthe charge carriers at low temperatures and contrasts the behavior expected for\na bulk superconducting state for which the missing spectral weight would be\nredshifted to a delta-function at zero frequency that accounts for the\nloss-free response of the superconducting condensate.
