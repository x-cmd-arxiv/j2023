Molecular outflows in particular have\nbeen the focus of recent interest as they may be responsible for removing gas\nfrom the galaxy, thereby suppressing star formation. As material is ejected\nfrom the cores of galaxies, interactions of the outflowing material with the\ninterstellar medium can accelerate cosmic rays and produce high-energy gamma\nrays. In this work, we search for gamma-ray emission from a sample of local\ngalaxies known to host molecular outflows using data collected by the {\\fermi}\nLarge Area Telescope. We employ a stacking technique in order to search for and\ncharacterize the average gamma-ray emission properties of the sample. Gamma-ray\nemission is detected from the galaxies in our sample at the $4.4 \\, \\sigma$\nlevel with a power-law photon index of $\\Gamma \\approx 2$ in the 1-800 GeV\nenergy range. The emission is found to correlate with tracers of star formation\nactivity, namely the $8-1000 \\: \\mu$m infrared luminosity. We also find that\nthe observed signal can be predominantly attributed to \\ion{H}{ii} galaxies\nhosting energy-driven outflows. While we do not find evidence suggesting that\nthe outflows are accelerating charged particles directly, galaxies with\nmolecular outflows may produce more gamma rays than galaxies without outflows.\nIn particular, the set consisting of gamma-ray-detected galaxies with molecular\noutflows are nearly perfect calorimeters and may be future targets for searches\nof high-energy neutrinos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 16:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

However, a lack of data on this variable has limited researchers'\nability to understand its role for success in college and the labor market.\nThis paper uses college-admission-exam records from 15 million Brazilian high\nschool students to measure cognitive endurance based on changes in performance\nthroughout the exam. By exploiting exogenous variation in the order of exam\nquestions, I show that students are 7.1 percentage points more likely to\ncorrectly answer a given question when it appears at the beginning of the day\nversus the end (relative to a sample mean of 34.3%). I develop a method to\ndecompose test scores into fatigue-adjusted ability and cognitive endurance. I\nthen merge these measures into a higher-education census and the earnings\nrecords of the universe of Brazilian formal-sector workers to quantify the\nassociation between endurance and long-run outcomes. I find that cognitive\nendurance has a statistically and economically significant wage return.\nControlling for fatigue-adjusted ability and other student characteristics, a\none-standard-deviation higher endurance predicts a 5.4% wage increase. This\nwage return to endurance is sizable, equivalent to a third of the wage return\nto ability. I also document positive associations between endurance and college\nattendance, college quality, college graduation, firm quality, and other\noutcomes. Finally, I show how systematic differences in endurance across\nstudents interact with the exam design to determine the sorting of students to\ncolleges. I discuss the implications of these findings for the use of cognitive\nassessments for talent selection and investments in interventions that build\ncognitive endurance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 16:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

They are strongly correlated, which led to\nthe publication of many proxy relations allowing to convert one index onto the\nother. However, those existing proxies show significant disagreements, in\nparticular at low solar activity. Our aim is to bring a global clarification of\nthose many issues. We compute new polynomial regressions up to degree 4, in\norder to obtain a more accurate proxy. We also study the role of temporal\naveraging on the regression, and we investigate the issue of the all-quiet\n$F_{10.7}$ background flux. Finally, we check for any change in the $F_{10.7}$\n-- sunspot number relation over the entire period 1947 -- 2015. We find that,\nwith a $4^{th}$-degree polynomial, we obtain a more accurate proxy relation\nthan all previous published ones, and we derive a formula giving standard\nerrors. The relation is different for daily, monthly and yearly mean values,\nand it proves to be fully linear for raw non-averaged daily data. By a simple\ntwo-component model for daily values, we show how temporal averaging leads to\nnon-linear proxy relations. We also show that the quiet-Sun $F_{10.7}$\nbackground is not absolute and actually depends on the duration of the spotless\nperiods. Finally, we find that the $F_{10.7cm}$ time series is inhomogeneous,\nwith an abrupt 10.5% upward jump occurring between 1980 and 1981. Our new proxy\nrelations show the importance of temporal scale for choosing the appropriate\nproxy and the $F_{10.7}$ quiet-Sun background level. From historical evidence,\nwe conclude that the 1981 jump is most likely due to a unique change in the\n$F_{10.7}$ scientific team and the data processing, and that the newly\nre-calibrated sunspot number (version2) will probably provide the only possible\nreference to correct this inhomogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 16:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

This paper proposes a probabilistic\nframework to estimate the risk of infection during an individual's commute\nconsidering different travel modes, including public transit, ride-share, bike,\nand walking. The objective is to evaluate the probability of infection as well\nas the estimation errors (i.e., uncertainty quantification) given the\norigin-destination (OD), departure time, and travel mode. We first define a\ngeneral trip planning function to generate trip trajectories and probabilities\nof choosing different paths according to the OD, departure time, and travel\nmode. Then, we consider two channels of infections: 1) infection by close\ncontact and 2) infection by touching surfaces. The infection risks are\ncalculated on a trip segment basis. Different sources of data (such as smart\ncard data, travel surveys, and population data) are used to estimate the\npotential interactions between the individual and the infectious environment.\nThe model is implemented in the MIT community as a case study. We evaluate the\ncommute infection risks for employees and students. Results show that most of\nthe individuals have an infection probability close to zero. The maximum\ninfection probability is around 0.8%, implying that the probability of getting\ninfected during the commuting process is low. Individuals with larger travel\ndistances, traveling in transit, and traveling during peak hours are more\nlikely to get infected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 16:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

Under this\nassumption, the computation of the sample mean and covariance matrix is\nsimplified, enabling an efficient implementation of the GP filter in a\ndata-driven manner, with no ad hoc hyperparameters. The proposed filter is\nevaluated and compared with a state-of-the-art wavelet-based filter, on the\nPhysioNet QT Database. The performance is evaluated by measuring the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement of the filter at SNR levels ranging\nfrom -5 to 30dB, in 5dB steps, using additive noise.

An alternative\napproach uses scan-general (SG) priors that instead leverage information\nregarding the latent features of MRI images for reconstruction. SG priors are\nfrozen at test time for efficiency, albeit they require learning from a large\ntraining dataset. Here, we introduce a novel parallel-stream fusion model\n(PSFNet) that synergistically fuses SS and SG priors for performant MRI\nreconstruction in low-data regimes, while maintaining competitive inference\ntimes to SG methods. PSFNet implements its SG prior based on a nonlinear\nnetwork, yet it forms its SS prior based on a linear network to maintain\nefficiency. A pervasive framework for combining multiple priors in MRI\nreconstruction is algorithmic unrolling that uses serially alternated\nprojections, causing error propagation under low-data regimes. To alleviate\nerror propagation, PSFNet combines its SS and SG priors via a novel\nparallel-stream architecture with learnable fusion parameters. Demonstrations\nare performed on multi-coil brain MRI for varying amounts of training data.\nPSFNet outperforms SG methods in low-data regimes, and surpasses SS methods\nwith few tens of training samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 17:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-09"}

The methodology accounts for cases involving\ntargets of any number, size, and shape. Methods: Data from 322 GK treatment\nplans was modified by isolating and cropping the contoured MRI and clinical\ndose distributions based on tumor location, then scaling the resulting tumor\nspaces to a standard size. An accompanying 3D tensor was created for each\ninstance to account for tumor size. The modified dataset for 272 patients was\nused to train both a generative adversarial network (GAN-GK) and a 3D U-Net\nmodel (U-Net-GK). Unmodified data was used to train equivalent baseline models.\nAll models were used to predict the dose distribution of 50 out-of-sample\npatients. Prediction accuracy was evaluated using gamma, with criteria of\n4%/2mm, 3%/3mm, 3%/1mm and 1%/1mm. Prediction quality was assessed using\ncoverage, selectivity, and conformity indices. Results: The predictions\nresulting from GAN-GK and U-Net-GK were similar to their clinical counterparts,\nwith average gamma (4%/2mm) passing rates of 84.9 and 83.1, respectively.

Second, we define the\nconcepts of warming acceleration and warming amplification in a testable\nformat. And third, we introduce the new testable concept of warming dominance\nto determine whether region A is suffering a worse warming process than region\nB. Applying this three-step methodology, we find that Spain and the Globe\nexperience a clear distributional warming process (beyond the standard average)\nbut of different types. In both cases, this process is accelerating over time\nand asymmetrically amplified. Overall, warming in Spain dominates the Globe in\nall the quantiles except the lower tail of the global temperature distribution\nthat corresponds to the Arctic region.

The main limitation to\nthe precision of time-delay cosmography is mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD). Some of\nthe previous TDCOSMO analyses broke the MSD by making standard assumptions\nabout the mass density profile of the lens galaxy, reaching 2% precision from\nseven lenses. However, this approach could potentially bias the $H_0$\nmeasurement or underestimate the errors. In this work, for the first time, we\nbreak the MSD using spatially resolved kinematics of the lens galaxy in\nRXJ1131$-$1231 obtained from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy, in\ncombination with previously published time delay and lens models derived from\nHubble Space Telescope imaging. This approach allows us to robustly estimate\n$H_0$, effectively implementing a maximally flexible mass model. Following a\nblind analysis, we estimate the angular diameter distance to the lens galaxy\n$D_{\\rm d} = 865_{-81}^{+85}$ Mpc and the time-delay distance $D_{\\Delta t} =\n2180_{-271}^{+472}$ Mpc, giving $H_0 = 77.1_{-7.1}^{+7.3}$ km s$^{-1}$\nMpc$^{-1}$ - for a flat $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology. The error budget\naccounts for all uncertainties, including the MSD inherent to the lens mass\nprofile and the line-of-sight effects, and those related to the mass-anisotropy\ndegeneracy and projection effects. Our new measurement is in excellent\nagreement with those obtained in the past using standard simply parametrized\nmass profiles for this single system ($H_0 = 78.3^{+3.4}_{-3.3}$ km s$^{-1}$\nMpc$^{-1}$) and for seven lenses ($H_0 = 74.2_{-1.6}^{+1.6}$ km s$^{-1}$\nMpc$^{-1}$), or for seven lenses using single-aperture kinematics and the same\nmaximally flexible models used by us ($H_0 = 73.3^{+5.8}_{-5.8}$ km s$^{-1}$\nMpc$^{-1}$).

Winds with a velocity often exceeding $0.1c$ are called\nUltra-Fast-Outflows (UFOs) and thanks to their high power they can play a key\nrole in the co-evolution between the SMBH and the host galaxy. In order to\nconstruct a proper model of the properties of these winds, it is necessary to\nconsider special relativistic corrections due to their very high velocities. We\npresent a derivation of the Poynting-Robertson effect (P-R effect) and apply it\nto the description of the dynamics of UFOs. The P-R effect is a special\nrelativistic correction which breaks the isotropy of the radiation emitted by a\nmoving particle funneling the radiation in the direction of motion. As a result\nof the conservation of the four-momentum, the emitting particles are subjected\nto a drag force and decelerate. We provide a derivation of the drag force\ncaused by the P-R effect starting from general Lorentz transformations and\nassuming isotropic emission in the gas reference frame. Then, we derive the\nequations to easily implement this drag force in future simulations. Finally,\nwe apply them in a toy model in which the gas particles move radially under the\ninfluence of the gravitation force, the radiation pressure and the drag due to\nthe P-R effect. P-R effect plays an important role in determining the velocity\nprofile of the wind. For a wind launched from $r_0=10r_s$ (where $r_S$ stands\nfor the Schwarzschild radius), the asymptotic velocity reached by the wind is\nbetween $10$% and $24$% smaller than the one it would possess if we neglect the\neffect.

Informed by the arguments\nderived, we discuss where UHECRs might come from and which classes of powerful\nastrophysical objects could be UHECR sources; generally, we favour radio\ngalaxies, GRB afterglows and other sources which are not too compact and\ndissipate prodigious amounts of energy on large scales, allowing them to\ngenerate large products $\\beta B R$ without the CRs undergoing restrictive\nlosses. Finally, we discuss when UHECRs are accelerated by highlighting the\nimportance of source variability, and explore the intriguing possibility that\nthe UHECR arrival directions are partly a result of \"echoes\" from magnetic\nstructures in the local Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 19:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Like other\nMRI simulators, it solves the Bloch equations with CPU and GPU parallelization.\nThe inputs are the scanner parameters, the phantom, and the pulse sequence that\nis Pulseq-compatible. The raw data is stored in the ISMRMRD format. For the\nreconstruction, MRIReco.jl is used. A graphical user interface utilizing web\ntechnologies was also designed. Two types of experiments were performed: one to\ncompare the quality of the results and the execution speed, and the second to\ncompare its usability. Finally, the use of Koma in quantitative imaging was\ndemonstrated by simulating Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF)\nacquisitions.\n  Results: Koma was compared to two well-known open-source MRI simulators,\nJEMRIS and MRiLab. Highly accurate results (with MAEs below 0.1% compared to\nJEMRIS) and better GPU performance than MRiLab were demonstrated. In an\nexperiment with students, Koma was proved to be easy to use, eight times faster\non personal computers than JEMRIS, and 65% of them recommended it. The\npotential for designing acquisition and reconstruction techniques was also\nshown through the simulation of MRF acquisitions, with conclusions that agree\nwith the literature.\n  Conclusions: Koma's speed and flexibility have the potential to make\nsimulations more accessible for education and research. Koma is expected to be\nused for designing and testing novel pulse sequences before implementing them\nin the scanner with Pulseq files, and for creating synthetic data to train\nmachine learning models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 20:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Nevertheless, on\nreal-world graphs, it is usually difficult to obtain abundant labeled nodes for\nmany classes. In practice, each meta-training class can only consist of several\nlabeled nodes, known as the extremely weak supervision problem. In few-shot\nnode classification, with extremely limited labeled nodes for meta-training,\nthe generalization gap between meta-training and meta-test will become larger\nand thus lead to suboptimal performance. To tackle this issue, we study a novel\nproblem of few-shot node classification with extremely weak supervision and\npropose a principled framework X-FNC under the prevalent meta-learning\nframework. Specifically, our goal is to accumulate meta-knowledge across\ndifferent meta-training tasks with extremely weak supervision and generalize\nsuch knowledge to meta-test tasks. To address the challenges resulting from\nextremely scarce labeled nodes, we propose two essential modules to obtain\npseudo-labeled nodes as extra references and effectively learn from extremely\nlimited supervision information. We further conduct extensive experiments on\nfour node classification datasets with extremely weak supervision to validate\nthe superiority of our framework compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 20:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

How this integration occurs is poorly understood.\nPreviously we developed high throughput methods to probe neural activity in\npopulations of Caenorhabditis elegans and discovered that the animal?s\nmechanosensory processing is rapidly modulated by the animal?s locomotion.\nSpecifically we found that when the worm turns it suppresses its\nmechanosensory-evoked reversal response. Here we report that C. elegans use\ninhibitory feedback from turning-associated neurons to provide this rapid\nmodulation of mechanosensory processing. By performing high-throughput\noptogenetic perturbations triggered on behavior, we show that turning\nassociated neurons SAA, RIV and/or SMB suppress mechanosensory-evoked reversals\nduring turns. We find that activation of the gentle-touch mechanosensory\nneurons or of any of the interneurons AIZ, RIM, AIB and AVE during a turn is\nless likely to evoke a reversal than activation during forward movement.\nInhibiting neurons SAA, RIV and SMB during a turn restores the likelihood with\nwhich mechanosensory activation evokes reversals. Separately, activation of\npremotor interneuron AVA evokes reversals regardless of whether the animal is\nturning or moving forward. We therefore propose that inhibitory signals from\nSAA, RIV and/or SMB gate mechanosensory signals upstream of neuron AVA. We\nconclude that C. elegans rely on inhibitory feedback from the motor circuit to\nmodulate its response to sensory stimuli on fast timescales. This need for\nmotor signals in sensory processing may explain the ubiquity in many organisms\nof motor-related neural activity patterns seen across the brain, including in\nsensory processing areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 20:45:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 13:24:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 10:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

However, for specific data types, such as hierarchical data, other\ngeometrical spaces may be more appropriate. We study PCA in space forms; that\nis, those with constant positive (spherical) and negative (hyperbolic)\ncurvatures, in addition to zero-curvature (Euclidean) spaces. At any point on a\nRiemannian manifold, one can define a Riemannian affine subspace based on a set\nof tangent vectors and use invertible maps to project tangent vectors to the\nmanifold and vice versa. Finding a low-dimensional Riemannian affine subspace\nfor a set of points in a space form amounts to dimensionality reduction\nbecause, as we show, any such affine subspace is isometric to a space form of\nthe same dimension and curvature. To find principal components, we seek a\n(Riemannian) affine subspace that best represents a set of manifold-valued data\npoints with the minimum average cost of projecting data points onto the affine\nsubspace. We propose specific cost functions that bring about two major\nbenefits: (1) the affine subspace can be estimated by solving an eigenequation\n-- similar to that of Euclidean PCA, and (2) optimal affine subspaces of\ndifferent dimensions form a nested set. These properties provide advances over\nexisting methods which are mostly iterative algorithms with slow convergence\nand weaker theoretical guarantees. Specifically for hyperbolic PCA, the\nassociated eigenequation operates in the Lorentzian space, endowed with an\nindefinite inner product; we thus establish a connection between Lorentzian and\nEuclidean eigenequations. We evaluate the proposed space form PCA on data sets\nsimulated in spherical and hyperbolic spaces and show that it outperforms\nalternative methods in convergence speed or accuracy, often both.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 23:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Second, two tracking control methods, curvature\ncalculation (CC-based) and model predictive control (MPC-based) methods with\nthe lateral dynamics model, are proposed to track the desired path under\ndifferent driving conditions, in which a forward-looking behavior model of the\ndriver with variable preview distance is designed based on fuzzy control\ntheory. CarSim-AMESim-Simulink co-simulation is conducted with the existence of\nobstacles. The simulation results show that the proposed two control approaches\nare effective for many driving scenarios and the MPC-based path-tracking\ncontroller enhances dynamic tracking performance and ensures good\nmaneuverability under high-dynamic driving conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 00:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

ML models are\ntrained on simulated holograms obtained from the physical model of the probe\nsince real holograms have no absolute truth labels.

Models perform well on real holograms only when image\ncorruption is performed on the simulated images during training, thereby\nmimicking non-ideal conditions in the actual probe (Schreck et. al, 2022).\nOptimizing image corruption requires a cumbersome manual labeling effort.\n  Here we demonstrate the application of the neural style translation approach\n(Gatys et. al, 2016) to the simulated holograms.

With an ML model trained to\npredict particle locations and shapes on the stylized data sets, we observed\ncomparable performance on both simulated and real holograms, obviating the need\nto perform manual labeling.

However, most methods ignore the huge parameters and computational\ncost brought by CNNs, and only a few pay attention to the portability and\nmobility. To facilitate practical applications, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel lightweight network for ORSI-SOD based on semantic matching and edge\nalignment, termed SeaNet. Specifically, SeaNet includes a lightweight\nMobileNet-V2 for feature extraction, a dynamic semantic matching module (DSMM)\nfor high-level features, an edge self-alignment module (ESAM) for low-level\nfeatures, and a portable decoder for inference. First, the high-level features\nare compressed into semantic kernels. Then, semantic kernels are used to\nactivate salient object locations in two groups of high-level features through\ndynamic convolution operations in DSMM. Meanwhile, in ESAM, cross-scale edge\ninformation extracted from two groups of low-level features is self-aligned\nthrough L2 loss and used for detail enhancement. Finally, starting from the\nhighest-level features, the decoder infers salient objects based on the\naccurate locations and fine details contained in the outputs of the two\nmodules. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our\nlightweight SeaNet not only outperforms most state-of-the-art lightweight\nmethods but also yields comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art conventional\nmethods, while having only 2.76M parameters and running with 1.7G FLOPs for\n288x288 inputs.

The present paper proposes a method called RLAS-BIABC\nfor AS, which is established on attention mechanism-based long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) and the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers\n(BERT) word embedding, enriched by an improved artificial bee colony (ABC)\nalgorithm for pretraining and a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for\ntraining backpropagation (BP) algorithm. BERT can be comprised in downstream\nwork and fine-tuned as a united task-specific architecture, and the pretrained\nBERT model can grab different linguistic effects. Existing algorithms typically\ntrain the AS model with positive-negative pairs for a two-class classifier. A\npositive pair contains a question and a genuine answer, while a negative one\nincludes a question and a fake answer. The output should be one for positive\nand zero for negative pairs. Typically, negative pairs are more than positive,\nleading to an imbalanced classification that drastically reduces system\nperformance. To deal with it, we define classification as a sequential\ndecision-making process in which the agent takes a sample at each step and\nclassifies it. For each classification operation, the agent receives a reward,\nin which the prize of the majority class is less than the reward of the\nminority class. Ultimately, the agent finds the optimal value for the policy\nweights. We initialize the policy weights with the improved ABC algorithm. The\ninitial value technique can prevent problems such as getting stuck in the local\noptimum. Although ABC serves well in most tasks, there is still a weakness in\nthe ABC algorithm that disregards the fitness of related pairs of individuals\nin discovering a neighboring food source position.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 08:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Each magnon mode and optical cavity mode adopts a strong red detuning\ndriving field to activate the beam splitter interaction. Therefore, the\nentangled state generated by the injected two-mode squeezed light in optical\ncavities can be eventually transferred into two microwave cavities.

It assumes\nthat Hilbert spaces of the Universe as a whole and its subsystems represent the\nsymmetry group $SU(\\infty)$. The Universe is divided to infinite number of\nsubsystems based on an arbitrary finite rank symmetry group $G$, which arises\ndue to quantum fluctuations and clustering of states. After selection of two\narbitrary subsystems as clock and reference observer, subsystems acquire a\nrelative dynamics, and gravity emerges as a $SU(\\infty)$ Yang-Mills quantum\nfield theory, defined on the (3+1)-dimensional parameter space of Hilbert\nspaces of the subsystems. As a Yang-Mills model $SU(\\infty)$-QGR is\nrenormalizable and despite prediction of a spin-1 field for gravity at quantum\nlevel, when QGR effects are not detectable, it is perceived similar to Einstein\ngravity. The aim of the present work is to make the foundation of\n$SU(\\infty)$-QGR more mathematically rigorous and fill the gaps in the\nconstruction of the model reported in earlier works. In particular, we show\nthat the global $SU(\\infty)$ symmetry manifests itself through the entanglement\nof every subsystem with the rest of the Universe. Moreover, we demonstrate\nirrelevance of the geometry of parameter space, which can be gauged out by a\n$SU(\\infty)$ gauge transformation up to an irrelevant constant. Therefore,\n$SU(\\infty)$-QGR deviates from gauge-gravity duality models, because the\nperceived classical spacetime is neither quantized, nor considered to be\nnon-commutative. In fact, using quantum uncertainty relations, we demonstrate\nthat the classical spacetime and its perceived geometry present the average\npath of the ensemble of quantum states of subsystems in their parameter space.\nThus, $SU(\\infty)$-QGR explains both the dimension and signature of the\nclassical spacetime.

The concept of Taiji mission is\nsimilar to LISA's with slightly better sensitivity, which means that the\ngalactic GW signals will also affect the detection with Taiji.

Currently, most LMs calculate these\nrepresentations through a neural network consuming the immediate previous\ncontext. However recently, retrieval-augmented LMs have shown to improve over\nstandard neural LMs, by accessing information retrieved from a large datastore,\nin addition to their standard, parametric, next-word prediction. In this paper,\nwe set out to understand why retrieval-augmented language models, and\nspecifically why k-nearest neighbor language models (kNN-LMs) perform better\nthan standard parametric LMs, even when the k-nearest neighbor component\nretrieves examples from the same training set that the LM was originally\ntrained on. To this end, we perform a careful analysis of the various\ndimensions over which kNN-LM diverges from standard LMs, and investigate these\ndimensions one by one. Empirically, we identify three main reasons why kNN-LM\nperforms better than standard LMs: using a different input representation for\npredicting the next tokens, approximate kNN search, and the importance of\nsoftmax temperature for the kNN distribution. Further, we incorporate these\ninsights into the model architecture or the training procedure of the standard\nparametric LM, improving its results without the need for an explicit retrieval\ncomponent.

Between DFA layers, we dynamically update the\nconstructed local graph structure, so that we can learn richer information,\nwhich greatly improves adaptability and efficiency. We demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method by conducting extensive experiments on point cloud\nclassification and segmentation tasks.

All subjects had their ONHs imaged\nin 3D with Spectralis optical coherence tomography. To describe the 3D\nstructural phenotype of glaucoma as a function of severity, we used two\ndifferent approaches: (1) We extracted human-defined 3D structural parameters\nof the ONH including retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, lamina\ncribrosa (LC) shape and depth at different stages of glaucoma; (2) we also\nemployed a geometric deep learning method (i.e. PointNet) to identify the most\nimportant 3D structural features that differentiate ONHs from different\nglaucoma severity groups without any human input.\n  $\\bf{Results}$: We observed that the majority of ONH structural changes\noccurred in the early glaucoma stage, followed by a plateau effect in the later\nstages. Using PointNet, we also found that 3D ONH structural changes were\npresent in both neural and connective tissues. In both approaches, we observed\nthat structural changes were more prominent in the superior and inferior\nquadrant of the ONH, particularly in the RNFL, the prelamina, and the LC. As\nthe severity of glaucoma increased, these changes became more diffuse (i.e.\nwidespread), particularly in the LC.\n  $\\bf{Conclusions}$: In this study, we were able to uncover complex 3D\nstructural changes of the ONH in both neural and connective tissues as a\nfunction of glaucoma severity.

To further\nreduce the complexity, a lower-complexity method based on whitening filter,\ngeneral power iterative and generalized Rayleigh-Ritz (WF-GPI-GRR) is proposed,\nwhere different from the above two methods, it is assumed that the amplifying\ncoefficient of each active IRS element is equal, and the corresponding\nanalytical solution of the amplifying coefficient can be obtained according to\nthe transmit powers at AF relay and hybrid IRS. Simulation results show that\nthe proposed three methods can greatly improve the rate performance compared to\nthe existing technology-aided metaverse, such as the passive IRS plus AF\nrelay-aided metaverse and only AF relay-aided metaverse. In particular, a 50.0%\nrate gain over the existing technology-aided metaverse is approximately\nachieved in the high power budget region of hybrid IRS. Moreover, it is\nverified that the proposed three efficient beamforming methods have an\nincreasing order in rate performance: WF-GPI-GRR, LC-SCA-FP and HP-SDR-FP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 14:05:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 23:33:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 07:50:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 08:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

However, UAVs are often equipped with cheap POS\nsystems and non-measurement cameras, and their flight attitudes are easily\naffected. How to realize the large-scale mapping of UAV image-free control\nsupported by POS faces many technical problems. The most basic and important\ncore technology is how to accurately realize the absolute orientation of images\nthrough advanced aerial triangulation technology. In traditional aerial\ntriangulation, image matching algorithms are constrained to varying degrees by\npreset prior knowledge. In recent years, deep learning has developed rapidly in\nthe field of photogrammetric computer vision. It has surpassed the performance\nof traditional handcrafted features in many aspects. It has shown stronger\nstability in image-based navigation and positioning tasks, especially it has\nbetter resistance to unfavorable factors such as blur, illumination changes,\nand geometric distortion. Based on the introduction of the key technologies of\naerial triangulation without image control points, this paper proposes a new\ndrone image registration method based on deep learning image features to solve\nthe problem of high mismatch rate in traditional methods. It adopts SuperPoint\nas the feature detector, uses the superior generalization performance of CNN to\nextract precise feature points from the UAV image, thereby achieving\nhigh-precision aerial triangulation. Experimental results show that under the\nsame pre-processing and post-processing conditions, compared with the\ntraditional method based on the SIFT algorithm, this method achieves suitable\nprecision more efficiently, which can meet the requirements of UAV aerial\ntriangulation without image control points in large-scale surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 15:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Roughly speaking, an instance of MEB is stable, if the radius of\nthe resulting ball cannot be significantly reduced by removing a small fraction\nof the input points. Under the stability assumption, we present two sampling\nalgorithms for computing radius-approximate MEB with sample complexities\nindependent of the number of input points $n$.

Since infectious diseases like COVID-19 transmit mainly through\nclose contact with individuals, an efficient way to prevent the spread is by\nlimiting the number of on-site employees in the workplace along with regular\ntesting. Thus, determining an optimal scheduling and testing strategy that\nmeets the organization's goals and prevents the spread of the virus is crucial\nduring disease outbreaks. In this paper, we formulate these challenges in the\nframework of two Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) models.

This is called the\n``Service Requirement Elicitation (SRE)'' task. Considering the amount of\ncustomers is huge, it is an inefficient way for service providers to interact\nwith each user by face-to-face dialog. Therefore, to elicit user requirements\nwith the assistance of virtual intelligent assistants has become a mainstream\nway. Since user requirements generally consist of different levels of details\nand need to be satisfied by services from multiple domains, there is a huge\npotential requirement space for SRE to explore to elicit complete requirements.\nConsidering that traditional dialogue system with static slots cannot be\ndirectly applied to the SRE task, it is a challenge to design an efficient\ndialogue strategy to guide users to express their complete and accurate\nrequirements in such a huge potential requirement space. Based on the\nphenomenon that users tend to express requirements subjectively in a sequential\nmanner, we propose a Personalized Utterance Style (PUS) module to perceive the\npersonalized requirement expression habits, and then apply PUS to an dialogue\nstrategy to efficiently complete the SRE task. Specifically, the dialogue\nstrategy chooses suitable response actions for dynamically updating the\ndialogue state. With the assistance of PUS extracted from dialogue history, the\nsystem can shrink the search scope of potential requirement space.

However, often the public is never informed of how\nthese systems operate and resultant institutional decisions are made. A ``black\nbox'' effect of automated decision-making systems reduces the public's\nperceptions of integrity and trustworthiness. The result is that the public\nloses the capacity to identify, challenge, and rectify unfairness or the costs\nassociated with the loss of public goods or benefits.\n  The current position paper defines and explains the role of fiduciary\nresponsibility within an automated decision-making system. We formulate an\nautomated decision-making system as a data science lifecycle (DSL) and examine\nthe implications of fiduciary responsibility within the context of the DSL.\nFiduciary responsibility within DSLs provides a methodology for addressing the\npublic's lack of trust in automated decision-making systems and the\ninstitutions that employ them to make decisions affecting the public. We posit\nthat fiduciary responsibility manifests in several contexts of a DSL, each of\nwhich requires its own mitigation of sources of mistrust. To instantiate\nfiduciary responsibility, a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) predictive\npolicing case study is examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 18:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

UAVs are deployed as\nmobile base stations (BSs) for cell-edge coverage enhancement for MU. The\nco-existence of heterogeneous networks gives rise to the issue of co-channel\ninterference due to the utilization of the same frequency band. By considering\nboth sharing and non-sharing of radio access channels (RAC), we analyze\nco-channel interference in the downlink system of PSN, UAV, and LRN. As the LRN\ncontrol signal demands high reliability and low latency, we provide higher\npriority to LRN users when allocating resources from the LRN RAC shared with\nMUs. Moreover, UAVs are deployed at the cell edge to increase the performance\nof cell-edge users. Therefore, interference control techniques enable LRN, PSN,\nand UAVs to cohabit in a scenario of sharing RAC. By offloading more PSN UEs to\nthe LRN or UAVs, the resource utilization of the LRN and UAVs BSs is enhanced.\nIn this paper, we aim to adopt deep learning (DL) based on enhanced\ninter-cell-interference coordination (eICIC) and further enhanced ICIC (FeICIC)\nstrategies to deal with the interference from the PSN to the LRN and UAVs.\nAmong LRN, PSN BS, and UAVs, a DL-based coordinated multipoint (CoMP) link\ntechnique is utilized to enhance the performance of PSN MUs. Therefore, if\nradio access channels are shared, utilization of DL-based FeICIC and CoMP for\ncoordinated scheduling gives the best performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 16:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-25"}

It is considered\nthat the whole space is not only integer dimensions but also a superposition of\nspaces between integer dimensions. Space-filling between integer dimensions\nmakes a fractional dimensional space. This happens through a rotation of the\ninteger dimension by the fractional derivative operator (local part) to sweep\nall spaces between two integer dimensions. Then, we introduce four axioms which\nthey can help us to build a mathematical framework for study physics from\nfractional dimension point of view. Afterward, three scenarios such as static,\nlinear and quadratic trajectories are demonstrated. Where moving with linear or\nquadratic trajectories in fractional dimensional space corresponds to an\ninertial framework or accelerated system in physics, respectively. Also from\nthis opinion, it is realized that the coupling of space and time (space-time)\nhappens through the dimension with an interconnection role where we call it\nspace-dimension-time. Finally, the wave equation is derived from fractional\ndimensional point of view with a linear trajectory in fractional dimensional\nspace. And the behavior of electromagnetic wave in lossless and lossy mediums,\nDoppler effect and gravitational red (blue)-shift are also demonstrated from\nfractional dimensional aspect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2023 17:01:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 12:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

Service robots need to detect\nmultiple targets when completing auxiliary tasks. However, indoor scenes are\nusually complex and there are many types of interference factors, leading to\ngreat challenges in the multiple targets detection. To overcome this technical\ndifficulty, a novel improved Mask RCNN method for multiple targets detection in\nthe indoor complex scenes is proposed in this paper. The improved model\nutilizes Mask RCNN as the network framework. On this basis, Convolutional Block\nAttention Module (CBAM) with channel mechanism and space mechanism is\nintegrated, and the influence of different background, distance, angle and\ninterference factors are comprehensively considered. Meanwhile, in order to\nevaluate the detection and identification effects of the established model, a\ncomprehensive evaluation system based on loss function and Mean Average\nPrecision (mAP) is established. For verification, experiments on the detection\nand identification effects under different distances, backgrounds, angles and\ninterference factors were conducted. The results show that designed model\nimproves the accuracy to a higher level and has a better anti-interference\nability than other methods when the detection speed was nearly the same.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 07:28:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}
