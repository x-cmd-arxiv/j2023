In practice,\nfully trained neural networks interact randomly with out-of-distribution (OOD)\ninputs and map aberrant samples randomly within the model representation space.\nSince data representations are direct manifestations of the training\ndistribution, the data selection process plays a crucial role in outlier\nrobustness. For paradigms such as active learning, this is especially\nchallenging since protocols must not only improve performance on the training\ndistribution most effectively but further render a robust representation space.\nHowever, existing strategies directly base the data selection on the data\nrepresentation of the unlabeled data which is random for OOD samples by\ndefinition. For this purpose, we introduce forgetful active learning with\nswitch events (FALSE) - a novel active learning protocol for\nout-of-distribution active learning. Instead of defining sample importance on\nthe data representation directly, we formulate \"informativeness\" with learning\ndifficulty during training. Specifically, we approximate how often the network\n\"forgets\" unlabeled samples and query the most \"forgotten\" samples for\nannotation. We report up to 4.5\\% accuracy improvements in over 270\nexperiments, including four commonly used protocols, two OOD benchmarks, one\nin-distribution benchmark, and three different architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 16:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

This recalls\nour previous analysis of the IMF in massive early type galaxies and suggests\nthe same kind of two-phase formation scenario, with the central bulge initially\nformed under more violent, burst-like conditions than the rest of the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 16:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Since topical\nmaps are the natural nonlinear counterpart of linear maps defined by\nrow-stochastic matrices, which are a cornerstone in the convergence analysis of\nlinear multi-agent systems (MASs), we exploit our results for solving the\nconsensus problem over nonlinear K-topical MASs.

Intuitively, given a set of votes over a set\nof candidates, the problem asks to find an aggregated ranking of candidates\nthat minimizes the overall dissatisfaction concerning the votes. Recently, a\ndiverse version of KRA was considered which asks for a sufficiently diverse set\nof sufficiently good solutions. The framework of diversity of solutions is a\nyoung and thriving topic in the field of artificial intelligence. The main idea\nis to provide the user with not just one, but with a set of different\nsolutions, enabling her to pick a sufficiently good solution that satisfies\nadditional subjective criteria that are hard or impossible to model.\n  In this work, we use a quantum annealer to solve the KRA problem and to\ncompute a representative set of solutions.

Our method extends self-supervised contrastive learning --\nwhere representations are shaped by distinguishing whether two samples\nrepresent the same underlying datum (positives) or not (negatives) -- with a\nnovel approach to selecting positives. To enrich the set of positives, we\nleverage the few existing ground-truth labels to predict the missing ones\nthrough a $k$-nearest neighbours classifier by using the learned embeddings of\nthe labelled data. We thus extend the set of positives with datapoints having\nthe same pseudo-label and call these semantic positives. We jointly learn the\nrepresentation and predict bootstrapped pseudo-labels.

It learns discriminative representation from different\nperspectives of augmented graphs. Ubiquitous in our daily life, singed-directed\ngraphs are the most complex and tricky to analyze among various graph types.\nThat is why singed-directed graph contrastive learning has not been studied\nmuch yet, while there are many contrastive studies for unsigned and undirected.\nThus, this paper proposes a novel signed-directed graph contrastive learning,\nSDGCL. It makes two different structurally perturbed graph views and gets node\nrepresentations via magnetic Laplacian perturbation. We use a node-level\ncontrastive loss to maximize the mutual information between the two graph\nviews. The model is jointly learned with contrastive and supervised objectives.\nThe graph encoder of SDGCL does not depend on social theories or predefined\nassumptions. Therefore it does not require finding triads or selecting\nneighbors to aggregate. It leverages only the edge signs and directions via\nmagnetic Laplacian. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to introduce\nmagnetic Laplacian perturbation and signed spectral graph contrastive learning.\nThe superiority of the proposed model is demonstrated through exhaustive\nexperiments on four real-world datasets.

We consider\narguably the simplest form of mechanisms -- the fixed-price mechanisms, where\nthe designer offers trade at a fixed price to the seller and buyer. Besides the\nsimple form, fixed-price mechanisms are also the only DSIC and budget balanced\nmechanisms in bilateral trade.\n  We obtain improved approximation ratios of fixed-price mechanisms in both (i)\nthe full information setting, where the designer knows the value distributions\nof both the seller and buyer; and (ii) the limited information settings. In the\nfull information setting, we show that the optimal fixed-price mechanism can\nachieve at least $0.72$ of the optimal welfare, and no fixed-price mechanism\ncan achieve more than $0.7381$ of the optimal welfare. Prior to our result the\nstate of the art approximation ratio was $1 - 1/e + 0.0001\\approx 0.632$. We\nfurther consider two limited information settings.

In the second one, we assume that the designer has access\nto more than one but still finitely many samples from the value distributions.\nWe propose a new family of sample-based fixed-price mechanisms called order\nstatistic mechanisms and provide a complete characterization of their\napproximation ratios for any fixed number of samples. Using the\ncharacterization, we provide the optimal approximation ratios obtainable by\norder statistic mechanism for small sample sizes and observe that they\nsignificantly outperform the single sample mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 17:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

In contrast to expensive\nmarker-based or multi-view systems, our lightweight setup is ideal for private\nusers as it enables an affordable 3D motion capture that is easy to install and\ndoes not require expert knowledge. To deal with this challenging setting, we\nleverage recent advances in computer vision using large-scale pre-trained\nmodels for a variety of modalities, including 2D body joints, joint angles,\nnormalized disparity maps, and human segmentation masks. Thus, we introduce the\nfirst non-linear optimization-based approach that jointly solves for the\nabsolute 3D position of each human, their articulated pose, their individual\nshapes as well as the scale of the scene. In particular, we estimate the scene\ndepth and person unique scale from normalized disparity predictions using the\n2D body joints and joint angles.

For purification MIPTs, projective measurements\neffectively cool and localize the system, inducing a transition from a mixed\nstate to an uncorrelated pure state. In this work, we numerically simulate\nmonitored dynamics in the all-to-all Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model for finite\nN. We witness both entanglement and purification MIPTs in the steady-state. It\nis often said that there is an equivalence between entanglement and\npurification MIPTs, however we provide numerical evidence to the contrary,\nimplying that entanglement and purification MIPTs are indeed two distinct\nphenomena. The reason for such a distinction is quite simple: entanglement can\nrevive after a completely projective measurement -- if measurements do not\noccur too often in time -- but impurity cannot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 18:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-13"}

On the theoretical side,\nrecent devoted studies have shown that the properly renormalized $\\rho_{\\rm\nvac}$ in QFT in FLRW spacetime adopts the \"running vacuum model\" (RVM) form.\nWhile in three previous studies by two of us (CMP and JSP) such computations\nfocused solely on scalar fields non-minimally coupled to gravity, in the\npresent work we compute the spin-$1/2$ fermionic contributions and combine them\nboth. The calculation is performed using a new version of the adiabatic\nrenormalization procedure based on subtracting the UV divergences at an\noff-shell renormalization point $M$. The quantum scaling of $\\rho_{\\rm vac}$\nwith $M$ turns into cosmic evolution with the Hubble rate, $H$. As a result the\n\"cosmological constant\" $\\Lambda$ appears in our framework as the nearly\nsustained value of $8\\pi G(H)\\rho_{\\rm vac}(H)$ around (any) given epoch $H$,\nwhere $G(H)$ is the gravitational coupling, which is also running, although\nvery mildly (logarithmically). We find that the VED evolution at present reads\n$\\delta \\rho_{\\rm vac}(H)\\sim \\nu_{\\rm eff}\\, m_{\\rm Pl}^2 \\left(H^2-H_0^2\n\\right)\\ (|\\nu_{\\rm eff}|\\ll 1)$. The coefficient $\\nu_{\\rm eff}$ receives\ncontributions from all the quantized fields, bosons and fermions. Remarkably,\nthere also exist higher powers ${\\cal O}(H^{6})$ which can trigger inflation in\nthe early universe. Finally, the equation of state (EoS) of the vacuum receives\nalso quantum corrections from bosons and fermion fields, shifting its value\nfrom -1. The striking consequence is that the EoS of the quantum vacuum may\nnowadays effectively appears as quintessence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 18:42:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 09:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

The localization\nmodule utilizes the prepossessed sensor data from the receiver, estimates the\nsensor pose online by registering LiDAR scans to maps, and dynamically grows\nthe map. Then, our meshing module takes the registered LiDAR scan for\nincrementally reconstructing the triangle mesh on the fly. Finally, the\nreal-time odometry, map, and mesh are published via our broadcaster.

First, the adversary can attack any link under a certain budget.\nOnce attacked, two end nodes of a link cannot exchange their models. Secondly,\nsome jammers with limited jamming ranges are deployed in the network and a\njammer can only jam nodes within its jamming range.

This raises an\ninteresting question: can the phases of a system without exact higher-form\nsymmetries be characterized exactly by emergent higher-form symmetries? Here we\nargue the answer is yes by constructing low-energy effective theories for\nbosonic lattice Hamiltonian models to identify emergent symmetries. We also\npresent an alternative point of view for emergent finite symmetries using\ntopological order in one higher dimension. We find that emergent higher-form\nsymmetries at zero temperature are robust against local UV perturbations and\nbecome exact symmetries of the effective theory in the thermodynamic limit.\nThis result is true for both invertible and non-invertible higher-form\nsymmetries. Therefore, emergent higher-form symmetries are exact emergent\nsymmetries: they are not UV symmetries but constrain low-energies as if they\nwere. We demonstrate this in three lattice models, the quantum clock model and\nemergent ${\\mathbb{Z}_N}$ and ${U(1)}$ ${p}$-gauge theory, finding regions of\nparameter space with exact emergent (anomalous) higher-form symmetries. Since\nphases of matter are defined in the thermodynamic limit, this implies that a UV\ntheory without higher-form symmetries can have phases characterized by exact\nemergent higher-form symmetries. We discuss in detail the physical consequences\nof this and contrast it to emergent ${0}$-form symmetries, which are typically\nnot exact.

We\npresent a wide field study of globular clusters (GCs) in NGC 4839 and its\nenvironment based on Hyper Suprime-Cam $gr$ images in the Subaru archive. We\ncompare the GC system of NGC 4839 with that of NGC 4816, which is the brightest\nmember (S0) of the nearby group and lies at a similar distance in the west from\nthe Coma center. Interestingly the spatial distribution of the GCs in NGC 4839\nis significantly more compact than that of the GCs in NGC 4816. In addition,\nthe radial number density profile of the GCs in NGC 4839 shows an abrupt drop\nat $R_{N4839}\\approx 80$ kpc, while that of the GCs in NGC 4816 shows a\ncontinuous slow decline even in the outer region at $80<R_{N4816}<500$ kpc. The\neffective radius of the NGC 4839 GC system is about three times smaller than\nthat of the NGC 4816 GC system. This striking difference can be explained if\nNGC 4839 lost a significant fraction of the GCs in its outskirt when it passed\nthrough Coma. This supports strongly the second infall scenario where the NGC\n4839 passed the Coma center about 1.6 Gyr ago, and began the second infall\nafter reaching the apocenter in the south-west recently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 19:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

One approach to address this\nchallenge is through self-driving experimentation techniques that can actively\nanalyze the data being collected and use this information to make on-the-fly\nmeasurement choices, such that the data collected is sparse but representative\nof the sample and sufficiently informative. Here, we report the Fast Autonomous\nScanning Toolkit (FAST) that combines a trained neural network, a route\noptimization technique, and efficient hardware control methods to enable a\nself-driving scanning microscopy experiment. The key features of our method are\nthat: it does not require any prior information about the sample, it has a very\nlow computational cost, and that it uses generic hardware controls with minimal\nexperiment-specific wrapping. We test this toolkit in numerical experiments and\na scanning dark-field x-ray microscopy experiment of a $WSe_2$ thin film, where\nour experiments show that a FAST scan of <25% of the sample is sufficient to\nproduce both a high-fidelity image and a quantitative analysis of the surface\ndistortions in the sample.

Amongst these methods, the control of foreseeable\nhybrid traffic that consists of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and robot vehicles\n(RVs) has recently emerged. We propose a decentralized reinforcement learning\napproach for the control and coordination of hybrid traffic at real-world,\ncomplex intersections--a topic that has not been previously explored.\nComprehensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of our\napproach. In particular, we show that using 5% RVs, we can prevent congestion\nformation inside the intersection under the actual traffic demand of 700\nvehicles per hour. In contrast, without RVs, congestion starts to develop when\nthe traffic demand reaches as low as 200 vehicles per hour. Further performance\ngains (reduced waiting time of vehicles at the intersection) are obtained as\nthe RV penetration rate increases. When there exist more than 50% RVs in\ntraffic, our method starts to outperform traffic signals on the average waiting\ntime of all vehicles at the intersection.\n  Our method is also robust against both blackout events and sudden RV\npercentage drops, and enjoys excellent generalizablility, which is illustrated\nby its successful deployment in two unseen intersections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 21:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

They specify communication structures essential for\nprogram correctness; a session type says what and when should be exchanged\nthrough a channel. Central to session-typed languages are sequencing constructs\nin types and processes that explicitly specify the order of actions in a\nprotocol.\n  In this paper we study session types without sequencing. The resulting\nframework of minimal session types is arguably the simplest form of session\ntypes one could conceive. In the context of a core process calculus with\nsessions and higher-order concurrency (abstraction-passing), we establish two\nmain technical results. First, we prove that every process $P$ typable with\nstandard session types can be compiled down into a process $\\mathcal{D}(P)$\ntypable with minimal session types. Second, we prove that $P$ and\n$\\mathcal{D}(P)$ are behaviorally equivalent. These results indicate that\nhaving sequencing constructs in processes and session types is convenient but\nredundant: only sequentiality in processes is truly indispensable, as it can\ncorrectly codify sequentiality in types.\n  Our developments draw inspiration from work by Parrow on behavior-preserving\ndecompositions of untyped processes. By casting Parrow's results in the realm\nof typed processes, our developments reveal a conceptually simple formulation\nof session types and a principled avenue to the integration of session types\ninto programming languages without sequencing in types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 21:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

While powerful, this approach is limited by the inability to\nassess higher-order interactions involving three or more elements directly. In\nthis work, we present a method for capturing higher-order dependencies in\ndiscrete data based on partial entropy decomposition (PED). Our approach\ndecomposes the joint entropy of the whole system into a set of strictly\nnon-negative partial entropy atoms that describe the redundant, unique, and\nsynergistic interactions that compose the system's structure. We begin by\nshowing how the PED can provide insights into the mathematical structure of\nboth the FC network itself, as well as established measures of higher-order\ndependency such as the O-information. When applied to resting state fMRI data,\nwe find robust evidence of higher-order synergies that are largely invisible to\nstandard functional connectivity analyses.

Our approach can also be localized in time, allowing a frame-by-frame\nanalysis of how the distributions of redundancies and synergies change over the\ncourse of a recording.

It is common in the current literature to use simplified\noperational models for electrolyzers. It is still an open question whether this\nis a good practice, and if not, when a more detailed operational model is\nnecessary. This paper answers it by assessing the impact of adding different\nlevels of electrolyzer details, i.e., physics and operational constraints, to\nthe optimal dispatch problem of a hybrid power plant in the day-ahead time\nstage. Our focus lies on the number of operating states (on, off, standby) as\nwell as the number of linearization segments used for approximating the\nnon-linear hydrogen production curve. For that, we develop several\nmixed-integer linear models, each representing a different level of operational\ndetails. We conduct a thorough comparative ex-post performance analysis under\ndifferent price conditions, wind farm capacities, and minimum hydrogen demand\nrequirements, and discuss under which operational circumstances a detailed\nmodel is necessary. In particular, we provide a case under which a simplified\nmodel, compared to a detailed one, results in a decrease in profit of 1.8% and\nhydrogen production of 13.5% over a year. The key lesson learned is that a\ndetailed model potentially earns a higher profit in circumstances under which\nthe electrolyzer operates with partial loading. This could be the case for a\ncertain range of electricity and hydrogen prices, or limited wind power\navailability. The detailed model also provides a better estimation of true\nhydrogen production, facilitating the logistics required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 21:39:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 09:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Here we determine, via a\nmathematically rigorous framework, which general conditions for the crowding\nfeedback regulation (i) must be minimally met, and (ii) are sufficient, to\nallow the maintenance of homeostasis in renewing tissues. We show that those\nconditions naturally allow for a degree of robustness toward disruption of\nregulation. Furthermore, intrinsic to this feedback regulation is that stem\ncell identity is established collectively by the cell population, not by\nindividual cells, which implies the possibility of `quasi-dedifferentiation',\nin which cells committed to differentiation may reacquire stem cell properties\nupon depletion of the stem cell pool. These findings can guide future\nexperimental campaigns to identify specific crowding feedback mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 22:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

In order to see coordination strategies\nemerging from the combination of independent policies, the recent research has\nfocused on the use of a centralized function (CF) that learns each agent's\ncontribution to the team reward. However, the structure in which the\nenvironment is presented to the agents and to the CF is typically overlooked.\nWe have observed that the features used to describe the coordination problem\ncan be represented as vertex features of a latent graph structure.

The automatic generation of such co-speech\ngestures is a long-standing problem in computer animation and is considered an\nenabling technology in film, games, virtual social spaces, and for interaction\nwith social robots. The problem is made challenging by the idiosyncratic and\nnon-periodic nature of human co-speech gesture motion, and by the great\ndiversity of communicative functions that gestures encompass. Gesture\ngeneration has seen surging interest recently, owing to the emergence of more\nand larger datasets of human gesture motion, combined with strides in\ndeep-learning-based generative models, that benefit from the growing\navailability of data. This review article summarizes co-speech gesture\ngeneration research, with a particular focus on deep generative models. First,\nwe articulate the theory describing human gesticulation and how it complements\nspeech. Next, we briefly discuss rule-based and classical statistical gesture\nsynthesis, before delving into deep learning approaches. We employ the choice\nof input modalities as an organizing principle, examining systems that generate\ngestures from audio, text, and non-linguistic input. We also chronicle the\nevolution of the related training data sets in terms of size, diversity, motion\nquality, and collection method. Finally, we identify key research challenges in\ngesture generation, including data availability and quality; producing\nhuman-like motion; grounding the gesture in the co-occurring speech in\ninteraction with other speakers, and in the environment; performing gesture\nevaluation; and integration of gesture synthesis into applications. We\nhighlight recent approaches to tackling the various key challenges, as well as\nthe limitations of these approaches, and point toward areas of future\ndevelopment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 00:20:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 08:17:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 19:35:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 09:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

To\napproximate the original process, we introduce gossip dynamics over an averaged\ngraph, obtained by averaging all possible networks generated from the random\ngraph. Using concentration inequalities, we derive high-probability bounds for\nthe difference between the expected final opinions of the regular agents in the\noriginal gossip process and those in the dynamics over the averaged graph.

Calculations are performed for\nmodel parameters relevant to recent experimental studies of an nm-sized organic\nmolecule diffusing in crosslinked PnBA networks. The theory predicts the\npenetrant alpha relaxation time increases exponentially with the crosslink\nfraction ($f_n$) dependent glass transition temperature, $T_g$, which grows\nroughly linearly with the square root of $f_n$. Moreover, $T_g$ is also found\nto be proportional to a geometric confinement parameter defined as the ratio of\nthe penetrant diameter to the mean network mesh size.

Polymer networks\nhold promise in these applications, because dramatic differences in molecular\ndiffusion can result from subtle changes in the network structure. In this\npaper, we use molecular simulation to understand the role that crosslinked\nnetwork polymers have in governing the molecular motion of penetrants. By\nconsidering the local, activated alpha relaxation time of the penetrant and its\nlong-time diffusive dynamics, we can determine the relative importance of\nactivated glassy dynamics on penetrants at the segmental scale versus entropic\nmesh confinement on penetrant diffusion. We vary several parameters, such as\nthe crosslinking density, temperature, and penetrant size, to show that\ncrosslinks primarily affect molecular diffusion through modification of the\nmatrix glass transition, with local penetrant hopping at least partially\ncoupled to the segmental relaxation of the polymer network. This coupling is\nvery sensitive to the local activated segmental dynamics of the surrounding\nmatrix, and we also show that penetrant transport is affected by dynamic\nheterogeneity at low temperatures. To contrast, only at high temperatures and\nfor large penetrants or when the dynamic heterogeneity effect is weak does the\neffect of mesh confinement become significant, even though penetrant diffusion\nmore broadly empirically follows similar trends as established models of mesh\nconfinement-based transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 01:36:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 20:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

To model such contacts, an accurate expression of the image force\nbarrier-lowering (IFBL) is needed. We derive the image-force energy by solving\nPoisson's equation with the boundary conditions of two metal surfaces separated\nby an angle omega. We show how the image-force energy can also be obtained\nusing the method of images provided a non-Euclidian cone-manifold space is\nused. We calculate how much the IFBL is strengthened or weakened for various\nomega and angles with the 2D semiconductor. For the most prominent 2D material\ncontact configuration, the image-force energy is reduced by a factor of 0.85,\nbut a smaller angle between the metal surfaces can significantly increase the\nimage-force energy. We predict that a contact with a small angle between the\nmetal and 2D material and a surrounding dielectric with low permittivity will\nyield low contact resistance by enhancing IFBL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 03:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

The mass transition to remote work amid the COVID-19 pandemic\nprofoundly affected software professionals, who abruptly shifted into\nostensibly temporary home offices.

Recent studies advocate for remote structures to create\nopportunities for many equity-deserving groups; however, remote work can also\nbe challenging for some individuals, such as women and individuals with\ndisabilities. Objective. This study aims to investigate the effects of remote\nwork on LGBTQIA+ software professionals. Method. Grounded theory methodology\nwas applied based on information collected from two main sources: a survey\nquestionnaire with a sample of 57 LGBTQIA+ software professionals and nine\nfollow-up interviews with individuals from this sample. This sample included\nprofessionals of different genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and\nlevels of experience. Findings. Our findings demonstrate that (1) remote work\nbenefits LGBTQIA+ people by increasing security and visibility; (2) remote work\nharms LGBTQIA+ software professionals through isolation and invisibility; (3)\nthe benefits outweigh the drawbacks; (4) the drawbacks can be mitigated by\nsupportive measures developed by software companies.

In comparison to mature GCs (mGCs) (born during\ndevelopment), the imGCs exhibit two competing distinct properties such as high\nexcitability and low excitatory innervation. We develop a spiking neural\nnetwork for the DG, incorporating the imGCs, and investigate their effect on\npattern separation. We first consider the effect of high excitability. The\nimGCs become very highly active due to their low firing threshold. Then, strong\npattern correlation occurs, which results in pattern integration. On the other\nhand, the mGCs exhibit very sparse firing activity due to strongly increased\nfeedback inhibition. As a result of high sparsity, the pattern separation\nefficacy (PSE) of the mGCs becomes very high. Thus, the whole population of GCs\nbecomes a heterogeneous one, composed of a (major) subpopulation of mGCs (i.e.,\npattern separators) with very low activation degree and a (minor) subpopulation\nof imGCs (i.e., pattern integrators) with very high activation degree. In the\nwhole heterogeneous population, the overall activation degree of all the GCs is\na little reduced in comparison to the activation degree in the presence of only\nmGCs without imGCs. However, no pattern separation occurs, due to heterogeneous\nsparsity, in contrast to the usual intuitive thought that sparsity could\nimprove PSE. Next, we consider the effect of low excitatory innervation for the\nimGCs. In this case, the imGCs perform pattern integration. The PSE of the mGCs\ndecreases from a high value to a limit value. In the whole population of all\nthe GCs, when passing through a threshold, pattern separation starts, the\noverall PSE increases and approaches that of the mGCs. However, due to\nheterogeneity caused by the imGCs, the overall PSE becomes deteriorated, in\ncomparison with that in the presence of only mGCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 04:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

The mixing of dust and gas in the interstellar medium remains a\nfundamental issue to keep track of astrochemistry evolution and molecular\nabundances.

Simulation results reveal significant improvements in terms\nof latency with a gain of 47.6% and 26.1% for Digital-Analog beamforming (BF),\n17.1% and 21.6% for Hybrid-Analog BF, and 24.7% and 39% for Analog-Analog BF\nwhen comparing the RL-schemes HiDQL and CDQL with the with the existent\nsolutions, HiDQL presented a slower convergence time, however obtained a more\noptimal solution than CDQL. Additionally, we foresee the advantages of\nutilizing context-information as geo-location of the UEs to reduce the beam\nexploration sector, and thus improving further multi-RAT handover latency\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 05:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

This is particularly evident for the\nlearning-based multi-target landmark detection, where algorithms could be\nmisleading to learn primarily the variation of background due to the varying\nFOV, failing the detection of targets. Based on learning a navigation policy,\ninstead of predicting targets directly, reinforcement learning (RL)-based\nmethods have the potential totackle this challenge in an efficient manner.\nInspired by this, in this work we propose a multi-agent RL framework for\nsimultaneous multi-target landmark detection. This framework is aimed to learn\nfrom incomplete or (and) complete images to form an implicit knowledge of\nglobal structure, which is consolidated during the training stage for the\ndetection of targets from either complete or incomplete test images. To further\nexplicitly exploit the global structural information from incomplete images, we\npropose to embed a shape model into the RL process. With this prior knowledge,\nthe proposed RL model can not only localize dozens of targetssimultaneously,\nbut also work effectively and robustly in the presence of incomplete images. We\nvalidated the applicability and efficacy of the proposed method on various\nmulti-target detection tasks with incomplete images from practical clinics,\nusing body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), cardiac MRI and head CT\ndatasets. Results showed that our method could predict whole set of landmarks\nwith incomplete training images up to 80% missing proportion (average distance\nerror 2.29 cm on body DXA), and could detect unseen landmarks in regions with\nmissing image information outside FOV of target images (average distance error\n6.84 mm on 3D half-head CT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 05:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

Therefore, we develop a novel learning to hash framework,\nnamely Hamming Spatial Graph Convolutional Networks (HS-GCN), which explicitly\nmodels the Hamming similarity and embeds it into the codes of users and items.\nExtensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing\nmodels, and obtains performance comparable with the real-valued recommendation\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 08:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

A typical example\nis the computation of the average communication rate (ACR) of the networked\nevent-triggered stochastic control systems (ET-SCS) of which the communication\nof the sensor network is scheduled by whether a system variable of interest\nexceeds predefined constant thresholds. For such a system, a closed-loop effect\nemerges due to the interdependence between the system variable and the trigger\nof communication.

To identify the optimized materials conditions for\n${\\rm YMn}_{6}{\\rm Sn}_{6}$-type room-temperature emergent inductors, we have\ninvestigated emergent electromagnetic inductance (EEMI) as the magnetism is\nmodified through systematic partial substitution of Y by Tb. By small angle\nneutron scattering and inductance measurements, we have revealed that the\npinning effect on the spin-helix translational mode by Tb doping selectively\nand largely suppresses the negative component of EEMI, while sustaining the\npositive inductance arising from the spin tilting mode. We also find that in\naddition to the spin helix, even the spin-collinear antiferromagnetic structure\ncan host the positive EEMI due to thermally enhanced spin fluctuations. The\npresent study highlights the facile control of both the magnitude and sign of\nEEMI beyond room temperature, and thus suggests a route to expand the range of\nemergent inductor candidate materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 09:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-16"}

However, learning a robust\nrepresentation from numerous unlabeled images remains challenging due to\npotential noise in pseudo labels and insufficient class separability in feature\nspace, which undermines the performance of current semi-supervised segmentation\napproaches.

Concept identification aims at\nidentifying non-overlapping groups of design instances that are similar in a\njoint space of all features, but which are also similar when considering only\nsubsets of features. These subsets usually comprise features that characterize\na design with respect to one specific context, for example, constructive design\nparameters, performance values, or operation modes. It is desirable to evaluate\nthe quality of design concepts by considering several of these feature subsets\nin isolation. In particular, meaningful concepts should not only identify\ndense, well separated groups of data instances, but also provide\nnon-overlapping groups of data that persist when considering pre-defined\nfeature subsets separately. In this work, we propose to view concept\nidentification as a special form of clustering algorithm with a broad range of\npotential applications beyond engineering design. To illustrate the differences\nbetween concept identification and classical clustering algorithms, we apply a\nrecently proposed concept identification algorithm to two synthetic data sets\nand show the differences in identified solutions. In addition, we introduce the\nmutual information measure as a metric to evaluate whether solutions return\nconsistent clusters across relevant subsets. To support the novel understanding\nof concept identification, we consider a simulated data set from a\ndecision-making problem in the energy management domain and show that the\nidentified clusters are more interpretable with respect to relevant feature\nsubsets than clusters found by common clustering algorithms and are thus more\nsuitable to support a decision maker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 13:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

To solve this problem, recent works gradually focus on\ncross-domain RS image semantic segmentation task.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has\ndemonstrated great potential, existing works are either limited by fixed models\nor require enormous data/time for online adaptation, which struggle to fit\ntime-varying and diverse network states. Driven by these practical concerns, we\nperform large-scale measurements on WeChat for Business's interactive video\nservice to study real-world network fluctuations. Surprisingly, our analysis\nshows that, compared to time-varying network metrics, network sequences exhibit\nnoticeable short-term continuity, sufficient for few-shot learning\nrequirements. We thus propose Fiammetta, the first meta-RL-based bitrate\nadaptation algorithm for interactive video streaming. Building on the\nshort-term continuity, Fiammetta accumulates learning experiences through\noffline meta-training and enables fast online adaptation to changing network\nstates through a few gradient updates. Moreover, Fiammetta innovatively\nincorporates a probing mechanism for real-time monitoring of network states,\nand proposes an adaptive meta-testing mechanism for seamless adaptation. We\nimplement Fiammetta on a testbed whose end-to-end network follows the\nreal-world WeChat for Business traces.

RCNN-based\ndetectors extract instance features by cropping rectangle regions of interest\nin the feature maps. However, the visible pixels of the occluded objects are\nlimited, making the rectangle instance feature mixed with a lot of\ninstance-irrelevant noise information. Besides, by counting the number of\ninstances with different degrees of overlap of CrowdHuman dataset, we find that\nthe number of severely overlapping objects and the number of slightly\noverlapping objects are unbalanced, which may exacerbate the challenges posed\nby occlusion issues. Regarding to the noise issue, from the perspective of\ndenoising, an iterable dynamic instance noise filter (DINF) is proposed for the\nRCNN-based pedestrian detectors to improve the signal-noise ratio of the\ninstance feature. Simulating the wavelet denoising process, we use the instance\nfeature vector to generate dynamic convolutional kernels to transform the RoIs\nfeatures to a domain in which the near-zero values represent the noise\ninformation. Then, soft thresholding with channel-wise adaptive thresholds is\napplied to convert the near-zero values to zero to filter out noise\ninformation.

Still, many preclinical animal experiments\nare only poorly designed. As a consequence, discoveries that are made in one\nanimal experiment, cannot be reproduced in another animal experiment or\ndiscoveries in translational animal research fail to be translated to humans.\nWhen designing new experiments in a classical frequentist framework, the sample\nsize for the new experiment is chosen with the goal to achieve at least a\ncertain statistical power, given a statistical test for a null hypothesis, a\nsignificance threshold and a minimally relevant effect size. In a Bayesian\nframework, inference is made by a combination of both the information from\nnewly observed data and also by a prior distribution, that represents a priori\ninformation on the parameters. In translational animal experiments, a priori\ninformation is present in previously conducted experiments to the same outcome\nin similar animals. The prior information can be incorporated in a systematic\nway in the design and analysis of a new animal experiment by summarizing the\nhistorical data in a (Bayesian) meta-analysis model and using the meta-analysis\nmodel to make predictions for the data in the new experiment. This is called\nmeta-analytic predictive (MAP) approach. In this work, concepts of how to\ndesign translational animal experiments by MAP approaches are introduced and\ncompared to classical frequentist power-oriented sample size planning. Current\nchances and challenges, that exist in the practical application of these\napproaches in translational animal research, are discussed.

At the crossroad of these, we investigate the impact of\npeculiar velocities on estimations of the Hubble constant from time-delay\ncosmography. We quantify the bias on the inference of the Hubble constant due\nto peculiar velocities of the lens, the source and of the observer. The former\ntwo, which may cancel from one system to another, affect the determination of\nthe angular diameter distances in the time-delay formula, and reconstructed\nquantities like the angle to the source, via a lens model. On the other hand,\nthe peculiar velocity of the observer, which is a debated quantity in the\ncontext of the cosmic dipole tension, systematically affects observed angles\nthrough aberration, redshifts, angular diameter distance and reconstructed\nquantities. We compute in detail the effect of these peculiar velocities on the\ninference of the Hubble constant to linear order in the peculiar velocities for\nthe seven lenses of the H0LiCOW/TDCOSMO collaboration. The bias generated by\nthe observer's peculiar velocity alone can reach $1.15\\%$ for the lenses which\nare well aligned with it. This results in a $0.25 \\%$ bias for the seven\ncombined lenses. Assuming a typical peculiar velocity of $300$ km s$^{-1}$ for\nthe lens and the source galaxies, these add an additional random uncertainty,\nwhich can reach $1\\%$ for an individual lens, but reduces to $0.24\\%$ for the\nfull TDCOSMO sample. The picture may change if peculiar velocities turn out to\nbe larger than expected.

Current walkers decode motion intention using information of\nwearable or embedded sensors, namely inertial units, force and hall sensors,\nand lasers, whose main limitations imply an expensive solution or hinder the\nperception of human movement.

New\nstudies suggest that CME-driven shocks can potentially accelerate electrons to\nMeV energies in the vicinity of the Sun. We focus on relativistic electrons\nassociated with strong IP shocks between 2007 and 2019 to determine whether the\nshocks can keep accelerating such electrons up to 1 AU distance.

We present a new filtering method to assess the\nstatistical significance of particle intensity increases and apply it to MeV\nelectron observations in the vicinity of interplanetary shocks.

Our\nmethod identified nine clear cases, where a significant increase of MeV\nelectrons was found in association with a shock.

All nine cases were associated with shocks driven by interplanetary\nCMEs that showed large transit speeds, in excess of 900 km/s. In several cases\nmultiple shocks were observed within one day of the shock related to the\nelectron increase. Although electron ESP events at MeV energies are found to be\nrare at 1 AU our filtering method is not designed to identify a potential\ninterplanetary shock contribution from distances closer to the Sun.

Without introducing any change in topology, the hydrofoil\nmorphing is achieved by six shape design variables associated with the\namplitude and shape of the perturbed displacements. The proposed approach has\nthree to four times lower design variables than shape optimization via\nfree-form deformation techniques and almost two orders lower design variables\ncompared to topology optimization via traditional parametric level sets. Using\nthe fixed Cartesian level set mesh, we also integrate deep convolutional\nencoder-decoder networks as a surrogate of high-fidelity Reynolds-averaged\nNavier-Stokes (RANS) simulations for learning the flow field around hydrofoil\nshapes. We show that an efficient shape representation via parametric level\nsets can enable online convolutional encoder-decoder application for the shape\noptimization of hydrofoils.

However, the performance of\nfrequency identification methods heavily hinges on the amount of user\ncalibration data and data length, which hinders the deployment in real-world\napplications. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based data\ngeneration methods have been widely adopted to create synthetic\nelectroencephalography (EEG) data, holds promise to address these issues. In\nthis paper, we proposed a GAN-based end-to-end signal transformation network\nfor data length extension, termed as TEGAN. TEGAN transforms short-length SSVEP\nsignals into long-length artificial SSVEP signals. By incorporating a novel\nU-Net generator architecture and an auxiliary classifier into the network\narchitecture, the TEGAN could produce conditioned features in the synthetic\ndata. Additionally, we introduced a two-stage training strategy and the\nLeCam-divergence regularization term to regularize the training process of GAN\nduring the network implementation. The proposed TEGAN was evaluated on two\npublic SSVEP datasets (a 4-class dataset and a 12-class dataset). With the\nassistance of TEGAN, the performance of traditional frequency recognition\nmethods and deep learning-based methods have been significantly improved under\nlimited calibration data.

However, the\nliterature claims that the KGEM evaluation procedure would benefit from adding\nsupplementary dimensions to assess. That is why, in this paper, we extend our\npreviously introduced metric Sem@$K$ that measures the capability of models to\npredict valid entities w.r.t. domain and range constrains. In particular, we\nconsider a broad range of KGs and take their respective characteristics into\naccount to propose different versions of Sem@$K$.

Solar Orbiter/EUI\nstarted its Nominal Mission Phase on 2021 November 27. Aims. EUI images from\nthe largest scales in the extended corona off limb, down to the smallest\nfeatures at the base of the corona and chromosphere. EUI is therefore a key\ninstrument for the connection science that is at the heart of the Solar Orbiter\nmission science goals. Methods. The highest resolution on the Sun is achieved\nwhen Solar Orbiter passes through the perihelion part of its orbit. On 2022\nMarch 26, Solar Orbiter reached for the first time a distance to the Sun close\nto 0.3 au. No other coronal EUV imager has been this close to the Sun.

Third, typical\napplications of SSL in areas such as image processing and computer vision (CV),\nas well as natural language processing (NLP), are discussed. Finally, the three\nmain trends of SSL and the open research questions are discussed. A collection\nof useful materials is available at https://github.com/guijiejie/SSL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 14:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

These stars are surrounded by\ndisks with Keplerian or quasi-Keplerian dynamics and outflows composed of gas\nescaping from the rotating disk. Depending on the dominance of these\ncomponents, there are two subclasses of binary post-AGB stars: disk-dominated\nand outflow-dominated. We aim to properly study the hourglass-like structure\nthat surrounds the Keplerian disk around 89 Her. We present total-power\non-the-fly maps of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J$=2-1 emission lines in 89 Her.\nPrevious studies are known to suffer from flux losses in the most extended\ncomponents. We merge these total-power maps with previous NOEMA maps. The\nresulting combined maps are expected to detect the whole nebula extent of the\nsource. Our new combined maps contain the entirety of the detectable flux of\nthe source and at the same time are of high spatial resolution thanks to the\ninterferometric observations. We find that the hourglass-like extended outflow\naround the rotating disk is larger and more massive than suggested by previous\nworks. The total nebular mass of this very extended nebula is 1.8E-2 solar\nmasses, of which 65% comes from the outflow. The observational data and model\nresults lead us to classify the envelope around 89 Her as an outflow-dominated\nnebula, together with R Sct and IRAS 19125+0343 (and very probably AI CMi, IRAS\n20056+1834, and IRAS 18123+0511). The updated statistics on the masses of the\ntwo post-AGB main components reveal that there are two distinct subclasses of\nnebulae around binary post-AGB stars depending on which component is the\ndominant one. We speculate that the absence of an intermediate subclass of\nsources is due to the different initial conditions of the stellar system and\nnot because both subclasses are in different stages of the post-AGB evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 13:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

However, small accuracy variations may increase the sensitivity\nof these accelerators towards undesired subtle disturbances, such as permanent\nfaults. The impact of permanent faults in accurate deep neural network (AccDNN)\naccelerators has been thoroughly investigated in the literature. Conversely,\nthe impact of permanent faults and their mitigation in approximate DNN (AxDNN)\naccelerators is vastly under-explored. Towards this, we first present an\nextensive fault resilience analysis of approximate multi-layer perceptrons\n(MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using the state-of-the-art\nEvoapprox8b multipliers in GPU and TPU accelerators. Then, we propose a novel\nfault mitigation method, i.e., fault-aware retuning of weights (Fal-reTune).\nFal-reTune retunes the weights using a weight mapping function in the presence\nof faults for improved classification accuracy. To evaluate the fault\nresilience and the effectiveness of our proposed mitigation method, we used the\nmost widely used MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. Our results\ndemonstrate that the permanent faults exacerbate the accuracy loss in AxDNNs\ncompared to the AccDNN accelerators. For instance, a permanent fault in AxDNNs\ncan lead to 56\\% accuracy loss, whereas the same faulty bit can lead to only\n4\\% accuracy loss in AccDNN accelerators. We empirically show that our proposed\nFal-reTune mitigation method improves the performance of AxDNNs up to 98%, even\nwith fault rates of up to 50%. Furthermore, we observe that the fault\nresilience in AxDNNs is orthogonal to their energy efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 21:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

We analyze the Laplacian matrix, known\nas supra-Laplacian, constructed through the supra-adjacency matrix associated\nwith the multilayer formulation of temporal networks, using a constant block\nJacobi model which has closed-form solution. To do this, we assume that the\ninter-layer weights are perturbations of the Kronecker sum of the separate\nadjacency matrices forming the temporal network. Thus we investigate the\nproperties of the eigenvectors associated with the smallest eigenvalues (close\nto zero) of the supra-Laplacian matrix. Using arguments of perturbation theory,\nwe show that these eigenvectors can be approximated by linear combinations of\nthe zero eigenvectors of the individual time layers. This finding is crucial in\nreconsidering and generalizing the role of the Fielder vector in\nsupra-Laplacian matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 19:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

While efforts are made to advance touch-based behavioural\nauthentication, researchers often focus on gathering data, tuning classifiers,\nand enhancing performance by evaluating touch interactions in a sequence rather\nthan independently. However, such systems only work by providing data\nrepresenting distinct behavioural traits. The typical approach separates\nbehaviour into touch directions and creates multiple user profiles. This work\npresents an omnidirectional approach which outperforms the traditional method\nindependent of the touch direction - depending on optimal behavioural features\nand a balanced training set. Thus, we evaluate five behavioural feature sets\nusing the conventional approach against our direction-agnostic method while\ntesting several classifiers, including an Extra-Tree and Gradient Boosting\nClassifier, which is often overlooked. Results show that in comparison with the\ntraditional, an Extra-Trees classifier and the proposed approach are superior\nwhen combining strokes. However, the performance depends on the applied feature\nset. We find that the TouchAlytics feature set outperforms others when using\nour approach when combining three or more strokes.
