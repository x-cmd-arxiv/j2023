In this paper we present the results of six surveys designed to\nmeasure familiarity with different styles of facial filters, perceived\nstrangeness of faces edited with different facial filters, and ability to\ndiscern whether images are filtered or not.

Our algorithm, however, considers more\nsophisticated chromosomes and simpler dynamic programming to enable broader\nexploration by the genetic algorithm and efficient exploitation through dynamic\nprogramming and local searches. The key contribution of this paper is the\ndiscovery of how decision-making processes should be divided among the layers\nof genetic algorithm, dynamic programming, and local search. In particular, our\ngenetic algorithm generates the truck and the drone sequences separately and\nencodes them in a type-aware chromosome, wherein each customer is assigned to\neither the truck or the drone.

In\nthis work, we introduce a novel method for predicting SLAM localization error\nbased on the characterization of raw sensor inputs.

We find that the flux scale is accurate to within 5% (compared to\nNVSS at 1.4 GHz). We then determine the global properties of eight Eridanus\nsupergroup members, which are detected in both radio continuum and neutral\nhydrogen (HI) emission, and find that the radio-derived star formation rates\n(SFRs) agree well with previous literature. Using our global and resolved radio\ncontinuum properties of the nearby Eridanus galaxies, we measure and extend the\ninfrared-radio correlation (IRRC) to lower stellar masses and inferred star\nformation rates than before. We find the resolved IRRC to be useful for: 1)\ndiscriminating between AGN and star-forming galaxies (SFGs); 2) identifying\nbackground radio sources; and 3) tracing the effects of group environment\npre-processing in NGC 1385. We find evidence for tidal interactions and\nram-pressure stripping in the HI, resolved spectral index and IRRC morphologies\nof NGC 1385. There appears to be a spatial coincidence (in projection) of\ndouble-lobed radio jets with the central HI hole of NGC 1367. The destruction\nof polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by merger-induced shocks may be\ndriving the observed WISE W3 deficit observed in NGC 1359. Our results suggest\nthat resolved radio continuum and IRRC studies are excellent tracers of the\nphysical processes that drive galaxy evolution and will be possible on larger\nsample of sources with upcoming ASKAP radio continuum surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 16:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

In this paper, we\nleverage the channel aging characteristics to reduce training overhead and to\ndesign a situation-dependent channel re-estimation interval optimization-based\nresource allocation for performance improvement in a multi-target tracking DFRC\nsystem. Specifically, we exploit the channel temporal correlation to predict\nradar and communication channels for reducing the need of training preamble\nretransmission.\n  Then, we characterize the channel aging effects on the Cramer-Rao lower\nbounds (CRLBs) for radar tracking performance analysis and achievable rates\nwith maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) transmit\nbeamforming for communication performance analysis. In particular, the aged\nCRLBs and achievable rates are derived as closed-form expressions with respect\nto the channel aging time, bandwidth, and power.

In contrast to previous works\nwhere the multiple scale method was not mentioned and slow magneto-acoustic\nwaves were included, I present here a theory for fast magneto-acoustic waves\nonly for which an asymptotic closure is possible in three dimensions. I\nintroduce the compressible Elsasser fields (canonical variables) and show their\nlinear relationship with the mass density and the compressible velocity. The\nkinetic equations of wave turbulence for three-wave interactions are obtained\nand the detailed conservation is shown for the two invariants, energy and\nmomentum (cross-helicity). An exact stationary solution (Kolmogorov-Zakharov\nspectrum) exists only for the energy. I find a $k^{-3/2}$ energy spectrum\ncompatible with the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan (IK) phenomenological prediction; this\nleads to a mass density spectrum with the same scaling. Despite the presence of\na relatively strong uniform magnetic field, this turbulence is characterized by\nan energy spectrum with a power index that is independent of the angular\ndirection; its amplitude, however, shows an angular dependence.

In the partially-melted phases,\nknown as vestigial phases, a bilinear made out of combinations of the multiple\ncomponents of the primary order parameter condenses. Multi-component\nsuperconductors are thus natural candidates for vestigial order, since they\nbreak both the U(1)-gauge and also time-reversal or lattice symmetries. Here,\nwe use group theory to classify all possible real-valued and complex-valued\nbilinears of a generic two-component superconductor on a tetragonal or\nhexagonal lattice. While the more widely investigated real-valued bilinears\ncorrespond to vestigial nematic or ferromagnetic order, the little explored\ncomplex-valued bilinears correspond to a vestigial charge-$4e$ condensate,\nwhich itself can have an underlying $s$-wave, $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave, or\n$d_{xy}$-wave symmetry. To properly describe the fluctuating regime of the\nsuperconducting Ginzburg-Landau action and thus access these competing\nvestigial phases, we employ both a large-N and a variational method. We show\nthat while vestigial order can be understood as a weak-coupling effect in the\nlarge-N approach, it is akin to a moderate-coupling effect in the variational\nmethod. Despite these distinctions, both methods yield similar results in wide\nregions of the parameter space spanned by the quartic Landau coefficients.\nSpecifically, we find that the nematic and ferromagnetic phases are the leading\nvestigial instabilities, whereas the various types of charge-$4e$ order are\nattractive albeit subleading vestigial channels. The only exception is for the\nhexagonal case, in which the nematic and $s$-wave charge-4e vestigial states\nare degenerate. We discuss the limitations of our approach, as well as the\nimplications of our results for the realization of exotic charge-4e states in\nmaterial candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 16:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

However, while some adoption of DP has\nhappened in industry, attempts to apply DP to real world complex ML models are\nstill few and far between. The adoption of DP is hindered by limited practical\nguidance of what DP protection entails, what privacy guarantees to aim for, and\nthe difficulty of achieving good privacy-utility-computation trade-offs for ML\nmodels.

This model is closely connected to\nthe Fermi liquid, but is more generally applicable, since it can also be viewed\nas a minimal effective functional describing disordered interacting electrons.\nOur discussion emphasizes the general structure of the theory, and the\nconnection of the scaling parameters to conservation laws.

The NLSM approach allows to identify the dynamical exponent\nconnecting the spatial and energy scales, which is central for the description\nof the kinetic and thermodynamic behavior in the critical region of the MIT in\nthree dimensions. In two dimensions, the system can be discussed in terms of a\nflow in the disorder-interaction phase plane, which is controlled by a fixed\npoint. We demonstrate that the two-parameter RG-equations accurately describe\nelectrons in Si-MOSFETs including the observed non-monotonic behavior of the\nresistance and its strong drop at low temperatures. The theory can also be\napplied to systems with an attractive interaction in the Cooper channel, where\nit describes the suppression of superconductivity in disordered amorphous\nfilms. We extend our discussion to heat transport in the two-dimensional\nelectron liquid. Similar to the electric conductivity, the thermal conductivity\nalso acquires logarithmic corrections induced by electron interaction and\ndisorder.

The first IBEX-Hi results showed that in addition\nto the anticipated globally distributed flux (GDF), a narrow and bright\nemission from a circular region in the sky, dubbed the IBEX ribbon, is visible\nin all energy steps. While the GDF is mainly produced in the inner heliosheath,\nample evidence indicates that the ribbon forms outside the heliopause in the\nregions where the interstellar magnetic field is perpendicular to the lines of\nsight. The IBEX maps produced by the mission team distribute the observations\ninto $6\\deg\\times6\\deg$ rectangle pixels in ecliptic coordinates.

Conventionally, this control is achieved by tuning the density of\nmobile charge carriers. A completely different approach is possible in Mott\ninsulators such as Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, where an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT)\ncan be induced by a weak electric field or current. This phenomenon has\nnumerous potential applications in, e.g., neuromorphic computing. While the\ndriving force of the IMT is poorly understood, it has been thought to be a\nbreakdown of the Mott state. Using in operando angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy, we show that this is not the case: The current-driven conductive\nphase arises with only a minor reorganisation of the Mott state. This can be\nexplained by the co-existence of structurally different domains that emerge\nduring the IMT. Electronic structure calculations show that the boundaries\nbetween domains of slightly different structure lead to a drastic reduction of\nthe overall gap. This permits an increased conductivity, despite the persistent\npresence of the Mott state. This mechanism represents a paradigm shift in the\nunderstanding of IMTs, because it does not rely on the simultaneous presence of\na metallic and an insulating phase, but rather on the combined effect of\nstructurally inhomogeneous Mott phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 17:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

Carbon-free chemical energy\ncarriers are proposed solutions, converting clean electricity into stable media\nfor storage and long-distance energy trade. Hydrogen (H$_2$) is the subject of\nsignificant investment and research. Metal fuels, such as iron (Fe), are\npromising solutions for a clean energy supply, but establishing an\ninterconnected ecosystem still requires considerable research and development.\nA model is proposed to assess the supply chain of hydrogen and iron as clean,\ncarbon-free energy carriers and then examines case studies of possible trade\nroutes between the potential energy exporters Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and\nAustralia and importers Germany and Japan. The work comprehends the assessment\nof economic (levelized cost of electricity - LCOE), energetic (thermodynamic\nefficiency) and environmental (CO$_2$ emissions) aspects, quantified by the\ncomprehensive model accounting for the most critical processes in the supply\nchain. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses identify the main drivers for\nenergy costs. Iron is shown to be lower-cost and more efficient to transport in\nlonger routes and for long-term storage, but potentially more expensive and\nless efficient than H$_2$ to produce and convert. Uncertainties related to the\nsupply chain specifications and the sensitivity to the used variables indicate\nthat the path to viable energy carriers fundamentally depends on efficient\nsynthesis, conversion, storage, and transport. A break-even analysis\ndemonstrated that clean energy carriers could be competitive with conventional\nenergy carriers at low renewable energy prices, while carbon taxes might be\nneeded to level the playing field.

In this work, we use physics-informed machine learning to\ndesign an exchange functional that is both orbital-dependent and nonlocal, but\nwhich can be evaluated at roughly the cost of semi-local functionals and is\nsignificantly faster than hybrid DFT in plane-wave codes.

For the other type\nof strain, the nematic director unlocks from the strain direction and\nspontaneously breaks an in-plane twofold rotational symmetry, which in twisted\nmoir\\'e superlattices triggers an electric polarization. Such a piezoelectric\ntransition changes from first to second-order upon increasing strain, resulting\nin a quantum tricritical point.

The existence of three minima in the nematic action also leaves\nfingerprints in the strain-nematic hysteresis curves, which display multiple\nloops.

The behavior of $\\alpha_s(Q^2)$ at all\nmomentum transfers also provides a connection between perturbative and\nnonperturbative QCD phenomena, such as hadron spectroscopy and dynamics. We\nfirst sketch the origin of the QCD coupling, the reason why its magnitude\ndepends on the scale at which hadronic phenomena are probed, and the resulting\nconsequences for QCD phenomenology.

Further,\ntimestamps corresponding each utterance are prone to inaccuracies and\nword-level timestamps are not available out-of-the-box. To overcome these\nchallenges, we present WhisperX, a time-accurate speech recognition system with\nword-level timestamps utilising voice activity detection and forced phoneme\nalignment. In doing so, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on\nlong-form transcription and word segmentation benchmarks.

Exploiting them to tailor a\ndesired effective Hamiltonian can have major applications and advance the\nsearch for many-body phases. Quantum technologies are mature enough to engineer\nlarge photonic lattices with sophisticated structures coupled to quantum\nemitters. In this context, a fundamental problem is to find general criteria to\ntailor a photonic environment that mediates a desired effective Hamiltonian of\nthe atoms. Among these criteria, topological properties are of utmost\nimportance since an effective atomic Hamiltonian endowed with a non-trivial\ntopology can be protected against disorder and imperfections. Here, we find\ngeneral theorems that govern the topological properties (if any) of\nphoton-mediated Hamiltonians in terms of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian\ntopological invariants, thus unveiling a system-bath topological\ncorrespondence. The results depend on the number of emitters relative to the\nnumber of resonators. For a photonic lattice where each mode is coupled to a\nsingle quantum emitter, the Altland-Zirnbauer classification of topological\ninsulators allows us to link the topology of the atoms to that of the photonic\nbath: we unveil the phenomena of topological preservation and reversal to the\neffect that the atomic topology can be the same or opposite to the photonic\none, depending on Hermiticity of the photonic system and on the parity of the\nspatial dimension. As a consequence, the bulk-edge correspondence implies the\nexistence of atomic boundary modes with the group velocity opposite to the\nphotonic ones in a 2D Hermitian topological system. If there are fewer emitters\nthan photonic modes, the atomic system is less constrained and no general\nphoton-atom topological correspondence can be found.

We aim to constrain the nitrogen chemistry and the\ngas-phase C/O ratio in the highly asymmetric dust trap in the Oph-IRS 48 disk.\nWe use ALMA observations of NO, CN, C$_2$H, and related molecules and model the\neffect of the dust trap on the physical and chemical structure using the\nthermochemical code DALI. Furthermore, we explore how ice sublimation\ncontributes to the observed emission lines. NO is only observed at the location\nof the dust trap but CN and C$_2$H are not detected in the Oph-IRS 48 disk.\nThis results in an CN/NO column density ratio of $< 0.05$ and thus a low C/O\nratio at the location of the dust trap. The main gas-phase formation pathways\nto NO through OH and NH in the fiducial model predict NO emission that is an\norder of magnitude lower than is observed. The gaseous NO column density can be\nincreased by factors ranging from 2.8 to 10 when the H$_2$O and NH$_3$ gas\nabundances are significantly boosted by ice sublimation. However, these models\nare inconsistent with the upper limits on the H$_2$O and OH column densities\nderived from observations. We propose that the NO emission in the Oph-IRS 48\ndisk is closely related to the nitrogen containing ices sublimating in the dust\ntrap. The non-detection of CN constrains the C/O ratio both inside and outside\nthe dust trap to be $< 1$ if all nitrogen initially starts as N$_2$ and $\\leq\n0.6$, consistent with the Solar value, if (part of) the nitrogen initially\nstarts as N or NH$_3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Streaming applications usually run\nin dedicated Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) that adopt the DataFlow model,\nwhich defines such applications as graphs of operators that, step by step,\ntransform data into the desired results. As operators can be deployed and\nexecuted independently, the DataFlow model supports parallelism and\ndistribution, thus making streaming applications scalable.\n  Today, we witness an abundance of SPEs, each with its set of operators. In\nthis context, understanding how operators' semantics overlap within and across\nSPEs, and thus which SPEs can support a given application, is not trivial. We\ntackle this problem by formally showing that common operators of SPEs can be\nexpressed as compositions of a single, minimalistic Aggregate operator, thus\nshowing any framework able to run compositions of such an operator can run\napplications defined for state-of-the-art SPEs. The Aggregate operator only\nrelies on core concepts of the DataFlow model such as data partitioning by key\nand time-based windows, and can only output up to one value for each window it\nanalyzes. Together with our formal argumentation, we empirically assess how an\nSPE that only relies on such an operator compares with an SPE offering\noperator-specific implementations, as well as study the performance impact of a\nmore expressive Aggregate operator by relaxing the constraint of outputting up\nto one value per window.\n  The existence of such a common denominator not only implies the portability\nof operators within and across SPEs but also defines a concise set of\nrequirements for other data processing frameworks to support streaming\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 19:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

We use\nnumerical continuation, together with extensive direct numerical simulations,\nto study SH35 with an additional nonvariational quadratic term to model the\neffects of breaking the midplane reflection symmetry. The nonvariational\nstructure of the model leads to the propagation of asymmetric spatially\nlocalized structures (LSs).

Next, we present an extensive study\nof possible collision scenarios between identical and nonidentical traveling\nstructures, varying a temperature-like control parameter. The final state may\nbe a simple bound state of the initial LSs or longer or shorter than the sum of\nthe two initial states as a result of nonlinear interactions.

Using simple\nthermodynamics and fluid mechanics, we show that a planet with sufficiently\nhigh concentrations of greenhouse gases must develop a convecting troposphere.\nThe planet must also develop a non-convecting stratosphere above the\ntropopause. In the simplest approximation of an atmosphere that is transparent\nto sunlight and has frequency-independent opacity for thermal radiation, one\ncan find simple formulas for the tropopause altitude, and for the altitude\nprofiles of pressure and temperature. The troposphere is nearly isentropic and\nthe stratosphere is nearly isothermal. Earth's real atmosphere is much more\ncomplicated but it does have a troposphere and a stratosphere. Between the\nsurface and the tropopause the entropy per kilogram of real tropospheric air\nincreases slowly with altitude. The entropy increases much more rapidly with\naltitude in the stratosphere. The stratosphere has a nearly isothermal lower\npart and a hotter upper part due to absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation\nby ozone. The thermal opacity of the real atmosphere has a complicated\nfrequency dependence due to the hundreds of thousands of vibration-rotation\ntransitions of its greenhouse molecules. Unlike the simple model where nearly\nall radiation to space originates at the tropopause altitude, radiation to\nspace from Earth's real atmosphere originates from both the surface and all\naltitudes in the troposphere. A small additional amount of radiation originates\nin the stratosphere. When these complications are taken into account, model\ncalculations of the thermal radiation spectrum at the top of the atmosphere can\nhardly be distinguished from satellite observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 20:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

The objective of the defender is to\ncovertly guide the attacker to a trap state from which the attacker cannot\nachieve their goal. Further, the defender is constrained to achieve its goal\nwithin K number of steps, where K is calculated as a pessimistic lower bound\nwithin which the attacker is unlikely to suspect a threat in the environment.\nSuch a defense strategy is highly useful in real world systems like honeypots\nor honeynets, where an unsuspecting attacker interacts with a simulated\nproduction system while assuming it is the actual production system. Typically,\nthe interaction between an attacker and a defender is captured using game\ntheoretic frameworks. Our problem formulation allows us to capture it as a much\nsimpler infinite horizon discounted MDP, in which the optimal policy for the\nMDP gives the defender's strategy against the actions of the attacker. Through\nempirical evaluation, we show the merits of our problem formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 21:08:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 21:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

In particular, with a current push in space exploration, it is\nbeneficial to study how the properties of such materials evolve under proton\nirradiation. Owing to their robust intra-layer stability and sensitivity to\nexternal perturbations, these materials provide excellent opportunities for\nstudying proton irradiation as a non-destructive tool for controlling their\nmagnetic properties. Specifically, the exfoliable Cr2Si2Te6 (CST) is a\nferromagnetic semiconductor with the Curie temperature (TC) of ~32 K. Here, we\nhave investigated the magnetic properties of CST upon proton irradiation as a\nfunction of fluence (1 x 1015, 5 x 1015, 1 x 1016, 5 x 1016, and 1 x 1018\nH+/cm2) by employing variable-temperature, variable-field magnetization\nmeasurements coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy\nand detail how the magnetization, magnetic anisotropy and EPR spectral\nparameters vary as a function of proton fluence across the magnetic phase\ntransition.

Herein, we assess the relationship between the\nbuilt-up probability in GHS-BUILT-S2 and reference built-up surface fractions\nderived from a highly reliable reference database for several regions in the\nUnited States. Furthermore, we identify a binarization threshold using an\nagreement maximization method that creates binary built-up land data from these\nbuilt-up probabilities. These binary surfaces are input to a spatially\nexplicit, scale-sensitive accuracy assessment which includes the use of a\nnovel, visual-analytical tool which we call focal precision-recall signature\nplots. Our analysis reveals that a threshold of 0.5 applied to GHS-BUILT-S2\nmaximizes the agreement with binarized built-up land data derived from the\nreference built-up area fraction. We find high levels of accuracy (i.e.,\ncounty-level F-1 scores of almost 0.8 on average) in the derived built-up\nareas, and consistently high accuracy along the rural-urban gradient in our\nstudy area. These results reveal considerable accuracy improvements in human\nsettlement models based on Sentinel-2 data and deep learning, in both rural and\nurban areas, as compared to earlier, Landsat-based versions of the Global Human\nSettlement Layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 22:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

To address this problem, this\npaper presents a new LDP approach, an improved Christofides mechanism.\n  It compared four statistical survey methods for conducting surveys on\nsensitive topics -- modified Warner, Simmons, Christofides, and the improved\nChristofides mechanism. Specifically, Warner, Simmons and Christofides\nmechanisms have been modified to draw a sample from the population without\nreplacement, to decrease variance.

These\nchallenges arise due to differences in material stiffnesses, the interaction\nbetween multiple phases, high bulk modulus of pore fluid, and low permeability.\nThe conventional explicit time integration scheme is limited by its conditional\nstability, necessitating small time step sizes and resulting in pressure\noscillations under rapid loading conditions. To address these issues, we\npropose a stable two-phase contact algorithm within the Material Point Method\n(MPM) framework for soil-structure interaction problems. Our algorithm models\nthe soil as a fully saturated porous media with incompressible pore fluid. We\nintroduce three main advancements over conventional MPM methods. We employ\nChorin's projection method to solve coupled formulations and reduce numerical\noscillations. By implicitly handling a diffusion term, our algorithm permits\nlarger stable time step sizes, independent of the bulk modulus and permeability\nof the pore fluid. Lastly, We integrate a rigid algorithm to model solid bodies\naccurately and a precise contact detection algorithm. We provide detailed\nformulations and time increment processes of the two-phase contact MPM\nalgorithm. Furthermore, we compare the proposed algorithm with Finite Element\nMethod (FEM) and explicit MPM to assess its accuracy and performance in\nsimulating coupled hydro-mechanical problems. The two-phase contact algorithm\noffers a more stable and efficient approach to simulate soil-structure\ninteraction problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 23:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

We compare our results to\nprevious analytical work, and find that thermal forces (the contribution to the\ndisc's force arising from thermal effects) match those predicted by linear\ntheory within $\\sim 20$%. When the planet's luminosity exceeds a threshold\nfound to be within $10$% of that predicted by linear theory, its eccentricity\nand inclination grow exponentially, whereas these quantities undergo a strong\ndamping below this threshold. In this regime of low luminosity indeed, thermal\ndiffusion cools the surroundings of the planet and allows gas to accumulate in\nits vicinity. It is the dynamics of this gas excess that contributes to damp\neccentricity and inclination. The damping rates obtained can be up to $h^{-1}$\ntimes larger than those due to the resonant interaction with the disc, where\n$h$ is the disc's aspect ratio. This suggests that models that incorporate\nplanet-disc interactions using well-known formulae based on resonant\nwave-launching to describe the evolution of eccentricity and inclination\nunderestimate the damping action of the disc on the eccentricity and\ninclination of low-mass planets by an order of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 23:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Three spatial analytics methods are utilized to\ngenerate the place name ontology: 1) Kernel Density Estimation (KDE); 2)\nDynamic Method Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise\n(DBSCAN); 3) hierarchal clustering. We identified feature types of place name\nontologies from geotagged social media data and classified them by comparing\ntheir default search radius of KDE of geo-tagged points. By tracing the\nseasonal changes of highly dynamic non-administrative places, seasonal\nvariation patterns were observed, which illustrates the dynamic changes in\nplace ontology caused by the change in human activities and conversation over\ntime and space. We also investigate the semantic meaning of each place name by\nexamining Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) scores and word clouds. The major\ncontribution of this research is to link and analyze the associations between\nplace, space, and their attributes in the field of geography. Researchers can\nuse crowd-sourced data to study the ontology of places rather than relying on\ntraditional gazetteers. The dynamic ontology in this research can provide\nbright insight into urban planning and re-zoning and other related industries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 00:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Recent experimental studies have demonstrated a fairly special\nbehavior in the smoothness of the training objective along its trajectory when\ntrained with gradient clipping. That is, the smoothness grows with the gradient\nnorm. This is in clear contrast to the well-established assumption in folklore\nnon-convex optimization, a.k.a. $L$--smoothness, where the smoothness is\nassumed to be bounded by a constant $L$ globally. The recently introduced\n$(L_0,L_1)$--smoothness is a more relaxed notion that captures such behavior in\nnon-convex optimization. In particular, it has been shown that under this\nrelaxed smoothness assumption, SGD with clipping requires $O(\\epsilon^{-4})$\nstochastic gradient computations to find an $\\epsilon$--stationary solution.

This is caused by both knowledge level uncertainty due to limited\ntraining data for accurate smoke segmentation and labeling level uncertainty\nrepresenting the difficulty in labeling ground-truth. To effectively model the\ntwo types of uncertainty, we introduce a Bayesian generative model to\nsimultaneously estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters and its\npredictions.

Trials require\ncareful design to, for example, maintain the safety of participants, use\nresources efficiently and allow clinically meaningful conclusions to be drawn.\nAdaptive clinical trials (i.e. trials that can be altered based on evidence\nthat has accrued) are often more efficient, informative and ethical than\nstandard or non-adaptive trials because they require fewer participants, target\nmore promising treatments, and can stop early with sufficient evidence of\neffectiveness or harm. The design of adaptive trials requires the\npre-specification of adaptions that are permissible throughout the conduct of\nthe trial. Proposed adaptive designs are then usually evaluated through\nsimulation which provides indicative metrics of performance (e.g. statistical\npower and type-1 error) under different scenarios.

Exploiting deep learning and introducing compact WSI\nrepresentations are urgently needed to accelerate image analysis and facilitate\nthe visualization and interpretability of pathology results in a postpandemic\nworld. In this paper, we introduce a new evolutionary approach for WSI\nrepresentation based on large-scale multi-objective optimization (LSMOP) of\ndeep embeddings. We start with patch-based sampling to feed KimiaNet , a\nhistopathology-specialized deep network, and to extract a multitude of feature\nvectors. Coarse multi-objective feature selection uses the reduced search space\nstrategy guided by the classification accuracy and the number of features. In\nthe second stage, the frequent features histogram (FFH), a novel WSI\nrepresentation, is constructed by multiple runs of coarse LSMOP. Fine\nevolutionary feature selection is then applied to find a compact (short-length)\nfeature vector based on the FFH and contributes to a more robust deep-learning\napproach to digital pathology supported by the stochastic power of evolutionary\nalgorithms. We validate the proposed schemes using The Cancer Genome Atlas\n(TCGA) images in terms of WSI representation, classification accuracy, and\nfeature quality. Furthermore, a novel decision space for multicriteria decision\nmaking in the LSMOP field is introduced. Finally, a patch-level visualization\napproach is proposed to increase the interpretability of deep features.

Within the\nWoods-Saxon potential as a nuclear component, we are able to quantify the\ndifferences in proton single-particle energies due to the differences from the\nmodel-independent data of the uniform distribution, the two-parameter Fermi\nfunction, as well as the charge density obtained from a microscopic\nHartree-Fock calculation using the effective Skyrme interaction. The obtained\nenergy differences are generally small in magnitude, namely about 100~keV or\nless if the parameters of the charge density models are appropriately\ndetermined. Considerable larger differences appear when the last occupied state\nis highly filled and, at the same time, has a small orbital angular momentum.\nSulfur isotopes ($Z=16$) are a perfect example of these nuclei. Unfortunately,\ndespite its simplicity, the uniform distribution cannot be used for evaluating\nthe Coulomb exchange term within a well-established method because it is not\ndifferentiable at the surface of a nucleus.

Thus, we hypothesize that there could be a more efficient way\nto train an ANN using a better representative sample. For this, we propose the\nLAD Improved Iterative Training (LIIT), a novel training approach for ANN using\nlarge deviations principle to generate and iteratively update training samples\nin a fast and efficient setting. This is exploratory work with extensive\nopportunities for future work. The thesis presents this ongoing research work\nwith the following contributions from this study: (1) We propose a novel ANN\ntraining method, LIIT, based on the large deviations theory where additional\ndimensionality reduction is not needed to study high dimensional data. (2) The\nLIIT approach uses a Modified Training Sample (MTS) that is generated and\niteratively updated using a LAD anomaly score based sampling strategy. (3) The\nMTS sample is designed to be well representative of the training data by\nincluding most anomalous of the observations in each class.

However, atomistic\nmodeling is currently feasible for only the smallest window of droplet sizes\nappearing at the end of a disintegrating droplet's lifetime. The relevance of\nthe observations made to the actual droplet evolution, which is much longer\nthat the simulated sizes, has not been addressed. Here, we perform a systematic\nstudy of desolvation mechanisms of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), protonated\npeptides of different compositions and proteins in order to (a) examine whether\natomistic modeling can establish the extrusion mechanism of proteins from\ndroplets and (b) obtain insight for the charging mechanism in larger droplets\nthan those simulated. Atomistic modeling of PEG charging shows that above a\ncritical droplet size charging occurs transiently by transfer of ions from the\nsolvent to the macroion, while below the critical size, the capture of the ion\nfrom PEG has a lifetime sufficiently long for extrusion of the charged PEG from\nan aqueous droplet. This is the first report of the role of droplet curvature\nin the conformations and charging of macroions. Simulations with highly\nhydrophobic peptides show that partial extrusion of a peptide from the droplet\nsurface is rare relative to desolvation by drying-out. Differently from what\nhas been presented in the literature we argue that atomistic simulations have\nnot sufficiently established extrusion mechanism of proteins from droplets and\ntheir charging mechanism. Moreover, we argue that release of highly charged\nproteins can occur at an earlier stage of a droplet's lifetime than predicted\nby atomistic modeling. In this earlier stage, we emphasize the key role of jets\nemanating from a droplet at the point of charge-induced instability in the\nrelease of proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 05:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

In this\nwork, we measure and rank the importance of economies using nine node metrics\nin an evolutionary way.

Currently, magnetic fields are considered to be an essential\nfactor in the launching and accelerating of the jet. However, current\nobservational estimates of the magnetic field strength of the M87 jet are\nlimited to the innermost part of the jet or to HST-1. No attempt has yet been\nmade to measure the magnetic field strength in between. We aim to infer the\nmagnetic field strength of the M87 jet out to a distance of several thousand\n$r_s$ by tracking the distance-dependent changes in the synchrotron spectrum of\nthe jet from high-resolution very long baseline interferometry observations. In\norder to obtain high-quality spectral index maps, quasi-simultaneous\nobservations at 22 and 43 GHz were conducted using the KVN and VERA Array\n(KaVA) and the VLBA. We compared the spectral index distributions obtained from\nthe observations with a model and placed limits on the magnetic field strengths\nas a function of distance. The overall spectral morphology is broadly\nconsistent over the course of these observations. The observed synchrotron\nspectrum rapidly steepens from $\\alpha_{22-43 GHz}$ ~ -0.7 at ~ 2 mas to\n$\\alpha_{22-43 GHz}$ ~ -2.5 at ~ 6 mas. A spectral index model in which\nnonthermal electron injections inside the jet decrease with distance can\nadequately reproduce the observed trend. This suggests the magnetic field\nstrength of the jet at a distance of 2 - 10 mas (~ 900 $r_s$ - ~ 4500 $r_s$ in\nthe deprojected distance) has a range of $B=(0.3 - 1.0 G)(z/2 mas)^{-0.73}$.\nExtrapolating to the EHT scale yields consistent results, suggesting that the\nmajority of the magnetic flux of the jet near the black hole is preserved out\nto ~ 4500 $r_s$ without significant dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 07:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

To achieve this, three areas on the sCMOS sensor, each\nconsisting of 99 * 99 pixels, are chosen for the experiment. The readout noise,\nconversion gain and energy resolutions of the individual pixels in these areas\nare measured from a large number (more than 25,000) of X-ray events accumulated\nfor each of the pixels through long time exposures. The energy resolution of\nthese pixels can reach 140 eV at 6.4 keV at room temperature and shows a\nsignificant positive correlation with the readout noise. The accurate gain can\nalso be derived individually for each of the pixels from its X-ray spectrum\nobtained. Variations of the gain values are found at a level of 0.56%\nstatistically among the 30 thousand pixels in the areas studied. With the gain\nof each pixel determined accurately, a precise gain correction is performed\npixel by pixel in these areas, in contrast to the standardized ensemble gain\nused in the conventional method. In this way, we could almost completely\neliminate the degradation of energy resolutions caused by gain variations among\npixels. As a result, the energy resolution at room temperature can be\nsignificantly improved to 124.6 eV at 4.5 keV and 140.7 eV at 6.4 keV.

The\ncurrent advances utilize the ability of heuristic algorithms to optimize\nseveral well-known objective constraints, such as difficulty degree, number of\nquestions, etc., for producing optimal solutions. However, in real scenarios,\nconsidering other equally relevant objectives (e.g., distribution of exam\nscores, skill coverage) is extremely important. Besides, how to develop an\nautomatic multi-objective solution that finds an optimal subset of questions\nfrom a huge search space of large-sized question datasets and thus composes a\nhigh-quality exam paper is urgent but non-trivial. To this end, we skillfully\ndesign a reinforcement learning guided Multi-Objective Exam Paper Generation\nframework, termed MOEPG, to simultaneously optimize three exam domain-specific\nobjectives including difficulty degree, distribution of exam scores, and skill\ncoverage.

How to effectively\nallocate the incentives so as to maximize the return (e.g., business\nobjectives) under the budget constraint, however, is less studied in the\nliterature. This problem is technically challenging due to the facts that 1)\nthe allocation strategy has to be learned using historically logged data, which\nis counterfactual in nature, and 2) both the optimality and feasibility (i.e.,\nthat cost cannot exceed budget) needs to be assessed before being deployed to\nonline systems.

Natal kicks are an integral input parameter for population synthesis\ncodes, and have implications for the formation of double NS systems and their\nsubsequent merger rates. However, many of the standard observational kick\ndistributions that are used are obtained from samples created only from\nisolated NSs. Kick distributions derived in this way overestimate the intrinsic\nNS kick distribution. For NSs in binaries, we can only directly estimate the\neffect of the natal kick on the binary system, instead of the natal kick\nreceived by the NS itself. Here, for the first time, we present a binary kick\ndistribution for NSs with low-mass companions. We compile a catalogue of 145\nNSs in low-mass binaries with the best available constraints on proper motion,\ndistance, and systemic radial velocity. For each binary, we use a\nthree-dimensional approach to estimate its binary kick. We discuss the\nimplications of these kicks on system formation, and provide a parametric model\nfor the overall binary kick distribution, for use in future theoretical\nmodelling work. We compare our results with other work on isolated NSs and NSs\nin binaries, finding that the NS kick distributions fit using only isolated\npulsars underestimate the fraction of NSs that receive low kicks. We discuss\nthe implications of our results on modelling double NS systems, and provide\nsuggestions on how to use our results in future theoretical works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 08:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

The performance of the\nmethod is demonstrated using isogeometric Kirchhoff-Love shells on problems\nwith snap-through and pitch-fork instabilities.

Inspired by the\nfact that predicates are highly correlated with semantics hidden in\nsubject-object pair and global context, we propose LANDMARK (LANguage-guiDed\nrepresentationenhanceMent frAmewoRK) that learns predicate-relevant\nrepresentations from language-vision interactive patterns, global language\ncontext and pair-predicate correlation. Specifically, we first project object\nlabels to three distinctive semantic embeddings for different representation\nlearning. Then, Language Attention Module (LAM) and Experience Estimation\nModule (EEM) process subject-object word embeddings to attention vector and\npredicate distribution, respectively. Language Context Module (LCM) encodes\nglobal context from each word embed-ding, which avoids isolated learning from\nlocal information. Finally, modules outputs are used to update visual\nrepresentations and SGG model's prediction. All language representations are\npurely generated from object categories so that no extra knowledge is needed.\nThis framework is model-agnostic and consistently improves performance on\nexisting SGG models.

A central\naspect of uncertainty quantification is the ability of a model to return\npredictions that are well-aligned with the actual probability of the model\nbeing correct, also known as model calibration. Although many methods have been\nproposed to improve calibration, no technique can match the simple, but\nexpensive approach of training an ensemble of deep neural networks. In this\npaper we introduce a form of simplified ensembling that bypasses the costly\ntraining and inference of deep ensembles, yet it keeps its calibration\ncapabilities. The idea is to replace the common linear classifier at the end of\na network by a set of heads that are supervised with different loss functions\nto enforce diversity on their predictions. Specifically, each head is trained\nto minimize a weighted Cross-Entropy loss, but the weights are different among\nthe different branches. We show that the resulting averaged predictions can\nachieve excellent calibration without sacrificing accuracy in two challenging\ndatasets for histopathological and endoscopic image classification. Our\nexperiments indicate that Multi-Head Multi-Loss classifiers are inherently\nwell-calibrated, outperforming other recent calibration techniques and even\nchallenging Deep Ensembles' performance.

The\ninterpretation of such anomalies provides evidence for the environment of the\nbirth of the Sun, its accretion process, the evolution of the solar\nproto-planetary disk, and the formation of the planets. A crucial element of\nsuch interpretation is the comparison of the observed anomalies to predictions\nfrom models of stellar nucleosynthesis. To date, however, this comparison has\nbeen limited to a handful of model predictions. This is mostly because the\ncalculated stellar abundances need to be transformed into a specific\nrepresentation, which nuclear astrophysicists and stellar nucleosynthesis\nresearchers are not familiar with. Here, we show in detail that this\nrepresentation is needed to account for mass fractionation effects in meteorite\ndata that can be generated both in nature and during instrumental analysis. We\nexplain the required internal normalisation to a selected isotopic ratio,\ndescribe the motivations behind such representation more widely, and provide\nthe tools to perform the calculations.

The measurements of the charge stability diagram for a\ncapacitively coupled, parallel double-QD formed from a QD in the TQD and the\nsensor QD show a visible capacitance coupling between the TQD and the sensor\nQD, indicating a good sensitivity of the charge sensor. The charge stability\ndiagrams of the TQD are measured by the charge sensor and the global features\nseen in the measured charge stability diagrams are well reproduced by the\nsimultaneous measurements of the direct transport current through the TQD and\nby the simulation made based on an effective capacitance network model. The\ncomplex charge stability diagrams of the TQD are measured in detail with the\nintegrated charge sensor in an energetically degenerate region, where all the\nthree QDs are on or nearly on resonance, and the formations of quadruple points\nand of all possible eight charge states are observed.

However, point cloud\nmaps acquired using consumer-level light detection and ranging sensors (lidars)\nstill suffer from bias related to local surface properties such as measuring\nbeam-to-surface incidence angle, distance, texture, reflectance, or\nillumination conditions. This fact has recently motivated researchers to\nexploit traditional filters, as well as the deep learning paradigm, in order to\nsuppress the aforementioned depth sensors error while preserving geometric and\nmap consistency details. Despite the effort, depth correction of lidar\nmeasurements is still an open challenge mainly due to the lack of clean 3D data\nthat could be used as ground truth. In this paper, we introduce two novel point\ncloud map consistency losses, which facilitate self-supervised learning on real\ndata of lidar depth correction models.

Since spacecraft provide sparse in situ observation\npoints, remote sensing these modes using ground-based instruments in the polar\nregions is desirable. However, many open conceptual questions on the expected\nsignatures remain. Therefore, we provide predictions of key qualitative\nfeatures expected in auroral, ionospheric, and ground magnetic observations\nthrough both magnetohydrodynamic theory and a global coupled\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere simulation of a magnetopause surface eigenmode. These\nshow monochromatic oscillatory field-aligned currents, due to both the surface\nmode and its non-resonant Alfv\\'en coupling, are present throughout the\nmagnetosphere. The currents peak in amplitude at the equatorward edge of the\nmagnetopause boundary layer, not the open-closed boundary as previously\nthought. They also exhibit slow poleward phase motion rather than being purely\nevanescent. We suggest the upward field-aligned current perturbations may\nresult in periodic auroral brightenings. In the ionosphere, convection vortices\ncirculate the poleward moving field-aligned current structures. Finally,\nsurface mode signals are predicted in the ground magnetic field, with\nionospheric Hall currents rotating perturbations by approximately (but not\nexactly) 90{\\deg} compared to the magnetosphere. Thus typical dayside\nmagnetopause surface modes should be strongest in the East-West ground magnetic\nfield component. Overall, all ground-based signatures of the magnetopause\nsurface mode are predicted to have the same frequency across L-shells,\namplitudes that maximise near the magnetopause's equatorward edge, and larger\nlatitudinal scales than for field line resonance. Implications in terms of\nionospheric Joule heating and geomagnetically induced currents are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 10:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Just like in the CPU world,\nthere is a need for performant GPU-resident index structures to speed up query\nprocessing. Unfortunately, mapping indexes efficiently to the highly parallel\nand hard-to-program hardware is challenging and often fails to yield the\ndesired performance and flexibility. Therefore, we advocate to take a different\nroute. Instead of proposing yet another hand-tailored index, we investigate\nwhether we can exploit an indexing mechanism that is already built into modern\nGPUs: The raytracing hardware accelerator provided by NVIDIA RTX cards. To do\nso, we re-phrase database indexing as a raytracing problem, where we express\nthe dataset to be indexed as primitives in a scene, and queries as rays. In\nthis combination, coined RX in the following, lookups are performed as\nintersection tests in hardware by dedicated raytracing cores. To analyze the\npros, cons, and usefulness of the raytracing pipeline for database indexing, we\ncarefully evaluate RX along twelve dimensions: We first identify the optimal\nsetup of the pipeline by evaluating different options regarding (1) how to\nexpress keys, (2) which primitives to use for that, (3) how to formulate\npoint/range queries against these, and (4) how to update the index. Continuing\nwith the best setup, we compare RX against a set of software-implemented\nGPU-resident index structures while varying (5) the number of inserts and\nqueries, (6) the order of the data, (7) the batch size, (8) the hit/miss ratio,\n(9) the selectivity of range queries, (10) the key size, and (11) the\ndistribution of inserts and queries. Finally, we evaluate (12) the impact of\nthree different GPU generations on the performance. Our results show that RX is\ncompetitive against traditional counterparts in a variety of situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 10:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Among these inefficiencies are human factors, such as how to\nmanage staff during periods of high demand, and technical factors, including\nthe management of Portable Medical Devices (PMD), such as mechanical\nventilators, capnography monitors, infusion pumps, or pulse oximeters. These\ndevices, which are vital for monitoring patients or performing different\nprocedures, were found to have a high turnover during high-demand, resulting in\ninefficiencies and more pressure on medical teams.\n  Thus, the work PMD-Track evaluates in detail two popular indoor tracking\napproaches concerning their accuracy, placement of beacons, and economic\nimpacts. The key novelty of PMD-Track relies on using smartphones provided to\nhospital employees, replacing typical stationary gateways spread across a\nhospital, functioning as mobile gateways with a front-end that assists staff in\nlocating PMDs. As employees approach tagged PMDs, their smartphone\nautomatically updates the location of spotted PMDs in real-time, providing\nroom-level localization data with up to 83% accuracy for fingerprinting and 35%\nfor multilateration. In addition, fingerprinting is 45% cheaper than\nmultilateration over the course of five years. Practical experiments were\nevaluated based on two locations in Z\\\"urich, Switzerland.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 10:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

In this paper, we\nderive a Grad-Shafranov-like equation solving for the axisymmetric drift\nsurfaces of the runaway electrons for the simple case that all runaway electron\nshare the same parallel momentum. This new equilibrium equation is then\nnumerically solved with simple rectangular wall with ITER-like and MAST-like\ngeometry parameters. The deviation between the drift surfaces and the flux\nsurfaces is readily obtained, and runaway electrons is found to be well\nconfined even in regions with open field lines. The change of the runaway\nelectron parallel momentum is found to result in a horizontal current center\ndisplacement without any changes in the total current or the external field.\nThe runaway current density profile is found to affect the susceptibility of\nsuch displacement, with flatter profiles result in more displacement by the\nsame momentum change. With up-down asymmetry in the external poloidal field,\nsuch displacement is accompanied by a vertical displacement of runaway electron\ncurrent. It is found that this effect is more pronounced in smaller, compact\ndevice and weaker poloidal field cases. The above results demonstrate the\ndynamics of current center displacement caused by the momentum space change in\nthe runaway electrons, and pave way for future, more sophisticated runaway\ncurrent equilibrium theory with more realistic consideration on the runaway\nelectron momentum distribution. This new equilibrium theory also provides\nfoundation for future stability analysis of the runaway electron current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 10:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

However, due to weight and\npower constraints, there is a need to investigate alternate modes of propulsion\nto navigate in the stratosphere. Very recently, reinforcement learning has been\nproposed as a control scheme to maintain the balloon in the region of a fixed\nlocation, facilitated through diverse opposing wind-fields at different\naltitudes. Although air-pump based station keeping has been explored, there is\nno research on the control problem for venting and ballasting actuated\nballoons, which is commonly used as a low-cost alternative. We show how\nreinforcement learning can be used for this type of balloon. Specifically, we\nuse the soft actor-critic algorithm, which on average is able to station-keep\nwithin 50\\;km for 25\\% of the flight, consistent with state-of-the-art.\nFurthermore, we show that the proposed controller effectively minimises the\nconsumption of resources, thereby supporting long duration flights. We frame\nthe controller as a continuous control reinforcement learning problem, which\nallows for a more diverse range of trajectories, as opposed to current\nstate-of-the-art work, which uses discrete action spaces. Furthermore, through\ncontinuous control, we can make use of larger ascent rates which are not\npossible using air-pumps. The desired ascent-rate is decoupled into desired\naltitude and time-factor to provide a more transparent policy, compared to\nlow-level control commands used in previous works. Finally, by applying the\nequations of motion, we establish appropriate thresholds for venting and\nballasting to prevent the agent from exploiting the environment. More\nspecifically, we ensure actions are physically feasible by enforcing\nconstraints on venting and ballasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 11:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

The luminosity of these systems are often\ncompared to the Eddington limit, the border at which the spherical accretion is\ninhibited by the radiation pressure of photons it produces. The discovery of\nultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) showed that accretion can proceed even when\nthe apparent luminosity exceeds the Eddington limit (Kaaret et al. 2017). High\napparent luminosity might be produced by the beaming of the incident radiation\nby a thick collimated outflow or by a truly super-Eddington accretion flow.\nHowever, possibilities to study these outflows in detail are limited, as ULXs\nare typically found in distant galaxies. Using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry\nExplorer (IXPE, Weisskopf et al. 2022), we made the first measurement of X-ray\npolarization in Galactic X-ray binary Cyg X-3. The detection of high,\n$\\approx$25\\%, nearly energy-independent linear polarization, orthogonal to the\ndirection of the radio ejections, unambiguously indicates the primary source is\nobscured and the observer on Earth only sees reflected and scattered light.\nModelling shows there is an optically thick envelope with a narrow funnel\naround the primary X-ray source in the system. We derive an upper limit on the\nopening angle of the funnel that implies a lower limit on the beamed luminosity\nexceeding the Eddington value.

Our findings\nreveal this unique persistent source as an ideal laboratory for the study of\nthe inner workings of ULX central engines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 11:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

However, an accurate\nmeasurement of the prompt emission properties of this burst is very challenging\ndue to its exceptional brightness. With joint observations of\n\\textit{Insight}-HXMT and GECAM-C, we made an unprecedentedly accurate\nmeasurement of the emission during the first $\\sim$1800 s of GRB 221009A,\nincluding its precursor, main emission (ME, which dominates the burst in flux),\nflaring emission and early afterglow, in the hard X-ray to soft gamma-ray band\nfrom $\\sim$ 10 keV to $\\sim$ 6 MeV. Based on the GECAM-C unsaturated data of\nthe ME, we measure a record-breaking isotropic equivalent energy ($E_{\\rm\niso}$) of $\\bf \\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{55}$ erg, which is about eight times the\ntotal rest-mass energy of the Sun. The early afterglow data require a\nsignificant jet break between 650 s and 1100 s, most likely at $\\sim950$ s from\nthe afterglow starting time $T_{AG}$, which corresponds to a jet opening angle\nof $\\sim {0.7^\\circ} \\ (\\eta_\\gamma n)^{1/8}$, where $n$ is the ambient medium\ndensity in units of $\\rm cm^{-3}$ and $\\eta_\\gamma$ is the ratio between\n$\\gamma$-ray energy and afterglow kinetic energy.

Moreover, the\ntransformed state-propagation Jacobian becomes an identity matrix which is more\nsuitable for distribution.

Due to the data-intensive nature of deep neural\nnetworks and the labor-intensive process of manual annotation, researchers have\nbeen exploring various methods for automatically generating synthetic\nmultimodal misinformation - which we refer to as Synthetic Misinformers - in\norder to train MMD models. However, limited evaluation on real-world\nmisinformation and a lack of comparisons with other Synthetic Misinformers\nmakes difficult to assess progress in the field.

Although current devices can easily\ntake very high-resolution images, current approaches of object detection seldom\nconsider detecting tiny object or the large scale variance problem in high\nresolution images. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet efficient approach\nthat improves accuracy of object detection especially for small objects and\nlarge scale variance scene while reducing the computational cost in high\nresolution image. Inspired by observing that overall detection accuracy is\nreduced if the image is properly down-sampled but the recall rate is not\nsignificantly reduced. Besides, small objects can be better detected by\ninputting high-resolution images even if using lightweight detector. We propose\na cluster-based coarse-to-fine object detection framework to enhance the\nperformance for detecting small objects while ensure the accuracy of large\nobjects in high-resolution images. For the first stage, we perform coarse\ndetection on the down-sampled image and center localization of small objects by\nlightweight detector on high-resolution image, and then obtains image chips\nbased on cluster region generation method by coarse detection and center\nlocalization results, and further sends chips to the second stage detector for\nfine detection. Finally, we merge the coarse detection and fine detection\nresults. Our approach can make good use of the sparsity of the objects and the\ninformation in high-resolution image, thereby making the detection more\nefficient. Experiment results show that our proposed approach achieves\npromising performance compared with other state-of-the-art detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 13:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

In this work, we propose Token\nContrast (ToCo) to address this issue and further explore the virtue of ViT for\nWSSS. Firstly, motivated by the observation that intermediate layers in ViT can\nstill retain semantic diversity, we designed a Patch Token Contrast module\n(PTC).

Numerical calculations of the\nabsorptive spin-orbit spectra show for an ideal InSb electron gas a behaviour\nthat is dominated by the localized (atomic) part of the distorted Landau\nlevels. In contrast, however, we also find analytically that a (non-local)\ndivergent static response emerges for Fermi energies close to the ionization\nenergy in the thermodynamic limit. The divergent linear response implies that\nthe external electric field is entirely absorbed outside the 2D electron gas by\ninduced radial spin-orbit currents, as it would be the case inside a perfect\nconductor. This spin-orbit induced polarization mechanism depends on the\neffective $g^*$-factor of the material for which it shows a critical behaviour\nat $g^*_c=2$, where it abruptly switches direction.

We show that tests of\nquantumness that follow a certain template, which captures recent proposals\nsuch as (Kalai et al., 2022), can in fact do much more. Namely, the same\nprotocols can be used for certifying a qubit, a building-block that stands at\nthe heart of applications such as certifiable randomness and classical\ndelegation of quantum computation.\n  Certifying qubits was previously only known to be possible based on the\nhardness of the Learning with Errors problem and the use of adaptive hardcore\n(Brakerski et al., 2018).

To feed this research variety, it is\nnecessary and convenient to reinforce the existing datasets with synthetic\nones.

Many systems are\ncalled to operate in uncertain and highly-changing environment, not rarely\nrequired to make intelligent decisions by themselves. This easily results in an\nintractable state space to explore at testing time. The state-of-the-art\ntechniques try to keep the pace, e.g., by augmenting the tester's intuition\nwith some form of (explicit or implicit) learning from observations to search\nthis space efficiently. For instance, they exploit historical data to drive the\nsearch (e.g., ML-driven testing) or the tests execution data itself (e.g.,\nadaptive or search-based testing).

A common strategy to handle the\nPOIR problem is using the non-occluded features for classification.\nUnfortunately, this strategy will lose effectiveness when the image is severely\noccluded, since the visible parts can only provide limited information. Several\nstudies in neuroscience reveal that feature restoration which fills in the\noccluded information and is called amodal completion is essential for human\nbrains to recognize partially occluded images. However, feature restoration is\ncommonly ignored by CNNs, which may be the reason why CNNs are ineffective for\nthe POIR problem. Inspired by this, we propose a novel brain-inspired feature\nrestoration network (BIFRNet) to solve the POIR problem. It mimics a ventral\nvisual pathway to extract image features and a dorsal visual pathway to\ndistinguish occluded and visible image regions. In addition, it also uses a\nknowledge module to store object prior knowledge and uses a completion module\nto restore occluded features based on visible features and prior knowledge.\nThorough experiments on synthetic and real-world occluded image datasets show\nthat BIFRNet outperforms the existing methods in solving the POIR problem.\nEspecially for severely occluded images, BIRFRNet surpasses other methods by a\nlarge margin and is close to the human brain performance.

It is based on a direction finding uncertainty parameter,\nwhich describes how well different directions of arrival and polarizations are\ndistinguishable. By investigating a simple antenna array, it is shown that the\nproposed parameter provides additional insight into the behavior of an antenna\nsystem, when compared to established methods. Moreover, since the uncertainty\nparameter is calculated from a set of far fields, it is applicable to port far\nfields as well as Characteristic Modes. This finding is utilized to derive a\ndesign guidance: Starting with a set of Characteristic Mode far fields, the\nangular distribution of the uncertainty is investigated to verify that no\nambiguities are present. Different sets of far fields are compared and the\ndifferences regarding their direction finding behavior are visualized and\nexplained using the uncertainty in conjunction with an estimate of the incident\nfield. To quantify these differences, a key performance indicator is introduced\nthat summarizes the direction finding capabilities over a selected angular\nregion. To demonstrate the design process, a Multi-Mode Multi-Port Antenna with\nthree uncorrelated ports is developed, manufactured and measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 14:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Meta-learning\nleverages data from previous tasks to quickly learn a new task, despite limited\ndata. In particular, model agnostic methods look for initialisation points from\nwhich gradient descent quickly adapts to any new task. Although it has been\nempirically suggested that such methods learn a good shared representation\nduring training, there is no strong theoretical evidence of such behavior. More\nimportantly, it is unclear whether these methods truly are model agnostic,\ni.e., whether they still learn a shared structure despite architecture\nmisspecifications. To fill this gap, this work shows in the limit of an\ninfinite number of tasks that first order ANIL with a linear two-layer network\narchitecture successfully learns a linear shared representation.

However, these\nmethods are not powerful enough to fully fool the vision system in a\nsystemically threatening manner. In fact, their impact is partial and locally\nlimited; they mislead the depth prediction of only the overlapping region with\nthe input image regardless of the target object size, shape and location.

One\nmechanism for cooperation is indirect reciprocity. According to this mechanism,\nindividuals cooperate to maintain a good reputation. This idea is embodied in a\nset of social norms called the ``leading eight''. When all information is\npublicly available, these norms have two major properties. Populations that\nemploy these norms are fully cooperative, and they are stable against invasion\nby alternative norms. In this paper, we extend the framework of the leading\neight in two directions. First, we allow social norms to be stochastic. Such\nnorms allow individuals to evaluate others with certain probabilities. Second,\nwe consider norms in which also the reputations of passive recipients can be\nupdated. Using this framework, we characterize all evolutionarily stable norms\nthat lead to full cooperation in the public information regime. When only the\ndonor's reputation is updated, and all updates are deterministic, we recover\nthe conventional model. In that case, we find two classes of stable norms: the\nleading eight and the `secondary sixteen'. Stochasticity can further help to\nstabilize cooperation when the benefit of cooperation is comparably small.\nMoreover, updating the recipients' reputations can help populations to recover\nmore quickly from errors. Overall, our study highlights a remarkable trade-off\nbetween the evolutionary stability of a norm and its robustness with respect to\nerrors. Norms that correct errors quickly require higher benefits of\ncooperation to be stable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 15:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

However, adversarial audio examples can cause abnormal behaviors\nfor those acoustic systems, while being hard for humans to perceive. Various\nmethods, such as transformation-based defenses and adversarial training, have\nbeen proposed to protect acoustic systems from adversarial attacks, but they\nare less effective against adaptive attacks. Furthermore, directly applying the\nmethods from the image domain can lead to suboptimal results because of the\nunique properties of audio data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial\npurification-based defense pipeline, AudioPure, for acoustic systems via\noff-the-shelf diffusion models. Taking advantage of the strong generation\nability of diffusion models, AudioPure first adds a small amount of noise to\nthe adversarial audio and then runs the reverse sampling step to purify the\nnoisy audio and recover clean audio. AudioPure is a plug-and-play method that\ncan be directly applied to any pretrained classifier without any fine-tuning or\nre-training.

Hence, smaller and\nquantized deep neural network (DNN) models are developed for mobile devices,\nwhich provide faster and more energy-efficient computation for mobile AI\napplications. However, how AI models consume energy in a mobile device is still\nunexplored. Predicting the energy consumption of these models, along with their\ndifferent applications, such as vision and non-vision, requires a thorough\ninvestigation of their behavior using various processing sources. In this\npaper, we introduce a comprehensive study of mobile AI applications considering\ndifferent DNN models and processing sources, focusing on computational resource\nutilization, delay, and energy consumption.

In particular, the possibility\nof parity violation should be considered in strong field regime. The\nChern-Simons gravity takes into account parity violation in strong gravity\nregime. For all conformally flat spacetimes and spacetimes with a maximally\nsymmetric two-dimensional subspace, Chern-Simons gravity is identical to\nGeneral Relativity. Specifically, the Anti-de Sitter (A)dS-Kerr/Kerr black hole\nis not a solution for Chern-Simons gravity. The slow-rotating BH and the\nquadratic order in spin solutions are some of the known solutions to quadratic\norder in spin and they are rotating solutions in the frame of dynamical\nChern-Simons gravity.\n  In the present study, for the (A)dS slow-rotating situation (correct to the\nfirst order in spin), we derive the linear perturbation equations controlling\nthe metric and the dynamical Chern-Simons field equation corrected to the\nlinear order in spin and to the second order in the Chern-Simons coupling\nparameter. We show that the black hole of the (A)dS-Kerr solution is stronger\n(i.e. more compact and energetic) than the Kerr black hole solution and the\nreason for this feature comes form contributions at Planck scales.

In addition,\nfull fine-tuning can become prohibitively expensive when the model is used for\nmany tasks. To mitigate this issue, parameter-efficient transfer learning\nalgorithms, such as adapters and prefix tuning, have been proposed as a way to\nintroduce a few trainable parameters that can be plugged into large pre-trained\nlanguage models such as BERT, and HuBERT.

The complexity of the proofs in conjunction with the\nlevel of expertise typically required for the process to succeed can often\nhinder the adoption of ITPs. A recent strain of work has investigated methods\nto incorporate machine learning models trained on ITP user activity traces as a\nviable path towards full automation. While a valuable line of investigation,\nmany problems still require human supervision to be completed fully, thus\napplying learning methods to assist the user with useful recommendations can\nprove more fruitful.\n  Following the vein of user assistance, we introduce CoProver, a proof\nrecommender system based on transformers, capable of learning from past actions\nduring proof construction, all while exploring knowledge stored in the ITP\nconcerning previous proofs. CoProver employs a neurally learnt sequence-based\nencoding of sequents, capturing long distance relationships between terms and\nhidden cues therein. We couple CoProver with the Prototype Verification System\n(PVS) and evaluate its performance on two key areas, namely: (1) Next Proof\nAction Recommendation, and (2) Relevant Lemma Retrieval given a library of\ntheories. We evaluate CoProver on a series of well-established metrics\noriginating from the recommender system and information retrieval communities,\nrespectively. We show that CoProver successfully outperforms prior state of the\nart applied to recommendation in the domain. We conclude by discussing future\ndirections viable for CoProver (and similar approaches) such as argument\nprediction, proof summarization, and more.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 16:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Faithful capture of the dynamics of\nthese three dimensional, dense networks calls for optical sectioning often\nassociated with fluorescence confocal microscopes. However, recent developments\nin light sheet microscopy has established it as a cost effective, and at times\nsuperior, alternative. To make the LSM accessible to cytoskeleton researchers\nless familiar with optics, we present a step by step beginners guide to\nbuilding a versatile light sheet microscope from off the shelf components. To\nenable sample mounting with traditional slide samples, our LSM follows the\nsingle objective light sheet design, which utilizes a single objective for both\nexcitation and emission collection. We describe the function of each component\nof the SOLS in sufficient detail to allow readers to modify the instrumentation\nand design to fit their specific needs.
