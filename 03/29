Here we address this\nissue based on numerical study of the escape kinetics of inertial Brownian\ncolloidal particles from various types of cavities with single and multiple\npores. We consider both the situations of strong and weak viscous damping. Our\nsimulation results show that as long as the thermal length is larger than the\ncavity size the mean exit time remains insensitive to the medium viscous\ndamping. On further increasing damping strength, a linear relation between\nescape rate and damping strength emerges gradually. This result is in sharp\ncontrast to the energy barrier crossing dynamics where the escape rate exhibits\na turnover behavior as a function of the damping strength. Moreover, in the\nballistic regime, the exit rate is directly proportional to the pore width and\nthe thermal velocity. All these attributes are insensitive to the cavity as\nwell as the pore structures. Further, we show that the effects of pore\nstructure variation on the escape kinetics are conspicuously different in the\nlow damping regimes compared to the overdamped situation. Apart from direct\napplications in biology and nanotechnology, our simulation results can\npotentially be used to understand diffusion of living or artificial micro/nano\nobjects, such as bacteria, virus, Janus Particle etc. where memory effects play\ndictating roles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 16:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Previous work has\ntaken the first step to scale up the kernel size from 3x3x3 to 7x7x7 by\nintroducing block-shared weights. However, to reduce the feature variations\nwithin a block, it only employs modest block size and fails to achieve larger\nkernels like the 21x21x21. To address this issue, we propose a new method,\ncalled LinK, to achieve a wider-range perception receptive field in a\nconvolution-like manner with two core designs. The first is to replace the\nstatic kernel matrix with a linear kernel generator, which adaptively provides\nweights only for non-empty voxels. The second is to reuse the pre-computed\naggregation results in the overlapped blocks to reduce computation complexity.\nThe proposed method successfully enables each voxel to perceive context within\na range of 21x21x21. Extensive experiments on two basic perception tasks, 3D\nobject detection and 3D semantic segmentation, demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method.

Methods: We generated DW-MRI signals using\nMonte-Carlo simulations with a PGSE sequence in numerical substrates made of\nspherical cells and their extracellular space for a range of membrane\npermeability. From these signals, the properties of the substrates were\ninferred using both BS and CEXI models. Results: CEXI outperformed the\nimpermeable model by providing more stable estimates cell size and\nintracellular volume fraction that were diffusion time-independent. Notably,\nCEXI accurately estimated the exchange time for low to moderate permeability\nlevels previously reported in other studies ($\\kappa<25\\mu m/s$). However, in\nhighly permeable substrates ($\\kappa=50\\mu m/s$), the estimated parameters were\nless stable, particularly the diffusion coefficients. Conclusion: This study\nhighlights the importance of modeling the exchange time to accurately quantify\nmicrostructure properties in permeable cellular substrates.

Existing studies model each actor and scene relation\nto improve action recognition. However, the scene variations and background\ninterference limit the effectiveness of this relation modeling. In this paper,\nwe propose to select actor-related scene context, rather than directly leverage\nraw video scenario, to improve relation modeling. We develop a Cycle\nActor-Context Relation network (CycleACR) where there is a symmetric graph that\nmodels the actor and context relations in a bidirectional form. Our CycleACR\nconsists of the Actor-to-Context Reorganization (A2C-R) that collects actor\nfeatures for context feature reorganizations, and the Context-to-Actor\nEnhancement (C2A-E) that dynamically utilizes reorganized context features for\nactor feature enhancement. Compared to existing designs that focus on C2A-E,\nour CycleACR introduces A2C-R for a more effective relation modeling. This\nmodeling advances our CycleACR to achieve state-of-the-art performance on two\npopular action detection datasets (i.e., AVA and UCF101-24).

Sampling-based\ngrasp planning is often impractical, as it requires evaluation of a large\nnumber of grasp candidates. Gradient-based grasp planning can be more\nefficient, but requires a differentiable model to synthesize optimal grasps\nfrom initial candidates.

As energy harvesting imposes a time-varying peak\npower constraint, it is not possible to deliver all the bits of a version\ninstantaneously. Accordingly, the AP chooses the objective of minimizing a\nfinite-horizon time average expectation of the product of importance weight and\na convex increasing function of the number of remaining bits of a version to be\ntransmitted at each time instant. The objective enables importance-aware\ndelivery of as many bits, as soon as possible.

In this work, we propose a\none-stage pipeline for expressive whole-body mesh recovery, named OSX, without\nseparate networks for each part. Specifically, we design a Component Aware\nTransformer (CAT) composed of a global body encoder and a local face/hand\ndecoder. The encoder predicts the body parameters and provides a high-quality\nfeature map for the decoder, which performs a feature-level upsample-crop\nscheme to extract high-resolution part-specific features and adopt\nkeypoint-guided deformable attention to estimate hand and face precisely. The\nwhole pipeline is simple yet effective without any manual post-processing and\nnaturally avoids implausible prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of OSX. Lastly, we build a large-scale Upper-Body dataset\n(UBody) with high-quality 2D and 3D whole-body annotations. It contains persons\nwith partially visible bodies in diverse real-life scenarios to bridge the gap\nbetween the basic task and downstream applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 17:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

They linearly scale the\naccurate depth maps as supervision to guide the predicted depth of few-shot\nNeRFs.

The\nexperiment is based on a two-mode coherently-driven optical resonator in which\nphotons interact through the Kerr nonlinearity. In presence of a phase defect\nbetween the modes, a nonlinear attractor develops, which confers a synthetic\nM\\\"obius topology to the modal structure of the system. That topology is\nassociated with an inherently protected exchange symmetry between the modes,\nenabling the realization of spontaneous symmetry breaking in ideal, bias-free,\nconditions without any fine tuning of parameters. The dynamic manifests itself\nby a periodic alternation of the modes from one resonator roundtrip to the next\nreminiscent of period-doubling. This extends to a range of localized structures\nin the form of domain walls, bright solitons, and breathers, which have all\nbeen observed with remarkable long term stability. A rigorous testing of the\nrandomness of the symmetry-broken state selection statistics has also confirmed\nthe robustness of the exchange symmetry in our experiment.

The latter are\ncalculated by solving the thermo-gravitational wind equation in an oblate\ngeometry. Comparing many such models to gravity data and the frequencies of\nring patterns excited by Saturn normal modes, we use statistical methods to\nestimate that Saturn's cloud-level winds extend inward along cylinders before\ndecaying at a depth 0.125-0.138 times Saturn's equatorial radius, or\n7,530-8,320 km, consistent with analyses of Cassini gravity and magnetic field\ndata.

On the\nother hand, high UV flux can be life-threatening, leading to atmospheric\nerosion and damaging biomolecules essential to life. These arguments raise\nquestions about the actual habitability of CHZ planets around stars other than\nSolar-type ones, with different UV to bolometric luminosity ratios.

Due to apsidal precession, the returning stream may collide with\nitself, leading to a self-crossing shock that launches an outflow. If the black\nhole spins, this collision may additionally be affected by Lense-Thirring\nprecession that can cause an offset between the two stream components. We study\nthe impact of this effect on the outflow properties by carrying out local\nsimulations of collisions between offset streams. As the offset increases, we\nfind that the geometry of the outflow becomes less spherical and more\ncollimated along the directions of the incoming streams, with less gas getting\nunbound by the interaction. However, even the most grazing collisions we\nconsider significantly affect the trajectories of the colliding gas, likely\npromoting subsequent strong interactions near the black hole and rapid disc\nformation. We analytically compute the dependence of the offset to stream width\nratio, finding that even slowly spinning black holes can cause both strong and\ngrazing collisions. We propose that the deviation from outflow sphericity may\nenhance the self-crossing shock luminosity due to a reduction of adiabatic\nlosses, and cause significant variations of the efficiency at which X-ray\nradiation from the disc is reprocessed to the optical band depending on the\nviewing angle. These potentially observable features hold the promise of\nconstraining the black hole spin from tidal disruption events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

Inefficient photon production in the ejecta\nrenders the QPE emission much harder than the blackbody temperature, enabling\nthe flares to stick out from the softer quiescent disk spectrum. Destruction of\nthe star via mass ablation limits the QPE lifetime to decades, precluding a\nlong-lived AGN as the gaseous disk. By contrast, a tidal disruption event (TDE)\nnaturally provides a transient gaseous disk on the requisite radial scale, with\na rate exceeding the EMRI inward migration rate, suggesting that many TDEs\nshould host a QPE. This picture is consistent with the X-ray TDE observed\nseveral years prior to the QPE appearance from GSN 069.

Traditionally, most algorthms use\n\"full-coordinate update,\" that is, at each step, very component of the argument\nis updated. However, when the dimension of the argument is very high, it is\nmore efficient to update some but not all components of the argument at each\niteration. We refer to this as \"batch updating\" in this paper.\n  When gradient-based algorithms are used together with batch updating, in\nprinciple it is sufficient to compute only those components of the gradient for\nwhich the argument is to be updated. However, if a method such as back\npropagation is used to compute these components, computing only some components\nof gradient does not offer much savings over computing the entire gradient.\nTherefore, to achieve a noticeable reduction in CPU usage at each step, one can\nuse first-order differences to approximate the gradient. The resulting\nestimates are biased, and also have unbounded variance. Thus some delicate\nanalysis is required to ensure that the HB algorithm converge when batch\nupdating is used instead of full-coordinate updating, and/or approximate\ngradients are used instead of true gradients. In this paper, we not only\nestablish the almost sure convergence of the iterations to the stationary\npoint(s) of the objective function, but also derive upper bounds on the rate of\nconvergence. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other paper that\ncombines all of these features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 18:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

However, it is still challenging\nto reconstruct the continuous motions of 3D structures from hundreds of\nthousands of noisy and randomly oriented 2D cryo-EM images. Existing methods\nbased on coordinate-based neural networks show compelling results to model\ncontinuous conformations of 3D structures in the Fourier domain, but they\nsuffer from a limited ability to model local flexible regions and lack\ninterpretability. We propose a novel approach, cryoFormer, that utilizes a\ntransformer-based network architecture for continuous heterogeneous cryo-EM\nreconstruction. We for the first time directly reconstruct continuous\nconformations of 3D structures using an implicit feature volume in the 3D\nspatial domain. A novel deformation transformer decoder further improves\nreconstruction quality and, more importantly, locates and robustly tackles\nflexible 3D regions caused by conformations. In experiments, our method\noutperforms current approaches on three public datasets (1 synthetic and 2\nexperimental) and a new synthetic dataset of PEDV spike protein.

They are implemented under strict cost and energy budgets, using\nmicrocontroller units (MCUs) that lack security features available in\ngeneral-purpose processors. In this context, Remote Attestation (RA) was\nproposed as an inexpensive security service to enable a verifier (Vrf) to\nremotely detect illegal modifications to a software binary installed on a\nlow-end prover MCU (Prv). Since attacks that hijack the software's control flow\ncan evade RA, Control Flow Attestation (CFA) augments RA with information about\nthe exact order in which instructions in the binary are executed, enabling\ndetection of control flow attacks. We observe that current CFA architectures\ncan not guarantee that Vrf ever receives control flow reports in case of\nattacks. In turn, while they support exploit detection, they provide no means\nto pinpoint the exploit origin.

However, there is currently no implementation\nthat supports its direct use in settings with soft labels. Hence, a synergy\nbetween the use of SDL and research leveraging the use of soft labels, also in\nthe context of model calibration, is still missing. In this work, we introduce\nDice semimetric losses (DMLs), which (i) are by design identical to SDL in a\nstandard setting with hard labels, but (ii) can be used in settings with soft\nlabels. Our experiments on the public QUBIQ, LiTS and KiTS benchmarks confirm\nthe potential synergy of DMLs with soft labels (e.g. averaging, label\nsmoothing, and knowledge distillation) over hard labels (e.g. majority voting\nand random selection). As a result, we obtain superior Dice scores and model\ncalibration, which supports the wider adoption of DMLs in practice.

Different strategies, including\ndrive-and-dissipation, adiabatic cooling, and measurement-based steering, have\nbeen proposed in the past for state generation and manipulation, each with its\nupsides and downsides. Here, we address a class of measurement-based state\nengineering protocols where a sequence of generalized measurements is employed\nto steer a quantum system toward a desired target state. Previously studied\nmeasurement-based protocols relied on idealized procedures and avoided\nexploration of the effects of various errors stemming from imperfections of\nexperimental realizations and external noise. We employ the quantum trajectory\nformalism to provide a detailed analysis of the robustness of these steering\nprotocols against various errors. We study a set of errors that can be\nclassified as dynamic or static, depending on whether they remain unchanged\nwhile running the protocol. More specifically, we investigate the impact of\nerroneous choice of system-detector coupling, re-initialization of the detector\nstate following a measurement step, fluctuating steering directions, and\nenvironmentally induced errors in the system-detector interaction. We show that\nthe protocol remains fully robust against the erroneous choice of\nsystem-detector coupling parameters and presents reasonable robustness against\nother errors. We employ various quantifiers such as fidelity, trace distance,\nand linear entropy to characterize the protocol's robustness and provide\nanalytical results.

We introduce a scaffolding framework based on pop quizzes presented\nas multi-choice programming tasks. To automatically generate these pop quizzes,\nwe propose a novel algorithm, PQuizSyn.

Here we\naddress this issue by formalizing the existing concept of pathway modules,\nwhich are sequences of state updates that are guaranteed to occur (barring\noutside interference) in the dynamics of automata networks after the\nperturbation of a subset of driver nodes. We present a novel algorithm to\nautomatically extract pathway modules from networks and we characterize the\ninteractions that may take place between modules. This methodology uses only\nthe causal logic of individual node variables (micro-dynamics) without the need\nto compute the dynamical landscape of the networks (macro-dynamics).\nSpecifically, we identify complex modules, which maximize pathway length and\nrequire synergy between their components. This allows us to propose a new take\non dynamical modularity that partitions complex networks into causal pathways\nof variables that are guaranteed to transition to specific states given a\nperturbation to a set of driver nodes. Thus, the same node variable can take\npart in distinct modules depending on the state it takes. Our measure of\ndynamical modularity of a network is then inversely proportional to the overlap\namong complex modules and maximal when complex modules are completely\ndecouplable from one another in the network dynamics. We estimate dynamical\nmodularity for several genetic regulatory networks, including the Drosophila\nmelanogaster segment-polarity network. We discuss how identifying complex\nmodules and the dynamical modularity portrait of networks explains the\nmacro-dynamics of biological networks, such as uncovering the (more or less)\ndecouplable building blocks of emergent computation (or collective behavior) in\nbiochemical regulation and signaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 00:01:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 22:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Here, by means of ab initio density functional\ntheory calculations, we systematically calculated the GSFEs of different slip\nsystems of Ni and Ni$_{3}$Al without and with alloying elements using the alias\nshear method.

The cost function is defined as the acoustic potential\nenergy, i.e., the regional integral of the power distribution inside the target\nregion.

The\noverwhelmingly favoured maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) under parametric\nmodel is renowned for its strong consistency and optimality generally credited\nto Cramer. These properties, however, falter when the model is not regular or\nnot completely accurate. In addition, their applicability is limited to local\nmaxima close to the unknown true parameter value. One must therefore ascertain\nthat the global maximum of the likelihood is strongly consistent under generic\nconditions (Wald, 1949). Global consistency is also a vital research problem in\nthe context of empirical likelihood (Owen, 2001). The EL is a ground-breaking\nplatform for nonparametric statistical inference. A subsequent milestone is\nachieved by placing estimating functions under the EL umbrella (Qin and\nLawless, 1994). The resulting profile EL function possesses many nice\nproperties of parametric likelihood but also shares the same shortcomings.\nThese properties cannot be utilized unless we know the local maximum at hand is\nclose to the unknown true parameter value. To overcome this obstacle, we first\nput forward a clean set of conditions under which the global maximum is\nconsistent. We then develop a global maximum test to ascertain if the local\nmaximum at hand is in fact a global maximum. Furthermore, we invent a global\nmaximum remedy to ensure global consistency by expanding the set of estimating\nfunctions under EL. Our simulation experiments on many examples from the\nliterature firmly establish that the proposed approaches work as predicted.

Recent studies demonstrate\nthat such designs can be effectively automated and accelerated via tools from\nmachine learning (ML), thus enabling ML-driven classes of error-correction\ncodes with promising performance gains compared to classical designs. A\nfundamental challenge, however, is that it is prohibitively complex, if not\nimpossible, to design and train fully ML-driven encoder and decoder pairs for\nlarge code dimensions.

On the\none hand, advanced foundation models like ChatGPT can offer powerful\nconversation, in-context learning and code generation abilities on a broad\nrange of open-domain tasks. They can also generate high-level solution outlines\nfor domain-specific tasks based on the common sense knowledge they have\nacquired. However, they still face difficulties with some specialized tasks\nbecause they lack enough domain-specific data during pre-training or they often\nhave errors in their neural network computations on those tasks that need\naccurate executions. On the other hand, there are also many existing models and\nsystems (symbolic-based or neural-based) that can do some domain-specific tasks\nvery well. However, due to the different implementation or working mechanisms,\nthey are not easily accessible or compatible with foundation models. Therefore,\nthere is a clear and pressing need for a mechanism that can leverage foundation\nmodels to propose task solution outlines and then automatically match some of\nthe sub-tasks in the outlines to the off-the-shelf models and systems with\nspecial functionalities to complete them. Inspired by this, we introduce\nTaskMatrix.AI as a new AI ecosystem that connects foundation models with\nmillions of APIs for task completion. Unlike most previous work that aimed to\nimprove a single AI model, TaskMatrix.AI focuses more on using existing\nfoundation models (as a brain-like central system) and APIs of other AI models\nand systems (as sub-task solvers) to achieve diversified tasks in both digital\nand physical domains.

It aims to assign labels to pixels in an image, thus enabling\nautomatic image labeling. Current approaches are mainly based on convolutional\nneural networks (CNN), but they rely on a large number of labels. Therefore,\nhow to use a small size of labeled data to achieve semantic segmentation\nbecomes more and more important. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation\n(DA) framework based on optimal transport (OT) and attention mechanism to\naddress this issue. Concretely, first we generate the output space via CNN due\nto its superiority of feature representation. Second, we utilize OT to achieve\na more robust alignment of source and target domains in output space, where the\nOT plan defines a well attention mechanism to improve the adaptation of the\nmodel. In particular, with OT, the number of network parameters has been\nreduced and the network has been better interpretable.

Because kz and km gradients share the same physical axis,\nthe blipped-CAIPI gradients introduce phase interference in the z-km domain\nwhile motion induces phase variations in the kz-m domain. Thus, our previous\nk-space-based reconstruction would need multiple steps to transform data back\nand forth between k-space and image space for phase correction. Here we propose\na model-based hybrid-space reconstruction algorithm to correct the phase errors\nsimultaneously. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is combined with distortion\ncorrection, and jointly reconstructs data acquired with the blip-up/down\nacquisition to reduce the g-factor penalty.\n  Results: The blipped-CAIPI-induced phase interference is corrected by the\nhybrid-space reconstruction.

Despite these recent endeavors, the problem of\nnegative transfer remains a major concern when utilizing graph pre-trained\nmodels to downstream tasks. Previous studies made great efforts on the issue of\nwhat to pre-train and how to pre-train by designing a variety of graph\npre-training and fine-tuning strategies. However, there are cases where even\nthe most advanced \"pre-train and fine-tune\" paradigms fail to yield distinct\nbenefits.

We start from a new perspective to explore the complex generative\nmechanisms from the pre-training data to downstream data. In particular, W2PGNN\nfirst fits the pre-training data into graphon bases, each element of graphon\nbasis (i.e., a graphon) identifies a fundamental transferable pattern shared by\na collection of pre-training graphs. All convex combinations of graphon bases\ngive rise to a generator space, from which graphs generated form the solution\nspace for those downstream data that can benefit from pre-training. In this\nmanner, the feasibility of pre-training can be quantified as the generation\nprobability of the downstream data from any generator in the generator space.\nW2PGNN offers three broad applications: providing the application scope of\ngraph pre-trained models, quantifying the feasibility of pre-training, and\nassistance in selecting pre-training data to enhance downstream performance.

However, no such conditions\nfor a finite family of convex sets in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to have a $k$-transversal\nfor $0<k<d-1$ has previously been proven or conjectured. We make progress in\nthis direction by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite\nfamily of convex sets in $\\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ to have a $(2d-2)$-transversal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 05:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

Recent works\nto reconstruct the 3D human and object from a single RGB image do not have\nconsistent relative translation across frames because they assume a fixed\ndepth. Moreover, their performance drops significantly when the object is\noccluded. In this work, we propose a novel method to track the 3D human,\nobject, contacts between them, and their relative translation across frames\nfrom a single RGB camera, while being robust to heavy occlusions. Our method is\nbuilt on two key insights. First, we condition our neural field reconstructions\nfor human and object on per-frame SMPL model estimates obtained by pre-fitting\nSMPL to a video sequence. This improves neural reconstruction accuracy and\nproduces coherent relative translation across frames. Second, human and object\nmotion from visible frames provides valuable information to infer the occluded\nobject. We propose a novel transformer-based neural network that explicitly\nuses object visibility and human motion to leverage neighbouring frames to make\npredictions for the occluded frames. Building on these insights, our method is\nable to track both human and object robustly even under occlusions.

We find the superconducting correlation exponent $K_{sc}$\nextracted from the pair-pair correlation is very sensitive to the position of\nthe reference bond, reflecting a huge boundary effect on it. By systematically\nremoving the effects from boundary conditions, finite sizes, and truncation\nerrors in DMRG, we obtain the most accurate value of $K_{sc}$ and $K_\\rho$ so\nfar with DMRG. With these exponents, we confirm that the 2-legged Hubbard model\nis in the Luther-Emery liquid phase with $K_{sc} \\cdot K_\\rho = 1$ from tiny\ndoping near half-filling to $1/8$ hole doping.

However, MRS has low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when concentrations of metabolites are in the range\nof the million molars. Standard approach of using a high number of signal\naveraging (NSA) to achieve sufficient NSR comes at the cost of a long\nacquisition time. Purpose: We propose to use deep-learning approaches to\ndenoise MRS data without increasing the NSA. Methods: The study was conducted\nusing data collected from the brain spectroscopy phantom and human subjects. We\nutilized a stack auto-encoder (SAE) network to train deep learning models for\ndenoising low NSA data (NSA = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16) randomly truncated from high\nSNR data collected with high NSA (NSA=192) which were also used to obtain the\nground truth. We applied both self-supervised and fully-supervised training\napproaches and compared their performance of denoising low NSA data based on\nimproved SNRs. Results: With the SAE model, the SNR of low NSA data (NSA = 1)\nobtained from the phantom increased by 22.8% and the MSE decreased by 47.3%.\nFor low NSA images of the human parietal and temporal lobes, the SNR increased\nby 43.8% and the MSE decreased by 68.8%. In all cases, the chemical shift of\nNAA in the denoised spectra closely matched with the high SNR spectra,\nsuggesting no distortion to the spectra from denoising. Furthermore, the\ndenoising performance of the SAE model was more effective in denoising spectra\nwith higher noise levels. Conclusions: The reported SAE denoising method is a\nmodel-free approach to enhance the SNR of low NSA MRS data. With the denoising\ncapability, it is possible to acquire MRS data with a few NSA, resulting in\nshorter scan times while maintaining adequate spectroscopic information for\ndetecting and quantifying the metabolites of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 07:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

To this end, we present SemBLK, a novel method that can learn\nto generate destructive physical layer semantic attacks for an ESC system under\nthe black-box setting, where the adversaries are imperceptible to humans.\nSpecifically, 1) we first introduce a surrogate semantic encoder and train its\nparameters by exploring a limited number of queries to an existing ESC system.\n2) Equipped with such a surrogate encoder, we then propose a novel semantic\nperturbation generation method to learn to boost the physical layer attacks\nwith semantic adversaries. Experiments on two public datasets show the\neffectiveness of our proposed SemBLK in attacking the ESC system under the\nblack-box setting. Finally, we provide case studies to visually justify the\nsuperiority of our physical layer semantic perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 08:26:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 15:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

This\npaper presents a novel application of Artificial Neural Network-Backpropagation\n(ANN-BP) and Deep Ensemble Learning for pillar stability classification. There\nare three types of ANN-BP used for the classification of pillar stability\ndistinguished by their activation functions: ANN-BP ReLU, ANN-BP ELU, and\nANN-BP GELU. This research also presents a new labeling alternative for pillar\nstability by considering its suitability with the SF. Thus, pillar stability is\nexpanded into four categories: failed with a suitable safety factor, intact\nwith a suitable safety factor, failed without a suitable safety factor, and\nintact without a suitable safety factor. There are five inputs used for each\nmodel: pillar width, mining height, bord width, depth to floor, and ratio.

In this paper, we show that under some mild\nconditions, the features learned within deep functional map approaches can be\nused as point-wise descriptors and thus are directly comparable across\ndifferent shapes, even without the necessity of solving for a functional map at\ntest time.

Thus, the properties under\ninvestigation by the runtime verification have to be dynamically adapted to\nrepresent the changing requirements while preserving the knowledge about\nrequirements satisfaction gathered thus far, all with minimal latency. To\naddress this need, we present a runtime verification approach for self-adaptive\nsystems with changing requirements. Our approach uses property specification\npatterns to automatically obtain automata with precise semantics that are the\nbasis for runtime verification. The automata can be safely adapted during\nruntime verification while preserving intermediate verification results to\nseamlessly reflect requirement changes and enable continuous verification. We\nevaluate our approach on an Arduino prototype of the Body Sensor Network and\nthe Timescales benchmark.

This\nstudy presents a high-performance cloud removal architecture called Progressive\nMulti-scale Attention Autoencoder (PMAA), which simultaneously leverages global\nand local information. It mainly consists of a cloud detection backbone and a\ncloud removal module. The cloud detection backbone uses cloud masks to\nreinforce cloudy areas to prompt the cloud removal module. The cloud removal\nmodule mainly comprises a novel Multi-scale Attention Module (MAM) and a Local\nInteraction Module (LIM). PMAA establishes the long-range dependency of\nmulti-scale features using MAM and modulates the reconstruction of the\nfine-grained details using LIM, allowing for the simultaneous representation of\nfine- and coarse-grained features at the same level.

Furthermore, PMAA has a considerable efficiency advantage, with only\n0.5% and 14.6% of the parameters and computational complexity of CTGAN,\nrespectively.

It is\ncomposed of two tasks: (1) Learning the generative model that is trained over a\nset of 3D landmark sequences, and (2) Generating 3D mesh sequences of an input\nfacial mesh driven by the generated landmark sequences. The generative model is\nbased on a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), which has achieved\nremarkable success in generative tasks of other domains. While it can be\ntrained unconditionally, its reverse process can still be conditioned by\nvarious condition signals.

Thus, some specialized active learning methods have been proposed to\nreduce the cost by selecting either coarse-grained samples or fine-grained\ninstances from unlabeled data for labeling. However, the former approaches\nsuffer from redundant labeling, while the latter methods generally lead to\ntraining instability and sampling bias. To address these challenges, we propose\na novel approach called Multi-scale Region-based Active Learning (MuRAL) for\nobject detection.

The informative region score is designed to consider both the\npredicted confidence of instances and the distribution of each object category,\nenabling our method to focus more on difficult-to-detect classes.

In both cases, we are able to drastically reduce the\ncomputational expense for a model evaluation and, at the same time, to maintain\nan adequate accuracy level. All in all, this work indicates the effectiveness\nof the presented MOR approach for deforming domain problems taking advantage of\na time-continuous space-time setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 13:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

A recent approach named pix2rule proposes a neural Disjunctive\nNormal Form (neural DNF) module to learn symbolic rules with feed-forward\nlayers. Although proved to be effective in synthetic binary classification,\npix2rule has not been applied to more challenging tasks such as multi-label and\nmulti-class classifications over real-world data. In this paper, we address\nthis limitation by extending the neural DNF module to (i) support rule learning\nin real-world multi-class and multi-label classification tasks, (ii) enforce\nthe symbolic property of mutual exclusivity (i.e. predicting exactly one class)\nin multi-class classification, and (iii) explore its scalability over large\ninputs and outputs. We train a vanilla neural DNF model similar to pix2rule's\nneural DNF module for multi-label classification, and we propose a novel\nextended model called neural DNF-EO (Exactly One) which enforces mutual\nexclusivity in multi-class classification.

Deep learning has recently gained\nattention across various physical sciences for its potential to reduce\ncomputational cost. Super-resolution is one such technique that enhances the\nresolution of data. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)\nthat super-resolves instantaneous snapshots of three-dimensional air\ntemperature and wind velocity fields for urban micrometeorology. This\nsuper-resolution process requires not only an increase in spatial resolution\nbut also the restoration of missing data caused by the difference in the\nbuilding shapes that depend on the resolution. The proposed CNN incorporates\ngated convolution, which is an image inpainting technique that infers missing\npixels. The CNN performance has been verified via supervised learning utilizing\nbuilding-resolving micrometeorological simulations around Tokyo Station in\nJapan. The CNN successfully reconstructed the temperature and velocity fields\naround the high-resolution buildings, despite the missing data at lower\naltitudes due to the coarseness of the low-resolution buildings. This result\nimplies that near-surface flows can be inferred from flows above buildings.\nThis hypothesis was assessed via numerical experiments where all input values\nbelow a certain height were made missing.

One of the\nmain challenges in this search is that M dwarfs can be magnetically active and\nstellar activity can produce radial velocity (RV) signals that could mimic\nthose of a planet.\n  Aims: We aim to investigate whether the 2.2 day period observed in optical\nRVs of the nearby active M dwarf star Gl 388 (AD Leo) is due to stellar\nactivity or to a planet that corotates with the star as suggested in the past.\n  Methods: We obtained quasi-simultaneous optical RVs of Gl 388 from 2019 to\n2021 with SOPHIE (R~75k) at the OHP in France, and near-IR RV and Stokes V\nmeasurements with SPIRou at the CFHT (R~70k).\n  Results: The SOPHIE RV time series displays a periodic signal with a\n2.23+-0.01 day period and 23.6+-0.5 m/s amplitude, which is consistent with\nprevious HARPS observations obtained in 2005-2006. The SPIRou RV time series is\nflat at 5 m/s rms and displays no periodic signals. RV signals of amplitude\nhigher than 5.3 m/s at a period of 2.23 days can be excluded with a confidence\nlevel higher than 99%. Using the modulation of the longitudinal magnetic field\n(Bl) measured with SPIRou, we derive a stellar rotation period of\n2.2305+-0.0016 days.\n  Conclusions: SPIRou RV measurements provide solid evidence that the periodic\nvariability of the optical RVs of Gl 388 is due to stellar activity rather than\nto a corotating planet. The magnetic activity nature of the optical RV signal\nis further confirmed by the modulation of Bl with the same period. The SPIRou\ncampaign on Gl 388 demonstrates the power of near-IR RV to confirm or infirm\nplanet candidates discovered in the optical around active stars.

The LW functional is represented by skeleton diagrams,\neach skeleton diagram consists of appropriately connected dressed fermion\nloops. First, we prove that every $D$-dimensional skeleton diagram consisting\nof a single fermion loop is reduced to a one-dimensional (1D) fermion loop with\nthe same diagrammatic structure, which justifies the name dimensional\nreduction. This statement, combined with the fermion loop cancellation theorem\n(FLCT), agrees with results of multidimensional bosonization. Here we show that\nthe backscattering and the spectral curvature, both explicitly violate the FLCT\nand both are irrelevant for a 1DEG, become relevant at $D > 1$ and $D > 2$,\nrespectively. The reason for this is a strong infrared divergence of the\nskeleton diagrams containing multiple fermion loops at $D > 1$. These diagrams,\nwhich are omitted within the multidimensional bosonization approaches, account\nfor the non-collinear scattering processes. Thus, the dimensional reduction\nprovides the framework to go beyond predictions of the multidimensional\nbosonization.

In contrast to these, we take the emerging implicit representation\nas the object model and seamlessly combine it with the active reconstruction\ntask. To fully integrate observation information into the model, we propose a\nsupervision method specifically for object-level reconstruction that considers\nboth valid and free space. Additionally, to directly evaluate view information\nfrom the implicit object model, we introduce a sample-based uncertainty\nevaluation method. It samples points on rays directly from the object model and\nuses variations of implicit function inferences as the uncertainty metrics,\nwith no need for voxel traversal or an additional information map. Leveraging\nthe differentiability of our metrics, it is possible to optimize the\nnext-best-view by maximizing the uncertainty continuously. This does away with\nthe traditionally-used candidate views setting, which may provide sub-optimal\nresults. Experiments in simulations and real-world scenes show that our method\neffectively improves the reconstruction accuracy and the view-planning\nefficiency of active reconstruction tasks. The proposed system is going to open\nsource at https://github.com/HITSZ-NRSL/ActiveImplicitRecon.git.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 14:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

For example, this applies to quasar-light absorption\nby a damped Lyman-alpha system due to atomic as well as ionic fine-splitting\ntransitions or molecular rotational bands. Similarly, the thermal\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (thSZ) effect cannot be used to extract the CMB's $T$-$z$\nrelation. This is because the relative line strengths between ground and\nexcited states in the former and the CMB spectral distortion in the latter case\nboth depend, apart from environment specific normalisations, solely on the\ndimensionless spectral variable $x=\\frac{h\\nu}{k_B T}$. Since literature on\nextractions of the CMB's $T$-$z$ relation always assumes (i)\n$\\nu(z)=(1+z)\\nu(z=0)$ where $\\nu(z=0)$ is the observed frequency in the\nheliocentric rest frame, the finding (ii) $T(z)=(1+z)T(z=0)$ just confirms the\nexpected blackbody nature of the interacting CMB at $z>0$. In contrast to\nemission of isolated, directed radiation, whose frequency-redshift relation\n($\\nu$-$z$ relation) is subject to (i), a non-conventional $\\nu$-$z$ relation\n$\\nu(z)=f(z)\\nu(z=0)$ of pure, isotropic blackbody radiation, subject to\nadiabatically slow cosmic expansion, necessarily has to follow that of the\n$T$-$z$ relation $T(z)=f(z)T(z=0)$ and vice versa.

Firstly, we specifically focus on\nthe host galaxy properties and binary formation rates. Subsequently, we\ninvestigate the expected evolution of the rotation and dispersion measure in\nthis scenario, the predicted birth-site offsets, and the origin of the\npersistent radio emission observed in a subset of these systems. The host\ngalaxies for repeating FRBs favour the formation of neutron star-massive star\nbinary systems but any conclusive evidence will require future discoveries and\nlocalizations of FRBs. The birth rate of high-mass X-ray binaries, used as a\nproxy for all considered binaries, significantly exceeds the estimated rate of\nFRBs, which can be explained if only a small subset of these systems produce\nFRBs. We show that under simple assumptions, we can reproduce the DM and RM\nevolution that is seen in a subset of repeating FRBs.

In this study, we present a computational approach named GRAF\nutilizing GNN-based approaches on multiple networks with the help of attention\nmechanisms and network fusion. Using attention-based neighborhood aggregation,\nGRAF learns the importance of each neighbor per node (called node-level\nattention) followed by the importance of association (called association-level\nattention) in a hierarchical way. Then, GRAF processes a network fusion step\nweighing each edge according to learned node- and association-level attention,\nwhich results in a fused enriched network. Considering that the fused network\ncould be a highly dense network with many weak edges depending on the given\ninput networks, we included an edge elimination step with respect to edges'\nweights. Finally, GRAF utilizes Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on the fused\nnetwork and incorporates the node features on the graph-structured data for the\nprediction task or any other downstream analysis. Our extensive evaluations of\nprediction tasks from different domains showed that GRAF outperformed the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

However, noise in real-world scenarios\nis often spatially correlated, which causes many self-supervised algorithms\nbased on the pixel-wise independent noise assumption to perform poorly on\nreal-world images. Recently, asymmetric pixel-shuffle downsampling (AP) has\nbeen proposed to disrupt the spatial correlation of noise. However,\ndownsampling introduces aliasing effects, and the post-processing to eliminate\nthese effects can destroy the spatial structure and high-frequency details of\nthe image, in addition to being time-consuming.

Second, we address the problem of a rigorous error bound, which,\nto the authors' knowledge, has been ignored in all engineering applications so\nfar.

Here, we address a relevant example of\nhow to compute the entropy reduction by information in a spatially continuous\nfeedback-controlled system. Specifically, we consider a feedback flashing\nratchet, which constitutes a paradigmatic example for the role of information\nand feedback in the dynamics and thermodynamics of transport induced by the\nrectification of Brownian motion. A Brownian particle moves in a periodic\npotential that is switched on and off by a controller, with the latter\nperforming the switching depending on the system state. We show how the entropy\nreduction can be computed from the entropy of a sequence of control actions,\nand also discuss the required sampling effort for its accurate computation.\nMoreover, the output power developed by the particle against an external force\nis investigated, which -- for some values of the system parameters -- is shown\nto become larger than the input power due to the switching of the potential:\nthe apparent efficiency of the ratchet thus becomes higher than one, if the\nentropy reduction contribution is not considered.

The challenge\nis that the pilot resources spent on configuring the RIS increase the energy\nconsumption, especially when small payloads are transmitted, so it must be\nbalanced against the energy savings during data transmission. We derive a\nformula for the energy consumption, taking both the pilot and data transmission\npower into account.

Our analytical results show that, for a given geometry and\ntransmission payload length, there exists a unique energy-minimizing subarray\nsize and pilot power. For small payloads and when the channel conditions\nbetween the BS and UE are favorable compared to the path to the RIS, the energy\nconsumption is minimized using subarrays with many elements and low pilot\ntransmission power.

Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 09:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

On the\nother hand, high-fidelity data is accurate but expensive to obtain.\nMulti-fidelity methods use a small set of high-fidelity data to enhance the\naccuracy of a large set of low-fidelity data. In the approach described in this\npaper, this is accomplished by constructing a graph Laplacian using the\nlow-fidelity data and computing its low-lying spectrum. This spectrum is then\nused to cluster the data and identify points that are closest to the centroids\nof the clusters. High-fidelity data is then acquired for these key points.\nThereafter, a transformation that maps every low-fidelity data point to its\nbi-fidelity counterpart is determined by minimizing the discrepancy between the\nbi- and high-fidelity data at the key points, and to preserve the underlying\nstructure of the low-fidelity data distribution. The latter objective is\nachieved by relying, once again, on the spectral properties of the graph\nLaplacian. This method is applied to a problem in solid mechanics and another\nin aerodynamics. In both cases, this methods uses a small fraction of\nhigh-fidelity data to significantly improve the accuracy of a large set of\nlow-fidelity data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 00:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

While some fear that the\nregulation leaves too much room for interpretation and thus bring little\nbenefit to society, others expect that the regulation is too restrictive and,\nthus, blocks progress and innovation, as well as hinders the economic success\nof companies within the EU. Without a systematic approach, it is difficult to\nassess how it will actually impact the AI landscape. In this paper, we suggest\na systematic approach that we applied on the initial draft of the AI Act that\nhas been released in April 2021. We went through several iterations of\ncompiling the list of AI products and projects in and from Germany, which the\nLernende Systeme platform lists, and then classified them according to the AI\nAct together with experts from the fields of computer science and law. Our\nstudy shows a need for more concrete formulation, since for some provisions it\nis often unclear whether they are applicable in a specific case or not. Apart\nfrom that, it turns out that only about 30\\% of the AI systems considered would\nbe regulated by the AI Act, the rest would be classified as low-risk. However,\nas the database is not representative, the results only provide a first\nassessment. The process presented can be applied to any collections, and also\nrepeated when regulations are about to change. This allows fears of over- or\nunder-regulation to be investigated before the regulations comes into effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 06:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

This allows for\nflexible and efficient deployments of impactful low-earth-orbit experiments\nthat would otherwise never be flown. However, the launch industry responsible\nfor flying these experiments is not flexible nor efficient. This project aims\nto make orbital technologies accessible at the miniature scale, specifically\nthrust-vector-control, through an iterative engineering process simplifying and\nminiaturizing technologies from launch vehicles such as the Space Shuttle and\nFalcon 9. An Arduino-based custom flight computer was developed alongside state\nmachine control software and active-control hardware, all designed to scale.\nTogether, these three major components emulate the methods used in the\naerospace industry. Initial test flights and recent ground test data have\nindicated stable control with a maximum of 7{\\deg} and 2.62{\\deg} of deviation\nfrom the intended flight path respectively, an acceptable stability range when\ncompared to similar finned flights. Results show that scalable thrust vectoring\nis possible at a small scale, giving adaptability and control applicable to\nboth small and large test vehicles. With accessible orbital flight, countless\nexperiments can be completed concurrently, allowing for faster amateur rocket\ndevelopment and opening another path to space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 07:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}
