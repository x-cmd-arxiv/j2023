However, the reduced models obtained by\nSPA generally introduce better approximation in the lower frequency range and\nnear steady-states, whereas BT is better suited for the higher frequency range.\nEven so, independently of the frequency range of interest, BT and its variants\nare more often applied in practice, since there exist more efficient\nalgorithmic realizations thereof.

Utilizing the full\npotential of PGNs requires a deeper understanding of how polymer graft length,\ndensity, and chemistry influence interfacial interactions between particles.\nThere has been great progress in describing these effects with molecular\ndynamics (MD). However, the limitations of the length and time scales of MD\nmake it prohibitively costly to study systems involving more than a few PGNs.\nHere, we address some of these challenges by proposing a new modeling paradigm\nfor PGNs using a strain-energy mapping framework involving potential of mean\nforce (PMF) calculations. In this approach, each nanoparticle is coarse-grained\ninto a representative particle with chains treated implicitly, namely, the\nimplicit chain particle model (ICPM). Using a chemistry-specific CG-MD model of\nPMMA as a testbed, we derive the effective interaction between particles\narranged in a closed-packed lattice configuration by matching bulk\ndilation/compression strain energy densities. The strain-rate dependence of the\nmechanical work in ICPM is also discussed. Overall, the ICPM model increases\nthe computational speed by approximately 5-6 orders of magnitude compared to\nthe CG-MD models. This novel framework is foundational for particle-based\nsimulations of PGNs and their blends and accelerates the understanding and\npredictions of emergent properties of PGN materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 16:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

We constrain the parameters of stable multiple planet\ncircumbinary systems. Both planet-planet and planet-binary interactions can\ncause complex planet tilt oscillations which can destabilise the orbits of one\nor both planets. The system is considerably more unstable than the effects of\nthese individual interactions would suggest, due to the interplay between these\ntwo interactions. The stability of the system is sensitive to the binary\neccentricity, the orbital tilt and the semi-major axes of the two circumbinary\nplanets. With an inner planet semi-major axis of $5\\,a_{\\rm b}$, where $a_{\\rm\nb}$ is semi-major axis of the binary, the system is generally stable if the\nouter planet is located at $\\gtrsim 8\\,a_{\\rm b}$, beyond the 2:1 mean motion\nresonance with the inner planet. For larger inner planet semi-major axis the\nsystem is less stable because the von-Zeipel--Kozai--Lidov mechanism plays a\nsignificant role, particularly for low binary-eccentricity cases.

In this work, we follow an alternative\nline of work based on learning explicit regularization functionals that promote\npreferred solutions. We develop the Explicit Learned Deep Equilibrium\nRegularizer (ELDER) method for learning explicit regularizers that minimize a\nmean-squared error (MSE) metric. ELDER is based on a regularization functional\nparameterized by a CNN and a deep equilibrium learning (DEQ) method for\ntraining the functional to be MSE-optimal at the fixed points of the\nreconstruction algorithm. The explicit regularizer enables ELDER to directly\ninherit fundamental convergence results from optimization theory. On the other\nhand, DEQ training enables ELDER to improve over existing explicit regularizers\nwithout prohibitive memory complexity during training. We use ELDER to train\nseveral approaches to parameterizing explicit regularizers and test their\nperformance on three distinct imaging inverse problems.

The model is integrated into a\nDeep Functional Predictive Control (d-FPC) system to control the displacement\nof the stem on the tactile finger during pushes. Pushing an object with a robot\nfinger along a desired trajectory in 3D is a highly nonlinear and complex\nphysical robot interaction, especially when the object is not stably grasped.\nThe proposed approach controls the stem movements on the tactile finger in a\nprediction horizon. The effectiveness of the proposed FPC is demonstrated in a\nseries of tests involving a real robot pushing a strawberry in a cluster. The\nresults indicate that the d-FPC controller can successfully control PRI in\nrobotic manipulation tasks beyond the handling of strawberries.

In particular, the nonsmooth part is possibly nonconvex. To\ntackle the nonconvexity, we develop a notion of strong prox-regularity which is\nrelated to the singleton property, Lipschitz continuity, and monotonicity of\nthe associated proximal operator, and we verify it in various classes of\nfunctions, including weakly convex functions, indicator functions of proximally\nsmooth sets, and two specific sphere-related nonconvex nonsmooth functions. In\nthis case, the problem class we are concerned with covers smooth optimization\nproblems on manifold and certain composite optimization problems on manifold.\nFor the latter, the proposed algorithm is the first second-order type method.\nCombining with the semismoothness of the proximal operator, we design a\nprojected semismooth Newton method to find a root of the natural residual\ninduced by the proximal gradient method. Since the corresponding natural\nresidual may not be globally monotone, an extra projection is added on the\nusual semismooth Newton step and new criteria are proposed for the switching\nbetween the projected semismooth Newton step and the proximal step. The global\nconvergence is then established under the strong prox-regularity. Based on the\nBD regularity condition, we establish local superlinear convergence. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with\nstate-of-the-art ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 16:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

Numerous approaches to manage\nthis impact have been proposed, ranging from stochastic and chance-constrained\nprogramming to robust optimization. However, these approaches either tend to be\nconservative in their assumptions, causing higher-than-necessary costs, or\nleave the system vulnerable to low probability, high impact uncertainty\nrealizations. To address this issue, we propose a new formulation for\nstochastic optimal power flow that explicitly distinguishes between \"normal\noperation\", in which automatic generation control (AGC) is sufficient to\nguarantee system security, and \"adverse operation\", in which the system\noperator is required to take additional actions, e.g., manual reserve\ndeployment. This formulation can be understood as a combination of a joint\nchance-constrained problem, which enforces that AGC should be sufficient with a\nhigh probability, with specific treatment of large-disturbance scenarios that\nallows for additional, more complex redispatch actions. The new formulation has\nbeen compared with the classical ones in a case study on the IEEE-118 bus\nsystem. We observe that our consideration of extreme scenarios enables\nsolutions that are more secure than typical chance-constrained formulations,\nyet less costly than solutions that guarantee robust feasibility with only AGC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 16:58:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

For the case when $M$ is a homogeneous\n$G$-space, we prove a characterisation of the existence of these invariant\nstructures in terms of a lift of the isotropy representation. As an\napplication, we study the invariant generalised Spin$^r$ structures for all the\nhomogeneous realisations of the spheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 17:25:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 11:34:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

There are many interesting examples and applications of tangent\ncategories in a variety of areas such as differential geometry, algebraic\ngeometry, algebra, and even computer science. The purpose of this paper is to\nexpand the theory of tangent categories in a new direction: the theory of\noperads. The main result of this paper is that both the category of algebras of\nan operad and its opposite category are tangent categories. The tangent bundle\nfor the category of algebras is given by the semi-direct product, while the\ntangent bundle for the opposite category of algebras is constructed using the\nmodule of K\\\"ahler differentials, and these tangent bundles are in fact\nadjoints of one another. To prove these results, we first prove that the\ncategory of algebras of a coCartesian differential monad is a tangent category.\nWe then show that the monad associated to any operad is a coCartesian\ndifferential monad. This also implies that we can construct Cartesian\ndifferential categories from operads. Therefore, operads provide a bountiful\nsource of examples of tangent categories and Cartesian differential categories,\nwhich both recaptures previously known examples and also yield new interesting\nexamples. We also discuss how certain basic tangent category notions recapture\nwell-known concepts in the theory of operads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 17:25:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 18:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

The\nagreement of observations to different models of the evolution of massive\nstellar binaries leading to the formation of compact binaries can be\ncharacterized by a Bayesian marginal likelihood. In this work, we show how to\ncarefully interpolate this marginal likelihood between choices of binary\nevolution model parameters, enabling the analysis of their posterior\ndistributions between expensive binary evolution simulations. Using the\nStarTrack binary evolution code, we compare one- and four-dimensional binary\nevolution models to the compact binary mergers reported in recent\ngravitational-wave observing runs, considering merger detection rates and mass\ndistributions. We demonstrate that the predicted detection rates and mass\ndistribution of simulated binaries are effective in constraining binary\nevolution formation.

Previous studies have\ndemonstrated helicity-dependent optical control of spatial chirality and\nmagnetization $M$. The former is central for asymmetric synthesis in chemistry\nand homochirality in bio-molecules, while the latter is of great interest for\nferromagnetic spintronics. In this paper, we report the surprising observation\nof helicity-dependent optical control of fully-compensated antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) order in 2D even-layered MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, a topological Axion insulator\nwith neither chirality nor $M$. We further demonstrate helicity-dependent\noptical creation of AFM domain walls by double induction beams and the direct\nreversal of AFM domains by ultrafast pulses. The control and reversal of AFM\ndomains and domain walls by light helicity have never been achieved in any\nfully-compensated AFM. To understand this optical control, we study a novel\ntype of circular dichroism (CD) proportional to the AFM order, which only\nappears in reflection but is absent in transmission. We show that the optical\ncontrol and CD both arise from the optical Axion electrodynamics, which can be\nvisualized as a Berry curvature real space dipole. Our Axion induction provides\nthe possibility to optically control a family of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric AFMs\nsuch as Cr$_2$O$_3$, CrI$_3$ and possibly novel states in cuprates. In\nMnBi$_2$Te$_4$, this further opens the door for optical writing of\ndissipationless circuit formed by topological edge states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 17:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

However, instantaneous dependence is prevalent in many RL environments.\nFor instance, in the stock market, instantaneous dependence can exist between\ntwo stocks because the fluctuation of one stock can quickly affect the other\nand the resolution of price change is lower than that of the effect. In this\npaper, we prove that with few exceptions, ignoring instantaneous dependence can\nresult in suboptimal policy learning in MBRL.

However, MAE solely reconstructs the low-level RGB\nsignals after the decoder and lacks supervision upon high-level semantics for\nthe encoder, thus suffering from sub-optimal learned representations and long\npre-training epochs. To alleviate this, previous methods simply replace the\npixel reconstruction targets of 75% masked tokens by encoded features from\npre-trained image-image (DINO) or image-language (CLIP) contrastive learning.\nDifferent from those efforts, we propose to Mimic before Reconstruct for Masked\nAutoencoders, named as MR-MAE, which jointly learns high-level and low-level\nrepresentations without interference during pre-training. For high-level\nsemantics, MR-MAE employs a mimic loss over 25% visible tokens from the encoder\nto capture the pre-trained patterns encoded in CLIP and DINO. For low-level\nstructures, we inherit the reconstruction loss in MAE to predict RGB pixel\nvalues for 75% masked tokens after the decoder. As MR-MAE applies high-level\nand low-level targets respectively at different partitions, the learning\nconflicts between them can be naturally overcome and contribute to superior\nvisual representations for various downstream tasks. On ImageNet-1K, the MR-MAE\nbase pre-trained for only 400 epochs achieves 85.8% top-1 accuracy after\nfine-tuning, surpassing the 1600-epoch MAE base by +2.2% and the previous\nstate-of-the-art BEiT V2 base by +0.3%.

However, several\nexisting offline RL methods tend to exhibit poor online fine-tuning\nperformance. On the other hand, online RL methods can learn effectively through\nonline interaction, but struggle to incorporate offline data, which can make\nthem very slow in settings where exploration is challenging or pre-training is\nnecessary. In this paper, we devise an approach for learning an effective\ninitialization from offline data that also enables fast online fine-tuning\ncapabilities. Our approach, calibrated Q-learning (Cal-QL) accomplishes this by\nlearning a conservative value function initialization that underestimates the\nvalue of the learned policy from offline data, while also being calibrated, in\nthe sense that the learned Q-values are at a reasonable scale. We refer to this\nproperty as calibration, and define it formally as providing a lower bound on\nthe true value function of the learned policy and an upper bound on the value\nof some other (suboptimal) reference policy, which may simply be the behavior\npolicy. We show that offline RL algorithms that learn such calibrated value\nfunctions lead to effective online fine-tuning, enabling us to take the\nbenefits of offline initializations in online fine-tuning. In practice, Cal-QL\ncan be implemented on top of existing conservative methods for offline RL\nwithin a one-line code change. Empirically, Cal-QL outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods on 10/11 fine-tuning benchmark tasks that we study in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 18:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

To optimize the\nparameterized resource noise, we use dual annealing and evolutionary\noptimization. Another essential component of our approach is reducing quantum\nresources in the number of artificial noise models, number of qubits,\nentanglement scheme complexity, and circuit depth.

The main reason is that\nconventional Transformer decoding algorithms may not be the best choice for\ncode generation. In this work, we propose a novel Transformer decoding\nalgorithm, Planning-Guided Transformer Decoding (PG-TD), that uses a planning\nalgorithm to do lookahead search and guide the Transformer to generate better\nprograms. Specifically, instead of simply optimizing the likelihood of the\ngenerated sequences, the Transformer makes use of a planner to generate\ncandidate programs and test them on public test cases. The Transformer can\ntherefore make more informed decisions and generate tokens that will eventually\nlead to higher-quality programs. We also design a mechanism that shares\ninformation between the Transformer and the planner to make our algorithm\ncomputationally efficient. We empirically evaluate our framework with several\nlarge language models as backbones on public coding challenge benchmarks,\nshowing that 1) it can generate programs that consistently achieve higher\nperformance compared with competing baseline methods; 2) it enables\ncontrollable code generation, such as concise codes and highly-commented codes\nby optimizing modified objective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 18:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

Inspired by simple constructions\nachieved for the case of disks and the half-plane, we reformulate bit threads\nin terms of a magnetic-like field generated by a current flowing through the\nboundary of the entangling region. The construction is possible for these\nhighly symmetric settings, leading us to a modified Biot-Savart law in curved\nspace that fully characterizes the entanglement structure of the state. For\ngeneral entangling regions, the prescription breaks down as the corresponding\nmodular Hamiltonians become inherently nonlocal. We develop a formalism for\ngeneral shape deformations and derive a flow equation that accounts for these\neffects as a systematic expansion. We solve this equation for a complete set of\nsmall deformations and show that the structure of the expansion explicitly\ncodifies the expected nonlocalities. Our findings are consistent with numerical\nresults existing in the literature, and shed light on the fundamental nature of\nquantum entanglement as a nonlocal phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 19:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 14:13:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Our strictly simultaneous\nmulti-wavelength data closely match the radio flare and allow us to\nunambiguously link the jetted radio emission of J1641. Indeed, for the X-ray\nspectra preceding and following the radio flare a simple absorbed power-law\nmodel is not an adequate description, and an extra absorption component is\nrequired. The average spectrum of J1641 can be best described by an absorbed\npower law model with a photon index $\\Gamma=1.93\\pm0.12$, modified by a\npartially covering neutral absorber with a covering fraction\n$f=0.91_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$. On the contrary, the X-ray spectrum closest to the\nradio flare does not require such extra absorber and is much harder\n($\\Gamma_{\\rm flare} \\sim 0.7\\pm0.4$), thus implying the emergence of a\nfurther, harder spectral component. We interpret this as the jet emission\nemerging from a gap in the absorber. The fractional variability we derive in\nthe optical/UV and X-ray bands are found to be lower than the typical values\nreported in the literature, since our observations of J1641 are dominated by\nthe source being in a low state.

To\nreach this conclusion, we develop a general picture of Lie algebroid morphisms\nas commutative diagrams between algebroids preserving the geometric structure\nencoded in their brackets. We illustrate that a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for such a diagram to define a morphism is that the two algebroids\npossess gauge-equivalent connections. This observation indicates that the set\nof Lie algebroid morphisms should be regarded as equivalent to the set of local\ndiffeomorphisms and gauge transformations. Moreover, a Lie algebroid morphism\nbeing a chain map in the exterior algebra sense ensures that morphic algebroids\nare cohomologically equivalent. The Atiyah Lie algebroids derived from\nprincipal bundles with common base manifolds and structure groups may therefore\nbe divided into equivalence classes of morphic algebroids.

Here, we compare the barriers\nfor basal slip for the known mechanisms of direct slip, synchroshear and\nundulating slip using density functional theory calculations. According to our\ncalculated generalized stacking fault (SF) energies, the most favorable\nmechanisms are synchroshear and undulating slip. Both mechanisms lead to stable\nSF with a formation energy of 50 $mJ/m^2$ through the same unstable SF\nconfiguration at the transition. The energy barrier of approximately 3 $J/m^2$\nindicates a low dislocation mobility as expected from the brittle character. We\nalso determine the influence of vacancies and antisite defects on the formation\nenergy of stable and unstable SF. Both kinds of point defects tend to lower the\nenergy barrier on both sides of 2:1 stoichiometry. This explains the\nexperimentally observed off-stoichiometric softening of C14-Fe$_2$Nb. The small\nenergy differences between the Fe$_2$Nb Laves phase polytypes raises the\nquestion if there are further deformation mechanisms with low barrier.\nTherefore, we additionally consider transformations between C14, C15 and C36\nLaves phases as further deformation mechanism. Our calculations for polytypic\ntransformations by successive synchroshear steps show that the corresponding\nenergy barriers are in fact very similar to the energy barrier for basal slip\nin C14. This suggests that the energy needed to create a stable SF in C14 by\nsynchroshear is also sufficient to initiate polytypic transformations where\nexisting SFs in C14 are further transformed to form C15 or C36 Laves phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 19:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

The nature of a contact,\nwhether a point, line, or surface, dictates how these bodies are able to move\nwith respect to one another given a force, and a set of contacts can provide\neither partial or full constraint on a body's motion. Decades of work have\nexplored how to explicitly estimate the location of a contact and its dynamics,\ne.g., frictional properties, but investigated methods have been computationally\nexpensive and there often exists significant uncertainty in the final\ncalculation. This has affected further advancements in contact-rich tasks that\nare seemingly simple to humans, such as generalized peg-in-hole insertions. In\nthis work, instead of explicitly estimating the individual contact dynamics\nbetween an object and its hole, we approach this problem by investigating\ncompliance-enabled contact formations.

Rather than estimating individual contact positions, we\nabstract out this calculation to an implicit representation, allowing the robot\nto either acquire, maintain, or release constraints on the object during the\ninsertion process, by monitoring forces enacted on the end effector through\ntime.

New JWST\nobservations provide the best evidence to date for mature stellar bars in this\nredshift range. The disk mass fraction $f_{disk}$ within $R_s=2.2 R_{disk}$ is\nthe dominant factor in determining how rapidly a bar forms.

The evolutionary\nprocess of organisms is determined by the goal of continuing life, and the\nnatural selection forced organisms to develop in an optimized way for survival\nand reproduction, after which any further development of the organisms did not\nmatter for natural selection and therefore was not regulated by it.\nAccordingly, the ongoing biochemical processes in the organism after giving\nbirth were not stabilised and continued casual, which, in the case of complex\nsystems of biochemical processes, led to imbalances and biochemical processes\nthat did not contribute to health in the organism, resulting in aging. Based on\nthis view, it is necessary to look for the key biochemical processes that\nregulate the vital activity of the organism.

It\nexplores two important topics: the inclusion of both magnetic and electric\ncharge to produce what it calls Extended Electrodynamics, and the existence of\na symmetry called Dyality Invariance that exchanges electric and magnetic\nquantities. First, the paper summarizes Extended Electrodynamics, including\npotentials, gauge transformations, and a new proof of the extended\nelectrodynamic Poynting theorem. A formal Lagrangian derivation of the extended\nMaxwell equations is also given, but its value in fundamental studies is\nquestioned. The paper then defines Dyality Invariance (form invariance under\nthe so-called Dyality Transformation that exchanges electric and magnetic\nquantities) and shows it to be a valid symmetry if and only if electrodynamics\nis given the extended form. The paper suggests that the complete Maxwellian\nelectrodynamics is extended electrodynamics with its dyality invariance. But\ndyality can be interpreted either actively or passively. Since magnetic charge\nhas not been observed experimentally, the active interpretation is ruled out.\nBut a passive interpretation can be used to avoid writing magnetic source and\npotential terms explicitly. The paper also refutes the idea that dyality\ninvariance would permit a magnetic charge to be transformed away even if one\nexisted. If nonzero magnetic charge exists, then experimental evidence for its\nexistence cannot be hidden by a dyality transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 23:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Utilizing spatially and polarization\nentangled photon pairs, ICE exhibits higher SNRs, greater resolvable pixel\ncounts, imaging of biological organisms, and ghost birefringence\nquantification; it also enables 25 times greater suppression of stray light\nthan classical imaging. ICE can potentially empower quantum imaging towards new\napplications in life sciences and remote sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 01:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

This is done by extending the previous work which is based on the thin\nlens approximation. We then derive the Kramers-Kronig relation in gravitational\nlensing, as the relation between real and imaginary parts of the amplification\nfactor, which is the amplitude ratio of the lensed wave to the unlensed wave.\nAs a byproduct, we find a new relation that equates integration of the square\nof the real part of the amplification factor over frequency to that for the\nimaginary part of the amplification factor. We also obtain a sum rule which\nrelates the integral of the imaginary part of the amplification factor with the\nmagnification of the first arrival image in geometrical optics. Finally, we\nargue that an incorrect separation of the observed gravitational waveform into\nthe amplification factor and the unlensed waveform generically leads to the\nviolation of the Kramers-Kronig relation.

In the FQH case,\nthe potential vorticity associated with the shallow water model becomes a\nconstant. In contrast to the shallow water equations, the hydro system for the\nFQH state contains higher derivatives of velocity which enforces the no-stress\nboundary condition in addition to the no-penetration condition at the hard wall\nor coastal boundary. For these boundary conditions, the linearized edge\ndynamics has two chiral edge modes propagating in the same direction: a\nnon-dispersing Kelvin mode and a dispersing chiral boson mode. We investigate\nthe nature of these modes in the presence of a tangent electric field. Our\nresults show that the Kelvin mode cannot be excited by this field, and as a\nresult, it cannot transport charge along the edge.

Shear wave\nelastography is effective in measuring shear wave speed (an intrinsic tissue\nproperty correlated with elasticity) in relatively homogeneous tissue, such as\nin the liver. However, for inhomogeneous tissue in the cervix, the shear wave\nspeed measurement is less robust. To overcome these limitations, we develop a\nquantitative cervical elastography system by adding a stress sensor to an\nultrasound imaging system.\n  Methods: In an imaging session for quantitative cervical elastography, we use\nthe transvaginal ultrasound imaging system to record B-mode images of the\ncervix showing its deformation and use the stress sensor to record the\nprobe-surface stress simultaneously.

To specify which features to unlearn, we\ndevelop an implicit feedback mechanism where a user can select images\ncontaining the target feature.

Sample variance forms a key component\nof the error on the local measurements, and will dominate the error budget in\nthe future as more supernovae are observed. Many methods have been proposed to\nestimate sample variance in many contexts, and we compared results from a\nnumber of them in Zhai \\& Percival (2022), confirming that sample variance for\nthe Pantheon supernovae sample does not solve the Hubble tension. We now extend\nthis analysis to include a method based on analytically calculating\ncorrelations between the radial peculiar velocities of supernovae, comparing\nthis technique with results from numerical simulations, which can be considered\na non-linear Monte-Carlo solution that works similarly. We consider the\ndependence of these errors on the linear power spectrum and how non-linear\nvelocities contribute to the error. Using this technique, and matching sample\nvariance errors, we can define an effective volume for supernovae samples,\nfinding that the Pantheon sample is equivalent to a top-hat sphere of radius\n$\\sim220~h^{-1}$Mpc. We use this link between sample-variance errors to compute\n$\\Delta H_{0}$ for idealised surveys with particular angular distributions of\nsupernovae. For example, a half-sky survey at the Pantheon depth has the\npotential to suppress the sample variance of $H_{0}$ to $\\sim0.1$ km\ns$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, a significant improvement compared with the current result.\nFinally, we consider the strength of large-scale velocity power spectrum\nrequired to explain the Hubble tension using sample variance, finding it\nrequires an extreme model well beyond that allowed by other observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 05:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

Given a graph $G$, determining the smallest $t$ for\nwhich $G$ is $t$-admissible, i.e. the stretch index of $G$ denoted by\n$\\sigma(G)$, is the goal of the $t$-admissibility problem. Split graphs are\n$3$-admissible and can be partitioned into three subclasses: split graphs with\n$\\sigma=1, 2 $ or $3$. In this work we consider such a partition while dealing\nwith the problem of coloring a split graph.

Recent studies show that insufficient training\ncaused by the lack of large-scale available sign datasets becomes the main\nbottleneck for SLR. Most SLR works thereby adopt pretrained visual modules and\ndevelop two mainstream solutions. The multi-stream architectures extend\nmulti-cue visual features, yielding the current SOTA performances but requiring\ncomplex designs and might introduce potential noise. Alternatively, the\nadvanced single-cue SLR frameworks using explicit cross-modal alignment between\nvisual and textual modalities are simple and effective, potentially competitive\nwith the multi-cue framework. In this work, we propose a novel contrastive\nvisual-textual transformation for SLR, CVT-SLR, to fully explore the pretrained\nknowledge of both the visual and language modalities.

This paper proposes a Generative model-based Noise-Robust Training\nmethod (GeNRT), which eliminates domain shift while mitigating label noise.\nGeNRT incorporates a Distribution-based Class-wise Feature Augmentation (D-CFA)\nand a Generative-Discriminative classifier Consistency (GDC), both based on the\nclass-wise target distributions modelled by generative models. D-CFA minimizes\nthe domain gap by augmenting the source data with distribution-sampled target\nfeatures, and trains a noise-robust discriminative classifier by using target\ndomain knowledge from the generative models. GDC regards all the class-wise\ngenerative models as generative classifiers and enforces a consistency\nregularization between the generative and discriminative classifiers. It\nexploits an ensemble of target knowledge from all the generative models to\ntrain a noise-robust discriminative classifier and eventually gets\ntheoretically linked to the Ben-David domain adaptation theorem for reducing\nthe domain gap.

It is necessary to balance out the class distribution\nwhile training a model for decent results. However, in the case of rare medical\ndiseases, images from affected patients are much harder to come by compared to\nimages from non-affected patients, resulting in unwanted class imbalance.\nVarious processes of tackling class imbalance issues have been explored so far,\neach having its fair share of drawbacks. In this research, we propose an\noutlier detection based binary medical image classification technique which can\nhandle even the most extreme case of class imbalance. We have utilized a\ndataset of malaria parasitized and uninfected cells. An autoencoder model\ntitled AnoMalNet is trained with only the uninfected cell images at the\nbeginning and then used to classify both the affected and non-affected cell\nimages by thresholding a loss value.

Inspired by emission theory of ancient Greek\nthat visual perception is accomplished by rays casting from eyes, we make\nslight modifications on vanilla NeRF to train on multiple views of low-light\nscene, we can thus render out the well-lit scene in an unsupervised manner. We\nintroduce a surrogate concept, Concealing Fields, that reduce the transport of\nlight during the volume rendering stage. Specifically, our proposed method,\nAleth-NeRF, directly learns from the dark image to understand volumetric object\nrepresentation and concealing field under priors. By simply eliminating\nConcealing Fields, we can render a single or multi-view well-lit image(s) and\ngain superior performance over other 2D low light enhancement methods.\nAdditionally, we collect the first paired LOw-light and normal-light Multi-view\n(LOM) datasets for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 09:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

However, the high-altitude environment\nfavours vertical mixing and the transportation of air masses at local or\nregional scales, which has a potential influence on the composition of the\nsampled air masses. Mixing processes, source-receptor pathways, and atmospheric\nchemistry may strongly depend on local and regional weather regimes, and these\nshould be characterized specifically for each station. The Pic du Midi (PDM)\nisa mountaintop observatory (2850 m a.s.l.) on the north side of the Pyrenees.\nPDM is associated with the Centre de Recherches Atmosph{\\'e}riques (CRA), a\nsite in the foothills ar 600 m a.s.l. 28 km north-east of the PDM. The two\ncenters make up the Pyrenean Platform for the Observation of the Atmosphere\n(P2OA). Data measured at PDM and CRA were combined to form a5-year hourly\ndataset of 23 meteorological variables notably: temperature, humidity, cloud\ncover, wind at several altitudes. The dataset was classified using hierarchical\nclustering, with the aim of grouping together the days which had similar\nmeteorological characteristics. To complete the clustering, we computed several\ndiagnostic tools, in order to provide additional information and study specific\nphenomena (foehn, precipitation, atmospheric vertical structure, and thermally\ndriven circulations). This classification resulted in six clusters: three\nhighly populated clusters which correspond to the most frequent meteorological\nconditions (fair weather, mixed weather and disturbed weather, respectively); a\nsmall cluster evidencing clear characteristics of winter northwesterly\nwindstorms; and two small clusters characteristic of south foehn (south- to\nsouthwesterly large-scaleflow, associated with warm and dry downslope flow on\nthe lee side of the chain).

Therefore, replacing the model $y$ with a\nsurrogate model $y_s$ that can be evaluated quickly leads to a significant\nspeedup. The approximation quality of the surrogate model depends strongly on\nthe number, position, and accuracy of the sample points. With an additional\nfinite computational budget, this leads to a problem of (computer) experimental\ndesign. In contrast to the selection of sample points, the trade-off between\naccuracy and effort has hardly been studied systematically. We therefore\npropose an adaptive algorithm to find an optimal design in terms of position\nand accuracy. Pursuing a sequential design by incrementally appending the\ncomputational budget leads to a convex and constrained optimization problem. As\na surrogate, we construct a Gaussian process regression model.

An open question is to quantitatively\nexplain how self-propulsion particles with directional memory diffuse in such a\nmedium. Based on simulations and analytic theory, we address this issue with\nactive viscoelastic systems where an active particle is connected with multiple\nsemi-flexible filaments. Our Langevin dynamics simulations show that the active\ncross-linker displays super- and sub-diffusive athermal motion with a\ntime-dependent anomalous exponent $\\alpha$. In such viscoelastic feedback, the\nactive particle always has superdiffusion with $\\alpha=3/2$ at times shorter\nthan the self-propulsion time ($\\tau_A$). At times greater than $\\tau_A$, the\nsubdiffusion emerges with $\\alpha$ bounded between $1/2$ and $3/4$. Remarkably,\nthe active subdiffusion is reinforced as the active propulsion (Pe) is more\nvigorous. In the high-Pe limit, the athermal fluctuation in the stiff filament\neventually leads to $\\alpha=1/2$, which can be misinterpreted with the thermal\nRouse motion in a flexible chain. We demonstrate that the motion of active\nparticles cross-linking a network of semi-flexible filaments can be governed by\na fractional Langevin equation combined with fractional Gaussian noise and an\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck noise.

However, extra care must be paid in realistic experiments involving\nan in-plane magnetic field, because trivial orbital effect due to, e.g.,\nrippled structures can inevitably be introduced, which could produce false\neffect confusing the expected physical phenomena. In this work, we report a\ndiamond-shaped evolution of the critical supercurrent in an in-plane magnetic\nfield in NbTiN weak-link Josephson junctions. Upon application of an in-plane\nmagnetic field perpendicular to the current, the superconducting interference\npattern exhibits a characteristic evolution, which manifests as a diamond block\ndiagram featured with each node opened and stretched out in a V-shape,\nmimicking the suppression-recovery patterns of critical supercurrent related to\nthe Zeeman-driven 0-pi transition. However, the effect of Zeeman splitting\nplays a negligible role due to the relatively small magnetic field involved in\nour experiment. Therefore, we explore the trivial orbital effect of rippled\nstructures and further take into account non-uniform current distributions\npertaining in our junctions. We find that the ripples in combination with\nspecific current distributions can give rise to a similar evolution pattern as\nthe experimental observations.

This motivates us to\nconsider selecting partial-yet-important target data and labeling them at a\nminimum cost, to achieve a good trade-off between high performance and low\nannotation cost. To this end, we propose a Bi-domain active learning approach,\nnamely Bi3D, to solve the cross-domain 3D object detection task.

Then a diversity-based target sampling\nstrategy is developed, which selects the most informative subset of target\ndomain to improve the model adaptability to the target domain using as little\nannotation budget as possible. Experiments are conducted on typical\ncross-domain adaptation scenarios including cross-LiDAR-beam, cross-country,\nand cross-sensor, where Bi3D achieves a promising target-domain detection\naccuracy (89.63% on KITTI) compared with UDAbased work (84.29%), even\nsurpassing the detector trained on the full set of the labeled target domain\n(88.98%).

This new physics\nscale M which is way higher than the electroweak scale, is motivated by the\nlack of new particle observations in the large hadron collider to date, beyond\nthe electroweak scale. Once the electroweak symmetry breaking occurs at T\\sim\n100 GeV, the axion potential acquires a new minimum due to the new terms\ngenerated by the electroweak breaking, and the axion oscillations at the origin\nare destabilized. In effect after some considerable amount of time, the axion\nrolls swiftly to its new minimum, experiencing a short kination epoch, where\nits energy density redshifts as $\\rho_a\\sim a^{-6}$. After it reaches the new\nminimum, since the latter is energetically less favorable that the Higgs\nminimum, it decays to the Higgs minimum and the Universe is described again by\nthe Higgs minimum. The axion returns to the origin and commences again\noscillations initiated by quantum fluctuations, redshifts as dark matter, and\nthe same procedure is repeated perpetually.

However, due to the non-adaptive proposal\ncropping and single-level feature mimicking processes, they suffer from\ninformation destruction during knowledge extraction and inefficient knowledge\ntransfer.

For this purpose, Mack's model is usually equipped\nwith a tailor-made bootstrap procedure. Although widely used in practice to\nestimate the reserve risk, no theoretical bootstrap consistency results exist\nthat justify this approach. To fill this gap in the literature, we adopt the\nframework proposed by Steinmetz and Jentsch (2022) to derive asymptotic theory\nin Mack's model. By splitting the reserve into two parts corresponding to\nprocess and estimation uncertainty, this enables - for the first time - a\nrigorous investigation also of the validity of the Mack bootstrap.

Open-set domain\nadaptation aims to not only recognize target samples belonging to common\nclasses shared by source and target domains but also perceive unknown class\nsamples. We propose a novel framework based on self-paced learning to\ndistinguish common and unknown class samples precisely, referred to as SPLOS\n(self-paced learning for open-set).

Existing methods mainly learn an\nentangled representation to encode two interacting hands, which are incredibly\nfragile to impaired interaction, such as truncated hands, separate hands, or\nexternal occlusion. This paper presents ACR (Attention Collaboration-based\nRegressor), which makes the first attempt to reconstruct hands in arbitrary\nscenarios. To achieve this, ACR explicitly mitigates interdependencies between\nhands and between parts by leveraging center and part-based attention for\nfeature extraction. However, reducing interdependence helps release the input\nconstraint while weakening the mutual reasoning about reconstructing the\ninteracting hands. Thus, based on center attention, ACR also learns cross-hand\nprior that handle the interacting hands better. We evaluate our method on\nvarious types of hand reconstruction datasets.

The\nsequence of perturbations is independent and identically distributed. It has\npreviously been shown that the arrival counting process for scheduled traffic\nobeys a functional central limit theorem (FCLT) with fractional Brownian motion\n(fBM) with Hurst parameter H strictly between 0 and 1/2 when the pertubratons\nhave a Pareto-like tail with tail exponent lying in (0,1). Such limit processes\nexhibit less variability than Brownian motion, because the scheduling feature\ninduces negative correlations in the arrival process. In this paper, we show\nthat when the tail of the perturbations have a super-heavy tail, the FCLT limit\nprocess is Brownian motion (i.e. H=1/2), so that the heaviness of the tails\neliminates any remaining negative correlations and generates a limit process\nwith independent increments. We further study the case when the perturbations\nhave a Cauchy-like tail, and show that the limit process in this setting is a\nfBM with H=0.

Of particular interest is the study of the Laplacian\nspectrum as a compact, isometry and permutation-invariant representation of a\nshape.

In this paper, we propose a possible way to fill this gap. We\nintroduce a learning-based method to estimate the Laplacian spectrum of the\nunion of partial non-rigid 3D shapes, without actually computing the 3D\ngeometry of the union or any correspondence between those partial shapes. We do\nso by operating purely in the spectral domain and by defining the union\noperation between short sequences of eigenvalues.

Working with\neigenvalues allows us to deal with unknown correspondence, different sampling,\nand different discretizations (point clouds and meshes alike), making this\noperation especially robust and general.

Optimal sizing of the\nrenewable power system is significant to improve the techno-economic of IRePtA\nsince the investment of power sources exceeds 80\\% of the total investment.\nHowever, multi-timescale electricity, hydrogen, and ammonia storages, minimum\npower supply for system safety, and the multi-year uncertainty of renewable\ngeneration lead to difficulties in planning. To address the issues above, an\nIGDT-MILFP model is proposed. First, the levelized cost of ammonia (LCOA) is\ndirectly formulated as the objective, rendering a mixed integer linear\nfractional programming (MILFP) problem. Information gap decision theory (IGDT)\nis utilized to handle the multi-year uncertainty of renewable generation.\nSecond, a combined Charnes-Cooper (C&C) transformation and Branch-and-Bound\n(B&B) method is proposed to efficiently solve the large-scale IGDT-MILFP model,\ngiving robust and opportunistic planning results. Then, Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) sampling-based posteriori analysis is leveraged to quantify the\nlong-run performance. Finally, a real-life system in Inner Mongolia, China, is\nstudied. The results indicate that the proposed methods could reduce the\ncomputational burden by orders of magnitude for solving a large-scale MILFP\nproblem. Moreover, the proposed IGDT-MILFP model is necessary and accurate to\nobtain an optimal capacity allocation with the lowest expected LCOA (3610\nRMB/t) in long-run simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 15:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

Even though the HCBF gives a good initialization point,\nit still requires a large amount of data to train the CBF network. In this\nwork, we propose a new method to learn more efficiently from the collected data\nthrough a novel prioritized data sampling strategy.

In the present work,\nwe will show qualitatively different collapsing dynamics for pure N\\'eel and\nhybrid skyrmions induced by a perpendicular magnetic field in two\nrepresentative systems, [Pt/Co/Ir]15 and [Ta/CoFeB/MgO]15 multilayers.\nSkyrmions in the former stack undergo two morphological transitions, upon\nreversing the perpendicular field direction. Skyrmions in [Ta/CoFeB/MgO]15\nmultilayers exhibit a continuous transition, which is mainly linked to a\nreversible change of the skyrmion size. A full micromagnetic phase diagram is\npresented to identify these two collapsing mechanisms as a function of material\nparameters. Since the two distinct collapsing dynamics rely on the detailed\nlayer-dependent spin structures of skyrmions, they could be used as potential\nfingerprints for identifying the skyrmion type in magnetic multilayers. Our\nwork suggests the employment of pure and hybrid skyrmions for specific\napplications, due to the strong correlation between the skyrmion dynamics and\n3-dimentional spin profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 15:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Most existing program synthesis methods are\ndesigned to synthesize programs from scratch, generating a program token by\ntoken, line by line. This fundamentally prevents these methods from scaling up\nto synthesize programs that are longer or more complex.

We extensively\nevaluate our proposed framework in a string transformation domain with\ninput/output pairs.

We\nintegrated different stages within the framework with the Sequential\nModel-Based Algorithm Configuration (SMAC) to perform automated hyperparameter\noptimisation. The best performance is achieved with a pipeline consisting of\nnoise removal applied to the raw location data with an RF model for the GNSS\nand no noise removal with an SVM model for the UWB. We further demonstrate\nthrough statistical analysis that the UWB achieves significantly higher results\nthan the GNSS in classifying movement patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 14:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

O'Meara in the 1970s and then\nsubsequently observed by the Voyager Spacecraft flybys in the early 1980s, it\nwas realised that the 'spokes' flare out like spokes on a bicycle wheel. The\nobserved behaviour of the 'spokes' indicates that they are not governed by\ngravitational interactions with the planets, moons, or ring material. In 2005\nthe Cassini probe confirmed that the 'spokes' are likely under the influence of\nthe gas giant's global magnetic field. Here we show that the 'spokes' that\nappear in Saturn's rings consist of grains of silicates coated in pyrolytic\ncarbon through the process of Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD). Pyrolytic\ncarbon is a highly diamagnetic substance that can levitate above a sufficiently\nstrong magnetic field. The 'spokes' also consist of ice particles that are\ndiamagnetic as well. The photoelectric effect can be used to explain why the\nsilicates coated in pyrolytic carbon return to the main ring structure when\nexposed to sunlight of a specific frequency. The pyrolytic carbon grains become\nparamagnetic when some of the unhybridised 2pz orbitals lose their unpaired\ndelocalised electrons, thus collapsing the pi bond molecular orbital structure.\nThe pyrolytic carbon grains are now attracted to the magnetic field emanating\nabove and below the main ring structure. It is suggested that the 'spokes' in\nSaturn's B ring are always present and no plasma triggering event is required\nto increase plasma density. The 'spokes', however, are only visible when a\nfavourable viewing angle is allowed, and their visibility is also dependent on\nthe angle of the sunlight hitting Saturn's rings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 13:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

While very effective for some unstructured\nproblems, early ME implementations relied exclusively on random search to\nevolve the population of solutions, rendering them notoriously\nsample-inefficient for high-dimensional problems, such as when evolving neural\nnetworks. Follow-up works considered exploiting gradient information to guide\nthe search in order to address these shortcomings through techniques borrowed\nfrom either Black-Box Optimization (BBO) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). While\nmixing RL techniques with ME unlocked state-of-the-art performance for robotics\ncontrol problems that require a good amount of exploration, it also plagued\nthese ME variants with limitations common among RL algorithms that ME was free\nof, such as hyperparameter sensitivity, high stochasticity as well as training\ninstability, including when the population size increases as some components\nare shared across the population in recent approaches. Furthermore, existing\napproaches mixing ME with RL tend to be tied to a specific RL algorithm, which\neffectively prevents their use on problems where the corresponding RL algorithm\nfails. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a flexible framework that\nallows the use of any RL algorithm and alleviates the aforementioned\nlimitations by evolving populations of agents (whose definition include\nhyperparameters and all learnable parameters) instead of just policies. We\ndemonstrate the benefits brought about by our framework through extensive\nnumerical experiments on a number of robotics control problems, some of which\nwith deceptive rewards, taken from the QD-RL literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 19:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

In the event that sufficient\nresources are not allocated to servers, they can become prone to failure and\nsecurity breaches. On the contrary, we would waste a lot of resources if we\nalways allocate the maximum amount of resources. Therefore, anticipating peak\nvolumes in network traffic becomes an important problem. However, popular\nforecasting models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)\nforecast time-series data generally, thus lack in predicting peak volumes in\nthese time-series. More than often, a time-series is a combination of different\nfeatures, which may include but are not limited to 1) Trend, the general\nmovement of the traffic volume, 2) Seasonality, the patterns repeated over some\ntime periods (e.g. daily and monthly), and 3) Noise, the random changes in the\ndata. Considering that the fluctuation of seasonality can be harmful for trend\nand peak prediction, we propose to extract seasonalities to facilitate the peak\nvolume predictions in the time domain. The experiments on both synthetic and\nreal network traffic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 20:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

Previous\nstudies have used traffic conflict indicators to predict and identify\nconflicts, including time-to-collision (TTC), proportion of stopping distance\n(PSD), and deceleration rate to avoid a crash (DRAC). However, limited research\nis conducted to understand how to set thresholds for these indicators while\naccounting for traffic flow characteristics at different traffic states.

In this study,\nunsupervised clustering is employed to identify different traffic states and\ntheir transitions under a three-phase theory framework. The resulting clusters\ncan then be utilized in conjunction with surrogate safety measures (SSM) to\nidentify traffic conflicts and assess safety performance in each traffic state.\nFrom different perspectives of time, space, and deceleration, we chose three\ncompatible conflict indicators: TTC, DRAC, and PSD, considering functional\ndifferences and empirical correlations of different SSMs. A total of three\nmodels were chosen by learning these indicators to identify traffic conflict\nand non-conflict clusters. It is observed that Mclust outperforms the other\ntwo. The results show that the distribution of traffic conflicts varies\nsignificantly across traffic states.
