Recent observations of galaxies and quasars\nhosts at high redshift (z>2) have revealed evidence for cold gaseous halos of\nscale r_CGM~10kpc, with one discovery of a molecular halo with r_CGM~200kpc and\na molecular gas mass one order of magnitude larger than the ISM of the central\ngalaxy. As a follow-up, we present deep ACA and ALMA observations of CO(3-2)\nfrom this source and two other quasar host galaxies at z~2.2. While we find\nevidence for CO emission on scales of r~10kpc, we do not find evidence for\nmolecular gas on scales larger than r>20 kpc. Therefore, our deep data do not\nconfirm the existence of massive molecular halos on scales of ~100 kpc for\nthese X-ray selected quasars. As an interesting by-product of our deep\nobservations, we obtain the tentative detection of a negative continuum signal\non scales larger than r>200kpc, which might be tracing the Sunyaev-Zeldovich\neffect associated with the halo heated by the active galactic nucleus (AGN).

A robust hash\ndeveloped utilising the QI has been named fuzzified robust hashes (FaR hashes),\nwhich can be used as an object identifier. Although the FaR hash is a single\nhash string, selected bits change in response to the modification of QI. On the\nother hand, other QIs in the object are more important for the object's\nidentity.

After sampling the output of the\nsystem, a sensor transmits the measurement information in a triple composed of\nsensor index, time-stamp, and measurement value to the fusion center via\nvulnerable communication channels. The malicious attacker can corrupt a subset\nof the sensors through (i) manipulating the time-stamp and measurement value;\n(ii) blocking transmitted measurement triples; or (iii) injecting fake\nmeasurement triples. To deal with such attacks, we propose the design of local\nestimators based on observability space decomposition, where each local\nestimator updates the local state and sends it to the fusion center after\nsampling a measurement. Whenever there is a local update, the fusion center\ncombines all the local states and generates a secure state estimate by adopting\nthe median operator. We prove that local estimators of benign sensors are\nunbiased with stable covariance. Moreover, the fused central estimation error\nhas bounded expectation and covariance against at most $p$ corrupted sensors as\nlong as the system is $2p$-sparse observable.

One important reason is due to the fragile\nnature of quantum hardware. As the building blocks of a quantum circuit (QC),\nquantum gates and qubits are susceptible to external interference, and\ntherefore even a simple QC can produce extremely noisy output. Since it is hard\nto distinguish whether the output represents meaningful computation or just\nrandom noise, it raises the question of how much we can rely on the output of a\nQC, i.e., the fidelity of the QC. In this paper, we purpose a simple yet\nintuitive metric to measure the fidelity of a QC. By using this metric, we can\nobserve the evolution of fidelity with time as the QC interacts with its\nexternal environment. Consequently, we can frame fidelity prediction as a Time\nSeries Forecasting problem and use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural\nnetworks to better estimate the fidelity of a QC. This gives the user better\nopportunities to optimize the mapping of qubits into the quantum hardware for\nlarger gains. We introduce the LSTM architecture and present a complete\nworkflow to build the training circuit dataset. The trained LSTM system, Q-fid,\ncan predict the output fidelity of a QC running on a specific quantum\nprocessor, without the need for any separate input of hardware calibration data\nor gate error rates.

These\ncodes can be sampled with randomness linear in the block-length, and achieve\nlist-decoding capacity (among other local properties). Our expander-based codes\ncan be made starting from any family of sufficiently low-bias codes, and as a\nconsequence, we give the first construction of a family of algebraic codes that\ncan be sampled with linear randomness and achieve list-decoding capacity. We\nachieve this by introducing the notion of a pseudorandom puncturing of a code,\nwhere we select $n$ indices of a base code $C\\subset \\mathbb{F}_q^m$ via an\nexpander random walk on a graph on $[m]$. Concretely, whereas a random linear\ncode (i.e. a truly random puncturing of the Hadamard code) requires $O(n^2)$\nrandom bits to sample, we sample a pseudorandom linear code with $O(n)$ random\nbits.

What does a model remember about such examples seen only a\nfew times during training and how long does that memory persist in the face of\ncontinuous training with new examples? Here, we investigate these questions\nthrough simple recognition, recall, and retention experiments with LLMs. In\nrecognition experiments, we ask if the model can distinguish the seen example\nfrom a novel example; in recall experiments, we ask if the model can correctly\nrecall the seen example when cued by a part of it; and in retention\nexperiments, we periodically probe the model's memory for the original examples\nas the model is trained continuously with new examples. We find that a single\nexposure is generally sufficient for a model to achieve near perfect accuracy\neven in very challenging recognition experiments. We estimate that the\nrecognition performance of even small language models easily exceeds human\nrecognition performance reported in similar experiments with humans (Shepard,\n1967). Achieving near perfect recall takes more exposures, but most models can\ndo it in just 3 exposures. The flip side of this remarkable capacity for fast\nlearning is that precise memories are quickly overwritten: recall performance\nfor the original examples drops steeply over the first 10 training updates with\nnew examples, followed by a more gradual decline. Even after 100K updates,\nhowever, some of the original examples are still recalled near perfectly. A\nqualitatively similar retention pattern has been observed in human long-term\nmemory retention studies before (Bahrick, 1984). Finally, recognition is much\nmore robust to interference than recall and memory for natural language\nsentences is generally superior to memory for stimuli without structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 17:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

While they are undeniably powerful tools, ML models often demonstrate\nimbalanced performance and unfair behaviors. The root of this problem often\nlies in the fact that different subpopulations commonly display divergent\ntrends: as a learning algorithm tries to identify trends in the data, it\nnaturally favors the trends of the majority groups, leading to a model that\nperforms poorly and unfairly for minority populations. Our goal is to improve\nthe fairness and trustworthiness of ML models by applying only non-invasive\ninterventions, i.e., without altering the data or the learning algorithm. We\nuse a simple but key insight: the divergence of trends between different\npopulations, and, consecutively, between a learned model and minority\npopulations, is analogous to data drift, which indicates the poor conformance\nbetween parts of the data and the trained model. We explore two strategies\n(model-splitting and reweighing) to resolve this drift, aiming to improve the\noverall conformance of models to the underlying data.

However, many models generate\nhallucinated responses instead that contradict it or contain unverifiable\ninformation. To mitigate such undesirable behaviour, it has been proposed to\nfine-tune a `negative expert' on negative examples and subtract its parameters\nfrom those of a pre-trained model. However, intuitively, this does not take\ninto account that some parameters are more responsible than others in causing\nhallucinations. Thus, we propose to weigh their individual importance via (an\napproximation of) the Fisher Information matrix, which measures the uncertainty\nof their estimate. We call this method Elastic Weight Removal (EWR). We\nevaluate our method -- using different variants of Flan-T5 as a backbone\nlanguage model -- on multiple datasets for information-seeking dialogue\ngeneration and compare our method with state-of-the-art techniques for\nfaithfulness, such as CTRL, Quark, DExperts, and Noisy Channel reranking.\nExtensive automatic and human evaluation shows that EWR systematically\nincreases faithfulness at minor costs in terms of other metrics.

Hence, as a\nsecond main contribution, we show that our method can be extended to\nsimultaneously discourage hallucinations and extractive responses.

The underlying assumption that the environment can be\neasily reset is limiting both practically, as resets generally require human\neffort in the real world and can be computationally expensive in simulation,\nand philosophically, as we'd expect intelligent agents to be able to\ncontinuously learn without intervention. Work in learning without any resets,\ni.e{.} Reset-Free RL (RF-RL), is promising but is plagued by the problem of\nirreversible transitions (e.g{.} an object breaking) which halt learning.\nMoreover, the limited state diversity and instrument setup encountered during\nRF-RL means that works studying RF-RL largely do not require their models to\ngeneralize to new environments.

In contrast to carbon and oxygen, whose dominant\nmolecules are frequently observed, sulfur is much less volatile and resides\nalmost exclusively in solid form in protoplanetary disks. This dichotomy leads\ndifferent models of planet formation to predict different compositions of gas\ngiant planets. Whereas planetesimal-based models predict roughly stellar C/S\nand O/S ratios, pebble accretion models more often predict superstellar ratios.\nTo explore the detectability of SO2 in transmission spectra and its ability to\ndiagnose planet formation, we present a grid of atmospheric photochemical\nmodels and corresponding synthetic spectra for WASP-39b (where SO2 has been\ndetected). Our 3D grid contains 11^3 models (spanning 1--100x the solar\nabundance ratio of C, O, and S) for thermal profiles corresponding to the\nmorning and evening terminators, as well as mean terminator transmission\nspectra. Our models show that for a WASP-39b-like O/H and C/H enhancement of\n~10x Solar, SO2 can only be seen for C/S and O/S <~1.5, and that WASP-39b's\nreported SO2 abundance of 1--10 ppm may be more consistent with planetesimal\naccretion than with pebble accretion models (although some pebble models also\nmanage to predict similarly low ratios). More extreme C/S and O/S ratios may be\ndetectable in higher-metallicity atmospheres, suggesting that smaller and more\nmetal-rich gas and ice giants may be particularly interesting targets for\ntesting planet formation models. Future studies should explore the dependence\nof SO2 on a wider array of planetary and stellar parameters, both for the\nprototypical SO2 planet WASP-39b, as well as for other hot Jupiters and smaller\ngas giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 02:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

To comprehend the impact of galaxy interactions on molecular gas\nproperties, we focus on interacting galaxies during the early stage and study\ntheir molecular gas properties. In this study, we investigate the physical\nstates of a filamentary molecular structure at the overlapping region, which\nwas previously reported. Utilising new higher-resolution CO(J = 1-0) data, we\nidentify molecular clouds within overlapping and disc regions. Although the\nmolecular clouds in the filament have a factor of two higher an average virial\nparameter (0.56+-0.14) than that in the overlapping region (0.28+-0.12) and in\nthe disc region (0.26+-0.16), all identified molecular clouds are\ngravitationally bound. These clouds in the filament also have a larger velocity\ndispersion than that in the overlapping region, suggesting that molecular gas\nand/or atomic gas with different velocities collide there. We calculate the\nratio of the integrated intensity of CO(J = 3-2) and CO(J = 1-0) (= R3-2/1-0)\non the molecular cloud scale. The maximum R3-2/1-0 is 0.17+-0.04 for all\nidentified clouds. The R3-2/1-0 of the molecular clouds in the filament is\nlower than that of the surrounding area. This result contradicts the\npredictions of previous numerical simulations, which suggested that the\nmolecular gas on the collision front of galaxies is compressed and becomes\ndenser. Our results imply that NGC 4567/4568 is in a very early stage of\ninteraction; otherwise, the molecular clouds in the filament would not yet\nfulfil the conditions necessary to trigger star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 18:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

There are more\nand more scenarios where autonomous control of multiple UAVs is required. Most\nof these scenarios present a large number of obstacles, such as power lines or\ntrees. If all UAVs can be operated autonomously, personnel expenses can be\ndecreased. In addition, if their flight paths are optimal, energy consumption\nis reduced. This ensures that more battery time is left for other operations.\nIn this paper, a Reinforcement Learning based system is proposed for solving\nthis problem in environments with obstacles by making use of Q-Learning. This\nmethod allows a model, in this particular case an Artificial Neural Network, to\nself-adjust by learning from its mistakes and achievements. Regardless of the\nsize of the map or the number of UAVs in the swarm, the goal of these paths is\nto ensure complete coverage of an area with fixed obstacles for tasks, like\nfield prospecting. Setting goals or having any prior information aside from the\nprovided map is not required. For experimentation, five maps of different sizes\nwith different obstacles were used. The experiments were performed with\ndifferent number of UAVs. For the calculation of the results, the number of\nactions taken by all UAVs to complete the task in each experiment is taken into\naccount. The lower the number of actions, the shorter the path and the lower\nthe energy consumption. The results are satisfactory, showing that the system\nobtains solutions in fewer movements the more UAVs there are. For a better\npresentation, these results have been compared to another state-of-the-art\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 18:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

The goal is to place all nodes across $k$ different blocks of bounded\nsize, such that hyperedges span as few parts as possible. This problem is\nwell-studied in sequential and distributed settings, but not in shared-memory.\nWe close this gap by devising efficient and scalable shared-memory algorithms\nfor all components employed in the best sequential solvers without compromises\nwith regards to solution quality.\n  This work presents the scalable and high-quality hypergraph partitioning\nframework Mt-KaHyPar. Its most important components are parallel improvement\nalgorithms based on the FM algorithm and maximum flows, as well as a parallel\nclustering algorithm for coarsening - which are used in a multilevel scheme\nwith $\\log(n)$ levels.

Then in\nthe second stage, the warped garment is fused with the person image to render a\nnew try-on image.

In this work, we propose a robust\nwarping method for virtual try-on based on a learned garment DensePose which\nhas a direct correspondence with the person's DensePose.

Firstly, component-wise domain\nscaling informed by cross-validation. Secondly, regression to construct\nresponse surfaces using additional information in the form of additional\nfunction-values sampled from multi-fidelity models and gradients.\nComponent-wise domain scaling reliably improves the surrogate quality at low\ndimensions but has been shown to suffer from high computational costs for\nhigher dimensional problems. The second strategy, adding gradients to train\nsurrogates, typically results in regression surrogates. Counter-intuitively,\nthese gradient-enhanced regression-based surrogates do not exhibit improved\naccuracy compared to surrogates only interpolating function values.\n  This study empirically establishes three main findings. Firstly, constructing\nthe surrogate in poorly scaled domains is the predominant cause of\ndeteriorating response surfaces when regressing with additional gradient\ninformation. Secondly, surrogate accuracy improves if the surrogates are\nconstructed in a fully transformed domain, by scaling and rotating the original\ndomain, not just simply scaling the domain. The domain transformation scheme\nshould be based on the local curvature of the approximation surface and not its\nglobal curvature. Thirdly, the main benefit of gradient information is to\nefficiently determine the (near) optimal domain in which to construct the\nsurrogate. This study proposes a foundational transformation algorithm that\nperforms near-optimal transformations for lower dimensional problems. The\nalgorithm consistently outperforms cross-validation-based component-wise domain\nscaling for higher dimensional problems.

DCA addresses the semantic gap between encoder\nand decoder features by sequentially capturing channel and spatial dependencies\nacross multi-scale encoder features. First, the Channel Cross-Attention (CCA)\nextracts global channel-wise dependencies by utilizing cross-attention across\nchannel tokens of multi-scale encoder features. Then, the Spatial\nCross-Attention (SCA) module performs cross-attention to capture spatial\ndependencies across spatial tokens. Finally, these fine-grained encoder\nfeatures are up-sampled and connected to their corresponding decoder parts to\nform the skip-connection scheme. Our proposed DCA module can be integrated into\nany encoder-decoder architecture with skip-connections such as U-Net and its\nvariants. We test our DCA module by integrating it into six U-Net-based\narchitectures such as U-Net, V-Net, R2Unet, ResUnet++, DoubleUnet and\nMultiResUnet.

The PRO continual reassessment method (PRO-CRM) has been\nproposed to formally incorporate PROs to estimate the MTD, requiring complete\nfollow-up of both clinician and patient toxicity information per dose cohort to\nassign the next cohort of patients. In this paper, we propose two extensions of\nthe PRO-CRM, allowing continuous enrollment of patients and handling longer\ntoxicity observation windows to capture late-onset or cumulative toxicities.\nThe first method, the TITE-PRO-CRM, uses a weighted likelihood to include the\npartial follow-up information from PRO in estimating the MTD during and at the\nend of the trial. The second method, the TITE-CRM+PRO, uses clinician's\ninformation solely to inform dose assignments during the trial and incorporates\nPRO at the end of the trial for dose recommendation. Simulation studies show\nthat the TITE-PRO-CRM performs similarly to the PRO-CRM in terms of dose\nrecommendation and assignments during the trial while reducing trial duration.\nThe TITE-CRM + PRO slightly underperforms compared to the TITE-PRO-CRM, but\nsimilar performance can be attained by requiring larger sample sizes.

Plausibility measures how reasonable\nthe machine explanation is compared to the human explanation. Plausibility has\nbeen conventionally formulated as an important evaluation objective for AI\nexplainability tasks. We argue against this idea, and show how optimizing and\nevaluating XAI for plausibility is sometimes harmful, and always ineffective in\nachieving model understandability, transparency, and trustworthiness.\nSpecifically, evaluating XAI algorithms for plausibility regularizes the\nmachine explanation to express exactly the same content as human explanation,\nwhich deviates from the fundamental motivation for humans to explain:\nexpressing similar or alternative reasoning trajectories while conforming to\nunderstandable forms or language. Optimizing XAI for plausibility regardless of\nthe model decision correctness also jeopardizes model trustworthiness, because\ndoing so breaks an important assumption in human-human explanation that\nplausible explanations typically imply correct decisions, and vice versa; and\nviolating this assumption eventually leads to either undertrust or overtrust of\nAI models. Instead of being the end goal in XAI evaluation, plausibility can\nserve as an intermediate computational proxy for the human process of\ninterpreting explanations to optimize the utility of XAI.

For this reason, the development of increasingly sophisticated\nerror characterization and error suppression techniques is central to the\nprogress of quantum computing. Error distributions are considerably influenced\nby the precise gate scheduling across the entire quantum processing unit. To\naccount for this holistic feature, we may ascribe each error profile to a\n(clock) cycle, which is a scheduled list of instructions over an arbitrarily\nlarge fraction of the chip. A celebrated technique known as randomized\ncompiling introduces some randomness within cycles' instructions, which yields\neffective cycles with simpler, stochastic error profiles. In the present work,\nwe leverage the structure of cycle benchmarking (CB) circuits as well as known\nPauli channel estimation techniques to derive a method, which we refer to as\ncycle error reconstruction (CER), to estimate with multiplicative precision the\nmarginal error distribution associated with any effective cycle of interest.\nThe CER protocol is designed to scale for an arbitrarily large number of\nqubits. Furthermore, we develop a fast compilation-based calibration method,\nreferred to as stochastic calibration (SC), to identify and suppress local\ncoherent error sources occurring in any effective cycle of interest. We\nperformed both protocols on IBM-Q 5-qubit devices. Via our calibration scheme,\nwe obtained up to a 5-fold improvement of the circuit performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 21:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

This study investigates pedestrian crossing\nbehavior given different roadway centerline features (i.e., undivided, two-way\nleft-turn lane (TWLTL), and median) and various AV operational schemes\nportrayed to pedestrians through on-vehicle signals (i.e., no signal, yellow\nnegotiating indication, and yellow/blue negotiating/no-yield indications). This\nstudy employs virtual reality to simulate an urban unmarked midblock\nenvironment where pedestrians interact with AVs. Results demonstrate that both\nroadway centerline design features and AV operations and signaling\nsignificantly impact pedestrian unmarked midblock crossing behavior, including\nthe waiting time at the curb, waiting time in the middle of the road, and the\ntotal crossing time. But only the roadway centerline features significantly\nimpact the walking time. Participants in the undivided scene spent a longer\ntime waiting at the curb and walking on the road than in the median and TWLTL\nscenes, but they spent a shorter time waiting in the middle. Compared to the AV\nwithout a signal, the design of yellow signal significantly reduced pedestrian\nwaiting time at the curb and in the middle. But yellow/blue significantly\nincreased the pedestrian waiting time. Interaction effects between roadway\ncenterline design features and AV operations and signaling are significant only\nfor waiting time in the middle. For middle waiting time, yellow/blue signals\nhad the most impact on the median road type and the least on the undivided\nroad. Demographics, past behaviors, and walking exposure are also explored.\nOlder individuals tend to wait longer, and pedestrian past crossing behaviors\nand past walking exposures do not significantly impact pedestrian walking\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 21:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

However, most linear\ntransforms are viewed as a pre-processing operation separate from the actual\ntraining. Starting from equivalent networks, it is shown that pre-processing\ninputs using linear transformation are equivalent to multiplying the negative\ngradient matrix with an autocorrelation matrix per training iteration. Second\norder method is proposed to find the autocorrelation matrix that maximizes\nlearning in a given iteration. When the autocorrelation matrix is diagonal, the\nmethod optimizes input gains. This optimal input gain (OIG) approach is used to\nimprove two first-order two-stage training algorithms, namely back-propagation\n(BP) and hidden weight optimization (HWO), which alternately update the input\nweights and solve linear equations for output weights.

Although dynamic\nrules of the motion of automated-driving vehicles in a road lane are\nqualitatively different from those of human-driving vehicles, we have revealed\nthat a free-flow-to-synchronized-flow transition (F$\\rightarrow$S transition)\nexhibits the nucleation nature, which was observed in empirical field data\nmeasured in traffic consisting of 100% human-driving vehicles.

The functions we construct represent the material response\nto specific types of active perturbation within the system. Utilizing these\nresponse functions we query the material response of disparate active systems\ncomposed of actin filaments and myosin motors, from model fluids to living\ncells. We show we can extract critical length scales from the turbulent flows\nof an active nematic, anticipate contractility in an active gel, distinguish\nviscous from viscoelastic dissipation, and even differentiate modes of\ncontractility in living cells. These examples underscore the vast utility of\nthis method which measures response functions from experimental observations of\ncomplex active systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 03:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

This\nstudy aimed to assess the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for TKM using the\nKorean National Licensing Examination for Korean Medicine Doctors.

Current attempts\nto use 'general' input features for model interpretation assume access to a\ndataset containing those features, which biases the interpretation. Addressing\nthe gap, we introduce a new perspective of input-agnostic saliency mapping that\ncomputationally estimates the high-level features attributed by the model to\nits outputs.

As a peculiar property, CRM priors lead to predictive\ndistributions that share the following common structure: for fixed prior's\nparameters, a new data point exhibits a Poisson (random) number of ``new''\ntraits, i.e., not appearing in the sample, which depends on the sampling\ninformation only through the sample size. While the Poisson posterior\ndistribution is appealing for analytical tractability and ease of\ninterpretation, its independence from the sampling information is a critical\ndrawback, as it makes the posterior distribution of ``new'' traits completely\ndetermined by the estimation of the unknown prior's parameters. In this paper,\nwe introduce the class of transform-scaled process (T-SP) priors as a tool to\nenrich the posterior distribution of ``new'' traits arising from CRM priors,\nwhile maintaining the same analytical tractability and ease of interpretation.\nIn particular, we present a framework for posterior analysis of trait\nallocations under T-SP priors, showing that Stable T-SP priors, i.e., T-SP\npriors built from Stable CRMs, lead to predictive distributions such that, for\nfixed prior's parameters, a new data point displays a negative-Binomial\n(random) number of ``new'' traits, which depends on the sampling information\nthrough the number of distinct traits and the sample size. Then, by relying on\na hierarchical version of T-SP priors, we extend our analysis to the more\ngeneral setting of trait allocations with multiple groups of data or\nsubpopulations. The empirical effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated\nthrough numerical experiments and applications to real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 07:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

In this\nresearch, we propose a feature learning module, termed WSense, which uses two\n1D CNN and global max pooling layers to extract similar quality features from\nwearable sensor data while ignoring the difference in activity recognition\nmodels caused by the size of the sliding window. Experiments were carried out\nusing CNN and ConvLSTM feature learning pipelines on a dataset obtained with a\nsingle accelerometer (WISDM) and another obtained using the fusion of\naccelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers (PAMAP2) under various sliding\nwindow sizes. A total of nine hundred sixty (960) experiments were conducted to\nvalidate the WSense module against baselines and existing methods on the two\ndatasets.

A typical\nmodelling approach is to fit a Poisson loglinear model to the numbers of cases\nobserved in each possible combination of the lists. It is necessary to decide\nwhich interaction parameters to include in the model, and information criterion\napproaches are often used for model selection. Difficulties in the context of\nmultiple systems estimation may arise due to sparse or nil counts based on the\nintersection of lists, and care must be taken when information criterion\napproaches are used for model selection due to issues relating to the existence\nof estimates and identifiability of the model. Confidence intervals are often\nreported conditional on the model selected, providing an over-optimistic\nimpression of the accuracy of the estimation.\n  A bootstrap approach is a natural way to account for the model selection\nprocedure.

The study of open quantum\nbatteries is motivated by the fact that real-world quantum systems are almost\nnever perfectly isolated from their environment. One important challenge in the\nstudy of open quantum batteries is to develop theoretical models that\naccurately capture the complex interactions between the battery and its\nenvironment. the goal of studying open quantum batteries is to develop\npractical methods for building and operating quantum devices that can store and\nrelease energy with high efficiency and reliability, even in the presence of\nenvironmental noise and other sources of decoherence. The charging process of\nopen quantum batteries under the influence of dissipative environment will be\nstudied. In this Work, the effect of the classical driving field on the\ncharging process of open quantum batteries will be investigated. The classical\ndriving field can be used to manipulate the charging and discharging process of\nthe battery, leading to enhanced performance and improved efficiency.

Therefore, a one-shot distributed\nprinciple component analysis (PCA) is leveraged to reduce the dimension of\nuploaded gradients such that the communication bottleneck is relieved. A\nPCA-based wireless federated learning (PCA-WFL) algorithm and its accelerated\nversion (i.e., PCA-AWFL) are proposed based on the low-dimensional gradients\nand the Nesterov's momentum. For the non-convex loss functions, a finite-time\nanalysis is performed to quantify the impacts of system hyper-parameters on the\nconvergence of the PCA-WFL and PCA-AWFL algorithms.

The 5 Myr PDS 70\nsystems offers a unique opportunity to directly compare the chemistry of a\ngiant planet's atmosphere to the chemistry of its natal disk. To that end, we\nderive our current best physical and chemical model for the PDS 70 disk through\nforward modelling of the $^{12}$CO, C$^{18}$O, and C$_2$H emission radial\nprofiles with the thermochemical code DALI and find a volatile C/O ratio above\nunity in the outer disk.

We compute the formation of PDS 70b\nand PDS 70c using the standard core accretion paradigm and account for the\naccretion of volatile and refractory sources of carbon and oxygen to estimate\nthe resulting atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen number ratio (C/O) for these\nplanets. Our inferred C/O ratio of the gas in the PDS 70 disk indicates that it\nis marginally carbon rich relative to the stellar C/O = 0.44 which we derive\nfrom an empirical relation between stellar metallicity and C/O. Under the\nassumption that the disk has been carbon rich for most of its lifetime, we find\nthat the planets acquire a super-stellar C/O in their atmospheres.

LFDBF is constructed to exclude most invalid background points, while\nCISS substitutes FPS strategy by fast sampling centroids and instance points.\nIC-FPS module can be inserted to almost every point-based models. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple public benchmarks have demonstrated the superiority of\nIC-FPS. On Waymo dataset, the proposed module significantly improves\nperformance of baseline model and accelerates inference speed by 3.8 times. For\nthe first time, real-time detection of point-based models in large-scale point\ncloud scenario is realized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 09:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine\nlearning approach which has emerged as an effective way to address privacy\nconcerns by only sharing local AI models while keeping the data decentralized.\nTwo critical challenges of Federated Learning are managing the heterogeneous\nsystems in the same federated network and dealing with real data, which are\noften not independently and identically distributed (non-IID) among the\nclients. In this paper, we focus on the second problem, i.e., the problem of\nstatistical heterogeneity of the data in the same federated network. In this\nsetting, local models might be strayed far from the local optimum of the\ncomplete dataset, thus possibly hindering the convergence of the federated\nmodel.

Given that most\ntraining is currently conducted with entire networks in FP32, or sometimes FP16\nwith mixed-precision, the step to having some parts of a network run in FP8\nwith 8-bit weights is an appealing potential speed-up for the generally costly\nand time-intensive training procedures in deep learning. A natural question\narises regarding what this development means for efficient inference on edge\ndevices. In the efficient inference device world, workloads are frequently\nexecuted in INT8. Sometimes going even as low as INT4 when efficiency calls for\nit. In this whitepaper, we compare the performance for both the FP8 and INT\nformats for efficient on-device inference. We theoretically show the difference\nbetween the INT and FP formats for neural networks and present a plethora of\npost-training quantization and quantization-aware-training results to show how\nthis theory translates to practice.

However, some WZ Sge-type DNe show a superoutburst\nlacking early superhumps; it is not well established how these differ from\nsuperoutbursts with an early superhump phase. We report time-resolved\nphotometric observations of the WZ Sge-type DN V627 Peg during its 2021\nsuperoutburst. The detection of ordinary superhumps before the superoutburst\npeak highlights that this 2021 superoutburst of V627 Peg, like that {in} 2014,\ndid not feature an early superhump phase. The duration of stage B superhumps\nwas slightly longer in the 2010 superoutburst accompanying early superhumps\nthan that in the 2014 and 2021 superoutbursts which lacked early superhumps.\nThis result suggests that an accretion disk experiencing the 2:1 resonance may\nhave a larger mass at the inner part of the disk and hence take more time for\nthe inner disk to become eccentric. The presence of a precursor outburst in the\n2021 superoutburst suggests that the maximum disk radius should be smaller than\nthat of the 2014 superoutburst, even though the duration of quiescence was\nlonger than that before the 2021 superoutburst. This could be accomplished if\nthe 2021 superoutburst was triggered as an inside-out outburst or if the mass\ntransfer rate in quiescence changes by a factor of two, suggesting that the\noutburst mechanism and quiescence state of WZ Sge-type DNe may have more\nvariety than ever thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 10:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Therefore,\nwe introduce a new framework for graph convolutional networks called Hybrid\nDiffusion-based Graph Convolutional Network (HD-GCN) to address the limitations\nof information diffusion caused by the adjacency matrix. In the HD-GCN\nframework, we initially utilize diffusion maps to facilitate the diffusion of\ninformation among nodes that are adjacent to each other in the feature space.\nThis allows for the diffusion of information between similar points that may\nnot have an adjacent relationship. Next, we utilize graph convolution to\nfurther propagate information among adjacent nodes after the diffusion maps,\nthereby enabling the spread of information among similar nodes that are\nadjacent in the graph. Finally, we employ the diffusion distances obtained\nthrough the use of diffusion maps to regularize and constrain the predicted\nlabels of training nodes. This regularization method is then applied to the\nHD-GCN training, resulting in a smoother classification surface. The model\nproposed in this paper effectively overcomes the limitations of information\ndiffusion imposed only by the adjacency matrix. HD-GCN utilizes hybrid\ndiffusion by combining information diffusion between neighborhood nodes in the\nfeature space and adjacent nodes in the adjacency matrix. This method allows\nfor more comprehensive information propagation among nodes, resulting in\nimproved model performance. We evaluated the performance of DM-GCN on three\nwell-known citation network datasets and the results showed that the proposed\nframework is more effective than several graph-based semi-supervised learning\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 11:12:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

In recent years, UNet-based networks have prevailed in\nthe field of medical image segmentation. However, convolution-neural networks\n(CNNs) suffer from limited receptive fields, which fail to model the long-range\ndependency of organs or tumors. Besides, these models are heavily dependent on\nthe training of the final segmentation head. And existing methods can not well\naddress these two limitations at the same time. Hence, in our work, we proposed\na novel shape prior module (SPM), which can explicitly introduce shape priors\nto promote the segmentation performance of UNet-based models. The explicit\nshape priors consist of global and local shape priors. The former with coarse\nshape representations provides networks with capabilities to model global\ncontexts. The latter with finer shape information serves as additional guidance\nto boost the segmentation performance, which relieves the heavy dependence on\nthe learnable prototype in the segmentation head. To evaluate the effectiveness\nof SPM, we conduct experiments on three challenging public datasets. And our\nproposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, SPM shows an\noutstanding generalization ability on classic CNNs and recent Transformer-based\nbackbones, which can serve as a plug-and-play structure for the segmentation\ntask of different datasets.

As a preparatory\npart of the work, before solving the Langevin equations, the determination of\ntransport parameters such as inertia and friction tensors within the\nhydrodynamic model is performed. Potential energy surfaces are calculated\nwithin a macroscopic-microscopic approach in a three-dimensional space of\ndeformation parameters defined within the Fourier decomposition of the surface\nradius function in cylindrical coordinates. Using the Lublin-Strasbourg drop\nmodel, Strutinsky shell correction and BCS-like pairing energy model with the\nprojection onto good particle number, we calculate the nuclear total potential\nenergy surfaces (PES). The restoration of the particle number in the superfluid\napproach is realized within the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) with the so\ncalled Gaussian Overlap Approximation (GOA). The final study is concerned with\nthe effect of the starting point of the stochastic Langevin trajectory on its\ntime evolution and, more importantly, the conditions for judging whether such a\ntrajectory for a given time moment describes an already passed fission nucleus\nor not.

Compared to single-agent settings, the exponential dimension\ngrowth of the joint state-action space in multi-agent systems dramatically\nincreases the complexity of the environment dynamics, which makes it infeasible\nto learn an accurate global model and thus necessitates the use of agent-wise\nlocal models. However, during multi-step model rollouts, the prediction of one\nlocal model can affect the predictions of other local models in the next step.\nAs a result, local prediction errors can be propagated to other localities and\neventually give rise to considerably large global errors. Furthermore, since\nthe models are generally used to predict for multiple steps, simply minimizing\none-step prediction errors regardless of their long-term effect on other models\nmay further aggravate the propagation of local errors. To this end, we propose\nModels as AGents (MAG), a multi-agent model optimization framework that\nreversely treats the local models as multi-step decision making agents and the\ncurrent policies as the dynamics during the model rollout process. In this way,\nthe local models are able to consider the multi-step mutual affect between each\nother before making predictions. Theoretically, we show that the objective of\nMAG is approximately equivalent to maximizing a lower bound of the true\nenvironment return.

In GAN,\nsimilar to bilingual models, multilingual NMT only considers one reference\ntranslation for each sentence during model training. This single reference\ntranslation limits the GAN model from learning sufficient information about the\nsource sentence representation. Thus, in this article, we propose Denoising\nAdversarial Auto-encoder-based Sentence Interpolation (DAASI) approach to\nperform sentence interpolation by learning the intermediate latent\nrepresentation of the source and target sentences of multilingual language\npairs.

Their thermodynamic forces and fluxes\nare following the Onsager reciprocal relation and consistent with the classical\nirreversible thermodynamics.

One such feature is the phase spiral where the stars in the Galactic disc\nform a spiral density pattern in the $Z-V_Z$ plane. Aims: We aim to\ncharacterize the shape, rotation, amplitude, and metallicity of the phase\nspiral in the outer disc of the Milky Way. This will allow us to better\nunderstand which physical processes caused the phase spiral and can give\nfurther clues to the Milky Way's past and the events that contributed to its\ncurrent state. Methods: We use Gaia data release 3 (DR3) to get full position\nand velocity data on approximately 31.5 million stars, and metallicity for a\nsubset of them. We then compute the angular momenta of the stars and develop a\nmodel to characterise the phase spiral in terms of amplitude and rotation at\ndifferent locations in the disc. Results: We find that the rotation angle of\nthe phase spiral changes with Galactic azimuth and Galactocentric radius,\nmaking the phase spiral appear to rotate about $3^\\circ$ per degree in Galactic\nazimuth. Furthermore, we find that the phase spiral in the $2200 - 2400$ kpc km\ns$^{-1}$ range of angular momentum is particularly strong compared to the phase\nspiral that can be observed in the solar neighbourhood. The metallicity of the\nphase spiral appears to match that of the Milky Way disc field stars.\nConclusions: We created a new model capable of fitting several key parameters\nof the phase spiral. We have been able to determine the rotation rate of the\nphase spiral and found a peak in the phase spiral amplitude which manifests as\na very clear phase spiral when using only stars with similar angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 13:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

We limit the\nsample to $B/T < 0.3$ galaxies to control for the trends with morphology and\nfind that the excess population of cluster galaxies with suppressed SFRs\npersists. We model the timescale associated with the decline of SFRs in dense\nenvironments and find that the observed SFRs of the cluster core galaxies are\nconsistent with a range of models including: a mechanism that acts slowly and\ncontinuously over a long (2-5 Gyr) timescale, and a more rapid ($<1$ Gyr)\nquenching event that occurs after a delay period of 1-6 Gyr. Quenching may\ntherefore start immediately after galaxies enter clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 13:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

In contrast, we have studied\nhere in the framework of the sandpile model a system that has mass inflow but\nno outflow. There is no boundary, and particles cannot escape from the system\nby any means. Therefore, there is no current balance, and consequently it is\nnot expected that the system would arrive at a stationary state.

However, configurations flowed from\nconfigurations in the confinement phase keep their confinement property that\nthe particles are strongly interacting. It is seemingly mysterious, and\nsomething stable against coarse-graining is expected to be behind the nature of\nconfinement. By performing Monte Carlo simulations of U(1) lattice gauge\ntheory, we discusses the relationship between the gradient flow and magnetic\nmonopoles created by the compactness of the U(1) gauge group. Many magnetic\nmonopoles are generated in the confinement phase but not so many in the\ndeconfinement phase. Since the monopole is a kind of topological quantity, the\nnumber of monopoles does not change much by the coarse-graining. To investigate\nwhy the confinement properties are not lost by the gradient flow, we computed\nWilson loops and Polyakov loops separating them into the field strength and the\nmonopole contributions. We found that the field strength, which decreases with\nthe gradient flow, does not affect confinement properties, and the monopole and\nthe confinement properties are strongly related.

We find again a simple formula,\nwhich also counts certain planar maps (of prescribed size) called\n$(m+1)$-constellations.\n  For instance, when $m=1$ the number of intervals in the greedy order on\n1-Dyck paths of length $2n$ is proved to be $\\frac{3\\cdot 2^{n-1}}{(n+1)(n+2)}\n\\binom{2n}{n}$, which is also the number of bipartite maps with $n$ edges.\n  Our approach is recursive, and uses a ``catalytic'' parameter, namely the\nlength of the final descent of the upper path of the interval.

To\nattain the computer ability to understand the reading text and answer relevant\ninformation, we introduce ViMMRC 2.0 - an extension of the previous ViMMRC for\nthe task of multiple-choice reading comprehension in Vietnamese Textbooks which\ncontain the reading articles for students from Grade 1 to Grade 12. This\ndataset has 699 reading passages which are prose and poems, and 5,273\nquestions. The questions in the new dataset are not fixed with four options as\nin the previous version. Moreover, the difficulty of questions is increased,\nwhich challenges the models to find the correct choice. The computer must\nunderstand the whole context of the reading passage, the question, and the\ncontent of each choice to extract the right answers.

To\nconstruct a digital twin of a thermal system, it is required to make online\nestimations of unknown time-varying boundary conditions from sensor measured\ndata, which needs to solve inverse heat transfer problems (IHTPs). However, a\nfast and accurate solution is challenging since the measured data is normally\ncontaminated with noise and the traditional method to solve IHTP involves\nsignificant amount of calculations. Therefore, in this work, a rapid yet robust\ninversion algorithm called ANN-based extended Kalman smoothing algorithm is\ndeveloped to realize the online prediction of desired parameter based on the\nmeasurements. The fast prediction is realized by replacing the conventional\nCFD-based state transfer models in extended Kalman smoothing algorithm with\npre-trained ANN.

Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based Liquid State\nMachine (LSM) serves as a suitable architecture to study brain-inspired\nintelligence because of its brain-inspired structure and the potential for\nintegrating multiple biological principles. Existing researches on LSM focus on\ndifferent certain perspectives, including high-dimensional encoding or\noptimization of the liquid layer, network architecture search, and application\nto hardware devices. There is still a lack of in-depth inspiration from the\nlearning and structural evolution mechanism of the brain. Considering these\nlimitations, this paper presents a novel LSM learning model that integrates\nadaptive structural evolution and multi-scale biological learning rules. For\nstructural evolution, an adaptive evolvable LSM model is developed to optimize\nthe neural architecture design of liquid layer with separation property. For\nbrain-inspired learning of LSM, we propose a dopamine-modulated\nBienenstock-Cooper-Munros (DA-BCM) method that incorporates global long-term\ndopamine regulation and local trace-based BCM synaptic plasticity. Comparative\nexperimental results on different decision-making tasks show that introducing\nstructural evolution of the liquid layer, and the DA-BCM regulation of the\nliquid layer and the readout layer could improve the decision-making ability of\nLSM and flexibly adapt to rule reversal. This work is committed to exploring\nhow evolution can help to design more appropriate network architectures and how\nmulti-scale neuroplasticity principles coordinated to enable the optimization\nand learning of LSMs for relatively complex decision-making tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 07:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

To address these concerns, this paper introduces an evolutionary\napproach that aims to identify the best set of Bloom's taxonomy keywords to\ngenerate questions that these tools have low confidence in answering. The\neffectiveness of this approach is evaluated through a case study that uses\nquestions from a Data Structures and Representation course being taught at the\nUniversity of New South Wales in Canberra, Australia. The results demonstrate\nthat the optimization algorithm is able to find keywords from different\ncognitive levels to create questions that ChatGPT has low confidence in\nanswering.

However, STR models show a large performance\ndegradation on languages with a numerous number of characters (e.g., Chinese\nand Korean), especially on characters that rarely appear due to the long-tailed\ndistribution of characters in such languages. To address such an issue, we\nconducted an empirical analysis using synthetic datasets with different\ncharacter-level distributions (e.g., balanced and long-tailed distributions).\nWhile increasing a substantial number of tail classes without considering the\ncontext helps the model to correctly recognize characters individually,\ntraining with such a synthetic dataset interferes the model with learning the\ncontextual information (i.e., relation among characters), which is also\nimportant for predicting the whole word. Based on this motivation, we propose a\nnovel Context-Aware and Free Experts Network (CAFE-Net) using two experts: 1)\ncontext-aware expert learns the contextual representation trained with a\nlong-tailed dataset composed of common words used in everyday life and 2)\ncontext-free expert focuses on correctly predicting individual characters by\nutilizing a dataset with a balanced number of characters. By training two\nexperts to focus on learning contextual and visual representations,\nrespectively, we propose a novel confidence ensemble method to compensate the\nlimitation of each expert. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that\nCAFE-Net improves the STR performance on languages containing numerous number\nof characters. Moreover, we show that CAFE-Net is easily applicable to various\nSTR models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 06:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

However, due to the inherent limits\nto the parallelism they can exploit, DNNs often under-utilize the capacity of\ntoday's high-end accelerators. Although spatial multiplexing of the GPU, leads\nto higher GPU utilization and higher inference throughput, there remain a\nnumber of challenges. Finding the GPU percentage for right-sizing the GPU for\neach DNN through profiling, determining an optimal batching of requests to\nbalance throughput improvement while meeting application-specific deadlines and\nservice level objectives (SLOs), and maximizing throughput by appropriately\nscheduling DNNs are still significant challenges. This paper introduces a\ndynamic and fair spatio-temporal scheduler (D-STACK) that enables multiple DNNs\nto run in the GPU concurrently. To help allocate the appropriate GPU percentage\n(we call it the \"Knee\"), we develop and validate a model that estimates the\nparallelism each DNN can utilize. We also develop a lightweight optimization\nformulation to find an efficient batch size for each DNN operating with\nD-STACK. We bring together our optimizations and our spatio-temporal scheduler\nto provide a holistic inference framework. We demonstrate its ability to\nprovide high throughput while meeting application SLOs. We compare D-STACK with\nan ideal scheduler that can allocate the right GPU percentage for every DNN\nkernel. D-STACK gets higher than 90 percent throughput and GPU utilization\ncompared to the ideal scheduler. We also compare D-STACK with other GPU\nmultiplexing and scheduling methods (e.g., NVIDIA Triton, Clipper, Nexus),\nusing popular DNN models. Our controlled experiments with multiplexing several\npopular DNN models achieve up to 1.6X improvement in GPU utilization and up to\n4X improvement in inference throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 15:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}
