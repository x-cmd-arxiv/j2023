Marginal\neffects are usually not relevant for information retrieval, and therefore, from\na theoretical perspective CA is more suitable for information retrieval.\n  In this paper, we empirically compare LSA and CA. The elements of the raw\ndocument-term matrix are weighted, and the weighting exponent of singular\nvalues is adjusted to improve the performance of LSA. We explore whether these\ntwo weightings also improve the performance of CA. In addition, we compare the\noptimal singular value weighting exponents for LSA and CA to identify what the\ninitial dimensions in LSA correspond to.\n  The results for four empirical datasets show that CA always performs better\nthan LSA.

Parser combinators use the host language to provide\nreusable components in the form of higher-order functions with parsers as\nparameters. Very few parser generators support this kind of reuse through\nabstraction and even fewer generate parsers that are as modular and reusable as\nthe parts of the grammar for which they are produced. This paper presents a\nstrategy for generating modular, reusable and complete top-down parsers from\nsyntax descriptions with parameterized nonterminals, based on the FUN-GLL\nvariant of the GLL algorithm.\n  The strategy is discussed and demonstrated as a novel back-end for the Happy\nparser generator. Happy grammars can contain `parameterized nonterminals' in\nwhich parameters abstract over grammar symbols, granting an abstraction\nmechanism to define reusable grammar operators. However, the existing Happy\nback-ends do not deliver on the full potential of parameterized nonterminals as\nparameterized nonterminals cannot be reused across grammars. Moreover, the\nparser generation process may fail to terminate or may result in exponentially\nlarge parsers generated in an exponential amount of time.\n  The GLL back-end presented in this paper implements parameterized\nnonterminals successfully by generating higher-order functions that resemble\nparser combinators, inheriting all the advantages of top-down parsing. The\nback-end is capable of generating parsers for the full class of context-free\ngrammars, generates parsers in linear time and generates parsers that find all\nderivations of the input string. To our knowledge, the presented GLL back-end\nmakes Happy the first parser generator that combines all these features.\n  This paper describes the translation procedure of the GLL back-end and\ncompares it to the LALR and GLR back-ends of Happy in several experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 16:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Fundamentally, this limit\narises from the non-commuting nature of quantum mechanics, leading to the\npresence of fluctuations often referred to as quantum projection noise. Quantum\nmetrology relies on the use of non-classical states of many-body systems in\norder to enhance the precision of measurements beyond the standard quantum\nlimit. To do so, one can reshape the quantum projection noise -- a strategy\nknown as squeezing. In the context of many-body spin systems, one typically\nutilizes all-to-all interactions (e.g. the one-axis twisting model) between the\nconstituents to generate the structured entanglement characteristic of spin\nsqueezing. Motivated by recent theoretical work, here we explore the prediction\nthat short-range interactions -- and in particular, the two-dimensional dipolar\nXY model -- can also enable the realization of scalable spin squeezing. Working\nwith a dipolar Rydberg quantum simulator of up to 100 atoms, we demonstrate\nthat quench dynamics from a polarized initial state lead to spin squeezing that\nimproves with increasing system size up to a maximum of -3.5 dB (prior to\ncorrecting for detection errors, or approximately -5 dB after correction).\nFinally, we present two independent refinements: first, using a multistep\nspin-squeezing protocol allows us to further enhance the squeezing by\napproximately 1 dB, and second, leveraging Floquet engineering to realize\nHeisenberg interactions, we demonstrate the ability to extend the lifetime of\nthe squeezed state by freezing its dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 16:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

We find that the <sSFR> of galaxies is only dependent on cosmic web\nenvironment at $z<2$, with the dependence increasing with time. At $z\\leq0.5$,\n$8 \\leq \\log(M_{\\ast}/\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}) < 9$ galaxies are quenched at\n$d_{\\mathrm{node}}\\lesssim1$~Mpc, and have significantly-suppressed star\nformation at $d_{\\mathrm{fil}}\\lesssim1$~Mpc, trends driven mostly by satellite\ngalaxies.

Therefore, in the present paper, we propose an alternative method of\nextracting these material properties from recently available experimental\nmagnetoexciton s-state energies in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides\n(TMDCs). The method is based on the high sensitivity of exciton energies to the\nmaterial parameters in the Rytova-Keldysh model. It allows us to vary the\nconsidered material parameters to get the best fit of the theoretical\ncalculation to the experimental exciton energies for the $1s$, $2s$, and $3s$\nstates. This procedure gives values of the exciton reduced mass and $2D$\npolarizability. Then, the experimental magnetoexciton spectra compared to the\ntheoretical calculation also determine the average dielectric constant.\nConcrete applications are presented only for monolayers WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ from\nthe recently available experimental data; however, the presented approach is\nuniversal and can be applied to other monolayer TMDCs. The mentioned fitting\nprocedure requires a fast and effective method of solving the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation of an exciton in monolayer TMDCs with a magnetic field. Therefore, we\nalso develop such a method in this paper for highly accurate magnetoexciton\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 17:22:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 14:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

However, a series of hyperparameters passed to a\nconventional neural network (CoNN) may be rather arbitrary, especially if there\nis no surefire way to decide how to program hyperparameters for a given\ndataset. The random hivemind (RH) alleviates this concern by having multiple\nneural network estimators make decisions based on random permutations of\nfeatures. The learning rate and the number of epochs may be boosted or\nattenuated depending on how all features of a given estimator determine the\nclass that the numerical feature data belong to, but all other hyperparameters\nremain the same across estimators. This allows one to quickly see whether\nconsistent decisions on a given dataset can be made by multiple neural networks\nwith the same hyperparameters, with random subsets of data chosen to force\nvariation in how data are predicted by each, placing the quality of the data\nand hyperparameters into focus. The effectiveness of RH is demonstrated through\nexperimentation in the predictions of dangerous solar energetic particle events\n(SEPs) by comparing it to that of using both CoNN and the traditional approach\nused by ensemble deep learning in this application. Our results demonstrate\nthat RH outperforms the CoNN and a committee-based approach, and demonstrates\npromising results with respect to the ``all-clear'' prediction of SEPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 17:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

The computational cost of producing one complete\nWMAP+LFI Gibbs sample is 812 CPU-hr, of which 603 CPU-hrs are spent on WMAP\nlow-level processing; this demonstrates that end-to-end Bayesian analysis of\nthe WMAP data is computationally feasible. We find that our WMAP posterior mean\ntemperature sky maps and CMB temperature power spectrum are largely consistent\nwith the official WMAP9 results. Perhaps the most notable difference is that\nour CMB dipole amplitude is $3366.2 \\pm 1.4\\ \\mathrm{\\mu K}$, which is $11\\\n\\mathrm{\\mu K}$ higher than the WMAP9 estimate and $2.5\\ {\\sigma}$ higher than\nBeyondPlanck; however, it is in perfect agreement with the HFI-dominated Planck\nPR4 result. In contrast, our WMAP polarization maps differ more notably from\nthe WMAP9 results, and in general exhibit significantly lower large-scale\nresiduals. We attribute this to a better constrained gain and transmission\nimbalance model. It is particularly noteworthy that the W-band polarization sky\nmap, which was excluded from the official WMAP cosmological analysis, for the\nfirst time appears visually consistent with the V-band sky map. Similarly, the\nlong standing discrepancy between the WMAP K-band and LFI 30 GHz maps is\nfinally resolved, and the difference between the two maps appears consistent\nwith instrumental noise at high Galactic latitudes.

Existing\napproaches do so by assigning a scalar influence score to each training\nexample, under a simplifying assumption that influence is additive. But in\nreality, we observe that training examples interact in highly non-additive ways\ndue to factors such as inter-example redundancy, training order, and curriculum\nlearning effects.\n  To study such interactions, we propose Simfluence, a new paradigm for TDA\nwhere the goal is not to produce a single influence score per example, but\ninstead a training run simulator: the user asks, ``If my model had trained on\nexample $z_1$, then $z_2$, ..., then $z_n$, how would it behave on\n$z_{test}$?''; the simulator should then output a simulated training run, which\nis a time series predicting the loss on $z_{test}$ at every step of the\nsimulated run. This enables users to answer counterfactual questions about what\ntheir model would have learned under different training curricula, and to\ndirectly see where in training that learning would occur.\n  We present a simulator, Simfluence-Linear, that captures non-additive\ninteractions and is often able to predict the spiky trajectory of individual\nexample losses with surprising fidelity. Furthermore, we show that existing TDA\nmethods such as TracIn and influence functions can be viewed as special cases\nof Simfluence-Linear. This enables us to directly compare methods in terms of\ntheir simulation accuracy, subsuming several prior TDA approaches to\nevaluation. In experiments on large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, we show\nthat our method predicts loss trajectories with much higher accuracy than\nexisting TDA methods (doubling Spearman's correlation and reducing mean-squared\nerror by 75%) across several tasks, models, and training methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 17:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

To better fit in with the video\nsegmentation tasks, InstMove uses instance masks to model the physical presence\nof an object and learns the dynamic model through a memory network to predict\nits position and shape in the next frame.

This generalizes\nthe discussion of discrete gauge theories by Verresen et al., arXiv:2211.01376.\nWe show that a Higgs phase in $d$ spatial dimensions is in a non-trivial SPT\nclass protected by a global $U(1)$ symmetry associated with the Higgs field,\nand a $d-2$ form $U(1)$ magnetic symmetry, associated with the absence of\nmagnetic monopoles.

The signature properties of superconductors -- Higgs\nphases for electromagnetism -- can be reproduced from this SPT response. For\ninstance, the Josephson effect directly arises from the aforementioned boundary\nsuperfluid. In addition to this minimalist approach being complementary to\nLandau-Ginzburg theory, its non-perturbative nature is useful in situations\nwhere fluctuations are significant. We substantiate this by predicting the\nstability of the Josephson effect upon introducing monopoles in $U(1)$ lattice\ngauge theory, where tuning from the charge-1 Higgs phase to the confined phase\nleads to a quantum critical point in the junction. Furthermore, this\nperspective reveals unexpected connections, such as how persistent currents at\nthe surface of a superconductor arise from generalized Thouless pumps.

On massively\nparallel supercomputers, however, it suffers a fidelity-scaling problem, where\ngrowing number of unphysical predictions of interatomic forces prohibits\nsimulations involving larger numbers of atoms for longer times. Here, we solve\nthis problem by combining the Allegro model with sharpness aware minimization\n(SAM) for enhancing the robustness of model through improved smoothness of the\nloss landscape. The resulting Allegro-Legato (meaning fast and \"smooth\") model\nwas shown to elongate the time-to-failure $t_\\textrm{failure}$, without\nsacrificing computational speed or accuracy. Specifically, Allegro-Legato\nexhibits much weaker dependence of timei-to-failure on the problem size,\n$t_{\\textrm{failure}} \\propto N^{-0.14}$ ($N$ is the number of atoms) compared\nto the SOTA Allegro model $\\left(t_{\\textrm{failure}} \\propto\nN^{-0.29}\\right)$, i.e., systematically delayed time-to-failure, thus allowing\nmuch larger and longer NNQMD simulations without failure. The model also\nexhibits excellent computational scalability and GPU acceleration on the\nPolaris supercomputer at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. Such scalable,\naccurate, fast and robust NNQMD models will likely find broad applications in\nNNQMD simulations on emerging exaflop/s computers, with a specific example of\naccounting for nuclear quantum effects in the dynamics of ammonia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 18:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

The energy spectrum of ions sputtered by\nISN helium atoms is broad and overlaps the four lowest IBEX-Lo electrostatic\nanalyzer (ESA) steps. Consequently, the energy response function for helium\natoms does not correspond to the nominal energy step transmission. Moreover,\nlaboratory calibration is incomplete because it is difficult to produce\nnarrow-energy neutral atom beams that are expected for ISN helium atoms.

Such phenomena raised the question of the nature of the\nassociation of magnetism and structural symmetry breaking with the appearance\nin (i) and (ii) and disappearance in (iii) of insulating band gaps. It is\ndemonstrated here that first-principles mean-field-like density functional\ntheory (DFT), driven by molecular dynamics temperature evolution, can describe\nnot only the origin of the magnetically long-range ordered insulating phase\n(i), but also the creation of an insulating paramagnet (ii) that lacks\nspin-long-range order, and of a metallic paramagnet (iii) as temperature rises.\nThis approach provides the patterns of structural and magnetic symmetry\nbreaking at different temperatures, in parallel with band gaps obtained when\nthe evolving geometries are used as input to DFT electronic band structure\ncalculations. This disentangles the complex interplay among spin, charge and\norbital degrees of freedom. Analysis shows that the success in describing the\nrise and fall of the insulating band gaps along the phase transition sequence\nis enabled by allowing sufficient flexibility in describing diverse local\nstructural and magnetic motifs as input to DFT. This entails using sufficiently\nlarge supercells that allow expressing structural disproportionation of\noctahedra, as well as a description of PM phases as a distribution of local\nmagnetic moments.

However, recent studies suggest that the key metric\nthat continual learning algorithms optimize, reduction in catastrophic\nforgetting, does not correlate well with the forward transfer of knowledge. We\nbelieve that the conclusion previous works reached is due to the way they\nmeasure forward transfer. We argue that the measure of forward transfer to a\ntask should not be affected by the restrictions placed on the continual learner\nin order to preserve knowledge of previous tasks. Instead, forward transfer\nshould be measured by how easy it is to learn a new task given a set of\nrepresentations produced by continual learning on previous tasks. Under this\nnotion of forward transfer, we evaluate different continual learning algorithms\non a variety of image classification benchmarks. Our results indicate that less\nforgetful representations lead to a better forward transfer suggesting a strong\ncorrelation between retaining past information and learning efficiency on new\ntasks. Further, we found less forgetful representations to be more diverse and\ndiscriminative compared to their forgetful counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 19:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

Current methods of\nstress detection lack: (i) robustness -- wearable health sensors contain high\nlevels of measurement noise that degrades performance, and (ii) adaptation --\nstatic architectures fail to adapt to changing contexts in sensing conditions.\nWe propose to address these deficiencies with SELF-CARE, a generalized\nselective sensor fusion method of stress detection that employs novel\ntechniques of context identification and ensemble machine learning.

Spinner handedness also matters at high spinner densities but\nnot low densities: oscillations in the mixing spatial entropy of spinners over\ntime emerge if there is a net spin imbalance from collective rotations.\nGeometrically confined spinners can lock themselves into frustrated spin\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 20:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

Motivated by the demands of dynamic relationship analysis\nof IoT system, we study the data-dependent sample selection and online\ninference problem for a multi-dimensional streaming time series, aiming to\nprovide low-cost real-time analysis of high-speed power grid electricity\nconsumption data. Inspired by D-optimality criterion in design of experiments,\nwe propose a class of online data reduction methods that achieve an optimal\nsampling criterion and improve the computational efficiency of the online\nanalysis. We show that the optimal solution amounts to a strategy that is a\nmixture of Bernoulli sampling and leverage score sampling. The leverage score\nsampling involves auxiliary estimations that have a computational advantage\nover recursive least squares updates. Theoretical properties of the auxiliary\nestimations involved are also discussed. When applied to European power grid\nconsumption data, the proposed leverage score based sampling methods outperform\nthe benchmark sampling method in online estimation and prediction. The general\napplicability of the sampling-assisted online estimation method is assessed via\nsimulation studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 21:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

Characterizing\nthe heterogeneous subpopulation structure within a tumor will enable a more\nprecise and successful treatment strategy for cancer therapy. A possible\nstrategy to uncover the structure of subpopulations is to examine how they\nrespond differently to different drugs. For instance, PhenoPop was proposed as\na means to unravel the subpopulation structure within a tumor from\nhigh-throughput drug screening data. However, the deterministic nature of\nPhenoPop restricts the model fit and the information it can extract from the\ndata.

Divergent phase diagrams in MATBG are often\nattributed to the sublattice polarization energy scale, tuned by the degree of\nalignment of the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates typically used in van\nder Waals devices. Unaligned MATBG exhibits unconventional superconductivity\nand correlated insulating phases, while nearly perfectly aligned MATBG/hBN\nexhibits zero-field Chern insulating phases and lacks superconductivity. Here\nwe use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) to observe\ngapped phases at partial fillings of the flat bands of MATBG in a new\nintermediate regime of sublattice polarization, observed when MATBG is only\npartially aligned ($\\theta_{Gr-hBN}$ $\\approx$ 1.65$^\\circ$) to the underlying\nhBN substrate.

At charge\nneutrality, we observe an insulating phase with a small energy gap ($\\Delta$ <\n5 meV) likely related to weak sublattice symmetry breaking from the hBN\nsubstrate.

Star formation within the bulge is itself in the high-\\Sigma_SFR clumpy\nmode, which ensures that the bulge's chemical track follows that of the thick\ndisk at low [Fe/H] and then extends to high [Fe/H], where it peaks. The peak at\nlow metallicity instead is comprised of a mixture of in-situ stars and stars\naccreted via clumps. As a result, the trough between the peaks occurs at the\nend of the thick disk track.

By\ncontrast, contrary to the conjecture we prove the sums $f_k$ increase\nmonotonically in $k$, sufficiently large.\n  Our main result gives an asymptotic for $f_k$ which identifies the (negative)\nsecondary term, i.e. $f_k = 1 - (a+o(1))k^2/2^k$ for an explicit constant $a=\n.0656\\cdots$. This is proven by a refined method combining real and complex\nanalysis, while the classical results of Sathe and Selberg on products of $k$\nprimes imply the weaker estimate $f_k=1+O_{\\varepsilon}(k^{\\varepsilon-1/2})$.\nWe also give an alternate, probability-theoretic argument related to the\nDickman distribution. Here the proof reduces to showing a new sequence of\nintegrals converges to $e^{-\\gamma}$, which may be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 23:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

Such techniques\nprovide workarounds for the limited numbers of qubits that are available on\nnear-term quantum devices. Wire cutting, however, introduces multiplicative\nfactors in the number of times such subcircuits need to be executed in order to\nestimate desired quantum observables to desired levels of statistical accuracy.\nAn optimal wire-cutting methodology has recently been reported that uses\nancilla qubits to minimize the multiplicative factors involved as a function of\nthe number of wire cuts. Until just recently, the best-known wire-cutting\ntechnique that did not employ ancillas asymptotically converged to the same\nmultiplicative factors, but performed significantly worse for small numbers of\ncuts. This latter technique also requires inserting measurement and\nstate-preparation subcircuits that are randomly sampled from Clifford 2-designs\non a per-shot basis.

We consider\nboth the classical and quantum descriptions of the system. We show that after a\nsingle frequency passage through zero value, the famous adiabatic invariant\nratio of energy to frequency (which does not hold for zero frequency) is\nreestablished again, but with the proportionality coefficient dependent on the\ninitial state. The dependence on the initial state disappears after averaging\nover phases of initial states with the same energy (in particular, for the\ninitial vacuum, Fock and thermal quantum states). In this case, the mean\nproportionality coefficient is always greater than unity. The concrete value of\nthe mean proportionality coefficient depends on the power index of the\nfrequency dependence on time near zero point. In particular, the mean energy\ntriplicates if the frequency tends to zero linearly. If the frequency attains\nzero more than once, the adiabatic proportionality coefficient strongly depends\non lengths of time intervals between zero points, so that the mean energy\nbehavior turns out quasi-stochastic after many passages through zero value. The\noriginal Born-Fock theorem does not work after the frequency passes through\nzero. However, its generalization is found: the initial Fock state becomes a\nwide superposition of many Fock states, whose weights do not depend on time in\nthe new adiabatic regime. When the mean energy triplicates, the initial Nth\nFock state becomes a superposition of, roughly speaking, 6N states, distributed\nnon-uniformly. The initial vacuum and low-order Fock states become squeezed, as\nwell as initial thermal states with low values of the mean energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 01:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

At a signal-to-noise ratio of 20dB, the improvements reach about two\norders of magnitude when only quantization error exists, indicating that the\nDAE-ZIC is highly robust to the interference compared to the conventional\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 02:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

To reconstruct the density field from the shear catalog, an important\nstep is to build the shear field from the shear catalog, which can be quite\nnontrivial due to the inhomogeneity of the background galaxy distribution and\nthe shape noise. We propose the PDF-Folding method as a statistically optimal\nway of reconstructing the shear field. It is an extention of the PDF-SYM\nmethod, which is previously designed for optimizing the stacked shear signal as\nwell as the shear-shear correlation. PDF-Folding does not require smoothing\nkernels as in traditional methods, therefore it suffers less information loss\non small scales, and avoids possible biases due to the spatial variation of\nshear on the scale of the kernel. We show with analytic reasoning as well as\nnumerical examples that the new method can reach the optimal signal-to-noise\nratio on the reconstructed shear map under general observing conditions, i.e.,\nwith inhomogeneous background densities or masks.

However, this inevitably leads to redundant computation since\nadjacent frames are highly correlated. In this paper, we propose an efficient\nMotion-guided Sequential Fusion (MSF) method, which exploits the continuity of\nobject motion to mine useful sequential contexts for object detection in the\ncurrent frame.

This\nspontaneous breaking leads to a tilting of the magnetization perpendicular to\nthe Majorana propagation direction and the opening of a fermionic gap (Majorana\nmass).

On the other hand, decreasing the number of\nchunks through training optimization techniques usually requires high model\ncapacity, which significantly slows down execution speed. To reconcile such, we\npropose a novel method for high-quality and efficient video resolution\nupscaling tasks, which leverages the spatial-temporal information to accurately\ndivide video into chunks, thus keeping the number of chunks as well as the\nmodel size to minimum.

To address this challenge, a common\npractice is to employ a sliding window, yet can be inefficient and inflexible\ndue to the limited number of frames within the window.

Existing models do not fully solve\nthis problem of relation redundancy and noise, as they directly characterize\nsocial influence over the full social network.

Coverings\nhave been employed in many applications, such as approximations for diameter,\nwidth, and $\\epsilon$-kernels of point sets, approximate nearest neighbor\nsearching, polytope approximations, and approximations to the Closest Vector\nProblem (CVP).\n  It is known how to construct coverings of size $n^{O(n)} /\n\\epsilon^{(n-1)/2}$ for general convex bodies in $\\textbf{R}^n$. In special\ncases, such as when the convex body is the $\\ell_p$ unit ball, this bound has\nbeen improved to $2^{O(n)} / \\epsilon^{(n-1)/2}$. This raises the question of\nwhether such a bound generally holds. In this paper we answer the question in\nthe affirmative.\n  We demonstrate the power and versatility of our coverings by applying them to\nthe problem of approximating a convex body by a polytope, under the\nBanach-Mazur metric.

Using this precise\nepitaxial control at the monolayer level, we demonstrate exponential modulation\nof the resonant tunneling current as a function of barrier thickness. Both the\npeak voltage and characteristic threshold bias exhibit a dependence on barrier\nthickness as a result of the intense electric fields present in the polar\nheterostructures.

Federated learning is a machine learning setting that can protect\ndata privacy, but the high communication cost is often the bottleneck of the\nfederated systems, especially for large neural networks. Limiting the number\nand size of communications is necessary for the practical training of large\nneural structures. Gradient sparsification has received increasing attention as\na method to reduce communication cost, which only updates significant gradients\nand accumulates insignificant gradients locally. However, the secure\naggregation framework cannot directly use gradient sparsification. This article\nproposes two sparsification methods to reduce communication cost in federated\nlearning. One is a time-varying hierarchical sparsification method for model\nparameter update, which solves the problem of maintaining model accuracy after\nhigh ratio sparsity. It can significantly reduce the cost of a single\ncommunication. The other is to apply the sparsification method to the secure\naggregation framework. We sparse the encryption mask matrix to reduce the cost\nof communication while protecting privacy. Experiments show that under\ndifferent Non-IID experiment settings, our method can reduce the upload\ncommunication cost to about 2.9% to 18.9% of the conventional federated\nlearning algorithm when the sparse rate is 0.01.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 04:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

This paper presents a multi-axis force sensing\nmodule that can be integrated with micro-sized surgical instruments such as\nbiopsy forceps. The proposed miniature sensing module mainly consists of a\nflexure, a camera, and a target. The deformation of the flexure is obtained by\nthe pose variation of the top-mounted target, which is estimated by the camera\nwith a proposed pose estimation algorithm. Then, the external force is\nestimated using the flexure's displacement and stiffness matrix. Integrating\nthe sensing module, we further develop a pair of haptics-enabled forceps and\nrealize its multi-modal force sensing, including touching, grasping, and\npulling when the forceps manipulate tissues. To minimize the unexpected sliding\nbetween the forceps' clips and the tissue, we design a micro-level actuator to\ndrive the forceps and compensate for the motion introduced by the flexure's\ndeformation. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to verify the\nfeasibility of the proposed sensing module and forceps, including an automatic\nrobotic grasping procedure on ex-vivo tissues.

An individual's inherent uncertainty, e.g., change of\ndestination, can be masked by complex patterns resulting from the movements of\ninteracting pedestrians. However, latent variable-based generative models often\nentangle such uncertainty with complexity, leading to either limited\nexpressivity or overconfident predictions. In this work, we propose to\nseparately model these two factors by implicitly deriving a flexible\ndistribution that describes complex pedestrians' movements, whereas\nincorporating predictive uncertainty of individuals with explicit density\nfunctions over their future locations. More specifically, we present an\nuncertainty-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework, parameterizing\nsufficient statistics for the distributions of locations that jointly comprise\nthe multi-modal trajectories. We further estimate these parameters of interest\nby approximating a denoising process that progressively recovers pedestrian\nmovements from noise.

However,\npedestrians with limited experience in negotiating with AVs could lack a\ncomprehensive and correct understanding of the information on driving\nintentions' meaning as conveyed by AVs through eHMI, particularly in the\ncurrent contexts where AV and eHMI are not yet mainstream. Consequently,\npedestrians who misunderstand the driving intention of the AVs during the\nencounter may feel threatened and perform unpredictable behaviors. To solve\nthis issue, this study proposes using the pre-instruction on the rationale of\neHMI to help pedestrians correctly understand driving intentions and predict AV\nbehavior. Consequently, this can improve their subjective feelings (ie. sense\nof danger, trust in AV, and sense of relief) and decision-making. In addition,\nthis study suggests that the eHMI could better guide pedestrian behavior\nthrough the pre-instruction.

With datacenters becoming a primary server\nprocessor market, optimizing server processors for cloud workloads by better\nunderstanding their behavior has become crucial. To address this, in this\npaper, we present MemProf, a memory profiler that profiles the three major\nreasons for stalls in cloud workloads: code-fetch, memory bandwidth, and memory\nlatency. We use MemProf to understand the behavior of cloud workloads and\npropose and evaluate micro-architectural and memory system design improvements\nthat help cloud workloads' performance.\n  MemProf's code analysis shows that cloud workloads execute the same code\nacross CPU cores. Using this, we propose shared micro-architectural\nstructures--a shared L2 I-TLB and a shared L2 cache. Next, to help with memory\nbandwidth stalls, using workloads' memory bandwidth distribution, we find that\nonly a few pages contribute to most of the system bandwidth. We use this\nfinding to evaluate a new high-bandwidth, small-capacity memory tier and show\nthat it performs 1.46x better than the current baseline configuration. Finally,\nwe look into ways to improve memory latency for cloud workloads. Profiling\nusing MemProf reveals that L2 hardware prefetchers, a common solution to reduce\nmemory latency, have very low coverage and consume a significant amount of\nmemory bandwidth.

For silicon\nimage sensors, image lag will occur when the charges of an event are not fully\ntransferred inside pixels. It can degrade the image quality for optical\nimaging, and deteriorate the energy resolution for X-ray spectroscopy. In this\nwork, the image lag of a sCMOS sensor is studied. To measure the image lag\nunder low-light illumination, we constructed a new method to extract the image\nlag from X-ray photons. The image lag of a customized X-ray sCMOS sensor\nGSENSE1516BSI is measured, and its influence on X-ray performance is evaluated.\nThe result shows that the image lag of this sensor exists only in the\nimmediately subsequent frame and is always less than 0.05% for different\nincident photon energies and under different experimental conditions. The\nresidual charge is smaller than 0.5 e- with the highest incident photon charge\naround 8 ke-. Compared to the readout noise level around 3 e-, the image lag of\nthis sensor is too small to have a significant impact on the imaging quality\nand the energy resolution. The image lag shows a positive correlation with the\nincident photon energy and a negative correlation with the temperature.\nHowever, it has no dependence on the gain setting and the integration time.\nThese relations can be explained qualitatively by the non-ideal potential\nstructure inside the pixels. This method can also be applied to the study of\nimage lag for other kinds of imaging sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 07:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

Therefore, we turn to\nlearn the distribution of real faces, and indirectly identify fake images that\ndeviate from the real face distribution. In this study, we propose Real Face\nFoundation Representation Learning (RFFR), which aims to learn a general\nrepresentation from large-scale real face datasets and detect potential\nartifacts outside the distribution of RFFR. Specifically, we train a model on\nreal face datasets by masked image modeling (MIM), which results in a\ndiscrepancy between input faces and the reconstructed ones when applying the\nmodel on fake samples.

Among the\navailable techniques to measure the DOS, KPFM is exceptional as it enables\nprecise local electronic investigations combined with microscopic imaging.\nHowever, a model to interpret KPFM spectroscopy data on amorphous\nsemiconductors of finite thickness is lacking. To address this issue, we\nprovide an analytical solution to the Poisson's equation for a\nmetal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) junction interacting with the AFM tip.

In this work, we propose an experimental\nprotocol for probing dynamics and equilibrium properties on near-term digital\nquantum computers.

Existing works in this field mainly suffer from two\nweaknesses: (1) They often neglect the multi-label case and only focus on\ntemporal modeling. (2) They ignore the semantic information in class labels and\nonly use the visual information. To solve these problems, we propose a novel\nCo-Occurrence Relation Module (CORM) that explicitly models the co-occurrence\nrelationship between actions. Besides the visual information, it further\nutilizes the semantic embeddings of class labels to model the co-occurrence\nrelationship. The CORM works in a plug-and-play manner and can be easily\nincorporated with the existing sequence models. By considering both visual and\nsemantic co-occurrence, our method achieves high multi-label relationship\nmodeling capacity. Meanwhile, existing datasets in TAL always focus on\nlow-semantic atomic actions. Thus we construct a challenging multi-label\ndataset UCF-Crime-TAL that focuses on high-semantic actions by annotating the\nUCF-Crime dataset at frame level and considering the semantic overlap of\ndifferent events. Extensive experiments on two commonly used TAL datasets,\n\\textit{i.e.}, MultiTHUMOS and TSU, and our newly proposed UCF-Crime-TAL\ndemenstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CORM, which achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on these datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 09:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

Most\nexisting methods directly employ optical flow or deformable convolution to\npredict full-spectrum motion fields, which might incur numerous irrelevant\ncues, such as a nearby person or background. Without further efforts to\nexcavate meaningful motion priors, their results are suboptimal, especially in\ncomplicated spatiotemporal interactions. On the other hand, the temporal\ndifference has the ability to encode representative motion information which\ncan potentially be valuable for pose estimation but has not been fully\nexploited. In this paper, we present a novel multi-frame human pose estimation\nframework, which employs temporal differences across frames to model dynamic\ncontexts and engages mutual information objectively to facilitate useful motion\ninformation disentanglement. To be specific, we design a multi-stage Temporal\nDifference Encoder that performs incremental cascaded learning conditioned on\nmulti-stage feature difference sequences to derive informative motion\nrepresentation. We further propose a Representation Disentanglement module from\nthe mutual information perspective, which can grasp discriminative\ntask-relevant motion signals by explicitly defining useful and noisy\nconstituents of the raw motion features and minimizing their mutual\ninformation.

Here we report new X-ray flux and S_MWO measurements and\nalso include S_MWO measurements from the historical Mount Wilson program. This\nresults in an observational time baseline of over 50 years for the S_MWO data\nand of over 7 years in X-rays. Moreover, we include Ca II infrared triplet\n(IRT) index measurements (S_IRT) from 2013-2022 in our study. With the extended\nX-ray data set, we can now detect the short cycle for the first time using a\nperiodogram analysis. Near-simultaneous S_MWO data and X-ray fluxes, which are\noffset by 20 days at most, are moderately strongly correlated when only the\nlowest activity state (concerning short-term variability) is considered in both\ndiagnostics. In the S_MWO data, we find strong evidence for a much longer cycle\nof about 34 years and an 11-year cycle instead of the formerly proposed\n$12$-year cycle in addition to the known 3-year cycle. The superposition of the\nthree periods naturally explains the recent drop in S_MWO measurements. The two\nshorter cycles are also detected in the S_IRT data, although the activity\ncycles exhibit lower amplitudes in the S_IRT than in the S_MWO data. Finally,\nthe rotation period of $\\epsilon$Eri can be found more frequently in the S_MWO\nas well as in the S_IRT data for times near the minimum of the long cycle. This\nmay be explained by a scenario in which the filling factor for magnetically\nactive regions near cycle maximum is too high to allow for notable short-term\nvariations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 09:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

The magnetoelectric voltage coefficient\n($\\alpha_{ME}$) reaches its maximum of 60.2 Vcm$^{-1}$Oe$^{-1}$ at 300 K, one\nof the highest values reported so far, for a sample with a BiFeO$_3$ thickness\nof 5 nm and a BaTiO$_3$ thickness of 10 nm. To gain deeper insight into the\nincreased magnetoelectric coupling, and both the local and macroscopic magnetic\nproperties, samples with varying BiFeO$_3$ thicknesses have been investigated.\nCorrelations were established between the hyperfine field (HFF), the\nmagnetoelectric voltage coefficient and the magnetization.

Despite their immense importance, rapid decline events of\npollinators are common worldwide in past decades. Excessive use of chemical\npesticides is one of the most important threat to pollination in the current\nera of anthropogenic changes. Pesticides are applied to the plants to increase\ntheir growth by killing harmful pests and pollinators accumulates toxic\npesticides from the interacting plants directly from the nectar and pollen.\nThis has a significant adverse effect on the pollinator growth and the\nmutualism which in turn can cause an abrupt collapse of the community however\npredicting the fate of such community dynamics remains a blur under the\nalarming rise in the dependency of chemical pesticides. We mathematically\nmodeled the influence of pesticides in a multispecies mutualistic community and\nused 105 real plant-pollinator networks sampled worldwide as well as simulated\nnetworks, to assess its detrimental effect on the plant-pollinator mutualistic\nnetworks. Our results indicate that the persistence of the community is\nstrongly influenced by the level of pesticide and catastrophic and irreversible\ncommunity collapse may occur due to pesticide. Furthermore, a species rich,\nhighly nested community with low connectance and modularity has greater\npotential to function under the influence of pesticide. We finally proposed a\nrealistic intervention strategy which involves the management of the pesticide\nlevel of one targeted plant from the community. We show that our intervention\nstrategy can significantly delay the collapse of the community. Overall our\nstudy can be considered as the first attempt to understand the consequences of\nthe chemical pesticide on a plant-pollinator mutualistic community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 10:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

In this\npaper, we design a novel black-box AE attack towards the FCG based malware\ndetection system, called BagAmmo. To mislead its target system, BagAmmo\npurposefully perturbs the FCG feature of malware through inserting\n\"never-executed\" function calls into malware code. The main challenges are\ntwo-fold. First, the malware functionality should not be changed by adversarial\nperturbation. Second, the information of the target system (e.g., the graph\nfeature granularity and the output probabilities) is absent.\n  To preserve malware functionality, BagAmmo employs the try-catch trap to\ninsert function calls to perturb the FCG of malware. Without the knowledge\nabout feature granularity and output probabilities, BagAmmo adopts the\narchitecture of generative adversarial network (GAN), and leverages a\nmulti-population co-evolution algorithm (i.e., Apoem) to generate the desired\nperturbation. Every population in Apoem represents a possible feature\ngranularity, and the real feature granularity can be achieved when Apoem\nconverges.\n  Through extensive experiments on over 44k Android apps and 32 target models,\nwe evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency and resilience of BagAmmo.

In this work, we focus on evaluating how\ndeep learning change detection techniques can unravel temporal population\ndynamics at short intervals. Since Post-Classification Comparison (PCC) methods\nfor change detection are known to propagate the error of the individual maps,\nwe propose an end-to-end population growth mapping method. Specifically, a\nResNet encoder, pretrained on a population mapping task with Sentinel-2 MSI\ndata, was incorporated into a Siamese network. The Siamese network was trained\nat the census level to accurately predict population change. The effectiveness\nof the proposed method is demonstrated in Kigali, Rwanda, for the time period\n2016-2020, using bi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. Compared to PCC, the Siamese\nnetwork greatly reduced errors in population change predictions at the census\nlevel.

In this\npaper, we try to break the above limitations for the first time thanks to the\nrecent development of continuous implicit representation.

Thus, this paper investigates CR in small-world and random\nadaptive networks of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons driven by STDP and HSP. Our\nnumerical study indicates that the degree of CR strongly depends, and in\ndifferent ways, on the adjusting rate parameter $P$, which controls STDP, on\nthe characteristic rewiring frequency parameter $F$, which controls HSP, and on\nthe parameters of the network topology. In particular, we found two robust\nbehaviors: (i) Decreasing $P$ (which enhances the weakening effect of STDP on\nsynaptic weights) and decreasing $F$ (which slows down the swapping rate of\nsynapses between neurons) always leads to higher degrees of CR in small-world\nand random networks, provided that the synaptic time delay parameter $\\tau_c$\nhas some appropriate values. (ii) Increasing the synaptic time delay $\\tau_c$\ninduces multiple CR (MCR) -- the occurrence of multiple peaks in the degree of\ncoherence as $\\tau_c$ changes -- in small-world and random networks, with MCR\nbecoming more pronounced at smaller values of $P$ and $F$. Our results imply\nthat STDP and HSP can jointly play an essential role in enhancing the time\nprecision of firing necessary for optimal information processing and transfer\nin neural systems and could thus have applications in designing networks of\nnoisy artificial neural circuits engineered to use CR to optimize information\nprocessing and transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 11:23:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 17:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

In order to perform our calculations, we adopt a formalism\nthat was recently developed for calculations of the Higgs mass within such\ntheories, and demonstrate that this formalism can also be applied to\ncalculations of gauge couplings. In general, this formalism gives rise to an\n``on-shell'' effective field theory (EFT) description in which the final\nresults are expressed in terms of supertraces over the physical string states,\nand in which these quantities exhibit an EFT-like ``running'' as a function of\nan effective spacetime mass scale. We find, however, that the calculation of\nthe gauge couplings differs in one deep way from that of the Higgs mass: while\nthe latter results depend on purely on-shell supertraces, the former results\nhave a different modular structure which causes them to depend on off-shell\nsupertraces as well. In some regions of parameter space, our results\ndemonstrate how certain expected field-theoretic behaviors can emerge from the\nhighly UV/IR-mixed environment.

However, unlike natural image, the semantic of an audio spectrogram\nis sensitive to positional change, as its vertical and horizontal axes indicate\nthe frequency and temporal information of the audio, instead of naive\nrectangular coordinates. Thus, the insensitivity of CNN to positional change\nplays a negative role on audio spectrogram encoding. To address this issue,\nthis paper proposes a new self-supervised learning mechanism, which enhances\nthe audio representation by first generating adversarial samples\n(\\textit{i.e.}, negative samples), then driving CNN to distinguish the\nembeddings of negative pairs in the latent space.

To this end, we study where to introduce and how to allocate\ntrainable parameters by proposing a novel Sensitivity-aware visual\nParameter-efficient Tuning (SPT) scheme, which adaptively allocates trainable\nparameters to task-specific important positions given a desired tunable\nparameter budget.

The P0-SIVR\napproach is a semiquantum method that describes the zero-phonon atom-surface\nscattering including the contribution of intermediate phonon transitions. The\nmain features introduced by thermal lattice vibrations in the angular\ndistributions of the scattered helium atoms are investigated by considering\nnormal energies in the 0.1 -3 eV range. In all the cases, thermal fluctuations\nintroduce a wide polar spread that transforms the interference maxima into\nelongated strips.

In addition,\nwhen the normal energy increases, not only the relative intensities of\ninterference peaks are affected by the crystal vibrations, but also the\nvisibility of the interference structures, which disappear completely for\nnormal energies approximately equal to or higher than 3 eV.

Particularly, we regularize the geometry smoothness of occluded\nbackground patches. With the improved background surface, the signed distance\nfunction and the reversedly rendered depth of objects can be optimized to bound\nthem within the background range. Extensive experiments show our method\noutperforms other methods on synthetic and real-world indoor scenes and prove\nthe effectiveness of proposed regularizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 13:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

Moreover, a new regularization called the \"step height penalty\" is\nstudied in addition to the standard L1 and L2 regularizations. An extremely\nsimple approach to the proposed ensemble-based model prediction interpretation\nby using the well-known method SHAP is proposed. It is shown that GBM with HRBM\ncan be regarded as a model extending a set of interpretable models for\nexplaining black-box models. Numerical experiments with real datasets\nillustrate the proposed GBM with HRBMs for regression and classification\nproblems. Experiments also illustrate computational efficiency of the proposed\nSHAP modifications. The code of proposed algorithms implementing GBM with HRBM\nis publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 13:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

Simply using\nhigh-resolution low-level feature maps from the early stages of the backbone to\ndirectly refine the low-resolution high-level feature map is a common practice\nof low-resolution feature map upsampling. However, the representation power of\nthe low-level features is generally worse than high-level features, thus\nintroducing ``noise\" to the upsampling refinement. To address this issue, we\nproposed High-level Feature Guided Decoder (HFGD), which uses isolated\nhigh-level features to guide low-level features and upsampling process.\nSpecifically, the guidance is realized through carefully designed stop gradient\noperations and class kernels. Now the class kernels co-evolve only with the\nhigh-level features and are reused in the upsampling head to guide the training\nprocess of the upsampling head. HFGD is very efficient and effective that can\nalso upsample the feature maps to a previously unseen output stride (OS) of 2\nand still obtain accuracy gain. HFGD demonstrates state-of-the-art performance\non several benchmark datasets (e.g. Pascal Context, COCOStuff164k and\nCityscapes) with small FLOPs.

We propose an innovative method to directly optimize the geometrical\ncharacteristics of the range modulator and the treatment plan with respect to\nuser defined constraints, similarly to state-of-the-art IMPT inverse planning.\n  Methods: The kind of range modulators proposed in this study is a voxelized\nobject which can be placed in the CT for dose computation, which simplifies the\nsimulation pipeline. Both the geometrical characteristics of the range\nmodulator and the weights of the PBS spots were directly optimized with respect\nto constraints on the dose using a first-order method. A modified Monte Carlo\ndose engine was used to provide an estimate of the gradient of the relaxed\nconstraints with respect to the elevation values of the range modulator.\n  Results: Assessed on a head and neck case, dose conformity logically appeared\nto be significantly degraded compared to IMPT. We then demonstrated that this\ndegradation came mainly from the use of a large range shifter and therefore\nfrom physical limitations inherent in the passive degradation of beam energy.\nThe geometry of the range modulator, on the other hand, was shown to be very\nclose to being optimal. PBS dose rates were computed and discussed with respect\nto FLASH objectives.\n  Conclusions: The voxelized range modulators optimized with the proposed\nmethod were proven to be optimal on a head and neck case characterized by two\nrather large volumes, with irregular contours and variable depths. The\noptimized geometry differed from conventional ridge filters as it was\narbitrarily set by the optimizer.

Generic polarity markers\nlocated in the cell are transported by actin which they help to polymerize.\nThis leads to a problem whose mathematical novelty is the nonlinear and\nnonlocal destabilizing term in the boundary condition.\n  We provide a detailed study of the qualitative properties of this model,\nnamely local and global existence, convergence and blow-up of solutions. We\nstart with a complete analysis of local existence-uniqueness in Lebesgue\nspaces.

Several works propose to\nprune redundant tokens to achieve efficient ViTs. However, these methods\ngenerally suffer from (i) dramatic accuracy drops, (ii) application difficulty\nin the local vision transformer, and (iii) non-general-purpose networks for\ndownstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic Token ViT (STViT),\nfor efficient global and local vision transformers, which can also be revised\nto serve as backbone for downstream tasks. The semantic tokens represent\ncluster centers, and they are initialized by pooling image tokens in space and\nrecovered by attention, which can adaptively represent global or local semantic\ninformation. Due to the cluster properties, a few semantic tokens can attain\nthe same effect as vast image tokens, for both global and local vision\ntransformers. For instance, only 16 semantic tokens on DeiT-(Tiny,Small,Base)\ncan achieve the same accuracy with more than 100% inference speed improvement\nand nearly 60% FLOPs reduction; on Swin-(Tiny,Small,Base), we can employ 16\nsemantic tokens in each window to further speed it up by around 20% with slight\naccuracy increase. Besides great success in image classification, we also\nextend our method to video recognition. In addition, we design a\nSTViT-R(ecover) network to restore the detailed spatial information based on\nthe STViT, making it work for downstream tasks, which is powerless for previous\ntoken sparsification methods. Experiments demonstrate that our method can\nachieve competitive results compared to the original networks in object\ndetection and instance segmentation, with over 30% FLOPs reduction for\nbackbone.

A prominent advantage is that it does not\nneed LiDAR point clouds during the inference. However, most current methods\nstill rely on 3D point cloud data for labeling the ground truths used in the\ntraining phase. This inconsistency between the training and inference makes it\nhard to utilize the large-scale feedback data and increases the data collection\nexpenses. To bridge this gap, we propose a new weakly supervised monocular 3D\nobjection detection method, which can train the model with only 2D labels\nmarked on images. To be specific, we explore three types of consistency in this\ntask, i.e. the projection, multi-view and direction consistency, and design a\nweakly-supervised architecture based on these consistencies. Moreover, we\npropose a new 2D direction labeling method in this task to guide the model for\naccurate rotation direction prediction.

A key element\nis the ability to locate and segment all the plants from image data. Modern\ninstance segmentation techniques can achieve this, however, training such\nsystems requires large amounts of hand-labelled data which is expensive and\nlaborious to obtain. Weakly supervised training can help to greatly reduce\nlabelling efforts and costs. We propose panoptic one-click segmentation, an\nefficient and accurate offline tool to produce pseudo-labels from click inputs\nwhich reduces labelling effort. Our approach jointly estimates the pixel-wise\nlocation of all N objects in the scene, compared to traditional approaches\nwhich iterate independently through all N objects; this greatly reduces\ntraining time. Using just 10% of the data to train our panoptic one-click\nsegmentation approach yields 68.1% and 68.8% mean object intersection over\nunion (IoU) on challenging sugar beet and corn image data respectively,\nproviding comparable performance to traditional one-click approaches while\nbeing approximately 12 times faster to train. We demonstrate the applicability\nof our system by generating pseudo-labels from clicks on the remaining 90% of\nthe data. These pseudo-labels are then used to train Mask R-CNN, in a\nsemi-supervised manner, improving the absolute performance (of mean foreground\nIoU) by 9.4 and 7.9 points for sugar beet and corn data respectively.

In reinforcement learning, however, recent work has shown that\nmodern deep model-based reinforcement-learning (MBRL) methods adapt poorly to\nsuch changes. An explanation for this mismatch is that MBRL methods are\ntypically designed with sample-efficiency on a single task in mind and the\nrequirements for effective adaptation are substantially higher, both in terms\nof the learned world model and the planning routine. One particularly\nchallenging requirement is that the learned world model has to be sufficiently\naccurate throughout relevant parts of the state-space. This is challenging for\ndeep-learning-based world models due to catastrophic forgetting. And while a\nreplay buffer can mitigate the effects of catastrophic forgetting, the\ntraditional first-in-first-out replay buffer precludes effective adaptation due\nto maintaining stale data. In this work, we show that a conceptually simple\nvariation of this traditional replay buffer is able to overcome this\nlimitation. By removing only samples from the buffer from the local\nneighbourhood of the newly observed samples, deep world models can be built\nthat maintain their accuracy across the state-space, while also being able to\neffectively adapt to changes in the reward function. We demonstrate this by\napplying our replay-buffer variation to a deep version of the classical Dyna\nmethod, as well as to recent methods such as PlaNet and DreamerV2,\ndemonstrating that deep model-based methods can adapt effectively as well to\nlocal changes in the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 15:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

To\nreconstruct the missing local details by well-aligned and properly-exposed\nregions, we exploit the long distance contextual dependency in the\nexposure-space pyramid by the self-attention mechanism. Extensive numerical and\nvisual evaluation has been conducted on a variety of benchmark datasets. The\nexperiments show that our model achieves the accuracy on par with current top\nperforming multi-exposure HDR imaging models, while gaining higher efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 15:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

The higher fidelity in these\ncomputer models makes it computationally intensive to query them hundreds of\ntimes for optimization and one usually relies on a simplified model albeit at\nthe cost of losing predictive accuracy and precision. Towards this, data-driven\nsurrogate modeling methods have shown a lot of promise in emulating the\nbehavior of the expensive computer models.
