This study\ninvestigates the role of speed heterogeneity in the emergence of the most\ncommon patterns (frontal and columnar), following the Self-Organization\nframework. To address whether marching activity intermittency and\ndensity-dependant hopping individual behaviours could underlie the formation of\nsuch patterns, a three-zone Self-Propelled Particles model variant was\nformulated. In this model, individuals alternated between marching and resting\nperiods, and were more likely to hop when crowded. The model successfully\npredicted the emergence of both patterns of interest, with the presence of a\ndensity-dependent hopping probability being a necessary condition. Short to\nabsent pause periods mostly resulted in columnar shapes, similar to the ones\nobserved in the brown locust (Locustana pardalina) and long pause periods\nrather resulted in frontal shapes, such as exhibited by the Australian plague\nlocust (Chortoicetes terminifera). Furthermore, the density profiles of\nsimulated frontal formations displayed the same shape as empirical profiles of\nAustralian plague locust hopper bands. Both simulated and experimental paint\nmarking experiments showed that locusts initially located at different\npositions in the band were find together at its front after a few hours\nmarching; an expected global behavior in hopper bands undergoing activity\nintermittency. These results represent an important first step towards a\ncross-species comparison of locust mass migration patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 16:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

We cast this problem as a game between a coordinator who\noptimizes the transmission and estimation policies jointly and a jammer who\noptimizes its probability of performing an attack. We consider two cases:\npoint-to-point channels and large-scale networks with a countably infinite\nnumber of sensor-receiver pairs. When the jammer proactively attacks the\nchannel, the game is nonconvex from the coordinator's perspective. However,\ndespite the lack of convexity, we construct a saddle point equilibrium solution\nfor any multi-variate Gaussian distribution for the observations. When the\njammer is reactive, we obtain an algorithm based on sequential convex\noptimization, which converges swiftly to first-order Nash-equilibria.\nInterestingly, blocking the channel is often optimal when the jammer is\nreactive, even when it is idle, to create ambiguity at the receiver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 16:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Existing SPMLL methods usually assume unknown\nlabels as negatives, which inevitably introduces false negatives as noisy\nlabels. More seriously, Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss is often used for\ntraining, which is notoriously not robust to noisy labels. To mitigate this\nissue, we customize an objective function for SPMLL by pushing only one pair of\nlabels apart each time to prevent the domination of negative labels, which is\nthe main culprit of fitting noisy labels in SPMLL. To further combat such noisy\nlabels, we explore the high-rankness of label matrix, which can also push apart\ndifferent labels. By directly extending from SPMLL to MLL with full labels, a\nunified loss applicable to both settings is derived. Experiments on real\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed loss not only performs more robustly to\nnoisy labels for SPMLL but also works well for full labels. Besides, we\nempirically discover that high-rankness can mitigate the dramatic performance\ndrop in SPMLL.

In order to realize a universal quantum computer with\ntrapped ions, independent and parallel control over the state of each qubit is\nnecessary. The manipulation of individual qubit states in an ion chain via\nstimulated Raman transitions generally requires light focused on individual\nions. In this manuscript, we present a novel, guided-light individual\naddressing system for hyperfine Ba$^+$ qubits. The system takes advantage of\nlaser-written waveguide technology, enabled by the atomic structure of Ba$^+$,\nallowing the use of visible light to drive Raman transitions. Such waveguides\ndefine the spatial mode of light, suppressing aberrations that would have\notherwise accumulated in a free-space optics set up. As a result, we\ndemonstrate a nearest neighbour relative intensity crosstalk on the order of\n10$^{-4}$, without any active aberration compensation. This is comparable to or\nbetter than other previous demonstrations of individual addressing.

The variability of properties at feature-scale and mesoscale lengths\noriginating from the foam's inherently random microstructure makes predictive\nmodels of their properties challenging. It also hinders the optimization of\ncomponents fabricated with such foams, an especially serious problem for\nspacecraft design where the balance between cost and mass must also be balanced\nagainst the catastrophic results of component failure. To address this problem,\nwe compute the critical transition length between the feature-scale, where\nmechanical properties are determined by individual features, and the mesoscale,\nwhere behavior is determined by ensembles of features. At the mesoscale,\ndistributions of properties -- with respect to both expectation value and\nstandard variability -- are consistent and predictable. The Kentucky Random\nStructure Toolkit (KRaSTk) is applied to determine the transition from\nfeature-scale to mesoscale for computational volumes representing metallic\nfoams at a range of reduced densities. The transition is found to occur when\nthe side length of a cubic sample volume is ~10x greater than the\ncharacteristic length. Comparing KRaSTk-computed converged stiffness\ndistributions with experimental measurements of a commercial metallic foam\nfound excellent agreement for both expectation value and standard variability\nat all reduced densities. Lastly, we observe that the diameter of a\nrepresentative MMOD strike is ~30x shorter than the feature-scale to mesoscale\ntransition for the foam at any reduced density. Therefore, features will\ndetermine response to hypervelocity impacts, rather than bulk (or even\nmesoscale) structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 16:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

The gas-liquid interface is hydrodynamically unstable,\nforming striking finger-like patterns that have been the subject of intense\nfocus. Generally, both the gas and liquid phases are taken to be\nincompressible, with the capillary number being the key parameter that\ndetermines the severity of the instability. Here, we consider a radially\noutward displacement driven by the steady compression of a gas reservoir. The\nassociated gas injection rate is then unsteady due to the compressibility of\nthe gas. We identify a second nondimensional parameter, the compressibility\nnumber, that plays a strong role in the development of the fingering pattern.\nWe use an axisymmetric model to study the impact of compressibility number on\nthe unsteady evolution of injection rate and gas pressure. We use linear\nstability analysis to show that increasing the compressibility number delays\nthe onset of finger development relative to the corresponding incompressible\ncase. Finally, we present and compare a series of experiments and fully\nnonlinear simulations over a broad range of capillary and compressibility\nnumbers. These results show that increasing the compressibility number\nsystematically decreases the severity of the fingering pattern at high\ncapillary number.

In this paper, we depart from this setup and consider an\ninteractive access model, in which the algorithm can query for samples from the\nconditional distributions of the HMMs. We show that interactive access to the\nHMM enables computationally efficient learning algorithms, thereby bypassing\ncryptographic hardness. Specifically, we obtain efficient algorithms for\nlearning HMMs in two settings:\n  (a) An easier setting where we have query access to the exact conditional\nprobabilities. Here our algorithm runs in polynomial time and makes\npolynomially many queries to approximate any HMM in total variation distance.\n  (b) A harder setting where we can only obtain samples from the conditional\ndistributions. Here the performance of the algorithm depends on a new\nparameter, called the fidelity of the HMM. We show that this captures\ncryptographically hard instances and previously known positive results.\n  We also show that these results extend to a broader class of distributions\nwith latent low rank structure.

Using the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development\ncrash database, fatal and injury RwD crashes occurring on rural two-lane (R2L)\nhighways between 2008-2017 were analyzed based on daylight and dark\n(with/without streetlight).

Based on the generated rules, the findings\nreveal several interesting crash patterns in the daylight,\ndark-with-streetlight, and dark-no-streetlight, emphasizing the importance of\ninvestigating RwD crash patterns depending on the lighting conditions. In\ndaylight, fatal RwD crashes are associated with cloudy weather conditions,\ndistracted drivers, standing water on the roadway, no seat belt use, and\nconstruction zones. In dark lighting conditions (with/without streetlight), the\nmajority of the RwD crashes are associated with alcohol/drug involvement, young\ndrivers (15-24 years), driver condition (e.g., inattentive, distracted,\nillness/fatigued/asleep) and colliding with animal (s). The findings reveal how\ncertain driver behavior patterns are connected to RwD crashes, such as a strong\nassociation between alcohol/drug intoxication and no seat belt usage in the\ndark-no-streetlight condition.

The user equipments (UEs) are\ncast as learning agents that need to learn a proper signaling policy to\ncoordinate the transmission of protocol data units (PDUs) to the base station\n(BS) over shared radio resources. In many MARL tasks, the conventional\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) is adopted, where each\nagent receives the same global extrinsic reward from the environment. However,\nthis approach involves a long training time. To overcome this drawback, we\nadopt the concept of learning a per-agent intrinsic reward, in which each agent\nlearns a different intrinsic reward signal based solely on its individual\nbehavior. Moreover, in order to provide an intrinsic reward function that takes\ninto account the long-term training history, we represent it as a long\nshortterm memory (LSTM) network.

And we further find that large gradient variance occurs during\nsupernet training, which degrades the supernet ranking consistency. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose to explicitly minimize the gradient variance of the\nsupernet training by jointly optimizing the sampling distributions of PAth and\nDAta (PA&DA). We theoretically derive the relationship between the gradient\nvariance and the sampling distributions, and reveal that the optimal sampling\nprobability is proportional to the normalized gradient norm of path and\ntraining data.

However, the quality of the established\nchannel crucially depends on the quality of the pre-shared entanglement. In\nthis work, we revisit the problem of using noisy entanglement for the task of\nteleportation. We first show how this problem can be rephrased as a state\ndiscrimination problem. In this picture, a quantitative duality between\nteleportation and dense coding emerges in which every Alice-to-Bob\nteleportation protocol can be repurposed as a Bob-to-Alice dense coding\nprotocol, and the quality of each protocol can be measured by the success\nprobability in the same state discrimination problem. One of our main results\nprovides a complete characterization of the states that offer no advantage in\none-way teleportation protocols over classical states, thereby offering a new\nand intriguing perspective on the long-standing open problem of identifying\nsuch states. This also yields a new proof of the known fact that bound\nentangled states cannot exceed the classical teleportation threshold. Moreover,\nour established duality between teleportation and dense coding can be used to\nshow that the exact same states are unable to provide a non-classical advantage\nfor dense coding as well. We also discuss the duality from a communication\ncapacity point of view, deriving upper and lower bounds on the accessible\ninformation of a dense coding protocol in terms of the fidelity of its\nassociated teleportation protocol. A corollary of this discussion is a simple\nproof of the previously established fact that bound entangled states do not\nprovide any advantage in dense coding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 17:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

One of the well-known challenges in MOT\nis object occlusion when an object becomes unobservant for subsequent frames.\nThe current MOT methods store objects information, like objects' trajectory, in\ninternal memory to recover the objects after occlusions. However, they retain\nshort-term memory to save computational time and avoid slowing down the MOT\nmethod. As a result, they lose track of objects in some occlusion scenarios,\nparticularly long ones.

This task is classically performed through manual scoring provided\nby trained annotators, at a great time expense. While a consistent body of work\nsuggests that natural language processing (NLP) tools can support the automatic\nanalysis of dream reports, proposed methods lacked the ability to reason over a\nreport's full context and required extensive data pre-processing. Furthermore,\nin most cases, these methods were not validated against standard manual scoring\napproaches. In this work, we address these limitations by adopting large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to study and replicate the manual annotation of dream\nreports, using a mixture of off-the-shelf and bespoke approaches, with a focus\non references to reports' emotions. Our results show that the off-the-shelf\nmethod achieves a low performance probably in light of inherent linguistic\ndifferences between reports collected in different (groups of) individuals. On\nthe other hand, the proposed bespoke text classification method achieves a high\nperformance, which is robust against potential biases.

This study\noriginated in classical work of Erd\\H{o}s and R\\'enyi (1960). More recent work\nstudies this question both in building a general theory of sharp versus coarse\ntransitions (Friedgut and Bourgain 1999; Hatami, 2012) and in results on the\nlocation of the transition (Kahn and Kalai, 2007; Talagrand, 2010; Frankston,\nKahn, Narayanan, Park, 2019; Park and Pham, 2022).\n  In inference problems, one often studies the optimal accuracy of inference as\na function of the amount of noise. In a variety of sparse recovery problems, an\n``all-or-nothing (AoN) phenomenon'' has been observed: Informally, as the\namount of noise is gradually increased, at some critical threshold the\ninference problem undergoes a sharp jump from near-perfect recovery to\nnear-zero accuracy (Gamarnik and Zadik, 2017; Reeves, Xu, Zadik, 2021). We can\nregard AoN as the natural inference analogue of the sharp threshold phenomenon\nin random graphs. In contrast with the general theory developed for sharp\nthresholds of random graph properties, the AoN phenomenon has only been studied\nso far in specific inference settings.\n  In this paper we study the general problem of inferring a graph $H=H_n$\nplanted in an Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi random graph, thus naturally connecting the\ntwo lines of research mentioned above. We show that questions of AoN are\nclosely connected to first moment thresholds, and to a generalization of the\nso-called Kahn--Kalai expectation threshold that scans over subgraphs of $H$ of\nedge density at least $q$. In a variety of settings we characterize AoN, by\nshowing that AoN occurs if and only if this ``generalized expectation\nthreshold'' is roughly constant in $q$.

We show that these solutions are stable to khronon\nperturbations in the low acceleration regime, for the cases of spherical,\ncylindrical and planar symmetry. For non-stationary systems in the low\nacceleration regime we show that the khronon field generally gives an order\nunity correction to the modified Newtonian dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 18:46:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 17:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

We\nrun test particle simulations of a stellar halo-like distribution of particles\nin a realistic Milky Way potential with a rotating bar.

Here, we explore whether we can increase the detection rate by using\ndata from ground-based wide-field surveys. Due to crowding and atmospheric\nblurring, progenitor stars can typically not be identified in pre-explosion\nimages alone. Instead, we combine many pre-SN and late-time images to search\nfor the disappearance of the progenitor star. As a proof of concept, we\nimplement our search for ZTF data. For a few hundred images, we achieve\nlimiting magnitudes of about 23 mag in the g and r band.

Here, we review the population synthesis method and then use one\npopulation to explore how different planetary system architectures emerge and\nwhich conditions lead to their formation. The systems can be classified into\nfour main architectures: Class I of near-in situ compositionally ordered\nterrestrial and ice planets, Class II of migrated sub-Neptunes, Class III of\nmixed low-mass and giant planets, broadly similar to the Solar System, and\nClass IV of dynamically active giants without inner low-mass planets. These\nfour classes exhibit distinct typical formation pathways and are characterised\nby certain mass scales. Class I systems form from the local accretion of\nplanetesimals followed by a giant impact phase, and the final planet masses\ncorrespond to the `Goldreich mass'. Class II systems form when planets reach\nthe `equality mass' (equal accretion and migration timescales) before the\ndispersal of the gas disc, but not large enough to allow for rapid gas\naccretion. Giant planets form when the `equality mass' allows for rapid gas\naccretion while the planet are migrating, i.e. when the critical core mass is\nreached. The main discriminant of the four classes is the initial mass of\nsolids in the disc, with contributions from the lifetime and mass of the gas\ndisc. The breakdown into classes allows to better understand which physical\nprocesses are dominant. Comparison with observations reveals certain\ndifferences to the actual population, pointing at limitation of theoretical\nunderstanding. For example, the overrepresentation of synthetic super Earths\nand sub-Neptunes in Class I causes these planets to be found at lower\nmetallicities than in observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

In these\ntheories different regimes are typically studied quite separately, sometimes\neven with the freedom in the theories chosen differently in different regimes.\nIf we wish to properly and fully test complete cosmologies containing MOND\nagainst the $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm then we need to understand cosmological\nstructure formation on all scales, and do so in a coherent and consistent\nmanner. We propose a method for doing so and apply it to generalised\nEinstein-Aether theories as a case study. We derive the equations that govern\ncosmological structure formation on all scales in these theories and show that\nthe same free function (which may contain both Newtonian and MONDian branches)\nappears in the cosmological background, linear perturbations, and non-linear\ncosmological structure formation. We show that MONDian behaviour on galactic\nscales does not necessarily result in MONDian behaviour on cosmological scales,\nand for MONDian behaviour to arise cosmologically, there will be no\nmodification to the Friedmann equations governing the evolution of the\nhomogeneous cosmological background. We comment on how existing N-body\nsimulations relate to complete and consistent generalised Einstein-Aether\ncosmologies. The equations derived in this work allow consistent cosmological\nN-body simulations to be run in these theories whether or not MONDian behaviour\nmanifests on cosmological scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 19:22:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 11:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

Generally, L2O develops a parameterized optimization\nmethod (i.e., ``optimizer\") by learning from solving sample problems. This\ndata-driven procedure yields L2O that can efficiently solve problems similar to\nthose seen in training, that is, drawn from the same ``task distribution\".\nHowever, such learned optimizers often struggle when new test problems come\nwith a substantially deviation from the training task distribution. This paper\ninvestigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an\nL2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an\nout-of-distribution task, in only a few steps.

In this work, we explore multi-modal correlations\nderived from large-scale image-text data to facilitate generalisable VMR. To\naddress the limitations of image-text pre-training models on capturing the\nvideo changes, we propose a generic method, referred to as Visual-Dynamic\nInjection (VDI), to empower the model's understanding of video moments. Whilst\nexisting VMR methods are focusing on building temporal-aware video features,\nbeing aware of the text descriptions about the temporal changes is also\ncritical but originally overlooked in pre-training by matching static images\nwith sentences. Therefore, we extract visual context and spatial dynamic\ninformation from video frames and explicitly enforce their alignments with the\nphrases describing video changes (e.g. verb). By doing so, the potentially\nrelevant visual and motion patterns in videos are encoded in the corresponding\ntext embeddings (injected) so to enable more accurate video-text alignments.

While\nmany model editing techniques are promising, research on the properties of\nedited models is largely limited to evaluation of validation accuracy. The\nrobustness of edited models is an important and yet mostly unexplored topic. In\nthis paper, we employ recently developed techniques from the field of deep\nlearning robustness to investigate both how model editing affects the general\nrobustness of a model, as well as the robustness of the specific behavior\ntargeted by the edit. We find that edits tend to reduce general robustness, but\nthat the degree of degradation depends on the editing algorithm chosen. In\nparticular, robustness is best preserved by more constrained techniques that\nmodify less of the model.

Previous works showed some chemical\nevolution processes: VUV photons slightly alter the aerosols nitrile bands,\nhydrogen atoms tend to hydrogenate their surface and carbon-containing species\nparticipate to the growth of the aerosols. This work investigates the effect of\nthe other plasma species, namely the N2-H2 derived ions, radicals and excited\nstates. Industrial plasmas often use N2-H2 discharges to form ammonia-based\nfertilizers, for metal nitriding, and to erode organic surfaces. Consequently,\nthese are likely to affect Titan's organic aerosols. We therefore developed the\nTHETIS experiment to study the interactions between analogues of Titan's\naerosols (tholins) and the erosive N2-H2 plasma species found in Titan's\nionosphere. Following a first paper on the evolution of the solid phase by\nScanning Electron Microscopy and IR transmission spectroscopy (Chatain et al.,\nIcarus, 2020), this paper focuses on evolution of the gas phase composition, by\nneutral and ion mass spectrometry. Newly formed HCN, NH3-CN and C2N2 are\nextracted from the tholins as well as some other carbon-containing species and\ntheir derived ions. On the other hand, the production of ammonia strongly\ndecreases, probably because the H, NH and N radicals are rather used for the\nproduction of HCN at the surface of tholins. Heterogeneous processes are\nsuggested: chemical processes induced by radicals at the surface would modify\nand weaken the tholin structure, while ion sputtering would desorb small\nmolecules and highly unsaturated ions. The effect of plasma erosion on aerosols\nin Titan's ionosphere could therefore lead to the formation of CN bonds in the\naerosol structure and the production of HCN or R-CN species in the gas phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 20:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

The same point set is\nalso universal for the class of $n$-vertex planar graphs of maximum degree $3$.\nThe point set used for the results is what we call an exploding double chain,\nand we prove that this point set allows planar straight-line embeddings of many\nmore planar graphs, namely of all subgraphs of planar graphs admitting a\none-sided Hamiltonian cycle. The result for bipartite graphs also implies that\nevery $n$-vertex plane graph has a $1$-bend drawing all whose bends and\nvertices are contained in a specific point set of size $4n-6$, this improves a\nbound of $6n-10$ for the same problem by L\\\"offler and T\\'oth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 22:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

However, undersampling the measurements in k-space as well as\nthe over- or under-parameterized and non-transparent nature of DL make these\nmodels exposed to uncertainty. Consequently, uncertainty estimation has become\na major issue in DL MRI reconstruction. To estimate uncertainty, Monte Carlo\n(MC) inference techniques have become a common practice where multiple\nreconstructions are utilized to compute the variance in reconstruction as a\nmeasurement of uncertainty. However, these methods demand high computational\ncosts as they require multiple inferences through the DL model. To this end, we\nintroduce a method to estimate uncertainty during MRI reconstruction using a\npixel classification framework. The proposed method, PixCUE (stands for Pixel\nClassification Uncertainty Estimation) produces the reconstructed image along\nwith an uncertainty map during a single forward pass through the DL model. We\ndemonstrate that this approach generates uncertainty maps that highly correlate\nwith the reconstruction errors with respect to various MR imaging sequences and\nunder numerous adversarial conditions. We also show that the estimated\nuncertainties are correlated to that of the conventional MC method.

Recent experimental observations further\nsuggest that in two-dimensional epithelial tissues these solid-liquid\ntransformations can happen via intermediate states akin to the intermediate\nhexatic phases observed in equilibrium two-dimensional melting. The hexatic\nphase is characterized by quasi-long-range (power-law) orientational order but\nno translational order, thus endowing some structure to an otherwise\nstructureless fluid. While it has been shown that hexatic order in tissue\nmodels can be induced by motility and thermal fluctuations, the role of cell\ndivision and apoptosis (birth and death) has remained poorly understood,\ndespite its fundamental biological role. Here we study the effect of cell\ndivision and apoptosis on global hexatic order within the framework of the\nself-propelled Voronoi model of tissue. Although cell division naively destroys\norder and active motility facilitates deformations, we show that their combined\naction drives a liquid-hexatic-liquid transformation as the motility increases.\nThe hexatic phase is accessed by the delicate balance of dislocation defect\ngeneration from cell division and the active binding of\ndisclination-antidisclination pairs from motility.

Our aim is to find the\nweakest possible conditions that guarantee exponentially fast consensus using a\nLyapunov function consisting of a sum of terms of the same functional form. We\nfirst investigate necessary conditions, starting by examining the system (both\nagent and network) parameters. It is found that controllability of the linear\nagents is necessary for reaching consensus. Then, to work out necessary\nconditions incorporating the network topology, we construct a set of Laplacian\nmatrix-valued functions. The precompactness of this set of functions is shown\nto be a significant generalization of existing assumptions on network topology,\nincluding the common assumption that the edge weights are bounded piecewise\nconstant functions or continuous functions. With the aid of such a\nprecompactness assumption and restricting the Lyapunov function to one\nconsisting of a sum of terms of the same functional form, we prove that a joint\n$(\\delta, T)$-connectivity condition on the network topology is necessary for\nexponential consensus. Finally, we investigate how the above two\n``necessities'' work together to guarantee exponential consensus. To partially\naddress this problem, we define a synchronization index to characterize the\ninterplay between agent parameters and network topology. Based on this notion,\nit is shown that by designing a proper feedback matrix and under the\nprecompactness assumption, exponential consensus can be reached globally and\nuniformly if the joint $(\\delta,T)$-connectivity and controllability conditions\nare satisfied, and the synchronization index is not less than one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 00:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

In\nmice, the Direct Imaging of Neuronal Activity (DIANA) method revealed MRI\nsignals that correlated with intracellular voltage changes, showing high\nspatial and temporal specificity. In this work we attempted DIANA in humans.\nFour visual paradigms were tested, exploring different stimulus types\n(flickering noise patterns, and naturalistic images) and stimulus durations\n(50-200ms). Regions of interest (ROI) were derived from traditional fMRI\nacquisitions and anatomical scans. When using small manually drawn ROI, signals\nwere detected that resembled possible functional activity. However, increasing\nthe stimulus duration did not lead to corroborating signal changes. Moreover,\nthese signals disappeared when averaged over larger functionally or\nanatomically derived ROI. Further analysis of the data highlighted, DIANA's\nsensitivity to inflow effects and subject motion. Therefore, care should be\ntaken not to mistake artifacts for neuronal activity. Although we did not yet\nobserve clear DIANA signals in humans, it is possible that a higher spatial\nresolution is needed to separate signals with opposite signs in different\nlaminar compartments. However, obtaining such data may be particularly\nchallenging because repetitive experiments with short interstimulus intervals\ncan be strenuous for the subjects. To obtain better data, improvements in\nsequence and stimulus designs are needed to maximize the DIANA signal and\nminimize confounds. However, without a clear understanding of DIANA's\nbiophysical underpinnings it is difficult to do so. Therefore, it may be more\neffective to first study DIANA's biophysical underpinnings in a controlled, yet\nbiologically revenant, setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 01:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

However, recent studies showed that attention is often tuned\nto the relative feature of the search target (e.g., redder), so that all items\nthat match the relative features of the target equally attract attention (e.g.,\nall redder items; relational account). Optimal tuning was shown to occur only\nat a later stage of identifying the target.

In this\npaper, we first give computation complexity analysis of existing GNN-LP\nmethods, which reveals that the scalability problem stems from their symmetric\nlearning strategy adopting the same class of GNN models to learn representation\nfor both head and tail nodes. Then we propose a novel method, called asymmetric\nlearning (AML), for GNN-LP. The main idea of AML is to adopt a GNN model for\nlearning head node representation while using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\nmodel for learning tail node representation. Furthermore, AML proposes a\nrow-wise sampling strategy to generate mini-batch for training, which is a\nnecessary component to make the asymmetric learning strategy work for training\nspeedup. To the best of our knowledge, AML is the first GNN-LP method adopting\nan asymmetric learning strategy for node representation learning.

Although discrete RIS is more practical\ngiven hardware limitations, continuous RIS phase-shift optimization has\nattracted significantly more attention than discrete RIS optimization, which\nsuffers from issues like quantization error and scalability. To overcome these\nissues, we develop a comprehensive probabilistic technique to transform\ndiscrete optimization problems into optimization problems of continuous domain\nprobability parameters by interpreting the discrete optimization variable as a\ncategorical random vector and computing expectations with respect to those\nparameters. We rigorously establish that for the unconstrained case, the\noptimal points of the reformulation and the original problem coincide. For the\nconstrained case, we prove that the transformed problem is a relaxation of the\noriginal problem. We apply the proposed technique to two canonical discrete RIS\napplications: SINR maximization and overhead-aware rate and energy efficiency\n(EE) maximization. The reformulation enables both stochastic and analytical\ninterpretations of the original problems, as we demonstrate in our RIS\napplications. The former interpretation yields a stochastic sampling technique,\nwhereas the latter yields an analytical gradient descent (GD) approach that\nemploys closed-form approximations for the expectation. The numerical results\ndemonstrate that the proposed technique is applicable to a variety of discrete\nRIS optimization problems and outperforms other general approaches, such as\nclosest point projection (CPP) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 02:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

However, such enhanced\nmagnetoresistance is not generic and can be nonmonotonic and change its sign\nwith Rashba SOC. For an in-plane rotation of magnetization, it is typically\nnegligibly small for a 2DEG and depends on the perfect transmission which\nemerges from a spin-parity-time symmetry of the scattering states, while this\nsymmetry is generally absent from the Hamiltonian of the system.

Despite the effectiveness, APR techniques\nstill face an overfitting problem: a generated patch can be incorrect although\nit passes all tests. It is time-consuming to manually evaluate the correctness\nof generated patches that can pass all tests. To address this problem, many\napproaches have been proposed to automatically assess the correctness of\npatches generated by APR techniques. However, existing approaches require a\nlarge set of manually labeled patches as the training data. To mitigate the\nissue, in this study, we propose PatchZero, the patch correctness assessment by\nadopting large pre-trained models. Specifically, for patches generated by a new\nor unseen APR tool, PatchZero does not need labeled patches of this new or\nunseen APR tool for training (i.e., zero-shot) but directly queries the large\npre-trained model to get predictions on the correctness labels without\ntraining. In this way, PatchZero can reduce the manual labeling effort when\nbuilding a model to automatically assess the correctness of generated patches\nof new APR tools. To provide knowledge regarding the automatic patch\ncorrectness assessment (APCA) task to the large pre-trained models, we also\ndesign an instance-wise demonstration formation strategy by using contrastive\nlearning.

The goal of this\npaper is to characterize and interpret the optimal (i.e., profit-maximizing)\nstrategy of a monopolist liquidity provider, as a function of that LP's beliefs\nabout asset prices and trader behavior.\n  We introduce a general framework for reasoning about AMMs. In this model, the\nmarket maker (i.e., LP) chooses a demand curve that specifies the quantity of a\nrisky asset (such as BTC or ETH) to be held at each dollar price. Traders\narrive sequentially and submit a price bid that can be interpreted as their\nestimate of the risky asset price; the AMM responds to this submitted bid with\nan allocation of the risky asset to the trader, a payment that the trader must\npay, and a revised internal estimate for the true asset price. We define an\nincentive-compatible (IC) AMM as one in which a trader's optimal strategy is to\nsubmit its true estimate of the asset price, and characterize the IC AMMs as\nthose with downward-sloping demand curves and payments defined by a formula\nfamiliar from Myerson's optimal auction theory. We characterize the\nprofit-maximizing IC AMM via a generalization of Myerson's virtual values.

However, it is rarely studied and understood how large\nthis support set should be to recover a successful backdoor. In this work, we\nshow that one can reliably recover the backdoor trigger with as few as a single\nimage. Specifically, we propose the SmoothInv method, which first constructs a\nrobust smoothed version of the backdoored classifier and then performs guided\nimage synthesis towards the target class to reveal the backdoor pattern.\nSmoothInv requires neither an explicit modeling of the backdoor via a mask\nvariable, nor any complex regularization schemes, which has become the standard\npractice in backdoor inversion methods.

However, SM sometimes determines an infeasible\nestimate against movement. We consider that MCL and SM have complemental\nadvantages and disadvantages and propose a fusion method of MCL and SM. Because\nSM is considered as optimization of a measurement model in terms of the\nprobabilistic modeling, we perform measurement model optimization as SM. The\noptimization result is then used to approximate the measurement model\ndistribution and the approximated distribution is used to sample particles. The\nsampled particles are fused with MCL via importance sampling. As a result, the\nadvantages of MCL and SM can be simultaneously utilized while mitigating their\ndisadvantages. Experiments are conducted on the KITTI dataset and other two\nopen datasets. Results show that the presented method can be run on a single\nCPU thread and accurately perform localization even if INS is not available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 03:40:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 06:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

It is well known that, without any monotonicity conditions, mean field\ngames typically contain multiple mean field equilibria and the wellposedness of\ntheir corresponding master equations fails. In this paper, a partial order for\nthe set of probability measure flows is proposed to compare different mean\nfield equilibria.

However, as the nature of\nper-scene optimization is based on the volumetric rendering of color, previous\nneural implicit surface reconstruction methods usually fail in low-textured\nregions, including the floors, walls, etc., which commonly exist for indoor\nscenes. Being aware of the fact that these low-textured regions usually\ncorrespond to planes, without introducing additional ground-truth supervisory\nsignals or making additional assumptions about the room layout, we propose to\nleverage a novel Pseudo Plane-regularized Signed Distance Field (P$^2$SDF) for\nindoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we consider adjacent pixels with\nsimilar colors to be on the same pseudo planes. The plane parameters are then\nestimated on the fly during training by an efficient and effective two-step\nscheme. Then the signed distances of the points on the planes are regularized\nby the estimated plane parameters in the training phase. As the unsupervised\nplane segments are usually noisy and inaccurate, we propose to assign different\nweights to the sampled points on the plane in plane estimation as well as the\nregularization loss. The weights come by fusing the plane segments from\ndifferent views. As the sampled rays in the planar regions are redundant,\nleading to inefficient training, we further propose a keypoint-guided rays\nsampling strategy that attends to the informative textured regions with large\ncolor variations, and the implicit network gets a better reconstruction,\ncompared with the original uniform ray sampling strategy. Experiments show that\nour P$^2$SDF achieves competitive reconstruction performance in Manhattan\nscenes. Further, as we do not introduce any additional room layout assumption,\nour P$^2$SDF generalizes well to the reconstruction of non-Manhattan scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 05:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

Users control image generation by defining a\ncollage: a text prompt paired with an ordered sequence of layers, where each\nlayer is an RGBA image and a corresponding text prompt. We introduce Collage\nDiffusion, a collage-conditional diffusion algorithm that allows users to\ncontrol both the spatial arrangement and visual attributes of objects in the\nscene, and also enables users to edit individual components of generated\nimages. To ensure that different parts of the input text correspond to the\nvarious locations specified in the input collage layers, Collage Diffusion\nmodifies text-image cross-attention with the layers' alpha masks.

However, LPBF incurs stochastic melt pool (MP) spattering, which would\nroughen workpiece in-process surface, thus weakening inter-layer bonding and\ncausing issues like porosity, powder contamination, and recoater intervention.\nUnderstanding the consequential effect of MP spattering on layer surface\nremains difficult due to the lack of process monitoring capability for\nconcurrently tracking MP spatters and characterizing layer surfaces. In this\nwork, using our lab-designed LPBF-specific fringe projection profilometry and\nan off-axis camera, we quantify the correlation between MP spattering and\nin-process layer surface roughness for the first time to reveal the influence\nof MP spatters on process anomaly and part defects. A method of extracting and\nregistering MP spattering metrics is developed by machine learning of the\nin-situ imaging data. Each image is analyzed to obtain the MP center location\nand the spatter count and ejection angle. These MP spatter signatures are\nregistered for each monitored MP across each layer. Regression modeling is used\nto correlate registered MP spatter signature and its processing parameters with\nlayer surface topography measured by the in-situ FPP. We find that the attained\nMP spatter feature profile can help predict the layer surface roughness more\naccurately (> 50% less error), in contrast to the conventional approaches that\nwould only use nominal process setting. This is because the spatter information\ncan reflect key process changes including the deviations in actual laser scan\nparameters and their effects. The results corroborate the importance of spatter\nmonitoring and the distinct influence of spattering on layer surface roughness.\nOur work paves a foundation to thoroughly elucidate and effectively control the\nrole of MP spattering in defect formation during LPBF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 06:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

To illustrate usage and assess FedScore's performance, we built a\nhypothetical global scoring system for mortality prediction within 30 days\nafter a visit to an emergency department using 10 simulated sites divided from\na tertiary hospital in Singapore.

We compared\nthe acquired FedScore model's performance with that of other scoring models\nusing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The FedScore model\nachieved an average area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.763 across all sites,\nwith a standard deviation (SD) of 0.020. We also calculated the average AUC\nvalues and SDs for each local model, and the FedScore model showed promising\naccuracy and stability with a high average AUC value which was closest to the\none of the pooled model and SD which was lower than that of most local models.\nThis study demonstrates that FedScore is a privacy-preserving scoring system\ngenerator with potentially good generalizability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 07:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

They are trained with\nloss functions that are computed considering a batch of scored triples and\ntheir corresponding labels. Traditional approaches consider the label of a\ntriple to be either true or false. However, recent works suggest that all\nnegative triples should not be valued equally. In line with this recent\nassumption, we posit that semantically valid negative triples might be\nhigh-quality negative triples. As such, loss functions should treat them\ndifferently from semantically invalid negative ones. To this aim, we propose\nsemantic-driven versions for the three main loss functions for link prediction.\nIn particular, we treat the scores of negative triples differently by injecting\nbackground knowledge about relation domains and ranges into the loss functions.\nIn an extensive and controlled experimental setting, we show that the proposed\nloss functions systematically provide satisfying results on three public\nbenchmark KGs underpinned with different schemas, which demonstrates both the\ngenerality and superiority of our proposed approach. In fact, the proposed loss\nfunctions do (1) lead to better MRR and Hits@$10$ values, (2) drive KGEMs\ntowards better semantic awareness. This highlights that semantic information\nglobally improves KGEMs, and thus should be incorporated into loss functions.\nDomains and ranges of relations being largely available in schema-defined KGs,\nthis makes our approach both beneficial and widely usable in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 07:25:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 13:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

This task requires directly recovering pixel-alignment\n3D human pose and body shape from monocular images or videos, which is\nchallenging due to its inherent ambiguity. To improve precision, existing\nmethods highly rely on the initialized mean pose and shape as prior estimates\nand parameter regression with an iterative error feedback manner. In addition,\nvideo-based approaches model the overall change over the image-level features\nto temporally enhance the single-frame feature, but fail to capture the\nrotational motion at the joint level, and cannot guarantee local temporal\nconsistency. To address these issues, we propose a novel Transformer-based\nmodel with a design of independent tokens. First, we introduce three types of\ntokens independent of the image feature: \\textit{joint rotation tokens, shape\ntoken, and camera token}. By progressively interacting with image features\nthrough Transformer layers, these tokens learn to encode the prior knowledge of\nhuman 3D joint rotations, body shape, and position information from large-scale\ndata, and are updated to estimate SMPL parameters conditioned on a given image.\nSecond, benefiting from the proposed token-based representation, we further use\na temporal model to focus on capturing the rotational temporal information of\neach joint, which is empirically conducive to preventing large jitters in local\nparts.

In\ncontrast, introducing bugs can be an effortless job, in that even a simple\nmutation can easily break the Program Under Test (PUT). Existing research has\nconsidered these two opposed activities largely separately, either trying to\nautomatically generate realistic patches to help developers, or to find\nrealistic bugs to simulate and prevent future defects. Despite the fundamental\ndifferences between them, however, we hypothesise that they do not\nsyntactically differ from each other when considered simply as code changes. To\nexamine this assumption systematically, we investigate the relationship between\npatches and buggy commits, both generated manually and automatically, using a\nclustering and pattern analysis. A large scale empirical evaluation reveals\nthat up to 70% of patches and faults can be clustered together based on the\nsimilarity between their lexical patterns; further, 44% of the code changes can\nbe abstracted into the identical change patterns. Moreover, we investigate\nwhether code mutation tools can be used as Automated Program Repair (APR)\ntools, and APR tools as code mutation tools. In both cases, the inverted use of\nmutation and APR tools can perform surprisingly well, or even better, when\ncompared to their original, intended uses. For example, 89% of patches found by\nSequenceR, a deep learning based APR tool, can also be found by its inversion,\ni.e., a model trained with faults and not patches. Similarly, real fault\ncoupling study of mutants reveals that TBar, a template based APR tool, can\ngenerate 14% and 3% more fault couplings than traditional mutation tools, PIT\nand Major respectively, when used as a mutation tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 07:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

The recorded latent codes implicitly\ncontain visual information about the environment, which makes the RNR-Map\nvisually descriptive.

In this regard, we propose a novel, secure, and\nlightweight continuous authentication scheme for IoT device authentication.

However,\nthere are aspects of existing approaches which limit their performance. First,\ninformation gained from key-term-level conversations and arm-level\nrecommendations is not appropriately incorporated to speed up learning. Second,\nit is important to ask explorative key-terms to quickly elicit the user's\npotential interests in various domains to accelerate the convergence of user\npreference estimation, which has never been considered in existing works. To\ntackle these issues, we first propose ``ConLinUCB\", a general framework for\nconversational bandits with better information incorporation, combining\narm-level and key-term-level feedback to estimate user preference in one step\nat each time. Based on this framework, we further design two bandit algorithms\nwith explorative key-term selection strategies, ConLinUCB-BS and ConLinUCB-MCR.\nWe prove tighter regret upper bounds of our proposed algorithms. Particularly,\nConLinUCB-BS achieves a regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{dT\\log T})$, better than the\nprevious result $O(d\\sqrt{T}\\log T)$. Extensive experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world data show significant advantages of our algorithms in learning\naccuracy (up to 54\\% improvement) and computational efficiency (up to 72\\%\nimprovement), compared to the classic ConUCB algorithm, showing the potential\nbenefit to recommender systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 08:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

Even though numerous efforts have been devoted to\ndeveloping self-supervised models for time series data, we argue that the\ncurrent methods are not sufficient to learn optimal time series representations\ndue to solely unidirectional encoding over sparse point-wise input units. In\nthis work, we propose TimeMAE, a novel self-supervised paradigm for learning\ntransferrable time series representations based on transformer networks. The\ndistinct characteristics of the TimeMAE lie in processing each time series into\na sequence of non-overlapping sub-series via window-slicing partitioning,\nfollowed by random masking strategies over the semantic units of localized\nsub-series. Such a simple yet effective setting can help us achieve the goal of\nkilling three birds with one stone, i.e., (1) learning enriched contextual\nrepresentations of time series with a bidirectional encoding scheme; (2)\nincreasing the information density of basic semantic units; (3) efficiently\nencoding representations of time series using transformer networks.\nNevertheless, it is a non-trivial to perform reconstructing task over such a\nnovel formulated modeling paradigm. To solve the discrepancy issue incurred by\nnewly injected masked embeddings, we design a decoupled autoencoder\narchitecture, which learns the representations of visible (unmasked) positions\nand masked ones with two different encoder modules, respectively.

First, it proposes a pre-processing\nalgorithm to adapt the high-resolution UAV image as input to the object\ndetector without lowering the resolution. This ensures an excellent detection\naccuracy from high-quality features, particularly the small size of detected\nobjects from UAV images. Second, it introduces an algorithm for recalibrating\nthe vehicle coordinates to ensure that vehicles are uniquely identified and\ntracked across the multiple crops of the same frame.

The typical energy\nresolution of ME at the beginning of the mission is 3 keV at 17.8 keV (Full\nWidth at Half Maximum, FWHM) and the time resolution is 255 us. In this study,\nwe present the in-orbit performance of ME in its first 5 years of operation.\nMethods: The performance of ME was monitored using onboard radioactive sources\nand astronomical X-ray objects. ME carries six 241Am radioactive sources for\nonboard calibration, which can continuously illuminate the calibration pixels.\nThe long-term performance evolution of ME can be quantified using the\nproperties of the accumulated spectra of the calibration pixels. In addition,\nobservations of the Crab Nebula and the pulsar were used to check the long-term\nevolution of the detection efficiency as a function of energy. Conclusion:\nAfter 5 years of operation, 742 cm2 of the Si-PIN pixels were still working\nnormally. The peak positions of 241Am emission lines gradually shifted to the\nhigh energy region, implying a slow increase in ME gain of 1.43%.

In this paper, we calculate the bispectrum of\ncurvature perturbation in such a scenario. We explicitly confirm that\nbispectrum satisfies Maldacena's theorem. At the end of the USR period, the\nbispectrum is generated by bulk interaction and field redefinition. At the end\nof inflation, bispectrum is generated only by bulk interaction.

This type of method only needs to use the\npre-trained off-the-shelf diffusion models, without any finetuning, and can\ndirectly handle various IR tasks. The upper limit of the restoration\nperformance depends on the pre-trained diffusion models, which are in rapid\nevolution. However, current methods only discuss how to deal with fixed-size\nimages, but dealing with images of arbitrary sizes is very important for\npractical applications. This paper focuses on how to use those diffusion-based\nzero-shot IR methods to deal with any size while maintaining the excellent\ncharacteristics of zero-shot. A simple way to solve arbitrary size is to divide\nit into fixed-size patches and solve each patch independently. But this may\nyield significant artifacts since it neither considers the global semantics of\nall patches nor the local information of adjacent patches. Inspired by the\nRange-Null space Decomposition, we propose the Mask-Shift Restoration to\naddress local incoherence and propose the Hierarchical Restoration to alleviate\nout-of-domain issues. Our simple, parameter-free approaches can be used not\nonly for image restoration but also for image generation of unlimited sizes,\nwith the potential to be a general tool for diffusion models.

Treatment planning systems (TPS) are an essential component for\nsimulating and optimizing a radiation therapy treatment before administering it\nto the patient. It ensures that the tumor is well covered and the dose to the\nhealthy tissues is minimized. However, the TPS provided by commercial companies\noften come with a large panel of tools, each implemented in the form of a\nblack-box making it difficult for researchers to use them for implementing and\ntesting new ideas. To address this issue, we have developed an open-source TPS.\nApproach. We have developed an open-source software platform, OpenTPS\n(opentps.org), to generate treatment plans for external beam radiation therapy,\nand in particular for proton therapy. It is designed to be a flexible and\nuser-friendly platform (coded with the freely usable Python language) that can\nbe used by medical physicists, radiation oncologists, and other members of the\nradiation therapy community to create customized treatment plans for\neducational and research purposes. Result. OpenTPS includes a range of tools\nand features that can be used to analyze patient anatomy, simulate the delivery\nof the radiation beam, and optimize the treatment plan to achieve the desired\ndose distribution. It can be used to create treatment plans for a variety of\ncancer types and was designed to be extended to other treatment modalities.\nSignificance. A new open-source treatment planning system has been built for\nresearch in proton therapy. Its flexibility allows an easy integration of new\ntechniques and customization of treatment plans. It is freely available for use\nand is regularly updated and supported by a community of users and developers\nwho contribute to the ongoing development and improvement of the software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 09:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

One of its major challenges is that images acquired from\ndifferent imaging machines have different imaging distributions, making it\ndifficult to focus only on the spatial aspect of the images and ignore\ndifferences in distributions. In this study, we developed a self-supervised\napproach, Indescribable Multi-model Spatial Evaluator (IMSE), to address\nmulti-modal image registration. IMSE creates an accurate multi-modal spatial\nevaluator to measure spatial differences between two images, and then optimizes\nregistration by minimizing the error predicted of the evaluator. To optimize\nIMSE performance, we also proposed a new style enhancement method called\nShuffle Remap which randomizes the image distribution into multiple segments,\nand then randomly disorders and remaps these segments, so that the distribution\nof the original image is changed. Shuffle Remap can help IMSE to predict the\ndifference in spatial location from unseen target distributions. Our results\nshow that IMSE outperformed the existing methods for registration using T1-T2\nand CT-MRI datasets. IMSE also can be easily integrated into the traditional\nregistration process, and can provide a convenient way to evaluate and\nvisualize registration results.

Such systems are characterized by a\nGoldstone excitation branch, terminating in a zero mode whose theoretical\ntreatment within a linearized approach leads to divergencies on finite-size\nsystems, revealing that the assumption of symmetry breaking is ill-defined away\nfrom the thermodynamic limit. In this work we show that, once all its\nnon-linearities are taken into account, the zero mode corresponds exactly to a\nU(1) quantum rotor, related to the Anderson tower of states expected in systems\nshowing symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic limit. The finite-momentum\nmodes, when weakly populated, can be instead safely linearized (namely treated\nwithin spin-wave theory) and effectively decoupled from the zero mode. This\npicture leads to an approximate separation of variables between rotor and\nspin-wave ones, which allows for a correct description of the ground-state and\nlow-energy physics. Most importantly, it offers a quantitative treatment of the\nfinite-size non-equilibrium dynamics -- following a quantum quench -- dominated\nby the zero mode, for which a linearized approach fails. Focusing on the 2$d$\nXX model with power-law decaying interactions, we compare our equilibrium\npredictions with unbiased quantum Monte Carlo results and exact\ndiagonalization; and our non-equilibrium results with time-dependent\nvariational Monte Carlo.

Our result is the first modified fluid theory\nthat can incorporate energy conservation. As an application of this framework,\nwe propose a specific modified fluid model to realize early dark energy\ntriggered by cosmic radiation-matter transition. This model naturally explains\nwhy early dark energy occurs around matter-radiation equality and is useful in\nerasing the Hubble tension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 10:14:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 07:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

Various mechanistic models have been\ndeveloped in an attempt to better understand avian influenza transmission and\nto evaluate the effectiveness of control measures. However, no comprehensive\nreview of the mechanistic approaches used currently exists. To help fill this\ngap, we conducted a systematic review of mechanistic models applied to\nreal-world epidemics to (1) describe the type of models and their\nepidemiological context, (2) synthetise estimated values of AIV transmission\nparameters and (3) review the control strategies most frequently evaluated and\ntheir outcome.

The majority were\npopulation-based models (n = 26), followed by individual-based models (n = 15)\nand a few metapopulation models (n = 4). Estimated values for the transmission\nrate varied substantially according to epidemiological settings, virus subtypes\nand epidemiological units. Other parameters such as the durations of the latent\nand infectious periods were more frequently assumed, limiting the insights\nbrought by mechanistic models on these. Concerning control strategies, many\nmodels evaluated culling (n = 15), while vaccination received less attention (n\n= 7). According to the reviewed articles, optimal control strategies varied\nbetween virus subtypes and local conditions, and also depended on the\nobjective. For instance, vaccination was optimal when the objective was to\nlimit the overall number of culled flocks, while pre-emptive culling was\npreferred for reducing the epidemic size and duration. Earlier implementation\nof interventions consistently improved the efficacy of control strategies,\nhighlighting the need for effective surveillance and epidemic preparedness.\nPotential improvements of mechanistic models include explicitly accounting for\nvarious transmission routes, and distinguishing poultry populations according\nto species and farm type. To provide insights to policy makers in a timely\nmanner, aspects about the evaluation of control strategies that could deserve\nfurther attention include: economic evaluation, combination of strategies\nincluding vaccination, the use of optimization algorithm instead of comparing a\nlimited set of scenarios, and real-time evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 10:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

The GFET-QD\ndevices deliver responsivities of 10${^5}$ - 10${^6}$ V/W in a wavelength range\nfrom 400 to 1800 nm, at up to 100 frames per second. Spectral sensitivity\ncompares well to that obtained using similar GFET-QD photodetectors. The device\nconcept enables gate-tunable suppression or enhancement of the photovoltage,\nwhich may be exploited for electric shutter operation by toggling between the\nsignal capture and shutter states. The devices show good stability at a wide\noperation range and external quantum efficiency of 20% in the short-wavelength\ninfrared range. Furthermore, an integration solution with complementary\nmetal-oxide-semiconductor technology is presented to realize image-sensor-array\nchips and a proof-of-concept image system.

Conventional\nmicroscopes and standard fluorescent emitters fall short in achieving the high\nbrightness required for sub-millisecond monitoring. Plasmonic nanoantennas have\nbeen proposed as a solution, but despite huge fluorescence enhancement have\nbeen obtained with these structures, the brightness generally remains below 1\nmillion photons/s/molecule.

However, it\nbinds the robot to a few trained classes and prevents it from adapting to\nunfamiliar surroundings beyond predefined scenarios. In such scenarios, humans\ncould assist robots amidst the overwhelming number of interaction entities and\nimpart the requisite expertise by acting as teachers. We propose a novel\npipeline that effectively harnesses human gaze and augmented reality in a\nhuman-robot collaboration context to teach a robot novel objects in its\nsurrounding environment. By intertwining gaze (to guide the robot's attention\nto an object of interest) with augmented reality (to convey the respective\nclass information) we enable the robot to quickly acquire a significant amount\nof automatically labeled training data on its own. Training in a transfer\nlearning fashion, we demonstrate the robot's capability to detect recently\nlearned objects and evaluate the influence of different machine learning models\nand learning procedures as well as the amount of training data involved. Our\nmultimodal approach proves to be an efficient and natural way to teach the\nrobot novel objects based on a few instances and allows it to detect classes\nfor which no training dataset is available.

To date, the standard for\nvarietal identification and certification consists of two methods:\nmorphological classification and genetic analysis. The morphological\nclassification consists of the visual pairwise comparison of different organs\nof the olive tree, where the most important organ is considered to be the\nendocarp. In contrast, different methods for genetic classification exist\n(RAPDs, SSR, and SNP). Both classification methods present advantages and\ndisadvantages. Visual morphological classification requires highly specialized\npersonnel and is prone to human error. Genetic identification methods are more\naccurate but incur a high cost and are difficult to implement. This paper\nintroduces OliVaR, a novel approach to olive varietal identification.

Results\nconfirm the viability of the approach, with Teriyaki-based planners being able\nto solve 95.5% of problems in a test data set of 1000 samples, and even\ngenerating plans up to 13.5% shorter on average than the employed traditional\nplanner, depending on the domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 11:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

This design focuses on efficiency in\nterms of performance and computational complexity under the adverse effects of\ntime variation and mobility of sources, the presence of multiuser and multipath\ncomponents, or simply multi-clusters, and the near-far effect. The design is\nalso suitable for hybrid beamforming and frequency-selective channels. In the\nproposed system, channel parameters are estimated in time-domain duplex (TDD)\nuplink mode using a per-cluster approach rather than a joint approach, which\nsignificantly reduces the complexity. Per-cluster estimation is possible thanks\nto the proposed interference-aware statistical beamforming method, namely\nreduced dimensional Generalized Eigenbeamformer (RD-GEB), which undertakes the\ncomputational load of interference mitigation and enables a simpler design for\nthe remaining stages. In addition, the overall design is based on the\nseparation of channel parameters as fast-time and slow-time, leaving only the\ninstantaneous channel estimation and channel matched filtering as fast-time\noperations, which are handled inside cluster-specific reduced dimensional\nsubspaces. Beam tracking and beamformer construction are held in slow-time\nrarely, which reduces the time-averaged complexity. Furthermore, beam tracking\nis performed by leveraging a batch of instantaneous channel estimates, which\nremoves the need for an additional training process. The proposed\nlow-complexity design is shown to outperform the conventional methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 12:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

Here, we perform direct numerical simulations of cylindrically\nconfined rotating convection at high rotation rates and strong turbulent\nforcing. Through comparison with earlier work, we find a fit-parameter-free\nrelation that links the angular drift frequency of the robust wall mode\nobserved far into the turbulent regime with the critical wall mode frequency at\nonset, firmly substantiating the connection between the observed boundary zonal\nflow and the wall modes. Deviations from this relation at stronger turbulent\nforcing suggest early signs of the bulk turbulence starting to hamper the\ndevelopment of the wall mode. Furthermore, by studying the interactive flow\nbetween the robust wall mode and the bulk turbulence, we identify radial jets\npenetrating from the wall mode into the bulk. These jets induce a large scale\nmultipolar vortex structure in the bulk turbulence, dependent on the wavenumber\nof the wall mode. In a narrow cylinder the entire bulk flow is dominated by a\nquadrupolar vortex driven by the radial jets, while in a wider cylinder the\njets are found to have a finite penetration length and the vortices do not\ncover the entire bulk.

Hence, we\npropose ORCHNet, a deep-learning-based approach that maps 3D-LiDAR scans to\nglobal descriptors. Specifically, this work proposes a new global feature\naggregation approach, which fuses multiple aggregation methods into a robust\nglobal descriptor.

The system couples a Cahn-Hilliard type equation with source term\nfor the order parameter with the universal balance law of internal energy. In\nplace of the standard Fourier form, the constitutive law of the heat flux is\nassumed in the form given by the theory developed by Green and Naghdi, which\naccounts for a possible thermal memory of the evolution. This has the\nconsequence that the balance law of internal energy becomes a second-order in\ntime equation for the thermal displacement or freezing index, that is, a\nprimitive with respect to time of the temperature.

In this paper, we study these theorems in\nKohlenbach's higher-order Reverse Mathematics, identifying a considerable\nnumber of equivalent theorems. The latter involve most basic properties of\nsemi-continuous and pointwise discontinuous functions, Blumberg's theorem,\nRiemann integration, and Volterra's early work circa 1881. All the\naforementioned theorems fall (far) outside of the Big Five of Reverse\nMathematics, and we investigate natural restrictions like Baire 1 and\nquasi-continuity that make these theorems provable again in the Big Five (or\nsimilar). Finally, despite the fundamental differences between measure and\ncategory, the proofs of our equivalences turn out to be similar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 13:27:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 10:24:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 10:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

The compressed skyrmions can be annihilated close to\nthe wall and form a conformal crystal with both a size and a density gradient,\nmaking it distinct from conformal crystals observed previously for\nsuperconducting vortices and colloidal particles. For both dc and ac driving,\nthe skyrmions can move transverse to the compression direction due to a\ncombination of density and size gradients. Forces in the compression direction\nare converted by the Magnus force into transverse motion. Under ac driving, the\namount of skyrmion annihilation is reduced and we find a skyrmion Magnus\nratchet pump. We also observe shear banding in which skyrmions near the wall\nmove up to twice as fast as skyrmions further from the wall. When we vary the\nmagnitude of the applied drive, we find a critical current above which the\nskyrmions are completely annihilated during a time scale that depends on the\nmagnitude of the drive. By varying the magnetic parameters, we find that the\ntransverse motion is strongly dependent on the skyrmion size. Smaller skyrmions\nare more rigid, which interferes with the size gradient and destroys the\ntransverse motion.

To this end, we propose a novel graph\ntransformer model named DeepGraph that explicitly employs substructure tokens\nin the encoded representation, and applies local attention on related nodes to\nobtain substructure based attention encoding. Our model enhances the ability of\nthe global attention to focus on substructures and promotes the expressiveness\nof the representations, addressing the limitation of self-attention as the\ngraph transformer deepens. Experiments show that our method unblocks the depth\nlimitation of graph transformers and results in state-of-the-art performance\nacross various graph benchmarks with deeper models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 15:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

This leads to a\nbreakdown of the rotational symmetry of the flat moir\\'e bands down to $C_3$,\nand to ground states in which the time-reversal symmetry is broken for a given\nspin projection. However, this symmetry can be recovered upon exchange of\nspin-up and spin-down electrons, as we illustrate by means of a self-consistent\nmicroscopic Hartree-Fock resolution where the states for the two spin\nprojections acquire opposite sign of the valley polarization. There is then a\nspin-valley locking by which the Fermi lines for the two spin projections are\ndifferent and related by inversion symmetry. This effect represents a large\nrenormalization of the bare spin-orbit coupling of the graphene multilayers,\nlending protection to the superconductivity against in-plane magnetic fields.\nIn the twisted bilayer as well as in trilayer and quadrilayer graphene, the\npairing glue is shown to be given by the nesting between parallel segments of\nthe Fermi lines which arise from the breakdown of symmetry down to $C_3$. This\nleads to a strong Kohn-Luttinger pairing instability, which is relevant until\nthe Fermi line recovers gradually a more isotropic shape towards the bottom of\nthe second valence band, explaining why the superconductivity fades away beyond\nthree-hole doping of the moir\\'e unit cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 15:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

Domain shift is one of these factors\nand is caused by discrepancies in the distributions of the testing and training\ndata. In this paper, we focus on the problem of compact feature clustering in\ndomain generalization to help optimize the embedding space from multi-domain\ndata. We design a domainaware triplet loss for domain generalization to help\nthe model to not only cluster similar semantic features, but also to disperse\nfeatures arising from the domain. Unlike previous methods focusing on\ndistribution alignment, our algorithm is designed to disperse domain\ninformation in the embedding space. The basic idea is motivated based on the\nassumption that embedding features can be clustered based on domain\ninformation, which is mathematically and empirically supported in this paper.\nIn addition, during our exploration of feature clustering in domain\ngeneralization, we note that factors affecting the convergence of metric\nlearning loss in domain generalization are more important than the pre-defined\ndomains.

Therefore, the macro and\nmicroscopic definitions and properties of ideal gas need to be\nreconceptualized.

The brief but intense life of NLU\nresearch in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) is full of ups and downs,\nwith periods of high hopes that the Grail is finally within reach, typically\nfollowed by phases of equally deep despair and disillusion. But never has the\ntrust that we can build {\\guillemotleft}talking machines{\\guillemotright} been\nstronger than the one engendered by the last generation of NLU systems. But is\nit gold all that glitters in AI? do state-of-the-art systems possess something\ncomparable to the human knowledge of language? Are we at the dawn of a new era,\nin which the Grail is finally closer to us? In fact, the latest achievements of\nAI systems have sparkled, or better renewed, an intense scientific debate on\ntheir true language understanding capabilities. Some defend the idea that, yes,\nwe are on the right track, despite the limits that computational models still\nshow. Others are instead radically skeptic and even dismissal: The present\nlimits are not just contingent and temporary problems of NLU systems, but the\nsign of the intrinsic inadequacy of the epistemological and technological\nparadigm grounding them. This paper aims at contributing to such debate by\ncarrying out a critical analysis of the linguistic abilities of the most recent\nNLU systems. I contend that they incorporate important aspects of the way\nlanguage is learnt and processed by humans, but at the same time they lack key\ninterpretive and inferential skills that it is unlikely they can attain unless\nthey are integrated with structured knowledge and the ability to exploit it for\nlanguage use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 08:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

This event has driven the\ncollection and analysis of large, directed social network datasets, but such\ndatasets can resist intuitive understanding. In such large datasets, the\noverwhelming number of nodes and edges present in typical representations\ncreate visual artifacts, such as densely overlapping edges and tightly-packed\nformations of low-degree nodes, which obscure many features of more practical\ninterest. We apply a method, coengagement transformations, to convert such\nnetworks of social data into tractable images. Intuitively, this approach\nallows for parameterized network visualizations that make shared audiences of\nengaged viewers salient to viewers. Using the interpretative capabilities of\nthis method, we perform an extensive case study of the 2020 United States\npresidential election on Twitter, contributing an empirical analysis of\ncoengagement. By creating and contrasting different networks at different\nparameter sets, we define and characterize several structures in this discourse\nnetwork, including bridging accounts, satellite audiences, and followback\ncommunities. We discuss the importance and implications of these empirical\nnetwork features in this context. In addition, we release open-source code for\ncreating coengagement networks from Twitter and other structured interaction\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 23:59:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 14:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

The\npresent study explores the discriminative ability of a deep learning (DL)\nframework to classify levels of ongoing hypovolemia, simulated via novel\ndynamic lower body negative pressure (LBNP) model among healthy volunteers. We\nused a dynamic LBNP protocol as opposed to the traditional model, where LBNP is\napplied in a predictable step-wise, progressively descending manner. This\ndynamic LBNP version assists in circumventing the problem posed in terms of\ntime dependency, as in real-life pre-hospital settings, intravascular blood\nvolume may fluctuate due to volume resuscitation. A supervised DL-based\nframework for ternary classification was realized by segmenting the underlying\nnoninvasive signal and labeling segments with corresponding LBNP target levels.\nThe proposed DL model with two inputs was trained with respective\ntime-frequency representations extracted on waveform segments to classify each\nof them into blood volume loss: Class 1 (mild); Class 2 (moderate); or Class 3\n(severe). At the outset, the latent space derived at the end of the DL model\nvia late fusion among both inputs assists in enhanced classification\nperformance. When evaluated in a 3-fold cross-validation setup with stratified\nsubjects, the experimental findings demonstrated PPG to be a potential\nsurrogate for variations in blood volume with average classification\nperformance, AUROC: 0.8861, AUPRC: 0.8141, $F1$-score:72.16%, Sensitivity:79.06\n%, and Specificity:89.21 %. Our proposed DL algorithm on PPG signal\ndemonstrates the possibility of capturing the complex interplay in\nphysiological responses related to both bleeding and fluid resuscitation using\nthis challenging LBNP setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 12:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

In this paper,\ngiven a target class T of an OWL ontology, with a focus on ontologies with\nreal- and boolean-valued data properties, we address the problem of learning\ngraded fuzzy concept inclusion axioms with the aim of describing enough\nconditions for being an individual classified as instance of the class T. To do\nso, we present PN-OWL that is a two-stage learning algorithm made of a P-stage\nand an N-stage. Roughly, in the P-stage the algorithm tries to cover as many\npositive examples as possible (increase recall), without compromising too much\nprecision, while in the N-stage, the algorithm tries to rule out as many false\npositives, covered by the P-stage, as possible. PN-OWL then aggregates the\nfuzzy inclusion axioms learnt at the P-stage and the N-stage by combining them\nvia aggregation functions to allow for a final decision whether an individual\nis instance of T or not. We also illustrate its effectiveness by means of an\nexperimentation. An interesting feature is that fuzzy datatypes are built\nautomatically, the learnt fuzzy concept inclusions can be represented directly\ninto Fuzzy OWL 2 and, thus, any Fuzzy OWL 2 reasoner can then be used to\nautomatically determine/classify (and to which degree) whether an individual\nbelongs to the target class T or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 09:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

We extend\nour results and find corrections to the relativistic particles using the\nKlein-Gordon, Proca, and Dirac equations. An important finding is that we\nextract a form of generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) from the corrected\nenergy. The form of GUP is shown to depend on the nature of particles; namely,\nfor bosons (spin $0$ and spin $1$) we obtain a quadratic form of GUP, while for\nfermions (spin $1/2$) we obtain a linear form of GUP. The correlation we found\nbetween spin and GUP may offer insights into investigating quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2023 13:48:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Researchers have assumed that the traditional autoscaling\ntechniques, with lightweight virtualisation technology (containers), can be\nused to provide autoscaling features in Fog computing environments, few\nresearchers have built the platform by exploiting the default autoscaling\ntechniques of the containerisation orchestration tools or systems.
