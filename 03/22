At the same time, as model complexity grows, it becomes\nincreasingly more difficult to explain model decisions. Such explanations may\nbe of critical importance for reliable operation of human-machine pairing\nsetups, or for model selection when the \"best\" model among many\nequally-accurate models must be established. Saliency maps represent one\npopular way of explaining model decisions by highlighting image regions models\ndeem important when making a prediction. However, examining salience maps at\nscale is not practical. In this paper, we propose five novel methods of\nleveraging model salience to explain a model behavior at scale. These methods\nask: (a) what is the average entropy for a model's salience maps, (b) how does\nmodel salience change when fed out-of-set samples, (c) how closely does model\nsalience follow geometrical transformations, (d) what is the stability of model\nsalience across independent training runs, and (e) how does model salience\nreact to salience-guided image degradations. To assess the proposed measures on\na concrete and topical problem, we conducted a series of experiments for the\ntask of synthetic face detection with two types of models: those trained\ntraditionally with cross-entropy loss, and those guided by human salience when\ntraining to increase model generalizability. These two types of models are\ncharacterized by different, interpretable properties of their salience maps,\nwhich allows for the evaluation of the correctness of the proposed measures. We\noffer source codes for each measure along with this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 16:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 16:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

As our\nexperiment demonstrates, simulated reference achieves higher performance than\nthe real reference of an image of a defect and anomaly.

In\nthis work we put forth a phenomenological picture of the SDE based on the\ngeneralized Ginzburg-Landau free energy, which includes a Lifshitz invariant as\nthe hallmark of noncentrosymmetric helical phase of the finite-momentum Cooper\npairs. We reveal that such a Lifshitz invariant drives the SDE in\nquasi-two-dimensional systems in an applied magnetic field and cannot be\nremoved by a gauge transformation, due to the inherently inhomogeneous magnetic\nresponse. For a thin film, the SDE scales with the square of its thickness and\nnonlinearly with the strength of the in-plane magnetic field. We derive an\nexplicit formula that relates the SDE at small magnetic fields to the strength\nof Rashba spin-orbit coupling, g-factor, and Fermi energy. For a\nnoncentrosymmetric Josephson junction, we self-consistently obtain generalized\nanharmonic current-phase relation which support the SDE.

The latter is our proposed globalization of a derived\nalgebraic context, itself a generalization of the theory of simplicial\ncommutative rings.\n  One key difference between a geometric context and ordinary derived algebraic\ngeometry is that the coordinate ring of an affine object in the former is not\nnecessarily connective. When constructing generalized blow-ups, this not only\nturns out to be remarkably convenient, but also leads to a wider existence\nresult. Indeed, we show that the derived Rees algebra and the derived blow-up\nexist for any affine morphism of stacks in a given geometric context. However,\nin general the derived Rees algebra will no longer be connective, hence in\ngeneral the derived blow-up will not live in the connective part of the theory.\nUnsurprisingly, this can be solved by restricting the input to closed\nimmersions.

The only such graph known to this\nday is $C_{11}$. As the original problem appears to be too challenging, several\nrelaxations were studied: one may look for graphs with at least $k$ \\v{S}oltes\nvertices; or one may look for $\\alpha$-\\v{S}olt\\'es graphs, i.e. graphs where\nthe ratio between the number of \\v{S}olt\\'es vertices and the order of the\ngraph is at least $\\alpha$.

Event cameras are more sensitive to junction leakage\ncurrent and photocurrent as they output differential signals, losing the\nsmoothing function of the integral imaging process in the RGB camera. The\nlogarithmic conversion further amplifies noise, especially in low-contrast\nconditions. Recently, researchers proposed a series of datasets and evaluation\nmetrics but limitations remain: 1) the existing datasets are small in scale and\ninsufficient in noise diversity, which cannot reflect the authentic working\nenvironments of event cameras; and 2) the existing denoising evaluation metrics\nare mostly referenced evaluation metrics, relying on APS information or manual\nannotation.

We are able to interpret microbial dichotomies as life\nhistory strategies by combining ecology theory with Monod curves, a classical\nlaboratory tool of bacterial physiology. Monod curves relate the specific\ngrowth rate of a microbe with the concentration of a limiting nutrient, and\nprovide quantities that directly correspond to key ecological parameters in\nMcArthur and Wilsons r/K selection theory, Tilmans resource competition and\ncommunity structure theory and Grimes triangle of life strategies. The\nresulting model allows us to reconcile the copiotrophic/oligotrophic and\nfast/slow-growing dichotomies as different subsamples of a life history\nstrategy triangle that also includes r/K strategists. We analyzed some\necological context by considering the known viable carbon sources for\nheterotrophic microbes in the framework of community structure theory.

It performs diarization by first separating the speakers and\nthen applying voice activity detection (VAD) on each separated stream. In this\nwork we conduct an in-depth study of SSGD in the conversational telephone\nspeech (CTS) domain, focusing mainly on low-latency streaming diarization\napplications. We consider three state-of-the-art speech separation (SSep)\nalgorithms and study their performance both in online and offline scenarios,\nconsidering non-causal and causal implementations as well as continuous SSep\n(CSS) windowed inference. We compare different SSGD algorithms on two widely\nused CTS datasets: CALLHOME and Fisher Corpus (Part 1 and 2) and evaluate both\nseparation and diarization performance. To improve performance, a novel, causal\nand computationally efficient leakage removal algorithm is proposed, which\nsignificantly decreases false alarms. We also explore, for the first time,\nfully end-to-end SSGD integration between SSep and VAD modules. Crucially, this\nenables fine-tuning on real-world data for which oracle speakers sources are\nnot available. In particular, our best model achieves 8.8% DER on CALLHOME,\nwhich outperforms the current state-of-the-art end-to-end neural diarization\nmodel, despite being trained on an order of magnitude less data and having\nsignificantly lower latency, i.e., 0.1 vs. 1 seconds. Finally, we also show\nthat the separated signals can be readily used also for automatic speech\nrecognition, reaching performance close to using oracle sources in some\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 16:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Such a separated framework overlooks the link between\nvisual grounding and tracking, which is that the natural language descriptions\nprovide global semantic cues for localizing the target for both two steps.\nBesides, the separated framework can hardly be trained end-to-end. To handle\nthese issues, we propose a joint visual grounding and tracking framework, which\nreformulates grounding and tracking as a unified task: localizing the referred\ntarget based on the given visual-language references. Specifically, we propose\na multi-source relation modeling module to effectively build the relation\nbetween the visual-language references and the test image. In addition, we\ndesign a temporal modeling module to provide a temporal clue with the guidance\nof the global semantic information for our model, which effectively improves\nthe adaptability to the appearance variations of the target. Extensive\nexperimental results on TNL2K, LaSOT, OTB99, and RefCOCOg demonstrate that our\nmethod performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms for both tracking\nand grounding.

Thereby, two scientific goals are of central\ninterest: First, to study the characteristics of the underlying planet\npopulation and distinguish between different planet formation and evolution\ntheories. Second, to find and characterize planets in our immediate Solar\nneighborhood. Both goals heavily rely on the metric used to quantify planet\ndetections and non-detections.\n  Current standards often rely on several explicit or implicit assumptions\nabout the noise. For example, it is often assumed that the residual noise after\ndata post-processing is Gaussian. While being an inseparable part of the\nmetric, these assumptions are rarely verified. This is problematic as any\nviolation of these assumptions can lead to systematic biases. This makes it\nhard, if not impossible, to compare results across datasets or instruments with\ndifferent noise characteristics.\n  We revisit the fundamental question of how to quantify detection limits in\nHCI. We focus our analysis on the error budget resulting from violated\nassumptions. To this end, we propose a new metric based on bootstrapping that\ngeneralizes current standards to non-Gaussian noise. We apply our method to\narchival HCI data from the NACO-VLT instrument and derive detection limits for\ndifferent types of noise. Our analysis shows that current standards tend to\ngive detection limit that are about one magnitude too optimistic in the\nspeckle-dominated regime. That is, HCI surveys may have excluded planets that\ncan still exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 17:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

In the absence of an experimental technique that can\nspatially resolve the current distribution and a nonlinear percolation model\nsuitable to interpret it, one relies on empirical rules and safety factors to\nengineer these materials.

While they have been intensively studied in\nclassification, backdoor attacks on semantic segmentation have been largely\noverlooked. Unlike classification, semantic segmentation aims to classify every\npixel within a given image. In this work, we explore backdoor attacks on\nsegmentation models to misclassify all pixels of a victim class by injecting a\nspecific trigger on non-victim pixels during inferences, which is dubbed\nInfluencer Backdoor Attack (IBA). IBA is expected to maintain the\nclassification accuracy of non-victim pixels and misleads classifications of\nall victim pixels in every single inference. Specifically, we consider two\ntypes of IBA scenarios, i.e., 1) Free-position IBA: the trigger can be\npositioned freely except for pixels of the victim class, and 2) Long-distance\nIBA: the trigger can only be positioned somewhere far from victim pixels, given\nthe possible practical constraint. Based on the context aggregation ability of\nsegmentation models, we propose techniques to improve IBA for the scenarios.\nConcretely, for free-position IBA, we propose a simple, yet effective Nearest\nNeighbor trigger injection strategy for poisoned sample creation. For\nlong-distance IBA, we propose a novel Pixel Random Labeling strategy.

We make the first measurements of the parity-odd CMB\ntrispectrum, focusing on the large-scale ($2<\\ell<510$) temperature\nanisotropies measured by Planck. This is facilitated by new maximum-likelihood\nestimators for binned correlators, which account for mask convolution and\nleakage between even- and odd-parity components, and achieve optimal variances\nwithin $\\approx 20\\%$.

Such communities may turn into incubators for conspiracy theories\n-- some spreading violent messages that could sharpen the debate and\npotentially harm society. To face these phenomena, most social media platforms\nimplemented moderation policies, ranging from posting warning labels up to\ndeplatforming, i.e., permanently banning users. Assessing the effectiveness of\ncontent moderation is crucial for balancing societal safety while preserving\nthe right to free speech. In this paper, we compare the shift in behavior of\nusers affected by the ban of two large communities on Reddit, GreatAwakening\nand FatPeopleHate, which were dedicated to spreading the QAnon conspiracy and\nbody-shaming individuals, respectively. Following the ban, both communities\npartially migrated to Voat, an unmoderated Reddit clone. We estimate how many\nusers migrate, finding that users in the conspiracy community are much more\nlikely to leave Reddit altogether and join Voat. Then, we quantify the\nbehavioral shift within Reddit and across Reddit and Voat by matching common\nusers. Few migrating zealots drive the growth of the new GreatAwakening\ncommunity on Voat, while this effect is absent for FatPeopleHate. Finally,\nconspiracy users migrating from Reddit tend to recreate their previous social\nnetwork on Voat. Our findings suggest that banning conspiracy communities\nhosting violent content should be carefully designed, as these communities may\nbe more resilient to deplatforming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 18:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

We\nshow how the problem can be transformed into a system of coupled Schr\\\"odinger\nequations, that we solve numerically. The novel numerical results are used to\nestimate the accuracy of several widely used approximations. We check the error\nintroduced while going from finite $N_c$ (i.e. $N_c =3$) to the large-$N_c$\nlimit, which we find to be small. For unbalanced splittings, e.g. when $z\\to\n0$, only one of the partons is affected by transverse momentum exchanges with\nthe medium. The emission process then separates into a term responsible for the\n$1 \\to 2$ splitting and the subsequent independent broadening of the daughter\npartons. This is also referred to as the factorizable term. For finite $z$,\nfurther contributions arise that are responsible for the coherent color\ndynamics of the two-parton system, and these are referred to as\nnon-factorizable terms. These were argued to be small for soft (unbalanced)\nsplittings and for large media. In this work we therefore determine the\naccuracy of keeping only the factorizable term of the large-$N_c$ solution. We\nfind that the error is insignificant at a small splitting fraction $z \\sim 0$,\nbut can be sizable in a more balanced splitting with $z\\sim 0.5$. Finally, we\nalso examine the eikonal approximation, which amounts to approximating the\npartons' paths through the medium as straight lines.

We find that the\nintroduction of Rashba spin-orbit coupling significantly alters the ground\nstate properties of the Hubbard model and we observe an increasing complexity\nof the ground state phase composition for increasing spin-orbit strength.

However, most of these works\nrequire additional captions or images for training, which is not feasible in\nthe context of zero-shot detection. In contrast, the distillation-based method\nis an extra-data-free method, but it has its limitations. Specifically,\nexisting work creates distillation regions that are biased to the base\ncategories, which limits the distillation of novel category information and\nharms the distillation efficiency. Furthermore, directly using the raw feature\nfrom CLIP for distillation neglects the domain gap between the training data of\nCLIP and the detection datasets, which makes it difficult to learn the mapping\nfrom the image region to the vision-language feature space - an essential\ncomponent for detecting unseen objects. As a result, existing\ndistillation-based methods require an excessively long training schedule. To\nsolve these problems, we propose Efficient feature distillation for Zero-Shot\nDetection (EZSD). Firstly, EZSD adapts the CLIP's feature space to the target\ndetection domain by re-normalizing CLIP to bridge the domain gap; Secondly,\nEZSD uses CLIP to generate distillation proposals with potential novel\ninstances, to avoid the distillation being overly biased to the base\ncategories.

We study here the interplay between the\nspin exchange and motional dynamics in the simple case of two interacting\ncircular Rydberg atoms confined in harmonic traps. The time evolution is solved\nexactly when the position dependence of the dipole-dipole interaction terms can\nbe linearized over the extension of the atomic motion. We present numerical\nsimulations in more complex cases, using the realistic parameters of the\nsimulator proposal. We discuss three applications. First, we show that\nrealistic experimental parameters lead to a regime in which atomic and spin\ndynamics become fully entangled, generating interesting non-classical motional\nstates. We also show that, in other parameter regions, the spin dynamics\nnotably depends on the initial temperature of the atoms in the trap, providing\na sensitive motional thermometry method. Last, and most importantly, we discuss\nthe range of parameters in which the motion has negligible influence over the\nspin dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 19:16:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 08:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

First, data is extracted from the Fatality Analysis\nReporting System (FARS) for two types of rear-end crashes from 2017 to 2019,\nincluding passenger cars as rear-end and rear-ended vehicles. Significant\ninjury severity difference between front- and rear-car occupant groups is found\nby conducting likelihood ratio test.

From the modeling, the\nsignificant factors are occupant positions, driver age, overturn, vehicle type,\netc. For instance, the driving and front-right positions significantly increase\nthe probability of severe injury when struck by another vehicle. Large\ntruck-strike-car tends to cause severe outcomes compared to car-strike-large\ntruck.

We empirically determined the terminal wind speed for\na sample of 149 OB stars in the Magellanic Clouds either by directly measuring\nthe maximum velocity shift of the absorption component of the Civ 1548-1550\nline profile, or by fitting synthetic spectra produced using the Sobolev with\nexact integration method.

To investigate the effect of nanoconfinement on water\ncompressibility, we performed water sorption experiments on two nanoporous\nglass samples while concomitantly measuring the speed of longitudinal and shear\nultrasonic waves in these samples. These measurements yield the longitudinal\nand shear moduli of the water laden nanoporous glass as a function of relative\nhumidity that we utilized in the Gassmann theory to infer the bulk modulus of\nthe confined water. This analysis shows that the bulk modulus (inverse of\ncompressibility) of confined water is noticeably higher than that of the bulk\nwater at the same temperature. Moreover, the modulus exhibits a linear\ndependence on the Laplace pressure. The results for water, which is a polar\nfluid, agree with previous experimental and numerical data reported for\nnon-polar fluids. This similarity suggests that irrespective of intermolecular\nforces, confined fluids are stiffer than bulk fluids. Accounting for fluid\nstiffening in nanopores may be important for accurate interpretation of wave\npropagation measurements in fluid-filled nanoporous media, including in\npetrophysics, catalysis, and other applications, such as in porous materials\ncharacterization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 20:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

We study the problem of\noptimizing personalized interventions for patients to maximize some long-term\noutcome, in a setting where interventions are costly and capacity-constrained.\n  Methodology/results: This paper provides a model-free approach to solving\nthis problem. We find that generic model-free approaches from the reinforcement\nlearning literature are too data intensive for healthcare applications, while\nsimpler bandit approaches make progress at the expense of ignoring long-term\npatient dynamics. We present a new algorithm we dub DecompPI that approximates\none step of policy iteration.

An overarching challenge in\ninverse problems is that there are many undesired images that fit to the\nobserved measurements, thus requiring image priors to constrain the space of\npossible solutions to more plausible reconstructions. However, in many\napplications it is difficult or potentially impossible to obtain ground-truth\nimages to learn an image prior. Thus, inaccurate priors are often used, which\ninevitably result in biased solutions. Rather than solving an inverse problem\nusing priors that encode the explicit structure of any one image, we propose to\nsolve a set of inverse problems jointly by incorporating prior constraints on\nthe collective structure of the underlying images.The key assumption of our\nwork is that the ground-truth images we aim to reconstruct share common,\nlow-dimensional structure. We show that such a set of inverse problems can be\nsolved simultaneously by learning a shared image generator with a\nlow-dimensional latent space. The parameters of the generator and latent\nembedding are learned by maximizing a proxy for the Evidence Lower Bound\n(ELBO). Once learned, the generator and latent embeddings can be combined to\nprovide reconstructions for each inverse problem. The framework we propose can\nhandle general forward model corruptions, and we show that measurements derived\nfrom only a few ground-truth images (O(10)) are sufficient for image\nreconstruction without explicit priors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 22:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

Much attention has been paid to large networks and\nlong-term memory, for example in models of associative memory. Smaller circuit\nmotifs may play an important complementary role on shorter time scales, where\nbroader network effects may be of less relevance. Yet, compact computational\nmodels of spiking neural networks that exhibit short-term volatile memory and\nactively hold information until their energy source is switched off, seem not\nfully understood. Here we propose that small spiking neural circuit motifs may\nact as volatile memory components. A minimal motif consists of only two\ninterconnected neurons -- one self-connected excitatory neuron and one\ninhibitory neuron -- and realizes a single-bit volatile memory. An excitatory,\ndelayed self-connection promotes a bistable circuit in which a self-sustained\nperiodic orbit generating spike trains co-exists with the quiescent state of no\nneuron spiking. Transient external inputs may straightforwardly induce\nswitching between those states. Moreover, the inhibitory neuron may act as an\nautonomous turn-off switch. It integrates incoming excitatory pulses until a\nthreshold is reached after which the inhibitory neuron emits a spike that then\ninhibits further spikes in the excitatory neuron, terminating the memory. Our\nresults show how external bits of information (excitatory signal), can be\nactively held in memory for a pre-defined amount of time. We show that such\nmemory operations are robust against parameter variations and exemplify how\nsequences of multidimensional input signals may control the dynamics of a\nmany-bits memory circuit in a desired way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 22:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

The outflowing plasma along the open magnetic\nfield line region of pulsars is generated due to spark discharges in an inner\nacceleration region (IAR) above the polar cap. The IAR has been modelled as a\npartially screened gap (PSG) with a steady supply of positively charged ions\nemitted from the heated polar cap surface dominated by strong non-dipolar\nmagnetic fields. In a PSG the sparks are tightly packed and constrained to be\npresent along the polar cap boundary. The sparks lag behind the rotation of the\nstar during their lifetimes. As a result the sparking pattern evolves along two\ndifferent directions in the clockwise and counter-clockwise manner around a\nstationary central spark, and can be associated with the observed phenomenon of\nsubpulse drifting.

End user\ndevices often contain a wealth of data and this information is sensitive and\nshould not be shared with servers or enterprises. As a result, federated\nlearning was introduced to enable machine learning over large decentralized\ndatasets while promising privacy by eliminating the need for data sharing.\nHowever, prior work has shown that shared gradients often contain private\ninformation and attackers can gain knowledge either through malicious\nmodification of the architecture and parameters or by using optimization to\napproximate user data from the shared gradients. Despite this, most attacks\nhave so far been limited in scale of number of clients, especially failing when\nclient gradients are aggregated together using secure model aggregation. The\nattacks that still function are strongly limited in the number of clients\nattacked, amount of training samples they leak, or number of iterations they\ntake to be trained. In this work, we introduce MANDRAKE, an attack that\novercomes previous limitations to directly leak large amounts of client data\neven under secure aggregation across large numbers of clients. Furthermore, we\nbreak the anonymity of aggregation as the leaked data is identifiable and\ndirectly tied back to the clients they come from. We show that by sending\nclients customized convolutional parameters, the weight gradients of data\npoints between clients will remain separate through aggregation. With an\naggregation across many clients, prior work could only leak less than 1% of\nimages. With the same number of non-zero parameters, and using only a single\ntraining iteration, MANDRAKE leaks 70-80% of data samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 23:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

However, it is more challenging than node-level\nand graph-level forecasting tasks, as it requires extracting the anomaly\nsubgraph or sub-time-series from dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose\nDG-Trans, a novel traffic incident impact prediction framework, to foresee the\nimpact of traffic incidents through dynamic graph learning. The proposed\nframework contains a dual-level spatial transformer and an\nimportance-score-based temporal transformer, and the performance of this\nframework is justified by two newly constructed benchmark datasets. The\ndual-level spatial transformer removes unnecessary edges between nodes to\nisolate the affected subgraph from the other nodes. Meanwhile, the\nimportance-score-based temporal transformer identifies abnormal changes in node\nfeatures, causing the predictions to rely more on measurement changes after the\nincident occurs. Therefore, DG-Trans is equipped with dual abilities that\nextract spatiotemporal dependency and identify anomaly nodes affected by\nincidents while removing noise introduced by benign nodes. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets verify that DG-Trans outperforms the\nexisting state-of-the-art methods, especially in extracting spatiotemporal\ndependency patterns and predicting traffic accident impacts.

In this paper, we inject two fundamental changes, namely conformal\nkeypoint detection and geometric uncertainty propagation, into the two-stage\nparadigm and propose the first pose estimator that endows an estimation with\nprovable and computable worst-case error bounds. On one hand, conformal\nkeypoint detection applies the statistical machinery of inductive conformal\nprediction to convert heuristic keypoint detections into circular or elliptical\nprediction sets that cover the groundtruth keypoints with a user-specified\nmarginal probability (e.g., 90%). Geometric uncertainty propagation, on the\nother, propagates the geometric constraints on the keypoints to the 6D object\npose, leading to a Pose UnceRtainty SEt (PURSE) that guarantees coverage of the\ngroundtruth pose with the same probability.

Fexprs, as reformulated by John Shutt, provide a\nfirst-class and more powerful alternative to macros that meshes well with pure\nfunctional programming. Unfortunately, naive execution of fexprs is much slower\nthan macros due to re-executing unoptimized operative combiner code at runtime\nthat, in a macro-based language, would have been expanded and then optimized at\ncompile time.

Experimental specimens in the life sciences are subject\nto individual variability and deformation, and therefore require autonomous\nrobotic control. As an example, we are studying the installation of a cranial\nwindow in a mouse. This operation requires the removal of the skull, which is\napproximately 300 um thick, to cut it into a circular shape 8 mm in diameter,\nbut the shape of the mouse skull varies depending on the strain of mouse, sex\nand week of age. The thickness of the skull is not uniform, with some areas\nbeing thin and others thicker. It is also difficult to ensure that the skulls\nof the mice are kept in the same position for each operation. It is not\nrealistically possible to measure all these features and pre-program a robotic\ntrajectory for individual mice. The paper therefore proposes an autonomous\nrobotic drilling method. The proposed method consists of drilling trajectory\nplanning and image-based task completion level recognition. The trajectory\nplanning adjusts the z-position of the drill according to the task completion\nlevel at each discrete point, and forms the 3D drilling path via constrained\ncubic spline interpolation while avoiding overshoot.

Additionally,\nincorporating these outliers introduces additional training burdens. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel paradigm called test-time OOD detection, which\nutilizes unlabeled online data directly at test time to improve OOD detection\nperformance. While this paradigm is efficient, it also presents challenges such\nas catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose adaptive\noutlier optimization (AUTO), which consists of an in-out-aware filter, an ID\nmemory bank, and a semantically-consistent objective. AUTO adaptively mines\npseudo-ID and pseudo-OOD samples from test data, utilizing them to optimize\nnetworks in real time during inference.

Most methods proposed in\nrecent years are deep learning-based due to their strength in encoding complex\ninteractions. However, unplausible predictions are often generated since they\nrely heavily on past observations and cannot effectively capture the transient\nand contingency interactions from sparse samples. In this paper, we propose a\nhierarchical hybrid framework of deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning\n(RL) for multi-agent trajectory prediction, to cope with the challenge of\npredicting motions shaped by multi-scale interactions. In the DL stage, the\ntraffic scene is divided into multiple intermediate-scale heterogenous graphs\nbased on which Transformer-style GNNs are adopted to encode heterogenous\ninteractions at intermediate and global levels. In the RL stage, we divide the\ntraffic scene into local sub-scenes utilizing the key future points predicted\nin the DL stage. To emulate the motion planning procedure so as to produce\ntrajectory predictions, a Transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\nincorporated with a vehicle kinematics model is devised to plan motions under\nthe dominant influence of microscopic interactions. A multi-objective reward is\ndesigned to balance between agent-centric accuracy and scene-wise\ncompatibility. Experimental results show that our proposal matches the\nstate-of-the-arts on the Argoverse forecasting benchmark.

Our method combines predictive and\nprescriptive machine learning models to forecast short-term wind speed and\ndirection and recommend operational decisions to reduce or pause the industrial\nplant's production. We exhibit several trade-offs between reducing\nenvironmental impact and maintaining production activities. The predictive\ncomponent of our framework employs various machine learning models, such as\ngradient-boosted tree-based models and ensemble methods, for time series\nforecasting. The prescriptive component utilizes interpretable optimal policy\ntrees to propose multiple trade-offs, such as reducing dangerous emissions by\n33-47% and unnecessary costs by 40-63%. Our deployed models significantly\nreduced forecasting errors, with a range of 38-52% for less than 12-hour lead\ntime and 14-46% for 12 to 48-hour lead time compared to official weather\nforecasts. We have successfully implemented the predictive component at the OCP\nSafi site, which is Morocco's largest chemical industrial plant, and are\ncurrently in the process of deploying the prescriptive component.

While existing works have focused on designing advanced semantic\ncommunication architectures and efficient semantic codecs, challenges such as\nexplainable and efficient semantic representation methods, and knowledge-based\nsemantic compression algorithms have yet to be explored. These challenges have\nhindered the widespread adoption of semantic communication. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel Semantic Communication system based on\nSemantic Triplets (SCST), in which semantics are represented through\nexplainable semantic triplets. A novel semantic extraction method is proposed\nto convert transmitted text into semantic triplets, where syntactic dependency\nanalysis is introduced to improve semantic completeness. Furthermore, a\nsemantic filtering method is designed to compress duplicate and task-irrelevant\nsemantic triplets, making use of prior knowledge from the knowledge base. The\nfiltered semantic triplets are then encoded and transmitted wirelessly to\ncomplete intelligent tasks at the receiver. To verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed SCST, it is applied to sentiment analysis and question-answering\ntasks, with semantic encoders and decoders designed for each task. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed SCST achieves at least 43.5% and 52% accuracy\ngains, respectively, compared to traditional communication method. These\nresults demonstrate that the proposed SCST can significantly improve semantic\ncommunication performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 03:27:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

A fundamental question is whether there exist algorithms that,\nwhen adopted by all agents and run independently in a decentralized fashion,\nlead to no-regret for each player, analogous to celebrated convergence results\nin normal-form games. While recent work has shown that such algorithms exist\nfor restricted settings (notably, when regret is defined with respect to\ndeviations to Markovian policies), the question of whether independent\nno-regret learning can be achieved in the standard Markov game framework was\nopen. We provide a decisive negative resolution this problem, both from a\ncomputational and statistical perspective. We show that:\n  - Under the widely-believed assumption that PPAD-hard problems cannot be\nsolved in polynomial time, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that attains\nno-regret in general-sum Markov games when executed independently by all\nplayers, even when the game is known to the algorithm designer and the number\nof players is a small constant.\n  - When the game is unknown, no algorithm, regardless of computational\nefficiency, can achieve no-regret without observing a number of episodes that\nis exponential in the number of players.\n  Perhaps surprisingly, our lower bounds hold even for seemingly easier setting\nin which all agents are controlled by a a centralized algorithm. They are\nproven via lower bounds for a simpler problem we refer to as SparseCCE, in\nwhich the goal is to compute a coarse correlated equilibrium that is sparse in\nthe sense that it can be represented as a mixture of a small number of product\npolicies.

Theories like\ncoupled cluster and their derivatives provide highly accurate approximations to\nthe energy landscape at a reasonable computational cost. Analogs of such\nmethods to study thermal properties, though highly desirable, have been lacking\nbecause evaluating thermal properties involve a trace over the entire Hilbert\nspace, which is a formidable task. Besides, excited-state theories are\ngenerally not as well studied as ground-state ones. In this mini-review, we\npresent an overview of a finite-temperature wave function formalism based on\nthermofield dynamics to overcome these difficulties. Thermofield dynamics\nallows us to map the equilibrium thermal density matrix to a pure state, i.e.,\na single wave function, albeit in an expanded Hilbert space. Ensemble averages\nbecome expectation values over this so-called thermal state. Around this\nthermal state, we have developed a procedure to generalize ground-state wave\nfunction theories to finite temperatures. As explicit examples, we highlight\nformulations of mean-field, configuration interaction, and coupled cluster\ntheories for thermal properties of fermions in the grand-canonical ensemble.

In addition, a subset of vertices in A U B are marked as\ncritical and the goal is to output a matching that matches as many critical\nvertices as possible. Such matchings are called critical matchings in the\nliterature and in our setting, we seek to compute a matching that is critical\nas well as optimal with respect to the preferences of the vertices.\n  Stability, which is a well-accepted notion of optimality in the presence of\ntwo-sided preferences, is generalized to weak-stability in the presence of\nties.

Recent ISAC studies have focused on upper millimeter-wave\nand low terahertz bands to exploit ultrawide bandwidths. At these frequencies,\nhybrid beamformers that employ fewer radio-frequency chains are employed to\noffset expensive hardware but at the cost of lower multiplexing gains.

While previous\nstudies have established a variety of simulators for their own tasks, it lacks\na fair and public platform for comparing the models or algorithms proposed by\ndifferent researchers. In addition, the existing simulators still face many\nchallenges, ranging from their closeness to real environments of ride-sourcing\nsystems, to the completeness of different tasks they can implement. To address\nthe challenges, we propose a novel multi-functional and open-sourced simulation\nplatform for ride-sourcing systems, which can simulate the behaviors and\nmovements of various agents on a real transportation network. It provides a few\naccessible portals for users to train and test various optimization algorithms,\nespecially reinforcement learning algorithms, for a variety of tasks, including\non-demand matching, idle vehicle repositioning, and dynamic pricing. In\naddition, it can be used to test how well the theoretical models approximate\nthe simulated outcomes. Evaluated on real-world data based experiments, the\nsimulator is demonstrated to be an efficient and effective test bed for various\ntasks related to on-demand ride service operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 06:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

Recently,\ndeep learning based methods have become the mainstream HAD methods, due to\ntheir powerful spatial-spectral feature extraction ability. However, the\ncurrent deep detection models are optimized to complete a proxy task (two-step\nparadigm), such as background reconstruction or generation, rather than\nachieving anomaly detection directly. This leads to suboptimal results and poor\ntransferability, which means that the deep model is trained and tested on the\nsame image. In this paper, an unsupervised transferred direct detection (TDD)\nmodel is proposed, which is optimized directly for the anomaly detection task\n(one-step paradigm) and has transferability. Specially, the TDD model is\noptimized to identify the spectral deviation relationship according to the\nanomaly definition. Compared to learning the specific background distribution\nas most models do, the spectral deviation relationship is universal for\ndifferent images and guarantees the model transferability. To train the TDD\nmodel in an unsupervised manner, an anomaly sample simulation strategy is\nproposed to generate numerous pairs of anomaly samples. Furthermore, a global\nself-attention module and a local self-attention module are designed to help\nthe model focus on the \"spectrally deviating\" relationship. The TDD model was\nvalidated on four public HAD datasets. The results show that the proposed TDD\nmodel can successfully overcome the limitation of traditional model training\nand testing on a single image, and the model has a powerful detection ability\nand excellent transferability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 06:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

To\ninvestigate the OPL's security boundary in quantum cryptography, we\ncomprehensively test and analyse the behavior of OPL under continuous-wave\n(c.w.) light-injection attacks and pulse illumination attacks with pulses'\nrepetition rate at 0.5-Hz,40-MHz, and 1-GHz. The testing results illuminate the\nsecurity boundary of the OPL, which allows one to properly employ the OPL in\nthe use cases. The methodology of testing and analysis proposed here is\napplicable to other power-limitation components in a QKD system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 07:46:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 12:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

For the\nfirst function, mathematically, the model is composed of a discrete Boltzmann\nequation coupled by a magnetic induction equation. Physically, the model is\nequivalent to a hydrodynamic model plus a coarse-grained model for the most\nrelevant TNE behaviors including the entropy production rate. The first\nfunction is verified by recovering hydrodynamic non-equilibrium (HNE) behaviors\nof a number of typical benchmark problems. Extracting and analyzing the most\nrelevant TNE effects in Orszag-Tang problem are practical applications of the\nsecond function. As a further application, the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability\nwith interface inverse and re-shock process is numerically studied. It is found\nthat, in the case without magnetic field, the non-organized momentum flux shows\nthe most pronounced effects near shock front, while the non-organized energy\nflux shows the most pronounced behaviors near perturbed interface. The\ninfluence of magnetic field on TNE effects shows stages: before the interface\ninverse, the TNE strength is enhanced by reducing the interface inverse speed;\nwhile after the interface inverse, the TNE strength is significantly reduced.\nBoth the global averaged TNE strength and entropy production rate contributed\nby non-organized energy flux can be used as physical criteria to identify\nwhether or not the magnetic field is sufficient to prevent the interface\ninverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 07:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

In the context of computer vision, this notion of\nindistinguishability is typically bounded by $L_{\\infty}$ or other norms.\nHowever, these norms are not appropriate for measuring indistinguishiability\nfor time series data. In this work, we propose adversarial examples in the\nWasserstein space for time series data for the first time and utilize\nWasserstein distance to bound the perturbation between normal examples and\nadversarial examples. We introduce Wasserstein projected gradient descent\n(WPGD), an adversarial attack method for perturbing univariant time series\ndata. We leverage the closed-form solution of Wasserstein distance in the 1D\nspace to calculate the projection step of WPGD efficiently with the gradient\ndescent method. We further propose a two-step projection so that the search of\nadversarial examples in the Wasserstein space is guided and constrained by\nEuclidean norms to yield more effective and imperceptible perturbations. We\nempirically evaluate the proposed attack on several time series datasets in the\nhealthcare domain. Extensive results demonstrate that the Wasserstein attack is\npowerful and can successfully attack most of the target classifiers with a high\nattack success rate. To better study the nature of Wasserstein adversarial\nexample, we evaluate a strong defense mechanism named Wasserstein smoothing for\npotential certified robustness defense. Although the defense can achieve some\naccuracy gain, it still has limitations in many cases and leaves space for\ndeveloping a stronger certified robustness method to Wasserstein adversarial\nexamples on univariant time series data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 07:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

However, existing\nQAS algorithms require to evaluate a large number of quantum circuits during\nthe search process, which makes them computationally demanding and limits their\napplications to large-scale quantum circuits. Recently, predictor-based QAS has\nbeen proposed to alleviate this problem by directly estimating the performances\nof circuits according to their structures with a predictor trained on a set of\nlabeled quantum circuits. However, the predictor is trained by purely\nsupervised learning, which suffers from poor generalization ability when\nlabeled training circuits are scarce. It is very time-consuming to obtain a\nlarge number of labeled quantum circuits because the gate parameters of quantum\ncircuits need to be optimized until convergence to obtain their ground-truth\nperformances. To overcome these limitations, we propose GSQAS, a graph\nself-supervised QAS, which trains a predictor based on self-supervised\nlearning. Specifically, we first pre-train a graph encoder on a large number of\nunlabeled quantum circuits using a well-designed pretext task in order to\ngenerate meaningful representations of circuits. Then the downstream predictor\nis trained on a small number of quantum circuits' representations and their\nlabels. Once the encoder is trained, it can apply to different downstream\ntasks. In order to better encode the spatial topology information and avoid the\nhuge dimension of feature vectors for large-scale quantum circuits, we design a\nscheme to encode quantum circuits as graphs. Simulation results on searching\ncircuit structures for variational quantum eigensolver and quantum state\nclassification show that GSQAS outperforms the state-of-the-art predictor-based\nQAS, achieving better performance with fewer labeled circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 08:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

In industry, feature models are often complex due to a large\nnumber of features and constraints. Thus, a multitude of automated analyses\nhave been proposed. Many of those rely on computing the number of valid\nconfigurations which typically depends on solving a #SAT problem, a\ncomputationally expensive operation. Further, most counting-based analyses\nrequire numerous #SAT computations on the same feature model. In particular,\nmany analyses depend on multiple computations for evaluating the number of\nvalid configurations that include certain features or conform to partial\nconfigurations.

However, the\ngeneral object detection methods they use are ill-suited to handle cluttered\nscenes, thus producing poor initialization to the subsequent pose network. To\naddress this, we propose a rigidity-aware detection method exploiting the fact\nthat, in 6D pose estimation, the target objects are rigid. This lets us\nintroduce an approach to sampling positive object regions from the entire\nvisible object area during training, instead of naively drawing samples from\nthe bounding box center where the object might be occluded. As such, every\nvisible object part can contribute to the final bounding box prediction,\nyielding better detection robustness. Key to the success of our approach is a\nvisibility map, which we propose to build using a minimum barrier distance\nbetween every pixel in the bounding box and the box boundary. Our results on\nseven challenging 6D pose estimation datasets evidence that our method\noutperforms general detection frameworks by a large margin.

DFL employs multiple stochastic gradient descent iterations on\ndevice datasets during each global aggregation interval and intermittently\naggregates model parameters through edge servers in local subnetworks. The\ncloud server synchronizes the local models with the global deployed model\ncomputed via a local-global combiner at global synchronization.

Numerical evaluations show DFL's superior\nperformance in terms of faster global model convergence, reduced resource\nconsumption, and robustness against communication delays compared to existing\nFL algorithms.

Here, we present a\nmethod to derive this relation using the nebular spectra of SESNe, based on the\ncorrelation between the [O~I]/[Ca~II], which is an indicator of the progenitor\nmass, and the width of [O~I], which measures the expansion velocity of the\noxygen-rich material. To explain the correlation, the kinetic energy ($E_{\\rm\nK}$) is required to be positively correlated with the progenitor mass as\nrepresented by the CO core mass ($M_{\\rm CO}$). We demonstrate that SNe IIb/Ib\nand SNe Ic/Ic-BL follow the same $M_{\\rm CO}$-$E_{\\rm K}$ scaling relation,\nwhich suggests the helium-rich and helium-deficient SNe share the same\nexplosion mechanism. The $M_{\\rm CO}$-$E_{\\rm K}$ relation derived in this work\nis compared with the ones from early phase observations. The results are\nlargely in good agreement.

Self-reflection provokes revising individual behaviour and\ndecisions, instead of presenting instructions.

This scenario can\nexplain the highest kinetic energies observed in the class of hypernovae.

We first analyze\nthe array gain and derive the closed-form beam squint ratio that characterizes\nthe severity of the beam squint effect on UPAs. The effect is shown to be more\nsevere with a higher fractional bandwidth, while it can be significantly\nmitigated when the shape of a UPA approaches a square. We then focus on the HBF\ndesign that maximizes the system spectral efficiency. The design problem is\nchallenging due to the frequency-flat nature and hardware constraints of the\nanalog beamformer. We overcome the challenges by proposing an efficient\ndecoupling design in which the digital and analog beamformers admit closed-form\nsolutions, which facilitate practical implementations. Numerical results\nvalidate our analysis and show that the proposed HBF design is robust to beam\nsquint, and thus, it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in wideband\nmassive MIMO systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 11:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

We show\nthat the window can be estimated from received samples alone, and that window\nestimate can be used to improve the signal cancellation. The window is\nestimated in the presence of noise and imperfect estimates of the center\nfrequency offset (CFO) and the channel.

Instead, design dependent integration weights are calculated to\nform a linear combination as an approximation to the true gradient at the\ncurrent design. As the approximation error vanishes in the course of the\niterations, CSG represents a hybrid approach, starting off like a purely\nstochastic method and behaving like a full gradient scheme in the limit.

The approach\nconsiders divergences as functionals of measures and exploits the duality\nbetween spaces of measures and spaces of functions. In particular, we show that\none can lower bound the risk with any information measure by upper bounding its\ndual via Markov's inequality. We are thus able to provide estimator-independent\nimpossibility results thanks to the Data-Processing Inequalities that\ndivergences satisfy. The results are then applied to settings of interest\ninvolving both discrete and continuous parameters, including the\n``Hide-and-Seek'' problem, and compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. An\nimportant observation is that the behaviour of the lower bound in the number of\nsamples is influenced by the choice of the information measure.

Specifically, the proposed $\\kappa$ statistic measures\ninter-rater reliability between multiple raters classifying subjects into\none-or-more nominal categories. These categories can be weighted according to\ntheir importance, and the measure can take into account the category hierarchy\n(e.g., categories consisting of subcategories that are only available when\nchoosing the main category like a primary psychiatric disorder and\nsub-disorders; but much more complex dependencies between categories are\npossible as well).

Then it refines the target box through motion-assisted shape\ncompletion at the 2nd-stage. Due to the motion-centric nature, our method shows\nits impressive generalizability with limited training labels and provides good\ndifferentiability for end-to-end cycle training. This inspires us to explore\nsemi-supervised LiDAR SOT by incorporating a pseudo-label-based motion\naugmentation and a self-supervised loss term. Under the fully-supervised\nsetting, extensive experiments confirm that M^2-Track significantly outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-arts on three large-scale datasets while running at 57FPS\n(~8%, ~17% and ~22% precision gains on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset\nrespectively). While under the semi-supervised setting, our method performs on\npar with or even surpasses its fully-supervised counterpart using fewer than\nhalf labels from KITTI. Further analysis verifies each component's\neffectiveness and shows the motion-centric paradigm's promising potential for\nauto-labeling and unsupervised domain adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 17:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

However, most methods are currently limited to either text- or\nimage-conditioned generation for synthesizing an entire image, texture transfer\nor inserting objects into a user-specified region.

Given an RGB image of an object, we aim to hallucinate plausible\nimages of a human hand interacting with it.

Such discrepancies between class\nfrequencies in the data used for a method's development/validation and that in\nits deployment environment(s) are of great importance, for example in the\ncontext of artificial intelligence (AI) democratization, as disease prevalences\nmay vary widely across time and location.

Combining quantization techniques and\nefficient hybrid transformer structures is crucial to maximize the acceleration\nof vision transformers on mobile devices.

Here, we\ndevelop a scattering simulator that models low-contrast target signals buried\nin heterogeneous strong background.

Exploiting LoTSS' high spatial resolution (6\narcsec) and low astrometric uncertainty (about 0.2 arcsec), we match its\ncompact sources to the compiled sample of dwarf galaxies in the Census of the\nLocal Universe -- an H{\\alpha} survey with the Palomar Observatory's 48-inch\nSamuel Oschin Telescope. We identify 29 overluminous compact radio sources,\nevaluate the probability of chance alignment within the sample, investigate the\npotential nature of these sources, and evaluate their volumetric density. While\noptical line-ratio diagnostics on the nebular lines from the host galaxies\nprefer a star-formation origin (against an AGN origin), future high angular\nresolution radio data is necessary to ascertain the origin of the radio\nsources. We discuss planned strategies to differentiate them between candidate\nFRB hosts and intermediate-mass black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 14:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

One of the effective\nsolutions is a series of list flip decoders proposed in recent years. To\nfurther enhance performance, we proposed a parity-check-aided dynamic\nsuccessive cancellation list flip (PC-DSCLF) decoder in this paper. First, we\ndesigned a simplified flip metric, and proved by simulations that this\nsimplification hardly affects the error-correction performance of list flip\ndecoders. Subsequently, we optimized the existing allocation scheme for parity\ncheck (PC) bits, and then designed the first multi-PC-aided scheme with the\ndynamic characteristic for list flip decoders. The dynamic characteristic\nrefers to an excellent ability to correct higher-order errors, which is\nbeneficial for error-correction performance improvement. Meantime, the\nmulti-PC-aided scheme to list flip decoders brings more flexible distributed\ncheck bits, which can narrow down the range for searching error bits and\nachieve a more efficient early termination. Simulation results showed that\nwithout error-correction performance loss, PC-DSCLF decoder shows up to 51.1%\naverage complexity gain with respect to the state-of-the-art list flip decoder\nat practical code lengths. Lower average complexity leads to lower average\nenergy consumption and lower average decoding delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 14:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

This process, known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability, is responsible for many familiar phenomena observed in the\natmosphere, and the oceans, as well as in astrophysics, and it is one of the\nparadigmatic routes to turbulence in fluid mechanics. While in classical\nhydrodynamics the instability is ruled by universal scaling laws, to what\nextent universality emerges in quantum fluids is yet to be fully understood.\nHere, we shed light on this matter by triggering the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability in atomic superfluids across widely different regimes, ranging from\nweakly-interacting bosonic to strongly-correlated fermionic pair condensates.\nUpon engineering two counter-rotating flows with tunable relative velocity, we\nobserve how their contact interface develops into an ordered circular array of\nquantized vortices, which loses stability and rolls up into clusters in close\nanalogy with classical Kelvin-Helmholtz dynamics. We extract the instability\ngrowth rates by tracking the position of individual vortices and find that they\nfollow universal scaling relations, predicted by both classical hydrodynamics\nand a microscopic point-vortex model. Our results connect quantum and classical\nfluids revealing how the motion of quantized vortices mirrors the interface\ndynamics and open the way for exploring a wealth of out-of-equilibrium\nphenomena, from vortex-matter phase transitions to the spontaneous emergence of\ntwo-dimensional quantum turbulence .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 15:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

The quality of US\nimages heavily relies on carefully tuned acoustic parameters, which vary across\nsonographers, machines, and settings. To improve the generalizability on US\nimages across domains, we propose MI-SegNet, a novel mutual information (MI)\nbased framework to explicitly disentangle the anatomical and domain feature\nrepresentations; therefore, robust domain-independent segmentation can be\nexpected. Two encoders are employed to extract the relevant features for the\ndisentanglement. The segmentation only uses the anatomical feature map for its\nprediction. In order to force the encoders to learn meaningful feature\nrepresentations a cross-reconstruction method is used during training.\nTransformations, specific to either domain or anatomy are applied to guide the\nencoders in their respective feature extraction task. Additionally, any MI\npresent in both feature maps is punished to further promote separate feature\nspaces.

This motivates the need for a supply chain\nresilience metric, which we define as the maximum magnitude shock that the\nproduction network can withstand such that at least $(1 -\n\\varepsilon)$-fraction of the products are produced with high probability as\nthe size of the production network grows to infinity. Next, we study the\nresilience of many network architectures and classify them as resilient, where\nlarge cascading failures can be avoided almost surely, and as fragile, where\nlarge cascades are inevitable. In the next step, we give bounds on the expected\nsize of cascading failures in a given production network graph as the solution\nto a linear program and show that extending the node percolation process to a\njoint percolation process that affects the nodes and the links of the\nproduction network becomes a special instance of the well-studied financial\ncontagion model of Eisenberg and Noe.

Conventional KGE methods\nrequire relatively high-dimensional entity representations to preserve the\nstructural information of knowledge graph, but lead to oversized model\nparameters. Recent methods reduce model parameters by adopting low-dimensional\nentity representations, while developing techniques (e.g., knowledge\ndistillation) to compensate for the reduced dimension. However, such operations\nproduce degraded model accuracy and limited reduction of model parameters.\nSpecifically, we view the concatenation of all entity representations as an\nembedding layer, and then conventional KGE methods that adopt high-dimensional\nentity representations equal to enlarging the width of the embedding layer to\ngain expressiveness. To achieve parameter efficiency without sacrificing\naccuracy, we instead increase the depth and propose a deeper embedding network\nfor entity representations, i.e., a narrow embedding layer and a multi-layer\ndimension lifting network (LiftNet).

Previous work has rarely mentioned this problem, but the ability and\nefficiency of data management systems determine the accuracy and speed of the\nGo system. To tackle this issue, we propose an online Go game system based on\nthe chunk data storage method (CH-Go), which processes the format of 160k Go\ngame data released by Kiseido Go Server (KGS) and designs a Go encoder with 11\nplanes, a parallel processor and generator for better memory performance.\nSpecifically, we store the data in chunks, take the chunk size of 1024 as a\nbatch, and save the features and labels of each chunk as binary files. Then a\nsmall set of data is randomly sampled each time for the neural network\ntraining, which is accessed by batch through yield method. The training part of\nthe prototype includes three modules: supervised learning module, reinforcement\nlearning module, and an online module. Firstly, we apply Zobrist-guided hash\ncoding to speed up the Go board construction. Then we train a supervised\nlearning policy network to initialize the self-play for generation of\nexperience data with 160k Go game data released by KGS. Finally, we conduct\nreinforcement learning based on REINFORCE algorithm. Experiments show that the\ntraining accuracy of CH- Go in the sampled 150 games is 99.14%, and the\naccuracy in the test set is as high as 98.82%. Under the condition of limited\nlocal computing power and time, we have achieved a better level of\nintelligence. Given the current situation that classical systems such as GOLAXY\nare not free and open, CH-Go has realized and maintained complete Internet\nopenness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 14:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

Significant crop yield losses had already\noccurred for Winter (Rabi) 2021-22 due to a heatwave earlier in the year and\nestimates for the Summer (Kharif) 2022 crop damage due to flood inundation have\nalready been determined to be very high. With the next sowing season already\nupon the flood affectees, there is a big question mark over the resumption of\nagricultural activity in disaster-struck districts. This study is aimed at\nanalyzing the range of influences of the 2022 floods on the upcoming winter\n(Rabi) crop. Satellite-based remote sensing data, state-of-the-art Earth system\nmodels, and field observations will be leveraged to estimate the impacts of the\nflood on the resumption of agricultural activity in the most impacted districts\nof Southern Punjab, Sindh, and Baluchistan. The field surveys are conducted\nduring multiple visits to the study area to maximize the monitoring of\non-ground conditions and provide a larger validation dataset for the\nsatellite-based inundation and crop classification maps. The project leverages\non the expertise and previous experiences of the LUMS team in performing\nsatellite-based land/crop classification, estimation of soil moisture levels\nfor irrigation activity, and determining changes in land-use patterns for\ndetecting key agricultural activities. Delays in the sowing of the winter crop\nand its effects on crop-yield were analyzed through this study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 18:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 07:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 07:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

BDDs are widely used in several fields, particularly in model\nchecking and hardware verification. There are several implementations for BDD\nmanipulation, where each package differs depending on the application. This\npaper presents HermesBDD: a novel multi-core and multi-platform binary decision\ndiagram package focused on high performance and usability. HermesBDD supports a\nstatic and dynamic memory management mechanism, the possibility to exploit\nlock-free hash tables, and a simple parallel implementation of the If-Then-Else\nprocedure based on a higher-level wrapper for threads and futures. HermesBDD is\ncompletely written in C++ with no need to rely on external libraries and is\ndeveloped according to software engineering principles for reliability and easy\nmaintenance over time. We provide experimental results on the n-Queens problem,\nthe de-facto SAT solver benchmark for BDDs, demonstrating a significant speedup\nof 18.73x over our non-parallel baselines, and a remarkable performance boost\nw.r.t. other state-of-the-art BDDs packages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 11:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}
