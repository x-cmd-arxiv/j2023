We propose a\ndirect regression for such distribution-valued covariates that circumvents\nestimating subject-specific densities and directly uses the observed repeated\nmeasures as covariates. The model is invariant to any transformation or\nordering of the repeated measures. Endowing the regression function with a\nGaussian Process prior, we obtain closed form or conjugate Bayesian inference.\nOur method subsumes the standard Bayesian non-parametric regression using\nGaussian Processes as a special case. Theoretically, we show that the method\ncan achieve an optimal estimation error bound. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst theoretical study on Bayesian regression using distribution-valued\ncovariates.

To address the challenges, previous strategies have focused on\nlocalizing subtle discrepancies between categories and enhencing the\ndiscriminative features in them. However, the background also provides\nimportant information that can tell the model which features are unnecessary or\neven harmful for classification, and models that rely too heavily on subtle\nfeatures may overlook global features and contextual information. In this\npaper, we propose a novel network called ``High-temperaturE Refinement and\nBackground Suppression'' (HERBS), which consists of two modules, namely, the\nhigh-temperature refinement module and the background suppression module, for\nextracting discriminative features and suppressing background noise,\nrespectively. The high-temperature refinement module allows the model to learn\nthe appropriate feature scales by refining the features map at different scales\nand improving the learning of diverse features. And, the background suppression\nmodule first splits the features map into foreground and background using\nclassification confidence scores and suppresses feature values in\nlow-confidence areas while enhancing discriminative features. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed HERBS effectively fuses features of varying\nscales, suppresses background noise, discriminative features at appropriate\nscales for fine-grained visual classification.The proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the CUB-200-2011 and NABirds benchmarks,\nsurpassing 93% accuracy on both datasets.

To relax the dependency on labeled data of downstream tasks, we\npropose an intuitive and effective zero-shot learning framework, ZeroNLG, which\ncan deal with multiple NLG tasks, including image-to-text (image captioning),\nvideo-to-text (video captioning), and text-to-text (neural machine\ntranslation), across English, Chinese, German, and French within a unified\nframework.

The development of\nan interatomic potential for a particular material requires the optimization of\nthe parameters of the functional form of the potential. We present a\nparameterization protocol for analytic bond-order potentials (BOP) that provide\na physically transparent and computationally efficient description of the\ninteratomic interaction. The parameterization protocol of the BOP follows the\nderivation of the BOP along the coarse-graining of the electronic structure\nfrom density-functional theory (DFT) to the tight-binding (TB) bond model to\nanalytic BOPs. In particular, it starts from TB parameters that are obtained by\ndownfolding DFT eigenstates of two-atomic molecules to an $sd$-valent minimal\nbasis. This $sd$-valent Hamiltonian is combined with a pairwise repulsion to\nobtain an initial binding energy relation. The $s$ electrons are then removed\nfrom the Hamiltonian and instead represented by an isotropic embedding term. In\nthe final step, the parameters of the remaining $d$-$d$ interaction, the pair\nrepulsion and the embedding term are optimized simultaneously. We demonstrate\nthat the application of this parameterization protocol leads to a basic BOP for\nRe with good transferability. We discuss different strategies to refine the\nbasic BOP towards global transferability or towards local accuracy. We\ndemonstrate that homogeneous samplings of the structural phase-space in a map\nof local atomic environments can be used to systematically increase the global\ntransferability. We also demonstrate the influence of training data-weighting\non local accuracy refinements with a Pareto-front analysis and suggest further\nrequirements to select a final BOP. The local accuracy and global\ntransferability of the final BOP is also shown and compared to DFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2023 19:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Given a medical\nvolume, a user first segments a slice (or several slices) via the interaction\nmodule and then propagates the segmentation(s) to the remaining slices. The\nuser may repeat this process multiple times until a sufficiently high volume\nsegmentation quality is achieved. However, due to the lack of human correction\nduring propagation, segmentation errors are prone to accumulate in the\nintermediate slices and may lead to sub-optimal performance. To alleviate this\nissue, we propose a simple yet effective cycle consistency loss that\nregularizes an intermediate segmentation by referencing the accurate\nsegmentation in the starting slice. To this end, we introduce a backward\nsegmentation path that propagates the intermediate segmentation back to the\nstarting slice using the same propagation network. With cycle consistency\ntraining, the propagation network is better regularized than in standard\nforward-only training approaches.

In the present paper, we use the recently developed\nnonequilibrium DMFT+CPA embedding scheme, that combines both the dynamical mean\nfield theory (DMFT) and the coherent potential approximation (CPA)\nnonequilibrium extensions, to characterize the relaxation and the\nthermalization of a disordered interacting system described by the\nAnderson-Hubbard model under an interaction quench.

In this Letter, we report\na new fundamental feature of the angular momentum projection, which clearly\ntells us the frequently discussed $K$-mixing in the angular momentum projected\nnuclear wave function can be safely removed. At a given spin $J$, one can\ngenerate $2J+1$ angular momentum projected states from a deformed Slater\ndeterminant. These projected states are labeled with different $K$ numbers.\nUsually, a nuclear wave function with $K$-mixing can be expressed as an\nexpansion in terms of all these $2J+1$ projected states.

Given many related works proposes blockchain-based\ntrustworthy data-sharing solutions, there is increasing confusion and\ndifficulties in understanding and selecting these technologies and platforms in\nterms of their sharing mechanisms, sharing services, quality of services, and\napplications. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on\nblockchain-based data-sharing architectures and applications to fill the gap.\nFirst, we present the foundations of blockchains and discuss the challenges of\ncurrent data-sharing techniques. Second, we focus on the convergence of\nblockchain and data sharing to give a clear picture of this landscape and\npropose a reference architecture for blockchain-based data sharing. Third, we\ndiscuss the industrial applications of blockchain-based data sharing, ranging\nfrom healthcare and smart grid to transportation and decarbonization. For each\napplication, we provide lessons learned for the deployment of Blockchain-based\ndata sharing. Finally, we discuss research challenges and open research\ndirections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2023 02:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

However, knowing the time delay of a causal relation can be\ncrucial as it instructs how and when actions should be taken. Yet, similar to\nstatic causality, deriving causal relations from observational time-series\ndata, as opposed to designed experiments, is not a straightforward process.

While hurricane preparedness and response strategies vastly rely\non the accuracy and timeliness of the predicted households' evacuation\ndecisions, current studies featuring psychological-driven linear models leave\nsome significant limitations in practice. Hence, the present study proposes a\nnew methodology for predicting households' evacuation decisions constructed by\neasily accessible demographic and resource-related predictors compared to\ncurrent models with a high reliance on psychological factors. Meanwhile, an\nenhanced logistic regression (ELR) model that could automatically account for\nnonlinearities (i.e., univariate and bivariate threshold effects) by an\ninterpretable machine learning approach is developed to secure the accuracy of\nthe results. Specifically, low-depth decision trees are selected for\nnonlinearity detection to identify the critical thresholds, build a transparent\nmodel structure, and solidify the robustness. Then, an empirical dataset\ncollected after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is hired to examine the\npracticability of the new methodology. The results indicate that the enhanced\nlogistic regression (ELR) model has the most convincing performance in\nexplaining the variation of the households' evacuation decision in model fit\nand prediction capability compared to previous linear models.

To preserve only key information and relationships of the documents\nin the heterogeneous graph, HGSUM uses graph pooling to compress the input\ngraph. And to guide HGSUM to learn compression, we introduce an additional\nobjective that maximizes the similarity between the compressed graph and the\ngraph constructed from the ground-truth summary during training. HGSUM is\ntrained end-to-end with graph similarity and standard cross-entropy objectives.\nExperimental results over MULTI-NEWS, WCEP-100, and ARXIV show that HGSUM\noutperforms state-of-the-art MDS models.

However, the rapid decoherence of quantum entangled states,\ndue to the unavoidable environment noise, result in practically the unwanted\nsharp drop of the measurement sensitivity. To overcome such a difficulty, here\nwe propose a spin-oscillator hybrid quantum interferometer to achieve the\ndesirable precise estimation of the parameter encoded in the vibrations of the\noscillator. Differing from the conventional two-mode quantum interferometers\ninput by the two-mode NOON state or entangled coherent states (ECS), whose\nachievable sensitivities are strongly limited by the decoherence of the\nentangled vibrational states, we demonstrate that the present interferometer,\ninput by a spin-dependent two-mode entangled state, possesses a manifest\nadvantage, i.e., the measurement sensitivity of the estimated parameter is not\ninfluenced by the decoherence from the spin-oscillator entanglement. This is\nbecause that, by applying a spin-oscillator disentangled operation, the\ninformation of the estimated parameter encoded originally in the vibrational\ndegrees can be effectively transferred into the spin degree and then can be\nsensitively estimated by the precise spin-state population measurements. As\nconsequence, the proposed hybrid quantum interferometer possesses a manifest\nrobustness against the particle losses of the vibrational modes. Interestingly,\nthe achieved phase measurement sensitivity can still surpass the SQL obviously,\neven if relatively large number of particle loss occurs in one of the two\nmodes.

Two velocity definitions at 20%\nand 50% of the peak flux were measured from the global HI profiles and adopted\nas proxies for the circular velocities. We compare our results with an\nidentically constructed z=0 TFR from the Ursa Major (UMa) association of\ngalaxies. To ensure an unbiased comparison of the TFR, all the samples were\ntreated identically regarding sample selection and applied corrections. We\nprovide catalogues and an atlas showcasing the properties of the galaxies. Our\nanalysis is focused on the zero points of the TFR and BTFR with their slopes\nfixed to the z=0 relation. Our main results are: (1) The BUDHIES galaxies show\nmore asymmetric HI profiles with shallower wings compared to the UMa galaxies,\nwhich is likely due to the environment in which they reside, (2) The\nluminosity-based z=0.2 TFRs are brighter and bluer than the z=0 TFRs, even when\ncluster galaxies are excluded from the BUDHIES sample, (3) The BTFR shows no\nevolution in its zero point over the past 2.5 billion years and does not\nsignificantly change on the inclusion of cluster galaxies, and (4) proper\nsample selection and consistent corrections are crucial for an unbiased\nanalysis of the evolution of the TFR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2023 09:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

The\nSemi-analog Monte-Carlo algorithm proposed the use of two kinds of particles,\nphotons and material particles that are born when a photon is absorbed. The\nmaterial particle can `propagate' only by transforming into a photon, due to\nblack-body emission. While this algorithm produces a teleportation-free result,\nit is noisier results compared to IMC due to the discrete nature of the\nabsorption-emission process. In a previous work [Steinberg and Heizler, ApJS,\n258:14 (2022)], proposed a gray version of DIMC, that makes use of two kinds of\nparticles, and therefore has teleportation-free results, but also uses the\ncontinuous absorption algorithm of IMC, yielding smoother results.

At present, most 3D adversarial attack methods perturb the entire\npoint cloud to generate adversarial examples, which results in high\nperturbation costs and difficulty in reconstructing the corresponding real\nobjects in the physical world. In this paper, we propose an adaptive local\nadversarial attack method (AL-Adv) on 3D point clouds to generate adversarial\npoint clouds. First, we analyze the vulnerability of the 3D network model and\nextract the salient regions of the input point cloud, namely the vulnerable\nregions.

The proposed attack algorithm adaptively assigns different\ndisturbances in different directions of the three-dimensional coordinates of\nthe point cloud.

In this work, we aim to learn robust MDPs using regularization. We\nfirst show that regularized MDPs are a particular instance of robust MDPs with\nuncertain reward. We thus establish that policy iteration on reward-robust MDPs\ncan have the same time complexity as on regularized MDPs.

The 100s of virtual machine sizes provided by cloud platforms\nalso makes it extremely challenging to select the ``right'' cloud cluster\nconfiguration for training. Furthermore, the training time and cost of\ndistributed model training is highly sensitive to the cluster configurations,\nand presents a large and complex tradeoff-space.\n  In this paper, we develop principled and practical techniques for optimizing\nthe training time and cost of distributed ML model training on the cloud. Our\nkey insight is that both parallel and statistical efficiency must be considered\nwhen selecting the optimum job configuration parameters such as the number of\nworkers and the batch size. By combining conventional parallel scaling concepts\nand new insights into SGD noise, our models accurately estimate the time and\ncost on different cluster configurations with < 5% error. Using the repetitive\nnature of training and our models, we can search for optimum cloud\nconfigurations in a black-box, online manner. Our approach reduces training\ntimes by 2 times and costs more more than 50%.

Existing studies on provider fairness usually focused on\ndesigning proportion fairness (PF) metrics that first consider systematic\nfairness. However, sociological researches show that to make the market more\nstable, max-min fairness (MMF) is a better metric. The main reason is that MMF\naims to improve the utility of the worst ones preferentially, guiding the\nsystem to support the providers in weak market positions. When applying MMF to\nrecommender systems, how to balance user preferences and provider fairness in\nan online recommendation scenario is still a challenging problem. In this\npaper, we proposed an online re-ranking model named Provider Max-min Fairness\nRe-ranking (P-MMF) to tackle the problem. Specifically, P-MMF formulates\nprovider fair recommendation as a resource allocation problem, where the\nexposure slots are considered the resources to be allocated to providers and\nthe max-min fairness is used as the regularizer during the process. We show\nthat the problem can be further represented as a regularized online optimizing\nproblem and solved efficiently in its dual space. During the online re-ranking\nphase, a momentum gradient descent method is designed to conduct the dynamic\nre-ranking. Theoretical analysis showed that the regret of P-MMF can be\nbounded. Experimental results on four public recommender datasets demonstrated\nthat P-MMF can outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines. Experimental\nresults also show that P-MMF can retain small computationally costs on a corpus\nwith the large number of items.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2023 13:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Most generally, one\ncan construct MLWFs that describe isolated band manifolds, e.g. for the valence\nbands of insulators, or entangled band manifolds, e.g. in metals or describing\nboth the valence and the conduction manifolds in insulators. Obtaining MLWFs\nthat describe a target manifold accurately and with the most compact\nrepresentation often requires chemical intuition and trial and error, a\nchallenging step even for experienced researchers and a roadblock for automated\nhigh-throughput calculations. Here, we present a very natural and powerful\napproach that provides automatically MLWFs spanning the occupied bands and\ntheir natural complement for the empty states, resulting in Wannier Hamiltonian\nmodels that provide a tight-binding picture of optimized atomic orbitals in\ncrystals. Key to the success of the algorithm is the introduction of a\nprojectability measure for each Bloch state onto atomic orbitals (here, chosen\nfrom the pseudopotential projectors) that determines if that state should be\nkept identically, discarded, or mixed into a disentangling algorithm.

Most of the existing techniques for source reconstruction require\ndense multi-frequency data at the Nyquist sampling rate. Accessibility of only\nsparse data at a sub-sampled grid contributes to the null space of the inverse\nsource-to-data operator, which causes significant imaging artifacts. For this\npurpose, additional knowledge about the source or regularization is required.\nIn this article, we propose a novel two-stage strategy for multipolar source\nreconstruction from the sub-sampled sparse data that takes advantage of the\nsparsity of the sources in the physical domain. The data at the Nyquist\nsampling rate is recovered from sub-sampled data and then a conventional\ninversion algorithm is used to reconstruct sources. The data recovery problem\nis linked to a spectrum recovery problem for the signal with the finite rate of\ninnovations (FIR) that is solved using an annihilating filter-based structured\nHankel matrix completion approach (ALOHA). For an accurate reconstruction of\nmultipolar sources, we employ a Fourier inversion algorithm.
