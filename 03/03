Accurate chemical abundances of ultra\nmetal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<-4) can be used to infer properties of the first\nstars, and thus the formation mechanism for low-mass second generation stars in\nthe early universe. Spectroscopic studies have shown that most second\ngeneration stars are carbon-enhanced with one notable exception SDSS\nJ102915.14+172927.9. Aims: We reanalyse the composition of SDSS\nJ102915.14+172927.9. Methods: We developed a tailored 3D model atmosphere for\nSDSS J102915.14+172927.9 with the Stagger-code, making use of an improved\nsurface gravity estimate based on the Gaia DR3 parallax. This model was used as\ninput in the radiative transfer code Balder to compute 3D non-LTE synthetic\nspectra. These spectra were then used to infer abundances for Mg, Si, Ca, Fe\nand Ni, and upper limits on Li, Na and Al. 3D LTE synthetic spectra were\ncomputed with Scate to infer the abundance of Ti and upper limits on C and N.\nResults: In contrast to earlier works based on 1D non-LTE corrections to 3D LTE\nresults, we are able to achieve ionisation balance for Ca I and Ca II when\nemploying our consistent 3D non-LTE treatment. Moreover, the elemental\nabundances are systematically higher than those found in earlier works. In\nparticular, [Fe/H] increases by 0.57 dex, and the upper limits of C and N\nincrease by 0.90 dex and 1.82 dex, respectively. Conclusions: We find that\nPopulation III progenitors with masses 10-20 M_sun exploding with energy\nE<=3*10^{51} erg can reproduce our 3D non-LTE abundance pattern. Contrary to\nprevious work, we obtain higher upper limits on the carbon abundance that are\n``marginally consistent'' with star formation through atomic line cooling, and\nas such, prevent strong conclusions about the formation mechanism of this low\nmass star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 16:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

In this paper, we study cooperative data\ncollection using multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with the objective of\nminimizing the total average Age of Information (AoI). We consider various\nconstraints of the UAVs, including kinematic, energy, trajectory, and collision\navoidance, in order to optimize the data collection process. Specifically, each\nUAV, which has limited on-board energy, takes off from its initial location and\nflies over sensor nodes to collect update packets in cooperation with the other\nUAVs. The UAVs must land at their final destinations with non-negative residual\nenergy after the specified time duration to ensure they have enough energy to\ncomplete their missions. It is crucial to design the trajectories of the UAVs\nand the transmission scheduling of the sensor nodes to enhance information\nfreshness.

On typical MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)\nbenchmarks, we find common phenomena for TD3 and RAD agents: 1) the activity of\npolicy network parameters is highly asymmetric and policy networks advance\nmonotonically along very few major parameter directions; 2) severe detours\noccur in parameter update and harmonic-like changes are observed for all minor\nparameter directions. By performing a novel temporal SVD along policy learning\npath, the major and minor parameter directions are identified as the columns of\nright unitary matrix associated with dominant and insignificant singular values\nrespectively. Driven by the discoveries above, we propose a simple and\neffective method, called Policy Path Trimming and Boosting (PPTB), as a general\nplug-in improvement to DRL algorithms. The key idea of PPTB is to periodically\ntrim the policy learning path by canceling the policy updates in minor\nparameter directions, while boost the learning path by encouraging the advance\nin major directions. In experiments, we demonstrate the general and significant\nperformance improvements brought by PPTB, when combined with TD3 and RAD in\nMuJoCo and DMC environments respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 16:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

This setting differs from traditional ride-sharing marketplaces because\nof the absence of the supply side (drivers). However, it has far-reaching\nconsequences because in addition to pricing, players now have to make decisions\non how to distribute fleets across network locations and re-balance vehicles in\norder to serve future demand. In this paper, we explore a duopoly setting in\nthe ride-sharing marketplace where the players have fully autonomous fleets.\nEach ride-service provider (RSP)'s prices depend on the prices and the supply\nof the other player. We formulate their decision-making problems using a\ngame-theoretic setup where each player seeks to find the optimal prices and\nsupplies at each node while considering the decisions of the other player. This\nleads to a scenario where the players' optimization problems are coupled and it\nis challenging to find the equilibrium. We characterize the types of demand\nfunctions (e.g.: linear) for which this game admits an exact potential function\nand can be solved efficiently. For other types of demand functions, we propose\nan iterative algorithm to compute the equilibrium. We conclude by providing\nnumerical insights into how different kinds of equilibria would play out in the\nmarket when the players are asymmetric. Our numerical evaluations also provide\ninsights into how the regulator needs to consider network effects while\ndeciding regulation in order to avoid unfavorable outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 16:22:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 07:09:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

For a\nbetter performance in continuous VLN, we design a multi-level instruction\nunderstanding procedure and propose a novel model, Multi-Level Attention\nNetwork (MLANet). The first step of MLANet is to generate sub-instructions\nefficiently. We design a Fast Sub-instruction Algorithm (FSA) to segment the\nraw instruction into sub-instructions and generate a new sub-instruction\ndataset named ``FSASub\". FSA is annotation-free and faster than the current\nmethod by 70 times, thus fitting the real-time requirement in continuous VLN.\nTo solve the complex instruction understanding problem, MLANet needs a global\nperception of the instruction and observations. We propose a Multi-Level\nAttention (MLA) module to fuse vision, low-level semantics, and high-level\nsemantics, which produce features containing a dynamic and global comprehension\nof the task. MLA also mitigates the adverse effects of noise words, thus\nensuring a robust understanding of the instruction. To correctly predict\nactions in long trajectories, MLANet needs to focus on what sub-instruction is\nbeing executed every step. We propose a Peak Attention Loss (PAL) to improve\nthe flexible and adaptive selection of the current sub-instruction. PAL\nbenefits the navigation agent by concentrating its attention on the local\ninformation, thus helping the agent predict the most appropriate actions. We\ntrain and test MLANet in the standard benchmark. Experiment results show MLANet\noutperforms baselines by a significant margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 16:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Feldman and Langberg [STOC'11] have shown that for\n$k$-clustering of $n$ points in general metrics, it is possible to obtain\ncoresets whose size depends logarithmically in $n$. Moreover, such a dependency\nin $n$ is inevitable in general metrics. A significant amount of recent work in\nthe area is devoted to obtaining coresests whose sizes are independent of $n$\n(i.e., ``small'' coresets) for special metrics, like $d$-dimensional Euclidean\nspaces, doubling metrics, metrics of graphs of bounded treewidth, or those\nexcluding a fixed minor.\n  In this paper, we provide the first constructions of small coresets for\n$k$-clustering in the metrics induced by geometric intersection graphs, such as\nEuclidean-weighted Unit Disk/Square Graphs. These constructions follow from a\ngeneral theorem that identifies two canonical properties of a graph metric\nsufficient for obtaining small coresets. The proof of our theorem builds on the\nrecent work of Cohen-Addad, Saulpic, and Schwiegelshohn [STOC '21], which\nensures small-sized coresets conditioned on the existence of an interesting set\nof centers, called ``centroid set''. The main technical contribution of our\nwork is the proof of the existence of such a small-sized centroid set for\ngraphs that satisfy the two canonical geometric properties. The new coreset\nconstruction helps to design the first $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for\ncenter-based clustering problems in UDGs and USGs, that is fixed-parameter\ntractable in $k$ and $\\epsilon$ (FPT-AS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 16:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

The\nremarkable flexibility of modern Machine Learning (ML) methods is perfectly\nsuited to this task. However, data-driven hyperparameter tuning of ML methods\nrequires effective model evaluation to avoid large errors in causal estimates,\na task made more challenging because causal inference involves unavailable\ncounterfactuals. Multiple performance-validation metrics have recently been\nproposed such that practitioners now not only have to make complex decisions\nabout which causal estimators, ML learners and hyperparameters to choose, but\nalso about which evaluation metric to use. This paper, motivated by unclear\nrecommendations, investigates the interplay between the four different aspects\nof model evaluation for causal effect estimation. We develop a comprehensive\nexperimental setup that involves many commonly used causal estimators, ML\nmethods and evaluation approaches and apply it to four well-known causal\ninference benchmark datasets. Our results suggest that optimal hyperparameter\ntuning of ML learners is enough to reach state-of-the-art performance in effect\nestimation, regardless of estimators and learners. We conclude that most causal\nestimators are roughly equivalent in performance if tuned thoroughly enough. We\nalso find hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation are much more important\nthan causal estimators and ML methods. Finally, from the significant gap we\nfind in estimation performance of popular evaluation metrics compared with\noptimal model selection choices, we call for more research into causal model\nevaluation to unlock the optimum performance not currently being delivered even\nby state-of-the-art procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 17:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Each\njob is moldable, so it can be assigned not only to one but any number of the\nequal machines. We assume that the work of each job is monotone and that jobs\ncan be placed non-contiguously. In this work we present a $(\\frac 3 2 +\n\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with a worst-case runtime of ${O(n\n\\log^2(\\frac 1 \\epsilon + \\frac {\\log (\\epsilon m)} \\epsilon) +\n\\frac{n}{\\epsilon} \\log(\\frac 1 \\epsilon) {\\log (\\epsilon m)})}$ when $m\\le\n16n$. This is an improvement over the best known algorithm of the same quality\nby a factor of $\\frac 1 \\epsilon$ and several logarithmic dependencies. We\ncomplement this result with an improved FPTAS with running time $O(n\n\\log^2(\\frac 1 \\epsilon + \\frac {\\log (\\epsilon m)} \\epsilon))$ for instances\nwith many machines $m> 8\\frac n \\epsilon$. This yields a $\\frac 3\n2$-approximation with runtime $O(n \\log^2(\\log m))$ when $m>16n$.\n  We achieve these results through one new core observation: In an\napproximation setting one does not need to consider all $m$ possible allotments\nfor each job. We will show that we can reduce the number of relevant allotments\nfor each job from $m$ to $O(\\frac 1 \\epsilon + \\frac {\\log (\\epsilon\nm)}{\\epsilon})$. Using this observation immediately yields the improved FPTAS.\nFor the other result we use a reduction to the knapsack problem first\nintroduced by Mouni\\'e, Rapine and Trystram. We use the reduced number of\nmachines to give a new elaborate rounding scheme and define a modified version\nof this this knapsack instance. This in turn allows for the application of a\nconvolution based algorithm by Axiotis and Tzamos.

Yet, the main gap in this field remains\nthe low availability of data. Furthermore, the expensive acquisition process of\nmotion biases the already modest data towards short single-person sequences.\nWith such a shortage, more elaborate generative tasks are left behind. In this\npaper, we show that this gap can be mitigated using a pre-trained\ndiffusion-based model as a generative prior. We demonstrate the prior is\neffective for fine-tuning, in a few-, and even a zero-shot manner. For the\nzero-shot setting, we tackle the challenge of long sequence generation. We\nintroduce DoubleTake, an inference-time method with which we demonstrate up to\n10-minute long animations of prompted intervals and their meaningful and\ncontrolled transition, using the prior that was trained for 10-second\ngenerations. For the few-shot setting, we consider two-person generation. Using\ntwo fixed priors and as few as a dozen training examples, we learn a slim\ncommunication block, ComMDM, to infuse interaction between the two resulting\nmotions. Finally, using fine-tuning, we train the prior to semantically\ncomplete motions from a single prescribed joint.

However,\nconventional semiparametric LMs will finally become prohibitive for computing\nand storing if they are applied to continual learning over streaming data,\nbecause the non-parametric memory grows linearly with the amount of data they\nlearn from over time. To address the issue of scalability, we present a simple\nand intuitive approach called Selective Memorization (SeMem), which only\nmemorizes difficult samples that the model is likely to struggle with. We\ndemonstrate that SeMem improves the scalability of semiparametric LMs for\ncontinual learning over streaming data in two ways: (1) data-wise scalability:\nas the model becomes stronger through continual learning, it will encounter\nfewer difficult cases that need to be memorized, causing the growth of the\nnon-parametric memory to slow down over time rather than growing at a linear\nrate with the size of training data; (2) model-wise scalability: SeMem allows a\nlarger model to memorize fewer samples than its smaller counterpart because it\nis rarer for a larger model to encounter incomprehensible cases, resulting in a\nnon-parametric memory that does not scale linearly with model size.

Yet, there is no bottom-up\nderivation of how flow forces impact vein dynamics. From the physical principle\nof force balance, shear rate acts parallel to vein walls, and hence, naively\nshear rate could only stretch veins and not dilate or shrink them. We, here,\nresolve this paradox by theoretically investigating force balance on a vein\nwall in the context of the vascular network of the model organism Physarum\npolycephalum. We propose, based on previous mechanical studies of cross-linked\ngels, that shear induces a nonlinear, anisotropic response of the actomyosin\ngel, making up vein walls that can indeed drive vein dilatation. Furthermore,\nour force balance approach allows us to identify that shear feedback occurs\nwith a typical timescale and with a typical target shear rate that are not\nuniversal properties of the material but instead depend smoothly on the\nlocation of the vein within the network. In particular, the target shear rate\nis related to the vein's hydrostatic pressure, which highlights the role of\npressure in vascular adaptation. Finally, since our derivation is based on\nforce balance and fluid mechanics, we believe our approach can be extended to\nvascular adaptation in other organisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 17:56:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 13:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

This poses\nheavy demands particularly on the control stack, as pulses need to be\ndistributed to an increasing number of control channels and variational\nalgorithms require rapid interleaving of quantum and classical computation.\nAssessing the bottlenecks in the control stack is therefore key to making it\nready for reaching quantum advantage. However, existing benchmark suites suffer\nfrom lack of detail due to indirect access to the control hardware. In this\nwork, we present Q-Profile, a tool to profile quantum control stacks that\ncircumvents these issues by utilizing a direct connection from the host CPU to\nthe control stack, providing fine accuracy in measuring the runtime and\nallowing to identify performance bottlenecks. We demonstrate the use of our\ntool by benchmarking the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on a\nQblox Cluster for a virtual 4 to 14-qubit transmon system. Our results identify\nthe major execution bottlenecks in the passive qubit reset and communication\noverhead. We estimate a 1.40x~speedup with respect to the total runtime by\nusing an active qubit reset, instead of passive reset, and demonstrate a\nfurther speedup of 1.37x by parallel initialization of the control modules. The\npresented method of profiling is applicable to other control-stack providers,\nas well as to other benchmarks, while still providing detailed information\nbeyond a single metric. By extension, this tool will enable identifying and\neliminating bottlenecks for future quantum acceleration. The profiling tool is\nincluded in the open-source Quantify quantum control software, which allows\nsupport for multiple back-ends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 18:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Traditional social navigation frameworks require the robot to stop\nsuddenly or \"freeze\" whenever a collision is imminent. This paradigm poses two\nproblems: 1) freezing while navigating a crowd may cause people to trip and\nfall over the robot, resulting in more harm than the collision itself, and 2)\nin very dense social environments where collisions are unavoidable, such a\ncontrol scheme would render the robot unable to move and preclude the\nopportunity to study how humans incorporate robots into these environments.\nHowever, if robots are to be meaningfully included in crowded social spaces,\nsuch as busy streets, subways, stores, or other densely populated locales,\nthere may not exist trajectories that can guarantee zero collisions. Thus,\nadoption of robots in these environments requires the development of minimally\ndisruptive navigation plans that can safely plan for and respond to contacts.\nWe propose a learning-based motion planner and control scheme to navigate dense\nsocial environments using safe contacts for an omnidirectional mobile robot.\nThe planner is evaluated in simulation over 360 trials with crowd densities\nvarying between 0.0 and 1.6 people per square meter.

We also perform automated placement of quantum assertions\nto maximize the functional coverage as well as minimize the hardware overhead.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated assertions in error detection\nusing a suite of quantum benchmarks, including Shor's factoring algorithm and\nGrover's search algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 18:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

An aspirational goal is to\nconstruct self-improving robots: robots that can learn and improve on their\nown, from autonomous interaction with minimal human supervision or oversight.\nSuch robots could collect and train on much larger datasets, and thus learn\nmore robust and performant policies. While reinforcement learning offers a\nframework for such autonomous learning via trial-and-error, practical\nrealizations end up requiring extensive human supervision for reward function\ndesign and repeated resetting of the environment between episodes of\ninteractions. In this work, we propose MEDAL++, a novel design for\nself-improving robotic systems: given a small set of expert demonstrations at\nthe start, the robot autonomously practices the task by learning to both do and\nundo the task, simultaneously inferring the reward function from the\ndemonstrations. The policy and reward function are learned end-to-end from\nhigh-dimensional visual inputs, bypassing the need for explicit state\nestimation or task-specific pre-training for visual encoders used in prior\nwork. We first evaluate our proposed algorithm on a simulated non-episodic\nbenchmark EARL, finding that MEDAL++ is both more data efficient and gets up to\n30% better final performance compared to state-of-the-art vision-based methods.\nOur real-robot experiments show that MEDAL++ can be applied to manipulation\nproblems in larger environments than those considered in prior work, and\nautonomous self-improvement can improve the success rate by 30-70% over\nbehavior cloning on just the expert data.

In this work we investigate the robustness of metrics used to optimise\nPCA-based detrending for high-resolution transmission spectra of exoplanets in\nthe near-infrared.

In this paper, we propose two methods that realize one-to-many\nmatching from a different perspective of augmenting images or image features.\nThe first method is One-to-many Matching via Data Augmentation (denoted as\nDataAug-DETR). It spatially transforms the images and includes multiple\naugmented versions of each image in the same training batch. Such a simple\naugmentation strategy already achieves one-to-many matching and surprisingly\nimproves DETR's performance. The second method is One-to-many matching via\nFeature Augmentation (denoted as FeatAug-DETR). Unlike DataAug-DETR, it\naugments the image features instead of the original images and includes\nmultiple augmented features in the same batch to realize one-to-many matching.\nFeatAug-DETR significantly accelerates DETR training and boosts detection\nperformance while keeping the inference speed unchanged. We conduct extensive\nexperiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on DETR\nvariants, including DAB-DETR, Deformable-DETR, and H-Deformable-DETR. Without\nextra training data, FeatAug-DETR shortens the training convergence periods of\nDeformable-DETR to 24 epochs and achieves 58.3 AP on COCO val2017 set with\nSwin-L as the backbone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 18:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

These\nalgorithms estimate the unknown strength of a unitary evolution. By using\ncoherence or entanglement to sample the unitary $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ times, the\nvariance of the estimates can scale as $O(1/{N^2_{\\mathrm{tot}}})$, compared to\nthe best ``classical'' strategy with $O(1/{N_{\\mathrm{tot}}})$. The original\nalgorithm for quantum phase estimation cannot be implemented on near-term\nhardware as it requires large-scale entangled probes and fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputing. Therefore, alternative algorithms have been introduced that rely on\ncoherence and statistical inference. These algorithms produce quantum-boosted\nphase estimates without inter-probe entanglement. This family of\nphase-estimation algorithms have, until now, never exhibited the possibility of\nachieving optimal scaling $O(1/{N^2_{\\mathrm{tot}}})$.

In this work, we also provide\na quantitative estimate of the false positive rate of Via Machinae 2.0 by\napplying it to a simulated Gaia-mock catalog based on Galaxia, a smooth model\nof the Milky Way that does not contain substructure or stellar streams.\nFinally, we perform the first full-sky search for stellar streams with Via\nMachinae 2.0, identifying 102 streams at high significance within the Gaia Data\nRelease 2, of which only 10 have been previously identified. While follow-up\nobservations for further confirmation are required, taking into account the\nfalse positive rate presented in this work, we expect approximately 90 of these\nstream candidates to correspond to real stellar structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 19:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

One of the most popular\nevaluation frameworks is to perturb features deemed important by an\ninterpretability method and to measure the change in prediction accuracy.\nIntuitively, a large decrease in prediction accuracy would indicate that the\nexplanation has correctly quantified the importance of features with respect to\nthe prediction outcome (e.g., logits). However, the change in the prediction\noutcome may stem from perturbation artifacts, since perturbed samples in the\ntest dataset are out of distribution (OOD) compared to the training dataset and\ncan therefore potentially disturb the model in an unexpected manner.

Our protocol replicates the functionality of Mahadev's\nprotocol (FOCS '18) but with two advantages: (1) the protocol is conceptually\nintuitive and requires fewer bespoke ingredients, and the soundness analysis is\nsimpler and directly follows the analysis of the nonlocal case, and (2) the\nsoundness analysis does not explicitly use the assumption of a TCF or an\nadaptive hardcore bit, and only requires QFHE as a black box (though currently\nthe only known constructions of QFHE use TCFs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 19:20:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 01:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

In order to check whether a weak internal gravity wave turbulence regime\ncan occur, we perform direct numerical simulations of stratified turbulence\nwithout shear modes, and with or without vortical modes at various Froude and\nbuoyancy Reynolds numbers.

We found that the reward maximising agent\nis a lot more certain than the agent minimising expected free energy. This is\nbecause the agent minimising expected free energy always picks the action down,\nand does not gather enough data for the other actions.

The only difference between those two agents is\nthe epistemic value, which aims to make the outputs of the transition and\nencoder networks as close as possible.

Because the sound pressure of whispered\nspeech is significantly lower than that of normal speech, it can be used as a\nsemi-silent speech interaction in public places without being audible to\nothers. Converting whispers to normal speech also improves the speech quality\nfor people with speech or hearing impairments. However, conventional speech\nconversion techniques do not provide sufficient conversion quality or require\nspeaker-dependent datasets consisting of pairs of whispered and normal speech\nutterances. To address these problems, we propose WESPER, a zero-shot,\nreal-time whisper-to-normal speech conversion mechanism based on\nself-supervised learning. WESPER consists of a speech-to-unit (STU) encoder,\nwhich generates hidden speech units common to both whispered and normal speech,\nand a unit-to-speech (UTS) decoder, which reconstructs speech from the encoded\nspeech units. Unlike the existing methods, this conversion is user-independent\nand does not require a paired dataset for whispered and normal speech. The UTS\ndecoder can reconstruct speech in any target speaker's voice from speech units,\nand it requires only an unlabeled target speaker's speech data. We confirmed\nthat the quality of the speech converted from a whisper was improved while\npreserving its natural prosody. Additionally, we confirmed the effectiveness of\nthe proposed approach to perform speech reconstruction for people with speech\nor hearing disabilities.

The resistance as a function of time was measured in a vacuum and\npure oxygen atmosphere through an ac lock-in method.

Most existing methods focus on visible human body\nparts through some prior information. However, when complementary occlusions\noccur, features in occluded regions can interfere with matching, which affects\nperformance severely. In this paper, different from most previous works that\ndiscard the occluded region, we propose a Feature Completion Transformer\n(FCFormer) to implicitly complement the semantic information of occluded parts\nin the feature space. Specifically, Occlusion Instance Augmentation (OIA) is\nproposed to simulates real and diverse occlusion situations on the holistic\nimage. These augmented images not only enrich the amount of occlusion samples\nin the training set, but also form pairs with the holistic images.\nSubsequently, a dual-stream architecture with a shared encoder is proposed to\nlearn paired discriminative features from pairs of inputs. Without additional\nsemantic information, an occluded-holistic feature sample-label pair can be\nautomatically created. Then, Feature Completion Decoder (FCD) is designed to\ncomplement the features of occluded regions by using learnable tokens to\naggregate possible information from self-generated occluded features. Finally,\nwe propose the Cross Hard Triplet (CHT) loss to further bridge the gap between\ncomplementing features and extracting features under the same ID. In addition,\nFeature Completion Consistency (FC$^2$) loss is introduced to help the\ngenerated completion feature distribution to be closer to the real holistic\nfeature distribution. Extensive experiments over five challenging datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed FCFormer achieves superior performance and\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on occluded\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 01:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

However, unlike the classical\nMean-Variance (MV) model of Markowitz, DR portfolios lack optimization theory\nfor justifying their often outstanding empirical performance. In this paper, we\nfirst explain what the DR criterion tries to achieve in terms of portfolio\ncentrality. A consequence of this explanation is that practically imposed norm\nconstraints in fact implicitly enforce constraints on DR. We then derive the\nmaximum DR portfolio under given risk and obtain the efficient DR frontier. We\nfurther develop a separation theorem for this frontier and establish a\nrelationship between the DR frontier and Markowitz MV efficient frontier. In\nthe particular case where the variance vector is proportional to the expected\nreturn vector of the underlining assets, the two frontiers yield same efficient\nportfolios.

To produce dynamic motion from weak control\nsignals such as desired paths, existing methods often require auxiliary\ninformation such as phases for alleviating motion ambiguity, which limits their\ngeneralisation capability. As past poses often contain useful auxiliary hints,\nin this paper, we propose a task-agnostic deep learning method, namely\nMulti-scale Control Signal-aware Transformer (MCS-T), with an attention based\nencoder-decoder architecture to discover the auxiliary information implicitly\nfor synthesizing controllable motion without explicitly requiring auxiliary\ninformation such as phase. Specifically, an encoder is devised to adaptively\nformulate the motion patterns of a character's past poses with multi-scale\nskeletons, and a decoder driven by control signals to further synthesize and\npredict the character's state by paying context-specialised attention to the\nencoded past motion patterns.

Although new\nalgorithms for camera-only 3D object detection have been continuously proposed,\nmost of them may risk drastic performance degradation when the domain of input\nimages differs from that of training. In this paper, we first analyze the\ncauses of the domain gap for the MV3D-Det task. Based on the covariate shift\nassumption, we find that the gap mainly attributes to the feature distribution\nof BEV, which is determined by the quality of both depth estimation and 2D\nimage's feature representation. To acquire a robust depth prediction, we\npropose to decouple the depth estimation from the intrinsic parameters of the\ncamera (i.e. the focal length) through converting the prediction of metric\ndepth to that of scale-invariant depth and perform dynamic perspective\naugmentation to increase the diversity of the extrinsic parameters (i.e. the\ncamera poses) by utilizing homography. Moreover, we modify the focal length\nvalues to create multiple pseudo-domains and construct an adversarial training\nloss to encourage the feature representation to be more domain-agnostic.\nWithout bells and whistles, our approach, namely DG-BEV, successfully\nalleviates the performance drop on the unseen target domain without impairing\nthe accuracy of the source domain. Extensive experiments on various public\ndatasets, including Waymo, nuScenes, and Lyft, demonstrate the generalization\nand effectiveness of our approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst systematic study to explore a domain generalization method for MV3D-Det.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 02:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Nanophotonic waveguides and integrated couplers\nhave been developed to achieve selective coupling and spatial control of an\noptical beam according to its multiple degrees of freedom. However, previous\ncoupling devices remain passive with an inherently linear response to the power\nof incident light limiting their maximal optical selectivity. Here, we\ndemonstrate nonlinear optical selectivity through selective excitation of\nindividual single-mode nanolasers based on the spin and orbital angular\nmomentum of light. Our designed nanolaser circuits consist of plasmonic\nmetasurfaces and individual perovskite nanowires, enabling subwavelength\nfocusing of angular-momentum-distinctive plasmonic fields and further selective\nexcitation of single transverse laser modes in nanowires. The optically\nselected nanolaser with nonlinear increase of light emission greatly enhances\nthe baseline optical selectivity offered by the metasurface from about 0.4 up\nto near unity. Our demonstrated nonlinear optical selectivity may find\nimportant applications in all-optical logic gates and nanowire networks,\nultrafast optical switches, nanophotonic detectors, and on-chip optical and\nquantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 04:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

One line of work generalizes the notion of\nprotected subgroups beyond simple discrete classes by introducing the notion of\na \"rich subgroup\", and seeks to train models that are calibrated or equalize\nerror rates with respect to these richer subgroup classes. Largely\northogonally, local model explanation methods have been developed that given a\nclassifier h and test point x, attribute influence for the prediction h(x) to\nthe individual features of x. This raises a natural question: Do local model\nexplanation methods attribute different feature importance values on average\nacross different protected subgroups, and can we detect these disparities\nefficiently? If the model places high weight on a given feature in a specific\nprotected subgroup, but not on the dataset overall (or vice versa), this could\nbe a potential indicator of bias in the predictive model or the underlying data\ngenerating process, and is at the very least a useful diagnostic that signals\nthe need for a domain expert to delve deeper. In this paper, we formally\nintroduce the notion of feature importance disparity (FID) in the context of\nrich subgroups, design oracle-efficent algorithms to identify large FID\nsubgroups, and conduct a thorough empirical analysis that establishes auditing\nfor FID as an important method to investigate dataset bias. Our experiments\nshow that across 4 datasets and 4 common feature importance methods our\nalgorithms find (feature, subgroup) pairs that simultaneously: (i) have\nsubgroup feature importance that is often an order of magnitude different than\nthe importance on the dataset as a whole (ii) generalize out of sample, and\n(iii) yield interesting discussions about potential bias inherent in these\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 04:12:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 16:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Recent works have\nshown the benefits of extracting domain-invariant representations on domain\ngeneralization. However, the interpretability of domain-invariant features\nremains a great challenge. To address this problem, we propose an interpretable\nBayesian framework (BayeSeg) through Bayesian modeling of image and label\nstatistics to enhance model generalizability for medical image segmentation.\nSpecifically, we first decompose an image into a spatial-correlated variable\nand a spatial-variant variable, assigning hierarchical Bayesian priors to\nexplicitly force them to model the domain-stable shape and domain-specific\nappearance information respectively. Then, we model the segmentation as a\nlocally smooth variable only related to the shape. Finally, we develop a\nvariational Bayesian framework to infer the posterior distributions of these\nexplainable variables. The framework is implemented with neural networks, and\nthus is referred to as deep Bayesian segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative\nexperimental results on prostate segmentation and cardiac segmentation tasks\nhave shown the effectiveness of our proposed method. Moreover, we investigated\nthe interpretability of BayeSeg by explaining the posteriors and analyzed\ncertain factors that affect the generalization ability through further ablation\nstudies.

But is it enough to only have physical\nreasoning capabilities to operate in a real physical environment? In the real\nworld, we constantly face novel situations we have not encountered before. As\nhumans, we are competent at successfully adapting to those situations.\nSimilarly, an agent needs to have the ability to function under the impact of\nnovelties in order to properly operate in an open-world physical environment.\nTo facilitate the development of such AI systems, we propose a new testbed,\nNovPhy, that requires an agent to reason about physical scenarios in the\npresence of novelties and take actions accordingly. The testbed consists of\ntasks that require agents to detect and adapt to novelties in physical\nscenarios. To create tasks in the testbed, we develop eight novelties\nrepresenting a diverse novelty space and apply them to five commonly\nencountered scenarios in a physical environment. According to our testbed\ndesign, we evaluate two capabilities of an agent: the performance on a novelty\nwhen it is applied to different physical scenarios and the performance on a\nphysical scenario when different novelties are applied to it. We conduct a\nthorough evaluation with human players, learning agents, and heuristic agents.\nOur evaluation shows that humans' performance is far beyond the agents'\nperformance. Some agents, even with good normal task performance, perform\nsignificantly worse when there is a novelty, and the agents that can adapt to\nnovelties typically adapt slower than humans.

Cryptocurrencies are largely unregulated, which can\nexacerbate their volatility. The high volatility of cryptocurrencies has also\nled to a speculative bubble, with many investors buying and selling\ncryptocurrencies based on short-term price fluctuations rather than their\nunderlying values.

Deepfake\nmanipulations typically involve tampering with facial parts, which can result\nin inconsistencies across different parts of the face. For instance, Deepfake\ntechniques may change smiling lips to an upset lip, while the eyes remain\nsmiling. Existing detection methods depend on specific indicators of forgery,\nwhich tend to disappear as the forgery patterns are improved. To address the\nlimitation, we propose Mover, a new Deepfake detection model that exploits\nunspecific facial part inconsistencies, which are inevitable weaknesses of\nDeepfake videos. Mover randomly masks regions of interest (ROIs) and recovers\nfaces to learn unspecific features, which makes it difficult for fake faces to\nbe recovered, while real faces can be easily recovered. Specifically, given a\nreal face image, we first pretrain a masked autoencoder to learn facial part\nconsistency by dividing faces into three parts and randomly masking ROIs, which\nare then recovered based on the unmasked facial parts. Furthermore, to maximize\nthe discrepancy between real and fake videos, we propose a novel model with\ndual networks that utilize the pretrained encoder and masked autoencoder,\nrespectively. 1) The pretrained encoder is finetuned for capturing the encoding\nof inconsistent information in the given video. 2) The pretrained masked\nautoencoder is utilized for mapping faces and distinguishing real and fake\nvideos.

In the first stage, we intend to generate natural hand gestures by\ntwo hand-disentanglement branches.

DeRe-GRL includes two\nmodules: Action Decomposition Module (ADM) and Relation Reconstruction Module\n(RRM), where ADM learns action features of facial key components and RRM\nexplores the relationship between these action features. Based on facial key\ncomponents, ADM divides the geometric movement features extracted by the graph\nmodel-based backbone into several sub-features, and learns the map matrix to\nmap these sub-features into multiple action features; then, RRM learns weights\nto weight all action features to build the relationship between action\nfeatures. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed modules, and the proposed method achieves competitive performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 08:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Sources of nucleosynthesis are diverse: Stars with hydrostatic\nnuclear burning eject some of the products, and core-collapse supernovae add\nejecta.

The total reaction cross section\n(including the double fragmentation channel) obtained for $v'$=6 matches the\nnew experimental results obtained by Savic, Schlemmer and Gerlich [Chem. Phys.\nChem. 21 (13), 1429.1435(2020)]. The differences among several experimental\nsetups, for collision energies above 1 eV, showing cross sections\nscattered/dispersed over a rather wide interval, can be explained by the\ndifferences in the vibrational excitations obtained in the formation of H$_2^+$\nreactants. On the contrary, for collision energies below 1 eV, the cross\nsection is determined by the long range behavior of the potential and do not\ndepend strongly on the vibrational state of H$_2^+$. In addition in this study,\nthe calculated reaction cross sections are used in a plasma model and compared\nwith previous results. We conclude that the efficiency of the formation of\nH$_3^+$ in the plasma is affected by the potential energy surface used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 10:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

In this formulation, the\nexpressions of the turbulent fluxes: the turbulent electromotive force (EMF) in\nthe mean induction equation and the Reynolds and turbulent Maxwell stresses in\nthe momentum equation are obtained. Related to the expression of EMF, the\nphysical origin of the cross-helicity effect in dynamos, as well as other\ndynamo effects, is discussed. In order to understand the actual role of the\nturbulent cross helicity, its transport equations is considered. Several\ngeneration mechanisms of cross helicity are discussed with illustrative\nexamples. On the basis of the cross-helicity production mechanisms, its effect\nin stellar dynamos is discussed. The role of cross helicity in the momentum\ntransport and global flow generation is also argued.

As a result,\nhigher quantities of radical and excited species are suspected to be produced.\nThe addition of hydrogen also leads to the formation of new species. In\nparticular, ammonia and hydrogen-bearing ions have been observed: N2H+ and NH4+\nbeing the major ones, and also H3+, NH+, NH2+, NH3+, N3H+ and N3H3+. The\ncomparison to a radiofrequency capacitively coupled plasma (RF CCP) discharge\nin similar experimental conditions shows that both discharges led to similar\nobservations. The study of N2-H2 discharges in the laboratory in the adequate\nionization conditions then gives some insights on which plasma species made of\nnitrogen and hydrogen could be present in the ionosphere of Titan. Here, we\nidentified some protonated ions, which are reactive species that could\nparticipate to the erosion of organic aerosols on Titan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 12:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

Early studies retrieve required\nknowledge from explicit knowledge bases (KBs), which often introduces\nirrelevant information to the question, hence restricting the performance of\ntheir models. Recent works have sought to use a large language model (i.e.,\nGPT-3) as an implicit knowledge engine to acquire the necessary knowledge for\nanswering. Despite the encouraging results achieved by these methods, we argue\nthat they have not fully activated the capacity of GPT-3 as the provided input\ninformation is insufficient. In this paper, we present Prophet -- a\nconceptually simple framework designed to prompt GPT-3 with answer heuristics\nfor knowledge-based VQA. Specifically, we first train a vanilla VQA model on a\nspecific knowledge-based VQA dataset without external knowledge. After that, we\nextract two types of complementary answer heuristics from the model: answer\ncandidates and answer-aware examples. Finally, the two types of answer\nheuristics are encoded into the prompts to enable GPT-3 to better comprehend\nthe task thus enhancing its capacity. Prophet significantly outperforms all\nexisting state-of-the-art methods on two challenging knowledge-based VQA\ndatasets, OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, delivering 61.1% and 55.7% accuracies on their\ntesting sets, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 13:05:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 01:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

In addition, long-term\nadaptation often leads to catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation, which\nhinders applying TTA in real-world deployments. Our approach consists of two\ncomponents to address these issues. First, we present lightweight meta networks\nthat can adapt the frozen original networks to the target domain.

Second, our novel\nself-distilled regularization controls the output of the meta networks not to\ndeviate significantly from the output of the frozen original networks, thereby\npreserving well-trained knowledge from the source domain. Without additional\nmemory, this regularization prevents error accumulation and catastrophic\nforgetting, resulting in stable performance even in long-term test-time\nadaptation.

The agent makes use of Bayesian\nlearning in order to estimate the institution's true trustworthiness and makes\nthe decision to place trust based on myopic rationality. Using elements from\nrandom walk theory, we explicitly derive the probability that such an agent\nceases placing trust at some point in the relationship, as well as the expected\ntime spent placing trust conditioned on their discontinuation thereof.\n  We then continue by modelling two truster agents, each in their own\nrelationship to the institution. We consider two natural models of\ncommunication between them. In the first (``observable rewards'') agents\ndisclose their experiences with the institution with one another, while in the\nsecond (``observable actions'') agents merely witness the actions of their\nneighbour, i.e., placing or not placing trust. Under the same assumptions as in\nthe single agent case, we describe the evolution of the beliefs of agents under\nthese two different communication models. Both the probability of ceasing to\nplace trust and the expected time in the system elude explicit expressions,\ndespite there being only two agents.

The\nwork was done within the Kubo formalism in linear response. We show that the\ncoexistence of the Rashba and cubic Dresselhaus SOC in 2DEGs promotes a strong\nanisotropy of the band spin splitting which in turn leads to a very\ncharacteristic frequency dependence of the spin Hall conductivity. We find that\nthe spin Hall conductivity response could be very sensible to sizeable\ncubic-Dresselhaus coupling strength. This may be of relevance for the optical\ncontrol of spin currents in 2DEGs with non-negligible cubic-Dresselhaus SOC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 14:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

The development of JE-SSL methods was driven primarily by the search for\never increasing downstream classification accuracies, using huge computational\nresources, and typically built upon insights and intuitions inherited from a\nclose parent JE-SSL method. This has led unwittingly to numerous pre-conceived\nideas that carried over across methods e.g. that SimCLR requires very large\nmini batches to yield competitive accuracies; that strong and computationally\nslow data augmentations are required. In this work, we debunk several such\nill-formed a priori ideas in the hope to unleash the full potential of JE-SSL\nfree of unnecessary limitations. In fact, when carefully evaluating\nperformances across different downstream tasks and properly optimizing\nhyper-parameters of the methods, we most often -- if not always -- see that\nthese widespread misconceptions do not hold. For example we show that it is\npossible to train SimCLR to learn useful representations, while using a single\nimage patch as negative example, and simple Gaussian noise as the only data\naugmentation for the positive pair. Along these lines, in the hope to\ndemocratize JE-SSL and to allow researchers to easily make more extensive\nevaluations of their methods, we introduce an optimized PyTorch library for\nSSL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 14:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Some web services publish their sanitization logic to make their client\ninterface more usable, e.g., allowing clients to debug invalid requests\nlocally. However, this usability practice poses a security risk. Specifically,\nservices may share the regexes they use to sanitize input strings -- and\nregex-based denial of service (ReDoS) is an emerging threat. Although prominent\nservice outages caused by ReDoS have spurred interest in this topic, we know\nlittle about the degree to which live web services are vulnerable to ReDoS.\n  In this paper, we conduct the first black-box study measuring the extent of\nReDoS vulnerabilities in live web services. We apply the Consistent\nSanitization Assumption: that client-side sanitization logic, including\nregexes, is consistent with the sanitization logic on the server-side. We\nidentify a service's regex-based input sanitization in its HTML forms or its\nAPI, find vulnerable regexes among these regexes, craft ReDoS probes, and\npinpoint vulnerabilities. We analyzed the HTML forms of 1,000 services and the\nAPIs of 475 services. Of these, 355 services publish regexes; 17 services\npublish unsafe regexes; and 6 services are vulnerable to ReDoS through their\nAPIs (6 domains; 15 subdomains). Both Microsoft and Amazon Web Services patched\ntheir web services as a result of our disclosure. Since these vulnerabilities\nwere from API specifications, not HTML forms, we proposed a ReDoS defense for a\npopular API validation library, and our patch has been merged. To summarize: in\nclient-visible sanitization logic, some web services advertise ReDoS\nvulnerabilities in plain sight. Our results motivate short-term patches and\nlong-term fundamental solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 15:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Existing methods estimate specific 3D shapes and achieve remarkable\nperformance. However, these methods rely on extensive computation and memory,\ncausing imbalances between accuracy and real-time performance. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose a novel LiDAR-based 3D object detection model named\nBSH-Det3D, which applies an effective way to enhance spatial features by\nestimating complete shapes from a bird's eye view (BEV). Specifically, we\ndesign the Pillar-based Shape Completion (PSC) module to predict the\nprobability of occupancy whether a pillar contains object shapes. The PSC\nmodule generates a BEV shape heatmap for each scene. After integrating with\nheatmaps, BSH-Det3D can provide additional information in shape deterioration\nareas and generate high-quality 3D proposals. We also design an attention-based\ndensification fusion module (ADF) to adaptively associate the sparse features\nwith heatmaps and raw points. The ADF module integrates the advantages of\npoints and shapes knowledge with negligible overheads. Extensive experiments on\nthe KITTI benchmark achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of\naccuracy and speed, demonstrating the efficiency and flexibility of BSH-Det3D.\nThe source code is available on https://github.com/mystorm16/BSH-Det3D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 15:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Generally, their\nstable operation is at the expense of numerous sensors, communication burdens,\nand complicated balancing strategies that challenge their expansion to cost\ndriven applications. Hence, the introduction of a sensorless voltage balancing\nstrategy with a simple controller is an attractive objective. Diode clamped\nMMCs offer a simple yet effective solution by providing a unidirectional\nbalancing path between two modules through a diode, and ideally, the modulation\ntechnique should compensate for the lack of bidirectional energy transfer.\nHence open loop operation is possible. Although the open loop operation is\ndesirable to reduce costs, good knowledge of the modules voltages for system\nmonitoring and protection functions still appears mandatory. This paper\ndevelops a compensated state space model for diode clamped MMCs and integrates\nit with an optimal estimator to reliably estimate the voltage of all modules\nwithout any direct measurement at module terminals. Additionally, the model\nconsiders the effect of the diode clamped branches and their balancing effect,\nresulting in a 30 percent to 50 percent reduction in estimation error compared\nto the conventional model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 15:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

We quantitatively account for the fraction of\nchoice reversals between two repetitions of the experiment, using a\nprobabilistic choice formulation in the simplest form without model assumption\nor adjustable parameters. The prediction of choice reversal is then refined by\nintroducing heterogeneity between decision makers through their differentiation\ninto two groups: ``majoritarian'' and ``contrarian'' (in proportion 3:1). This\nsupports the first fundamental tenet of QDT, which models choice as an inherent\nprobabilistic process, where the probability of a prospect can be expressed as\nthe sum of its utility and attraction factors. We propose to parameterise the\nutility factor with a stochastic version of cumulative prospect theory\n(logit-CPT), and the attraction factor with a constant absolute risk aversion\n(CARA) function. For this dataset, and penalising the larger number of QDT\nparameters via the Wilks test of nested hypotheses, the QDT model is found to\nperform significantly better than logit-CPT at both the aggregate and\nindividual levels, and for all considered fit criteria for the first experiment\niteration and for predictions (second ``out-of-sample'' iteration). The\ndistinctive QDT effect captured by the attraction factor is mostly appreciable\n(i.e., most relevant and strongest in amplitude) for prospects with big losses.\nOur quantitative analysis of the experimental results supports the existence of\nan intrinsic limit of predictability, which is associated with the inherent\nprobabilistic nature of choice.

Previous work has largely focused on current sheets with\na uniform thickness, for which the predicted spreading speed for anti-parallel\nreconnection is the local speed of the current carriers. We derive a scaling\ntheory of three-dimensional (3D) spreading of collisionless anti-parallel\nreconnection in a current sheet with its thickness varying in the out-of-plane\ndirection, both for spreading from a thinner to thicker region and a thicker to\nthinner region. We derive an expression for calculating the time it takes for\nspreading to occur for a current sheet with a given profile of its thickness. A\nkey result is that when reconnection spreads from a thinner to a thicker\nregion, the spreading speed in the thicker region is slower than both the\nAlfv\\'en speed and the speed of the local current carriers by a factor of the\nratio of thin to thick current sheet thicknesses. This is important because\nmagnetospheric and solar observations have previously measured the spreading\nspeed to be slower than previously predicted, so the present mechanism might\nexplain this feature. We confirm the theory via a parametric study using 3D\ntwo-fluid numerical simulations.

By taking advantage of blockchain technology,\ndigital assets are broadly grouped into fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFT).\nHere non-fungible tokens refer to those with unique and non-substitutable\nproperties. NFT has widely attracted attention, and its protocols, standards,\nand applications are developing exponentially. It has been successfully applied\nto digital fantasy artwork, games, collectibles, etc. However, there is a lack\nof research in utilizing NFT in issues such as Intellectual Property. Applying\nfor a patent and trademark is not only a time-consuming and lengthy process but\nalso costly. NFT has considerable potential in the intellectual property\ndomain. It can promote transparency and liquidity and open the market to\ninnovators who aim to commercialize their inventions efficiently. The main\nobjective of this paper is to examine the requirements of presenting\nintellectual property assets, specifically patents, as NFTs. Hence, we offer a\nlayered conceptual NFT-based patent framework. Furthermore, a series of open\nchallenges about NFT-based patents and the possible future directions are\nhighlighted. The proposed framework provides fundamental elements and guidance\nfor businesses in taking advantage of NFTs in real-world problems such as grant\npatents, funding, biotechnology, and so forth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 17:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Recently, technology companies such as Microsoft and Google\nhave announced new services which aim to combine search engines with\nconversational AI. However, we have found numerous mistakes in the public\ndemonstrations that suggest we should not easily trust the factual claims of\nthe AI models. Rather than criticizing specific models or companies, we hope to\ncall on researchers and developers to improve AI models' transparency and\nfactual correctness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 04:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}
