However,\nachieving such maximum chirality is challenging, as it typically requires\ncomplex chiral metamaterials. Here we demonstrate that chiral spheres can yield\nmaximum chirality in their emitted wavefield. Specifically, we analytically\nfind the spectral trajectories at which chiral spheres become optically\ntransparent to a given helicity of the incident field, while for its opposite\nhelicity, they behave as dual objects, i.e., on scattering, they preserve\nhelicity. Since chiral spheres behave as dual objects at the first Kerker\ncondition of zero backscattering, we significantly simplify this condition in\nterms of a Riccati-Bessel function. Importantly, all our results are exact and\napplicable regardless of the multipolar order, refractive index contrast,\noptical size, and intrinsic chirality of the chiral sphere. Thus, our exact\nfindings can serve as building blocks for designing novel metasurfaces or\nmetamaterials with maximum electromagnetic chirality properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 16:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

For such domain adaptation problems, we seek generalization bounds\nwhich are tractably computable and tight. If these desiderata can be reached,\nthe bounds can serve as guarantees for adequate performance in deployment.\nHowever, in applications where deep neural networks are the models of choice,\nderiving results which fulfill these remains an unresolved challenge; most\nexisting bounds are either vacuous or has non-estimable terms, even in\nfavorable conditions. In this work, we evaluate existing bounds from the\nliterature with potential to satisfy our desiderata on domain adaptation image\nclassification tasks, where deep neural networks are preferred. We find that\nall bounds are vacuous and that sample generalization terms account for much of\nthe observed looseness, especially when these terms interact with measures of\ndomain shift. To overcome this and arrive at the tightest possible results, we\ncombine each bound with recent data-dependent PAC-Bayes analysis, greatly\nimproving the guarantees. We find that, when domain overlap can be assumed, a\nsimple importance weighting extension of previous work provides the tightest\nestimable bound.

Even\nsystems that are not explicitly designed to persuade may do so in practice. In\nthe future, increasingly anthropomorphic AI systems may form ongoing\nrelationships with users, increasing their persuasive power. This paper\ninvestigates the uncertain future of persuasive AI systems. We examine ways\nthat AI could qualitatively alter our relationship to and views regarding\npersuasion by shifting the balance of persuasive power, allowing personalized\npersuasion to be deployed at scale, powering misinformation campaigns, and\nchanging the way humans can shape their own discourse.

We warn that\nubiquitous highlypersuasive AI systems could alter our information environment\nso significantly so as to contribute to a loss of human control of our own\nfuture. In response, we examine several potential responses to AI-driven\npersuasion: prohibition, identification of AI agents, truthful AI, and legal\nremedies.

Unbiased learning based on\ninverse propensity scores (IPS), which estimate the probability of observing a\nuser-item pair given the historical information, has been proposed to address\nthe issue. In these methods, propensity score estimation is usually limited to\nthe view of item, that is, treating the feedback data as sequences of items\nthat interacted with the users. However, the feedback data can also be treated\nfrom the view of user, as the sequences of users that interact with the items.\nMoreover, the two views can jointly enhance the propensity score estimation.\nInspired by the observation, we propose to estimate the propensity scores from\nthe views of user and item, called Dually Enhanced Propensity Score Estimation\n(DEPS). Specifically, given a target user-item pair and the corresponding item\nand user interaction sequences, DEPS firstly constructs a time-aware causal\ngraph to represent the user-item observational probability. According to the\ngraph, two complementary propensity scores are estimated from the views of item\nand user, respectively, based on the same set of user feedback data. Finally,\ntwo transformers are designed to make the final preference prediction.\nTheoretical analysis showed the unbiasedness and variance of DEPS. Experimental\nresults on three publicly available and an industrial datasets demonstrated\nthat DEPS can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 16:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

A\npopular idea in this regard is to locally construct bimaterial Riemann\nproblems, and to apply their exact solutions in flux computation. For general\nequations of state, however, finding the exact solution of a Riemann problem is\nexpensive as it requires nested loops. Multiplied by the large number of\nRiemann problems constructed during a simulation, the computational cost often\nbecomes prohibitive. The work presented in this paper aims to accelerate the\nsolution of bimaterial Riemann problems without introducing approximations or\noffline precomputation tasks. The basic idea is to exploit some special\nproperties of the Riemann problem equations, and to recycle previous solutions\nas much as possible. Following this idea, four acceleration methods are\ndeveloped, including (1) a change of integration variable through rarefaction\nfans, (2) storing and reusing integration trajectory data, (3) step size\nadaptation, and (4) constructing an R-tree on the fly to generate initial\nguesses. The performance of these acceleration methods are assessed using four\nexample problems in underwater explosion, laser-induced cavitation, and\nhypervelocity impact. These problems exhibit strong shock waves, large\ninterface deformation, contact of multiple (>2) interfaces, and interaction\nbetween gases and condensed matters.

As a classical\nRCS characterization, the echo signal is analysed based on two measurements\nwith and without the target in the RC. In the hypothesis of an ideal diffuse\nfield generated in the RC, this signal difference appears as the echo signal\nhidden in a Gaussian noise. In case of a point-like backscattering target,\nobserving this signal over a given frequency bandwidth allows the\nidentification of the target response as a sinusoidal signal over this\nbandwidth whose period is related to the antenna-target distance measured from\nthe measurement calibration plane positions.

This construction rests on the idea that the work\ndone on an isolated system can be coherently measured by coupling the system to\na quantum measurement apparatus. In this way, a quasiprobability distribution\nof work can be defined in terms of the Wigner function of the apparatus. This\nquasidistribution contains the information of the work statistics and also\nholds a clear operational definition. Moreover, it is shown that the presence\nof quantum coherence in the energy eigenbasis is related with the appearance of\ncharacteristics related to non-classicality in the Wigner function such as\nnegativity and interference fringes. On the other hand, from this\nquasiprobability distribution it is straightforward to obtain the standard\ntwo-point measurement probability distribution of work and also the difference\nin average energy for initial states with coherences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 16:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

This\nproblem proves difficult due to the abstract nature of hand-drawn sketches,\nvariations in the style and quality of sketches, and the large domain gap\nexisting between the sketches and the natural images. To mitigate these\nchallenges, existing works proposed attention-based frameworks to incorporate\nquery information into the image features. However, in these works, the query\nfeatures are incorporated after the image features have already been\nindependently learned, leading to inadequate alignment. In contrast, we propose\na sketch-guided vision transformer encoder that uses cross-attention after each\nblock of the transformer-based image encoder to learn query-conditioned image\nfeatures leading to stronger alignment with the query sketch. Further, at the\noutput of the decoder, the object and the sketch features are refined to bring\nthe representation of relevant objects closer to the sketch query and thereby\nimprove the localization. The proposed model also generalizes to the object\ncategories not seen during training, as the target image features learned by\nour method are query-aware.

Here we investigate the evolution of a\nstratified turbulent cloud under rotation. Since the turbulent cloud consists\nof vortices with different shapes and sizes, a single eddy under rotation and\nstratification is considered first. The stratified eddy is different from an\neddy under pure rotation in two respects. First, a new potential vorticity (PV)\nmode is found, which is manifested as a static stable vortex. Second, inertial\nwaves found in the purely rotating case are replaced by inertial-gravity waves\nin the stratified case. We then investigate a turbulent cloud for which we\nperform numerical simulations at a fixed Rossby number and for various Froude\nnumbers. Unlike the purely rotating case where vertical columnar structures\nspontaneously grow out of the turbulent cloud, in the stratified case the\ncolumnar structures emerge and tilt away from the vertical direction. As the\nstratification gets stronger, the tilting angle increases and the rate of cloud\nexpansion decreases. The columnar structures are composed of inertial-gravity\nwaves, as both the tilting angles of the flow structures and vertical growth\nrates of the turbulent cloud can be predicted by the linear theory. We adopt\nLagrangian particle tracking to identify regions dominated by wave and\nturbulence. When the stratification is weak, the inertial-gravity waves carry a\nconsiderable portion of energy away from the turbulent cloud. This portion of\nenergy reduces as the stratification becomes stronger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 17:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

These models extend the framework proposed in Albergo &\nVanden-Eijnden (2023), enabling the use of a broad class of continuous-time\nstochastic processes called `stochastic interpolants' to bridge any two\narbitrary probability density functions exactly in finite time. These\ninterpolants are built by combining data from the two prescribed densities with\nan additional latent variable that shapes the bridge in a flexible way. The\ntime-dependent probability density function of the stochastic interpolant is\nshown to satisfy a first-order transport equation as well as a family of\nforward and backward Fokker-Planck equations with tunable diffusion. Upon\nconsideration of the time evolution of an individual sample, this viewpoint\nimmediately leads to both deterministic and stochastic generative models based\non probability flow equations or stochastic differential equations with an\nadjustable level of noise. The drift coefficients entering these models are\ntime-dependent velocity fields characterized as the unique minimizers of simple\nquadratic objective functions, one of which is a new objective for the score of\nthe interpolant density. Remarkably, we show that minimization of these\nquadratic objectives leads to control of the likelihood for any of our\ngenerative models built upon stochastic dynamics. By contrast, we establish\nthat generative models based upon a deterministic dynamics must, in addition,\ncontrol the Fisher divergence between the target and the model. We also\nconstruct estimators for the likelihood and the cross-entropy of\ninterpolant-based generative models, discuss connections with other stochastic\nbridges, and demonstrate that such models recover the Schr\\\"odinger bridge\nbetween the two target densities when explicitly optimizing over the\ninterpolant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 17:43:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 17:07:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

The no-boundary proposal is the idea that the wave function\nshould be calculated by summing over geometries that have no boundary to the\npast, and over regular matter configurations on these geometries. Accordingly,\nthe universe is finite, self-contained and the big bang singularity is avoided.\nMoreover, given a dynamical theory, the no-boundary proposal provides\nprobabilities for various solutions of the theory. In this sense it provides a\nquantum theory of initial conditions.\n  This review starts with a general overview of the framework of quantum\ncosmology, describing both the canonical and path integral approaches, and\ntheir interpretations.

Autonomous vehicles also require path-specific guidance from lane\ngraph for trajectory planning. We argue that the path, which indicates the\ntraffic flow, is the primitive of the lane graph. Motivated by this, we propose\nto model the lane graph in a novel path-wise manner, which well preserves the\ncontinuity of the lane and encodes traffic information for planning. We present\na path-based online lane graph construction method, termed LaneGAP, which\nend-to-end learns the path and recovers the lane graph via a Path2Graph\nalgorithm. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the superiority of\nLaneGAP over conventional pixel-based and piece-based methods. Abundant\nvisualizations show LaneGAP can cope with diverse traffic conditions. Code and\nmodels will be released at \\url{https://github.com/hustvl/LaneGAP} for\nfacilitating future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 17:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

In this work, we present an interpolation-based gyrochronology\nframework that reproduces the time- and mass-dependent spin-down rates implied\nby the latest open cluster data, while also matching the rate at which the\ndispersion in initial stellar rotation periods decreases as stars age. We\nvalidate our technique for stars with temperatures of 3800-6200 K and ages of\n0.08-2.6 gigayears (Gyr), and use it to reexamine the empirical limits of\ngyrochronology.

It further requires a principled account of how these components\nmechanistically, and causally, relate to each another. While previous models\nhave isolated regions of interest for structure-building and lexical access,\nmany gaps remain with respect to bridging distinct scales of neural complexity.\nBy expanding existing accounts of how neural oscillations can index various\nlinguistic processes, this article proposes a neurocomputational architecture\nfor syntax, termed the ROSE model (Representation, Operation, Structure,\nEncoding). Under ROSE, the basic data structures of syntax are atomic features,\ntypes of mental representations (R), and are coded at the single-unit and\nensemble level. Elementary computations (O) that transform these units into\nmanipulable objects accessible to subsequent structure-building levels are\ncoded via high frequency gamma activity. Low frequency synchronization and\ncross-frequency coupling code for recursive categorial inferences (S). Distinct\nforms of low frequency coupling and phase-amplitude coupling (delta-theta\ncoupling via pSTS-IFG; theta-gamma coupling via IFG to conceptual hubs) then\nencode these structures onto distinct workspaces (E). Causally connecting R to\nO is spike-phase/LFP coupling; connecting O to S is phase-amplitude coupling;\nconnecting S to E is a system of frontotemporal traveling oscillations;\nconnecting E to lower levels is low-frequency phase resetting of spike-LFP\ncoupling. ROSE is reliant on neurophysiologically plausible mechanisms, is\nsupported at all four levels by a range of recent empirical research, and\nprovides an anatomically precise and falsifiable grounding for the basic\nproperty of natural language syntax: hierarchical, recursive\nstructure-building.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 18:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

Classically optimizing circuits with PNR detectors is challenging\ndue to their exponentially large Hilbert space, and quadratically more\nchallenging in the presence of decoherence as state vectors are replaced by\ndensity matrices. To tackle this problem, we introduce a family of algorithms\nthat calculate detection probabilities, conditional states (as well as their\ngradients with respect to circuit parametrizations) with a complexity that is\ncomparable to the noiseless case. As a consequence we can simulate and optimize\ncircuits with twice the number of modes as we could before, using the same\nresources. More precisely, for an $M$-mode noisy circuit with detected modes\n$D$ and undetected modes $U$, the complexity of our algorithm is $O(M^2\n\\prod_{i\\in U} C_i^2 \\prod_{i\\in D} C_i)$, rather than $O(M^2 \\prod_{i \\in\nD\\cup U} C_i^2)$, where $C_i$ is the Fock cutoff of mode $i$.

It provides instrumental value in\nallowing us to collaborate on and defer actions to others, and intrinsic value\nin our intimate relationships with romantic partners, family, and friends. In\nthis paper I examine the nature of trust from a philosophical perspective.\nSpecifically I propose to view trust as a context-sensitive state in a manner\nthat will be made precise. The contribution of this paper is threefold.\n  First, I make the simple observation that an individual's trust is typically\nboth action- and context-sensitive. Action-sensitivity means that trust may\nobtain between a given truster and trustee for only certain actions.\nContext-sensitivity means that trust may obtain between a given truster and\ntrustee, regarding the same action, in some conditions and not others. I also\nopine about what kinds of things may play the role of the truster, trustee, and\naction.\n  Second, I advance a theory for the nature of contextual trust. I propose that\nthe answer to \"What does it mean for $A$ to trust $B$ to do $X$ in context\n$C$?\" has two conditions. First, $A$ must take $B$'s doing $X$ as a means\ntowards one of $A$'s ends. Second, $A$ must adopt an unquestioning attitude\nconcerning $B$'s doing $X$ in context $C$. This unquestioning attitude is\nsimilar to the attitude introduced in Nguyen 2021.\n  Finally, we explore how contextual trust can help us make sense of trust in\ngeneral non-interpersonal settings, notably that of artificial intelligence\n(AI) systems. The field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) assigns\nparamount importance to the problem of user trust in opaque computational\nmodels, yet does little to give trust diagnostic or even conceptual criteria. I\npropose that contextual trust is a natural fit for the task by illustrating\nthat model transparency and explainability map nicely into our construction of\nthe contexts $C$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 19:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

We introduce a new configuration linear program\n(LP) which we prove is a relaxation of an optimal offline probing algorithm.\nUsing this LP, we establish the following competitive ratios which depend on\nthe model used to generate the instance graph, and the arrival order of its\nonline vertices:\n  - In the worst-case instance model, an optimal $1/e$ ratio when the vertices\narrive in uniformly at random (u.a.r.) order.\n  - In the known independently distributed (i.d.) instance model, an optimal\n$1/2$ ratio when the vertices arrive in adversarial order, and a $1-1/e$ ratio\nwhen the vertices arrive in u.a.r. order.\n  The latter two results improve upon the previous best competitive ratio of\n$0.46$ due to Brubach et al. (Algorithmica 2020), which only held in the more\nrestricted known i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) instance\nmodel. Our $1-1/e$-competitive algorithm matches the best known result for the\nprophet secretary matching problem due to Ehsani et al. (SODA 2018). Our\nalgorithm is efficient and implies a $1-1/e$ approximation ratio for the\nspecial case when the graph is known. This is the offline stochastic matching\nproblem, and we improve upon the $0.42$ approximation ratio for one-sided\npatience due to Pollner et al. (EC 2022), while also generalizing the $1-1/e$\napproximation ratio for unbounded patience due to Gamlath et al. (SODA 2019).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 20:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

In this work, we present a pyramid\nvideo transformer with a dynamic class token generator for egocentric action\nrecognition. Different from previous video transformers, which use the same\nstatic embedding as the class token for diverse inputs, we propose a dynamic\nclass token generator that produces a class token for each input video by\nanalyzing the hand-object interaction and the related motion information. The\ndynamic class token can diffuse such information to the entire model by\ncommunicating with other informative tokens in the subsequent transformer\nlayers. With the dynamic class token, dissimilarity between videos can be more\nprominent, which helps the model distinguish various inputs. In addition,\ntraditional video transformers explore temporal features globally, which\nrequires large amounts of computation. However, egocentric videos often have a\nlarge amount of background scene transition, which causes discontinuities\nacross distant frames.

We discuss recent results on the clustering, composition and\ndistribution of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) in the sky; from the\nenergy of several tens of EeV in the dipole anisotropy, up to the highest\nenergy of a few narrow clusters, those of Hot Spots. Following the early UHECR\ncomposition records deviations from proton, we noted that the UHECR events\nabove 40 EeV can be made not just by any light or heavy nuclei, but mainly by\nthe lightest ones as He,D, Li,Be. The remarkable Virgo absence and the few\nlocalized nearby extragalactic sources, such as CenA, NGC 253 and M82, are\nnaturally understood: lightest UHECR nuclei cannot reach us from the Virgo\ndistance of twenty Mpc, due to their nuclei fragility above a few Mpc\ndistances. Their deflection and smearing in wide hot spots is better tuned to\nthe lighter nuclei than to the preferred proton or heavy nuclei candidate\ncourier. We note that these lightest nuclei still suffer of a partial\nphotodistruction even from such close sources. Therefore, their distruption in\nfragments, within few tens EeV multiplet chain of events, have been expected\nand later on observed by Auger collaboration, nearly a decade ago.

This model, based on the\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model, is combined with a generalized\nKaluza-Klein model. It is well known that phantom dark energy can in principle\nsupport traversable wormholes due to the violation of the null energy condition\n(NEC). Since the phantom divide constitutes a serious barrier, we retain the\ndark-energy assumption $a''(t)>0$ but stay below the phantom divide. The\nviolation of the NEC can only come from the fifth dimension but requires a\ncareful analysis of the scale factor $a(t)$. While needed in the overall model,\ncertain 1-forms lack this scale factor since the extra dimension, often assumed\nto be compactified, would not be affected by the cosmological expansion.

Moreover, we compare our results with\ntwo non-RL baselines previously proposed in the literature named: Single Link\nLess Congested Interface (SLCI) and Multi-Link Congestion-aware Load balancing\nat flow arrivals (MCAA). Simulation results reveal that the MH-RSAC algorithm\nis able to obtain gains in terms of Throughput Drop Ratio (TDR) up to 35.2% and\n6% when compared with the SLCI and MCAA algorithms, respectively. Finally, we\nobserved that our scheme is able to respond more efficiently to high throughput\nand dynamic traffic such as VR and Web Browsing (WB) when compared with the\nbaselines. Results showed an improvement of the MH-RSAC scheme in terms of Flow\nSatisfaction (FS) of up to 25.6% and 6% over the the SCLI and MCAA algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 22:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

Without assuming an underlying theory of\ngravity, we derive a generalised form of the evolution equations for expansion,\nnamely, Raychaudhuri equation (timelike congruences) and Sachs optical equation\n(null congruences). The evolution equations for rotation and shear of both\ntimelike and null congruences are also derived. Generalising the deviation\nequation, we find that torsion and non-metricity contribute to a relative\nacceleration between neighbouring curves. We briefly discuss the interpretation\nof the expansion scalars and derive an equation governing angular diameter\ndistances. The effects of torsion and non-metricity on the distances are found\nto be dependent on whether the photon trajectories are autoparallels or\ngeodesics.

The evolution of these networks over time has motivated several\nrecent studies to identify local communities in temporal networks. Given any\nquery nodes, Community Search aims to find a densely connected subgraph\ncontaining query nodes. However, existing community search approaches in\ntemporal networks have two main limitations: (1) they adopt pre-defined\nsubgraph patterns to model communities, which cannot find communities that do\nnot conform to these patterns in real-world networks, and (2) they only use the\naggregation of disjoint structural information to measure quality, missing the\ndynamic of connections and temporal properties. In this paper, we propose a\nquery-driven Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (CS-TGN) that can capture\nflexible community structures by learning from the ground-truth communities in\na data-driven manner. CS-TGN first combines the local query-dependent structure\nand the global graph embedding in each snapshot of the network and then uses a\nGRU cell with contextual attention to learn the dynamics of interactions and\nupdate node embeddings over time. We demonstrate how this model can be used for\ninteractive community search in an online setting, allowing users to evaluate\nthe found communities and provide feedback. Experiments on real-world temporal\ngraphs with ground-truth communities validate the superior quality of the\nsolutions obtained and the efficiency of our model in both temporal and\ninteractive static settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 22:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

As a result, the approach remains practical even when considering\nlarge numbers of underlying assets, long investment time horizons or very\nfrequent rebalancing events. We prove convergence of the numerical solution to\nthe theoretical optimal solution of a large class of problems under fairly\ngeneral conditions, and present ground truth analyses for a number of popular\nformulations, including mean-variance and mean-conditional value-at-risk\nproblems.

To maximize the\nsynergy between AL and SSL, we focused on the differences between ASSL and AL.\nASSL involves more dynamic model updates than AL due to the use of unlabeled\ndata in the training process, resulting in the temporal instability of the\npredicted probabilities of the unlabeled data.

The pseudo-likelihood approach replaces the joint\ndistribution by a product of the conditional distributions of each variable. We\ncast the conditional distribution as a heteroscedastic regression problem, with\ncovariate-dependent variance terms, to enable information borrowing directly\nfrom the data instead of a hierarchical framework. This allows independent\ngraphical modeling for each subject, while retaining the benefits of a\nhierarchical Bayes model and being computationally tractable. An efficient\nembarrassingly parallel variational algorithm is developed to approximate the\nposterior and obtain estimates of the graphs. Using a fractional variational\nframework, we derive asymptotic risk bounds for the estimate in terms of a\nnovel variant of the $\\alpha$-R\\'{e}nyi divergence.

Motivated by various data\nmodelling problems for which the continuity assumption and/or the IID\nassumption are not appropriate, this article proposes three novel extensions of\nscore matching: (i) to univariate and multivariate ordinal data (including\ncount data); (ii) to INID (independent but not necessarily identically\ndistributed) data models, including regression models with either a continuous\nor a discrete ordinal response; and (iii) to a class of dependent data models\nknown as auto models.

In so doing, the BV\nsymplectic structure determines a compatible cyclic structure on the\n$L_\\infty$-algebra. Moreover, $L_\\infty$ quasi-isomorphisms correspond to\nso-called equivalent reductions (also known as the elimination of generalized\nauxiliary fields) of the respective BV systems.

To facilitate a deeper\nunderstanding, this paper also presents a new regularisation of Neural Network\n(NN) training by introducing a gradient-based term in the loss function. The\nresulting NNs, which we call dtNNs, help us deliver a comprehensive analysis\nabout the strengths and weaknesses of the NN based approaches, how\nincorporating knowledge of the underlying physics affects NN performance, and\nhow this compares with conventional solvers for power system dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 23:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

For example, in\nautonomous driving, the task of object detection is to accurately and\nefficiently identify and locate a large number of predefined classes of object\ninstances (vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, etc.) from videos of roads. In\nrobotics, the industry robot needs to recognize specific machine elements. In\nthe security field, the camera should accurately recognize each face of people.\nWith the wide application of deep learning, the accuracy and efficiency of\nobject detection have been greatly improved, but object detection based on deep\nlearning still faces challenges. Different applications of object detection\nhave different requirements, including highly accurate detection,\nmulti-category object detection, real-time detection, robustness to occlusions,\netc. To address the above challenges, based on extensive literature research,\nthis paper analyzes methods for improving and optimizing mainstream object\ndetection algorithms from the perspective of evolution of one-stage and\ntwo-stage object detection algorithms. Furthermore, this article proposes\nmethods for improving object detection accuracy from the perspective of\nchanging receptive fields. The new model is based on the original YOLOv5 (You\nLook Only Once) with some modifications. The structure of the head part of\nYOLOv5 is modified by adding asymmetrical pooling layers.

In the context of regional-scale energy systems, these problems are\nprohibitively expensive to solve due to large network sizes, heterogeneous node\ncharacteristics, and a large number of operational periods. To maintain\ntractability, traditional approaches aggregate network nodes and/or select a\nset of representative time periods. Often, these reductions do not capture\nsupply-demand variations that crucially impact CEP costs and constraints,\nleading to suboptimal decisions. Here, we propose a novel graph convolutional\nautoencoder approach for spatio-temporal aggregation of a generic CEP with\nheterogeneous nodes (CEPHN). Our architecture leverages graph pooling to\nidentify nodes with similar characteristics and minimizes a multi-objective\nloss function. This loss function is tailored to induce desirable spatial and\ntemporal aggregations with regard to tractability and optimality. In\nparticular, the output of the graph pooling provides a spatial aggregation\nwhile clustering the low-dimensional encoded representations yields a temporal\naggregation.

Specifically, in the\ninformation fusion process, we use the maximum consistency protocol to update\nthe joint estimation states of multi-targets (JESMT) and the area detection\ninformation. The area detection information is represented by the equivalent\nvisiting time map (EVTM), which is built based on the detection probability and\nthe actual visiting time of the area. Then, we model the task assignment\nproblem of multi-UAV searching and tracking multi-targets as a network flow\nmodel with upper and lower flow bounds.

The method replicates the environment\nand employs a simple reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. This strategy might\nbe applied in several sectors, including the electricity generation sector. A\npre-trained model with perception, planning, and action is suggested by the\nresearch. To address optimization problems, such as the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n(UAV) navigation problem, Deep Q-network (DQN), a reinforcement learning-based\nframework that Deepmind launched in 2015, incorporates both deep learning and\nQ-learning. To overcome problems with current procedures, the research proposes\na power plant inspection system incorporating UAV autonomous navigation and DQN\nreinforcement learning. These training processes set reward functions with\nreference to states and consider both internal and external effect factors,\nwhich distinguishes them from other reinforcement learning training techniques\nnow in use. The key components of the reinforcement learning segment of the\ntechnique, for instance, introduce states such as the simulation of a wind\nfield, the battery charge level of an unmanned aerial vehicle, the height the\nUAV reached, etc. The trained model makes it more likely that the inspection\nstrategy will be applied in practice by enabling the UAV to move around on its\nown in difficult environments. The average score of the model converges to\n9,000. The trained model allowed the UAV to make the fewest number of rotations\nnecessary to go to the target point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 00:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

Given a new task to solve, ART selects\ndemonstrations of multi-step reasoning and tool use from a task library. At\ntest time, ART seamlessly pauses generation whenever external tools are called,\nand integrates their output before resuming generation. ART achieves a\nsubstantial improvement over few-shot prompting and automatic CoT on unseen\ntasks in the BigBench and MMLU benchmarks, and matches performance of\nhand-crafted CoT prompts on a majority of these tasks.

In this paper, we propose an exploration method\nthat efficiently encourages cooperative exploration based on the idea of the\ntheoretically justified tree search algorithm UCT (Upper Confidence bounds\napplied to Trees). The high-level intuition is that to perform optimism-based\nexploration, agents would achieve cooperative strategies if each agent's\noptimism estimate captures a structured dependency relationship with other\nagents. At each node (i.e., action) of the search tree, UCT performs\noptimism-based exploration using a bonus derived by conditioning on the\nvisitation count of its parent node. We provide a perspective to view MARL as\ntree search iterations and develop a method called Conditionally Optimistic\nExploration (COE). We assume agents take actions following a sequential order,\nand consider nodes at the same depth of the search tree as actions of one\nindividual agent. COE computes each agent's state-action value estimate with an\noptimistic bonus derived from the visitation count of the state and joint\nactions taken by agents up to the current agent. COE is adaptable to any value\ndecomposition method for centralized training with decentralized execution.\nExperiments across various cooperative MARL benchmarks show that COE\noutperforms current state-of-the-art exploration methods on hard-exploration\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 02:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

Such motivated, we propose a UFER method with contrastive local\nwarping (ContraWarping), which leverages the insight that the emotional\nexpression is robust to current global transformation (affine transformation,\ncolor jitter, etc.) but can be easily changed by random local warping.\nTherefore, given a facial image, ContraWarping employs some global\ntransformations and local warping to generate its positive and negative samples\nand sets up a novel contrastive learning framework. Our in-depth investigation\nshows that: 1) the positive pairs from global transformations may be exploited\nwith general self-supervised learning (e.g., BYOL) and already bring some\ninformative features, and 2) the negative pairs from local warping explicitly\nintroduce expression-related variation and further bring substantial\nimprovement.

Challenges in adapting transformer for HSI arise\nfrom the capabilities to tackle existing limitations of CNN-based methods in\ncapturing the global and local spatial-spectral correlations while maintaining\nefficiency and flexibility. To address these issues, we introduce a hybrid\napproach that combines the advantages of both models with a Spatial-Spectral\nSeparable Convolution (S3Conv), Guided Spectral Self-Attention (GSSA), and\nSelf-Modulated Feed-Forward Network (SM-FFN). Our S3Conv works as a lightweight\nalternative to 3D convolution, which extracts more spatial-spectral correlated\nfeatures while keeping the flexibility to tackle HSIs with an arbitrary number\nof bands. These features are then adaptively processed by GSSA which per-forms\n3D self-attention across the spectral bands, guided by a set of learnable\nqueries that encode the spectral signatures. This not only enriches our model\nwith powerful capabilities for identifying global spectral correlations but\nalso maintains linear complexity. Moreover, our SM-FFN proposes the\nself-modulation that intensifies the activations of more informative regions,\nwhich further strengthens the aggregated features.

Recently, discriminative models via a temporal class activation\nmapping (CAM) method have been explored. Although results are promising,\nobjects are assumed to have minimal movement leading to degradation in\nperformance for relatively long-term dependencies. In this paper, a novel\nCoLo-CAM method for object localization is proposed to leverage spatiotemporal\ninformation in activation maps without any assumptions about object movement.\nOver a given sequence of frames, explicit joint learning of localization is\nproduced across these maps based on color cues, by assuming an object has\nsimilar color across frames. The CAMs' activations are constrained to activate\nsimilarly over pixels with similar colors, achieving co-localization. This\njoint learning creates direct communication among pixels across all image\nlocations, and over all frames, allowing for transfer, aggregation, and\ncorrection of learned localization. This is achieved by minimizing a color term\nof a CRF loss over joint images/maps. In addition to our multi-frame\nconstraint, we impose per-frame local constraints including pseudo-labels, and\nCRF loss in combination with a global size constraint to improve per-frame\nlocalization. Empirical experiments on two challenging datasets for\nunconstrained videos, YouTube-Objects, show the merits of our method, and its\nrobustness to long-term dependencies, leading to new state-of-the-art\nlocalization performance.

The goal of this contribution is twofold.\nFirstly, we provide a framework to identify suitable reaction coordinates for\nthe system starting from the microscopic properties of the interaction\nstructure among the agents. We state conditions on the interactions that lead\nto a dimension reduction of the system in terms of a finite number of reaction\ncoordinates. Secondly, we show that such reaction coordinates prove to be\nproper nonequilibrium thermodynamic variables as they carry information on\ncorrelation and memory properties and provide the natural way to probe the\nsensitivity of the system to external perturbations.

To enhance the generalization ability of\nthe architecture, L2-regularization (REG) is considered along with the maximum\nmargin (MM) criterion in the learning process. To highlight cell features, this\npaper investigates the effectiveness of two generic high-pass filters: ideal\nhigh-pass filtering and the Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) filtering. On both\nHEp-2 and Feulgen benchmark datasets, the t-SPN architecture learned based on\nthe max-margin criterion with regularization produced the highest accuracy rate\ncompared to other state-of-the-art algorithms that include convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) based algorithms. The ideal high-pass filter was more effective\non the HEp-2 dataset, which is based on immunofluorescence staining, while the\nLOG was more effective on the Feulgen dataset, which is based on Feulgen\nstaining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 03:45:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 02:34:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 02:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

However, the\nnon-differentiability of the SVM hinge loss function can lead to computational\ndifficulties in high dimensional settings. To overcome this problem, we rely on\nBernstein polynomial and propose a new smoothed version of the SVM hinge loss\ncalled the Bernstein support vector machine (BernSVM), which is suitable for\nthe high dimension $p >> n$ regime. As the BernSVM objective loss function is\nof the class $C^2$, we propose two efficient algorithms for computing the\nsolution of the penalized BernSVM. The first algorithm is based on coordinate\ndescent with maximization-majorization (MM) principle and the second one is\nIRLS-type algorithm (iterative re-weighted least squares). Under standard\nassumptions, we derive a cone condition and a restricted strong convexity to\nestablish an upper bound for the weighted Lasso BernSVM estimator. Using a\nlocal linear approximation, we extend the latter result to penalized BernSVM\nwith non convex penalties SCAD and MCP. Our bound holds with high probability\nand achieves a rate of order $\\sqrt{s\\log(p)/n}$, where $s$ is the number of\nactive features.

An important fact is that, given a polynomial formula with\n$n$ variables, the zero level set of the polynomials in the formula decomposes\nthe $n$-dimensional real space into finitely many components (cells) and every\npolynomial has constant sign in each cell. The key point of our algorithm is a\nnew operation based on real root isolation, called cell-jump, which updates the\ncurrent assignment along a given direction such that the assignment can `jump'\nfrom one cell to another. One cell-jump may adjust the values of several\nvariables while traditional local search operations, such as flip for SAT and\ncritical move for SMT(LIA), only change that of one variable. We also design a\ntwo-level operation selection to balance the success rate and efficiency.\nFurthermore, our algorithm can be easily generalized to a wider subclass of\nSMT(NRA) where polynomial equations linear with respect to some variable are\nallowed.

How would we reduce the number of affected nodes in the\nspreading process? This question appears in recent studies about implementing\nmobility interventions on mobility networks (Chang et al. (2021)). A practical\nalgorithm to reduce infections on unweighted graphs is to remove edges with the\nhighest edge centrality score (Tong et al. (2012)), which is the product of two\nadjacent nodes' eigenscores. However, mobility networks have weighted edges;\nThus, an intervention measure would involve edge-weight reduction besides edge\nremoval. Motivated by this example, we revisit the problem of minimizing top\neigenvalue(s) on weighted graphs by decreasing edge weights up to a fixed\nbudget. We observe that the edge centrality score of Tong et al. (2012) is\nequal to the gradient of the largest eigenvalue of $WW^{\\top}$, where $W$\ndenotes the weight matrix of the graph. We then present generalized edge\ncentrality scores as the gradient of the sum of the largest $r$ eigenvalues of\n$WW^{\\top}$. With this generalization, we design an iterative algorithm to find\nthe optimal edge-weight reduction to shrink the largest $r$ eigenvalues of\n$WW^{\\top}$ under a given edge-weight reduction budget. We also extend our\nalgorithm and its guarantee to time-varying graphs, whose weights evolve over\ntime. We perform a detailed empirical study to validate our approach. Our\nalgorithm significantly reduces the number of infections compared with existing\nmethods on eleven weighted networks. Further, we illustrate several properties\nof our algorithm, including the benefit of choosing the rank $r$, fast\nconvergence to global optimum, and an almost linear runtime per iteration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 05:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

Computational modeling provides a framework for\nquantitatively describing BHVs in the preclinical phase.

Bovine\npericardium (BP) is widely used as BHV leaflets. Previous computational studies\nassume BP density to be close to the density of water or blood. However, BP\nleaflets undergo multiple treatments such as fixation and anti-calcification.\nThe present study aims to measure the density of the BP used in BHVs and\ndetermine its effect on leaflet stress distribution.\n  Methods: We determined the density of eight square BP samples laser cut from\nEdwards BP patches. The weight of specimens was measured using an A&D\nAnalytical Balance, and volume was measured by high-resolution imaging. Finite\nelement models of a BHV similar to PERIMOUNT Magna were developed in ABAQUS.\n  Results: The average density value of the BP samples was 1410 kg/m3.

We introduce a\nBayesian probabilistic resolution to prompt learning, where the label-specific\nstochastic prompts are generated hierarchically by first sampling a latent\nvector from an underlying distribution and then employing a lightweight\ngenerative model. Importantly, we semantically regularize prompt learning with\nthe visual knowledge and view images and the corresponding prompts as patch and\ntoken sets under optimal transport, which pushes the prompt tokens to\nfaithfully capture the label-specific visual concepts, instead of overfitting\nthe training categories. Moreover, the proposed model can also be\nstraightforwardly extended to the conditional case where the\ninstance-conditional prompts are generated to improve the generalizability.\nExtensive experiments on 15 datasets show promising transferability and\ngeneralization performance of our proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 06:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

In this paper, we\nmitigate the cross-modal data bias for RRG from a new perspective, i.e.,\nvisual-linguistic causal intervention, and propose a novel Visual-Linguistic\nCausal Intervention (VLCI) framework for RRG, which consists of a visual\ndeconfounding module (VDM) and a linguistic deconfounding module (LDM), to\nimplicitly deconfound the visual-linguistic confounder by causal front-door\nintervention. Specifically, the VDM explores and disentangles the visual\nconfounder from the patch-based local and global features without object\ndetection due to the absence of universal clinic semantic extraction.\nSimultaneously, the LDM eliminates the linguistic confounder caused by salient\nvisual features and high-frequency context without constructing specific\ndictionaries. Extensive experiments on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets show that\nour VLCI outperforms the state-of-the-art RRG methods significantly.

Since cause\nof death is not easy to collect or is not necessarily reliable in cancer\nregistries, some special methodologies have been introduced and widely used by\nusing the concepts of the relative survival ratio and the net survival. In\nmaking inference of those measures, external life tables of the general\npopulation are utilized to adjust the impact of non-cancer death on overall\nsurvival. The validity of this adjustment relies on the assumption that\nmortality in the external life table approximates non-cancer mortality of\ncancer patients.

We first train a neural network for generating photorealistic\nstylized 3D LUTs on a large-scale dataset; then, when performing photorealistic\nstyle transfer for a specific video, we select a keyframe and style image in\nthe video as the data source and fine-turn the neural network; finally, we\nquery the 3D LUTs generated by the fine-tuned neural network for the colors in\nthe video, resulting in a super-fast photorealistic style transfer, even\nprocessing 8K video takes less than 2 millisecond per frame. The experimental\nresults show that our method not only realizes the photorealistic style\ntransfer of arbitrary style images but also outperforms the existing methods in\nterms of visual quality and consistency.

To\nmitigate this issue, recent studies have proposed the use of an additional\nfrozen pre-trained CLIP for classification.

The task planner is a\nrecurrent network using the latest image observation sequence to hallucinate a\nfeature as the next-best exploration goal. The motion planner then utilizes the\ncurrent and the hallucinated features to generate an action taking the agent\ntowards that goal. The two planners are jointly trained via deeply-supervised\nimitation learning from expert demonstrations. During exploration, we\niteratively call the two planners to predict the next action, and the\ntopological map is built by constantly appending the latest image observation\nand action to the map and using visual place recognition (VPR) for loop\nclosing. The resulting topological map efficiently represents an environment's\nconnectivity and traversability, so it can be used for tasks such as visual\nnavigation.

The participants' naming times are delayed in the\npresence of a distractor (general interference). The size of this effect\ndepends on the relationship between the target and distractor words.\nDistractors of the same semantic category create more interference (semantic\ninterference), distractors overlapping in phonology create less interference\n(phonological facilitation). The present study examines the relationships\nbetween these experimental effects, processing times, and attention in order to\nbetter understand the cognitive processes underlying participants' behavior in\nthis paradigm. Participants named pictures with a superimposed line of Xs,\nsemantically related distractors, phonologically related distractors, or\nunrelated distractors. General interference, semantic interference, and\nphonological facilitation effects are replicated. Distributional analyses\nreveal that general and semantic interference effects increase with naming\ntimes, while phonological facilitation decreases.

In this\nscenario, a precise evaluation of the DSF for a 1D quantum system with\narbitrary interaction strength remains a formidable task. In this paper, we use\nthe form factor approach based on algebraic Bethe ansatz theory to calculate\nprecisely the DSF of Lieb-Liniger model with an arbitrary interaction strength\nat a large scale of particle number. We find that the DSF for a system as large\nas 2000 particles enables us to depict precisely its line-shape from which the\npower-law singularity with corresponding exponents in the vicinities of\nspectral thresholds naturally emerge. It should be noted that, the advantage of\nour algorithm promises an access to the threshold behavior of dynamical\ncorrelation functions, further confirming the validity of nonlinear TLL theory\nbesides Kitanine et. al. 2012 J.

Based on their compositions, these magnetic electrides can be\nclassified as magnetic semiconductors, metals, or half-metals, each with unique\ntopological states and excellent catalytic performance for N2 fixation due to\ntheir low work functions and excess electrons. The novel properties of magnetic\nelectrides suggest potential applications in spintronics, topological\nelectronics, electron emission, and as high-performance catalysts. This work\nmarks the beginning of a new era in the identification, investigation, and\npractical applications of magnetic electrides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 11:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

Specifically, the employed student model is\ninitially a heavy model to fruitfully learn distilled knowledge in the early\ntraining epochs, and the student model is gradually compressed during the\ntraining. To dynamically adjust the model capacity, our dynamic framework\ninserts a learnable convolutional layer within each residual block in the\nstudent model as the channel importance indicator.

Identifying quantum features that cannot be\nreproduced by any classical means is key for quantum technology. This task is\noften pursued by comparing the quantum system of interest to a suitable\nclassical counterpart. However, the WPD implies that a comparison to a single\nclassical model is generally insufficient; at least one wave and one particle\nmodel should be considered. Here we exploit this insight and contrast a bosonic\nquantum heat engine with two classical counterparts, one based on waves and one\nbased on particles.

However, directly using CLIP to guide the transfer of style\nleads to undesirable artifacts (mainly written words and unrelated visual\nentities) spread over the image, partly due to the entanglement of visual and\nwritten concepts inherent in CLIP. Inspired by the use of spectral analysis in\nfiltering linguistic information at different granular levels, we analyse the\npatch embeddings from the last layer of the CLIP vision encoder from the\nperspective of spectral analysis and find that the presence of undesirable\nartifacts is highly correlated to some certain frequency components.

However, single-point\npredictions fail to account for prediction uncertainty that is critical for\nmany transportation management scenarios, such as determining the best- or\nworst-case arrival time. We present QuanTraffic, a generic framework to enhance\nthe capability of an arbitrary DNN model for uncertainty modeling. QuanTraffic\nrequires little human involvement and does not change the base DNN architecture\nduring deployment. Instead, it automatically learns a standard quantile\nfunction during the DNN model training to produce a prediction interval for the\nsingle-point prediction. The prediction interval defines a range where the true\nvalue of the traffic prediction is likely to fall. Furthermore, QuanTraffic\ndevelops an adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts the prediction interval\nbased on the location and prediction window of the test input. We evaluated\nQuanTraffic by applying it to five representative DNN models for traffic\nforecasting across seven public datasets.

Similar to the High Order\nSpectral method, the CEEEs can be derived up to arbitrary order in wave\nsteepness. In contrast, they have a temporal scale as slow as the rate of\nchange of a wave spectrum and allow for the wave fields prescribed on a\ncomputational (spatial) domain with a much larger size and with spacing longer\nthan the characteristic wavelength at no expense of accuracy and numerical\nefficiency.

By their\npermissionless nature, such systems are heterogeneous: participants may only\nhave a partial view of the system, and they may also have different goals and\nbeliefs. Thus, the traditional notion of consensus -- i.e. system-wide\nagreement -- may not be adequate, and we may need to generalise it.\n  This is a challenge: how should we understand what heterogeneous consensus\nis; what mathematical framework might this require; and how can we use this to\nbuild understanding and mathematical models of robust, effective, and secure\npermissionless systems in practice?\n  We analyse heterogeneous consensus using semitopology as a framework. This is\nlike topology, but without the restriction that intersections of opens be open.\n  Semitopologies have a rich theory which is related to topology, but with its\nown distinct character and mathematics.

To address this issue, we\npropose a novel image representation called DIffusion Reconstruction Error\n(DIRE), which measures the error between an input image and its reconstruction\ncounterpart by a pre-trained diffusion model.

The\nEkman flow over a smooth wall is a simplified configuration of the Atmospheric\nBoundary Layer (ABL) where effects of both stratification and rotation are\npresent. In this study, hairpin-like structures are investigated by treating\nthem as slender vortex filaments, i.e., a vortex filament whose diameter $d$ is\nsmall when compared to its radius of curvature $R$. The corrected thin-tube\nmodel of Klein and Knio [J. Fluid Mech. (1995)] is used to compute the motion\nof these filaments with the ABL as a background flow. The influence of the mean\nbackground flow on the filaments is studied for two stably stratified cases and\na neutrally stratified case. Our results suggest that the orientation of the\nhairpin filament in the spanwise direction is linked to its initial starting\nheight under stable stratification whereas no such dependency can be observed\nwith the neutrally stratified background flow. An improved feature tracking\nscheme based on spatial overlap for tracking $Q$-criterion vortex structures on\nthe Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data is also developed.

The calculation of entropy density is carried out by\nnumerical simulations of $O(a^{4})$ mean-field improved energy-momentum tensor\n(EMT) of SU(3) gauge theory on the lattice. We expand on reaching $O(a^{4})$\nimprovement using tadpole-improved Symanzik action. The entropy density is\ncalculated directly from the expectation value of the space-time component of\nthe improved EMT in the presence of shifted boundary conditions at several\nlattice spacings ($a \\approx 0.043 - 0.012$ fm). The absence of ultraviolet\ndivergences and the minimal finite-size effects allow for the precision\ndetermination of the entropy density and its extrapolation to the continuum\nlimit.

If drift is present, machine\nlearning models can become inaccurate and need adjustment. While there do exist\nmethods to detect concept drift or to adjust models in the presence of observed\ndrift, the question of explaining drift, i.e., describing the potentially\ncomplex and high dimensional change of distribution in a human-understandable\nfashion, has hardly been considered so far. This problem is of importance since\nit enables an inspection of the most prominent characteristics of how and where\ndrift manifests itself. Hence, it enables human understanding of the change and\nit increases acceptance of life-long learning models. In this paper, we present\na novel technology characterizing concept drift in terms of the characteristic\nchange of spatial features based on various explanation techniques. To do so,\nwe propose a methodology to reduce the explanation of concept drift to an\nexplanation of models that are trained in a suitable way extracting relevant\ninformation regarding the drift. This way a large variety of explanation\nschemes is available. Thus, a suitable method can be selected for the problem\nof drift explanation at hand.

Instrumental errors, irregular time sampling, and different noise\nsources originating in the intrinsic variability of the star can hinder the\ninterpretation of the data, and even lead to spurious detections. In recent\ntimes, work began to emerge in the field of extrasolar planets that use Machine\nLearning algorithms, some with results that exceed those obtained with the\ntraditional techniques in the field. We seek to explore the scope of the neural\nnetworks in the radial velocity method, in particular for exoplanet detection\nin the presence of correlated noise of stellar origin. In this work, a neural\nnetwork is proposed to replace the computation of the significance of the\nsignal detected with the radial velocity method and to classify it as of\nplanetary origin or not. The algorithm is trained using synthetic data of\nsystems with and without planetary companions. We injected realistic correlated\nnoise in the simulations, based on previous studies of the behaviour of stellar\nactivity. The performance of the network is compared to the traditional method\nbased on null hypothesis significance testing. The network achieves 28 % fewer\nfalse positives.

In addition, its\nexecution time is five orders of magnitude faster than the traditional method.\nThe superior performance exhibited by the algorithm has only been tested on\nsimulated radial velocity data so far. Although in principle it should be\nstraightforward to adapt it for use in real time series, its performance has to\nbe tested thoroughly.

The two main\napproaches are based on either partial absorption of the neutrino flux as it\npropagates through the Earth (at energies about a few TeV) or on coherent Earth\nmatter effects affecting the neutrino oscillations pattern (at energies below a\nfew tens of GeV). In this work, we consider the latter approach focusing on\nsupernova neutrinos with tens of MeV. Whereas at GeV energies, Earth matter\neffects are driven by the atmospheric mass-squared difference, at energies\nbelow $\\sim 100$~MeV, it is the solar mass-squared difference what controls\nthem. Unlike solar neutrinos, which suffer from significant weakening of the\ncontribution to the oscillatory effect from remote structures due to the\nneutrino energy reconstruction capabilities of detectors, supernova neutrinos\ncan have higher energies and thus, can better probe the Earth's interior. We\nshall revisit this possibility, using the most recent neutrino oscillation\nparameters and up-to-date supernova neutrino spectra. The capabilities of\nfuture neutrino detectors, such as DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande and JUNO are\npresented, including the impact of the energy resolution and other factors.\nAssuming a supernova burst at 10~kpc, we show that the average Earth's core\ndensity could be determined within $\\lesssim 10\\%$ at $1\\sigma$ confidence\nlevel, being Hyper-Kamiokande, with its largest mass, the most promising\ndetector to achieve this goal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 14:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

However, removing shadows over dynamic scenes remains largely\nunder-explored. In this paper, we propose the first data-driven video shadow\nremoval model, termed PSTNet, by exploiting three essential characteristics of\nvideo shadows, i.e., physical property, spatio relation, and temporal\ncoherence. Specifically, a dedicated physical branch was established to conduct\nlocal illumination estimation, which is more applicable for scenes with complex\nlighting and textures, and then enhance the physical features via a mask-guided\nattention strategy. Then, we develop a progressive aggregation module to\nenhance the spatio and temporal characteristics of features maps, and\neffectively integrate the three kinds of features. Furthermore, to tackle the\nlack of datasets of paired shadow videos, we synthesize a dataset (SVSRD-85)\nwith aid of the popular game GTAV by controlling the switch of the shadow\nrenderer. Experiments against 9 state-of-the-art models, including image shadow\nremovers and image/video restoration methods, show that our method improves the\nbest SOTA in terms of RMSE error for the shadow area by 14.7. In addition, we\ndevelop a lightweight model adaptation strategy to make our synthetic-driven\nmodel effective in real world scenes.

We obtain the near-infrared to\nultraviolet extinction towards 50 stars in the core of R136, employing the\n`extinction without standards' method. To assure good fits over the full\nwavelength range, we combine and modify existing extinction laws. We detect a\nstrong spatial gradient in the extinction properties across the core of R136,\ncoinciding with a gradient in density of cold gas that is part of a molecular\ncloud lying northeast of the cluster. In line with previous measurements of\nR136 and the 30 Doradus region, we obtain a high total-to-relative extinction\n($R_V = 4.38 \\pm 0.87$). However, the high values of $R_V$ are accompanied by\nrelatively strong extinction in the ultraviolet, contrary to what is observed\nfor Galactic sightlines. The relatively strong ultraviolet extinction suggests\nthat the properties of the dust towards R136 differ from those in the Milky\nWay. For $R_{V} \\sim 4.4$, about three times fewer ultraviolet photons can\nescape from the ambient dust environment relative to the canonical Galactic\nvalue of $R_{V} \\sim 3.1$ at the same $A_{V}$. Therefore, if dust in the R136\nstar-bursting environment is characteristic for cosmologically distant\nstar-bursting regions, the escape fraction of ultraviolet photons from such\nregions is overestimated by a factor of three relative to the standard Milky\nWay assumption for the total-to-selective extinction. Furthermore, a comparison\nwith average curves tailored to other regions of the LMC shows that large\ndifferences in ultraviolet extinction exist within this galaxy. Further\ninvestigation is required in order to decipher whether or not there is a\nrelation between $R_V$ and ultraviolet extinction in the LMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 15:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

HAT sets a new standard in\ncomputational attention, which emphasizes both effectiveness and generality.\nHAT's demonstrated scope and applicability will likely inspire the development\nof new attention models that can better predict human behavior in various\nattention-demanding scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 15:13:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 15:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

The ALMA\nCO(2-1) line detections allow to retrieve the gas mass-loss rates (Mdot_CO). In\ncontrast to mass-loss rates derived from the analysis of dust spectral features\n(Mdot_SED), the data allow a direct determination of the wind velocity and no\nuncertain dust-to-gas correction factor is needed. Results: Five RSGs in RSGC1\nhave been detected in CO(2-1). The retrieved Mdot_CO values are systematically\nlower than Mdot_SED. Although only five RSGs in RSGC1 have been detected, the\ndata allow to propose a new mass-loss rate relation for M-type red supergiants\nthat is dependent on luminosity and initial mass. The new mass-loss rate\nrelation is based on the new Mdot_CO values for the RSGs in RSGC1 and on prior\nMdot_SED values for RSGs in 4 clusters, including RSGC1. The new\nMdot-prescription yields a good prediction for the mass-loss rate of some\nwell-known Galactic RSGs that are observed in multiple CO rotational lines,\nincluding alpha Ori, mu Cep and VX Sgr. However, there are indications that a\nstronger, potentially eruptive, mass-loss process - different than captured by\nour new mass-loss rate prescription - is occurring during some fraction of the\nRSG lifetime. Implementing a lower mass-loss rate in evolution codes for\nmassive stars has important consequences for the nature of their end-state. A\nreduction of the RSG mass-loss rate implies that quiescent RSG mass loss is not\nenough to strip a single star's hydrogen-rich envelope. Upon core-collapse such\nsingle stars would explode as RSG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 15:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

Autonomous driving is expected to\ncontinue gradually overtaking all critical driving functions, which is adding\nto the complexity of the certification of autonomous driving systems. As a\nresponse, certification authorities have already started introducing strategies\nfor the certification of autonomous vehicles and their software. But even with\nthese new approaches, the certification procedures are not fully catching up\nwith the dynamism and unpredictability of future autonomous systems, and thus\nmay not necessarily guarantee compliance with all requirements imposed on these\nsystems. In this paper, we identified a number of issues with the proposed\ncertification strategies, which may impact the systems substantially. For\ninstance, we emphasize the lack of adequate reflection on software changes\noccurring in constantly changing systems, or low support for systems'\ncooperation needed for the management of coordinated moves. Other shortcomings\nconcern the narrow focus of the awarded certification by neglecting aspects\nsuch as the ethical behavior of autonomous software systems. The contribution\nof this paper is threefold. First, we discuss the motivation for the need to\nmodify the current certification processes for autonomous driving systems.\nSecond, we analyze current international standards used in the certification\nprocesses towards requirements derived from the requirements laid on dynamic\nsoftware ecosystems and autonomous systems themselves.

Radio systems at millimeter-wave (mmWave)\nfrequencies advantageously bring large bandwidth, multi-antenna array and beam\nsteering capability. \\textit{However}, the human point cloud obtained by mmWave\nradar and utilized for posture estimation is likely to be sparse and\nincomplete. Additionally, human's random body movements deteriorate the\nestimation of breathing and heart rates, therefore the information of the chest\nlocation and a narrow radar beam toward the chest are demanded for more\naccurate vital sign estimation.\n  In this paper, we propose a pipeline aiming to enhance the vital sign\nestimation performance of mmWave FMCW MIMO radar. The first step is to\nrecognize human body part and posture, where we exploit a trained Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNN) to efficiently process the imperfect human form point\ncloud. The CNN framework outputs the key point of different body parts, and was\ntrained by using RGB image reference and Augmentative Ellipse Fitting Algorithm\n(AEFA). The next step is to utilize the chest information of the prior\nestimated human posture for vital sign estimation. While CNN is initially\ntrained based on the frame-by-frame point clouds of human for posture\nestimation, the vital signs are extracted through beamforming toward the human\nchest.\n  The numerical results show that this spatial filtering improves the\nestimation of the vital signs in regard to lowering the level of side harmonics\nand detecting the harmonics of vital signs efficiently, i.e., peak-to-average\npower ratio in the harmonics of vital signal is improved up to 0.02 and 0.07dB\nfor the studied cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 15:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

This limitation is particularly important when image analysis requires\nthe use of deconvolution methods. As the PSF is a complex and time-varying\nfunction, reference PSFs acquired on calibration stars before or after the\nscientific observation can be too different from the actual PSF of the\nobservation to be used for deconvolution, and lead to artefacts in the final\nimage. We improved the existing PSF-estimation method based on the so-called\nmarginal approach by enhancing the object prior in order to make it more robust\nand suitable for observations of resolved extended objects. Our process is\nbased on a two-step blind deconvolution approach from the literature. The first\nstep consists of PSF estimation from the science image. For this, we made use\nof an analytical PSF model, whose parameters are estimated based on a marginal\nalgorithm. This PSF was then used for deconvolution. In this study, we first\ninvestigated the requirements in terms of PSF parameter knowledge to obtain an\naccurate and yet resilient deconvolution process using simulations. We show\nthat current marginal algorithms do not provide the required level of accuracy,\nespecially in the presence of small objects.

The computational\ncomplexity of MPS methods is known to be related to the growth of entropies of\nreduced density matrices for bipartitions of the chain. While for closed\nsystems the entropy relevant for the complexity is uniquely defined by the\nentanglement entropy, for open systems it depends on the choice of the\nrepresentation. Here, we systematically compare the growth of different\nentropies relevant to the complexity of matrix product representations in\nopen-system simulations. We simulate an XXZ spin-1/2 chain in the presence of\nspontaneous emission/absorption and dephasing. We compare simulations using a\nrepresentation of the full density matrix as a matrix product density operator\n(MPDO) with a quantum trajectory unravelling, where each trajectory is itself\nrepresented by an MPS (QT+MPS).

Although QT+MPS requires a smaller local state space, the more\nfavorable entropy growth can thus make MPDO simulations fundamentally more\nefficient than QT+MPS.

The traditional docking methods are\nnormally extensively time-consuming, and their performance in blind docking\nremains to be improved. Although the runtime of docking based on machine\nlearning is significantly decreased, their accuracy is still limited. In this\nstudy, we take the advantage of both traditional and machine-learning based\nmethods, and present a method Deep Site and Docking Pose (DSDP) to improve the\nperformance of blind docking. For the traditional blind docking, the entire\nprotein is covered by a cube, and the initial positions of ligands are randomly\ngenerated in the cube. In contract, DSDP can predict the binding site of\nproteins and provide an accurate searching space and initial positions for the\nfurther conformational sampling. The docking task of DSDP makes use of the\nscore function and a similar but modified searching strategy of AutoDock Vina,\naccelerated by implementation in GPUs.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Uni-Mol+ to tackle\nthis challenge. Firstly, given a 2D molecular graph, Uni-Mol+ generates an\ninitial 3D conformation from inexpensive methods such as RDKit. Then, the\ninitial conformation is iteratively optimized to its equilibrium conformation,\nand the optimized conformation is further used to predict the QC properties.\nAll these steps are automatically learned using Transformer models.

To effectively optimize conformation, we introduce a two-track\nTransformer model backbone in Uni-Mol+ and train it together with the QC\nproperty prediction task.

In such models, some equations involving\nempirically obtained functions of the membrane potential are usually defined.\nThe best known of these models, the Hodgkin-Huxley model, is an example of this\nparadigm since it defines the conductances of ion channels in terms of the\nopening and closing rates of each type of gate present in the channels. These\nfunctions need to be derived from laboratory measurements that are often very\nexpensive and produce little data because they involve a time-space-independent\nmeasurement of the voltage in a single channel of the cell membrane. In this\nwork, we investigate the possibility of finding the Hodgkin-Huxley model's\nparametric functions using only two simple measurements (the membrane voltage\nas a function of time and the injected current that triggered that voltage) and\napplying Deep Learning methods to estimate these functions. This would result\nin an hybrid model of the action potential generation composed by the original\nHodgkin-Huxley equations and an Artificial Neural Network that requires a small\nset of easy-to-perform measurements to be trained. Experiments were carried out\nusing data generated from the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, and results show\nthat a simple two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) architecture trained on\na minimal amount of data can learn to model some of the fundamental proprieties\nof the action potential generation by estimating the model's rate functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 22:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

This is an\ninteresting area of inquiry for two reasons. First, typed lambda calculi are\nthe lingua franc of programming languages. A set of heuristics that relate\nvarious typed lambda calculi to effective neural architectures would provide a\nsystematic method for mapping language features (e.g., polymorphism, subtyping,\ninheritance, etc.) to architecture choices. Second, transformer models are\nwidely used in deep learning architectures applied to code, but the design and\nhyperparameter space for them is large and relatively unexplored in programming\nlanguage applications. Therefore, we suggest a benchmark that allows us to\nexplore exactly this through perhaps the simplest and most fundamental property\nof a programming language: the relationship between terms and types.\nConsequently, we begin this inquiry of transformer architectures for typed\nlambda calculi by exploring the effect of transformer warm-up and optimizer\nselection in the task of type inference: i.e., predicting the types of lambda\ncalculus terms using only transformers. We find that the optimization landscape\nis difficult even in this simple setting. One particular experimental finding\nis that optimization by Adafactor converges much faster compared to the\noptimization by Adam and RAdam. We conjecture that such different performance\nof optimizers might be related to the difficulties of generalization over\nformally generated dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 17:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}
