The current mainstream\napproaches use either the perspective view retrieval perspective view (P2P)\nparadigm or the equirectangular image retrieval equirectangular image (E2E)\nparadigm. However, a natural and practical idea is that users only have\nconsumer-grade pinhole cameras to obtain query perspective images and retrieve\nthem in panoramic database images from map providers. To this end, we propose\nPanoVPR, a sliding-window-based perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) visual\nplace recognition framework, which eliminates feature truncation caused by hard\ncropping by sliding windows over the whole equirectangular image and computing\nand comparing feature descriptors between windows. In addition, this unified\nframework allows for directly transferring the network structure used in\nperspective-to-perspective (P2P) methods without modification. To facilitate\ntraining and evaluation, we derive the pitts250k-P2E dataset from the pitts250k\nand achieve promising results, and we also establish a P2E dataset in a\nreal-world scenario by a mobile robot platform, which we refer to YQ360.

However, comparatively little attention has been paid to estimating\nthe expectation values of other observables with respect to said ground states,\nwhich is important for many industrial applications. In this work we present a\nnovel expectation value estimation (EVE) quantum algorithm which can be applied\nto estimate the expectation values of arbitrary observables with respect to any\nof the system's eigenstates. In particular, we consider two variants of EVE:\nstd-EVE, based on standard quantum phase estimation, and QSP-EVE, which\nutilizes quantum signal processing (QSP) techniques. We provide rigorous error\nanalysis for both both variants and minimize the number of individual phase\nfactors for QSPEVE. These error analyses enable us to produce constant-factor\nquantum resource estimates for both std-EVE and QSP-EVE across a variety of\nmolecular systems and observables. For the systems considered, we show that\nQSP-EVE reduces (Toffoli) gate counts by up to three orders of magnitude and\nreduces qubit width by up to 25% compared to std-EVE. While estimated resource\ncounts remain far too high for the first generations of fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputers, our estimates mark a first of their kind for both the application of\nexpectation value estimation and modern QSP-based techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 16:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

This paper\nfocuses on developing neural representations for a more practical setup --\nencoding long and/or a large number of videos with diverse visual content. We\nfirst show that instead of dividing videos into small subsets and encoding them\nwith separate models, encoding long and diverse videos jointly with a unified\nmodel achieves better compression results.

Initially, a synthetic dataset is generated that\nmirrors the ten classes of the already available CIFAR-10 dataset with latent\ndiffusion which provides a contrasting set of images for comparison to real\nphotographs. The model is capable of generating complex visual attributes, such\nas photorealistic reflections in water. The two sets of data present as a\nbinary classification problem with regard to whether the photograph is real or\ngenerated by AI.

While no evidence has been found in\nthe literature that correlates poverty and overall criminality rates, this\npaper offers evidence of a collective belief that associates both concepts.\nThis brief report measures the societal bias that correlates criminality with\nthe poor, as compared to the rich, by using Natural Language Processing (NLP)\ntechniques in Twitter. The paper quantifies the level of crime-poverty bias in\na panel of eight different English-speaking countries. The regional differences\nin the association between crime and poverty cannot be justified based on\ndifferent levels of inequality or unemployment, which the literature correlates\nto property crimes.

In recent years, many studies have utilized multi-modal pre-trained\nmodels with stronger generative capabilities to reconstruct images that are\nsemantically similar to the original ones.

However, being temporal models,\nSNNs depend heavily on expressive states to generate predictions on par with\nclassical artificial neural networks (ANNs). These states converge only after\nlong transient periods, and quickly decay without input data, leading to higher\nlatency, power consumption, and lower accuracy. This work addresses this issue\nby initializing the state with an auxiliary ANN running at a low rate. The SNN\nthen uses the state to generate predictions with high temporal resolution until\nthe next initialization phase. Our hybrid ANN-SNN model thus combines the best\nof both worlds: It does not suffer from long state transients and state decay\nthanks to the ANN, and can generate predictions with high temporal resolution,\nlow latency, and low power thanks to the SNN. We show for the task of\nevent-based 2D and 3D human pose estimation that our method consumes 88% less\npower with only a 4% decrease in performance compared to its fully ANN\ncounterparts when run at the same inference rate.

This is an improvement of more than\ntwo orders of magnitude compared to existing diode laser spectroscopy methods.\nOur scheme provides precise frequency calibration markers while simultaneously\ntracking the instantaneous scan speed of the laser. We demonstrate several\napplications, including dispersion measurement of an ultra-high-Q\nmicroresonator and spectroscopy of an HF gas cell, which can be used for\nabsolute frequency referencing of the tunable diode laser. The simplicity,\nrobustness and low costs of this spectroscopy scheme could prove extremely\nvaluable for out-of-the-lab applications like LIDAR, gas spectroscopy and\nenvironmental monitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 17:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

By contrast, the velocity dispersion measured\ntoday, sigma_now, increases monotonically with age because of stronger\npost-formation heating for Pre-Disk stars. Importantly, most of sigma_now was\nin place at formation, not added post-formation, for stars younger than ~ 10\nGyr.

The lookback time that the disk began to settle correlates with its\ndynamical state today: earlier-settling galaxies currently form colder disks.\nYoung stars in FIRE-2 are kinematically hotter than the MW but broadly agree\nwith M31 and M33.

However, the contrastive samples are nonconsensual, as\nthe negatives are usually represented distantly from the clear (i.e., positive)\nimage, leaving the solution space still under-constricted. Moreover, the\ninterpretability of deep dehazing models is underexplored towards the physics\nof the hazing process. In this paper, we propose a novel curricular contrastive\nregularization targeted at a consensual contrastive space as opposed to a\nnon-consensual one. Our negatives, which provide better lower-bound\nconstraints, can be assembled from 1) the hazy image, and 2) corresponding\nrestorations by other existing methods. Further, due to the different\nsimilarities between the embeddings of the clear image and negatives, the\nlearning difficulty of the multiple components is intrinsically imbalanced.

The results\nshow that transformer-based methods such as Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) and Pre-training with Extracted\nGap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization (PEGASUS) dominate the landscape of\nlay text summarisation, with all but one study using these methods. A\ncombination of extractive and abstractive summarisation methods in a hybrid\napproach was found to be most effective. Furthermore, pre-processing approaches\nto input text (e.g. applying extractive summarisation) or determining which\nsections of a text to include, appear critical. Evaluation metrics such as\nRecall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) were used, which do\nnot consider readability. To conclude, automatic lay text summarisation is\nunder-explored. Future research should consider long document lay text\nsummarisation, including clinical trial reports, and the development of\nevaluation metrics that consider readability of the lay summary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 18:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Machine learning\noffers a promising method for reducing the time and resource burdens of\nmaterials development through efficient correlation of structure-property\nrelationships to allow down-selection and focusing on promising candidates.\nTowards demonstrating this, we have developed an end-to-end \"discovery cycle\"\nto select new aqueous amines compatible with the commercially viable acid gas\nscrubbing carbon capture.

Choosing\ncombinations of interventions is a problem that naturally arises in many\napplications such as factorial design experiments, recommendation engines\n(e.g., showing a set of movies that maximizes engagement for users),\ncombination therapies in medicine, selecting important features for ML models,\netc. Running $N \\times 2^p$ experiments to estimate the various parameters is\ninfeasible as $N$ and $p$ grow. Further, with observational data there is\nlikely confounding, i.e., whether or not a unit is seen under a combination is\ncorrelated with its potential outcome under that combination. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel model that imposes latent structure across both\nunits and combinations. We assume latent similarity across units (i.e., the\npotential outcomes matrix is rank $r$) and regularity in how combinations\ninteract (i.e., the coefficients in the Fourier expansion of the potential\noutcomes is $s$ sparse). We establish identification for all causal parameters\ndespite unobserved confounding.

The existing frameworks of CQM are\ncategorical proof theories of compact dagger linear logic, and are motivated by\nthe interpretation of quantum systems in the category of finite dimensional\nHilbert spaces. This thesis describes a new non-compact framework called Mixed\nUnitary Categories which can accommodate infinite dimensional systems, and\ndevelops models for the framework. To this end, it builds on linearly\ndistributive categories, and $*$-autonomous categories which are categorical\nproof theories of (non-compact) multiplicative linear logic. The proof theory\nof non-compact dagger-linear logic is obtained from the basic setting of an LDC\nby adding a dagger functor satisfying appropriate coherences to give a\ndagger-LDC. From every (isomix) dagger-LDC one can extract a canonical \"unitary\ncore\" which up to equivalence is the traditional CQM framework of\ndagger-monoidal categories. This leads to the framework of Mixed Unitary\nCategories (MUCs): every MUC contains a (compact) unitary core which is\nextended by a (non-compact) isomix dagger-LDC. Various models of MUCs based on\nFiniteness Spaces, Chu spaces, Hopf modules, etc., are developed in this\nthesis. This thesis also generalizes the key algebraic structures of CQM, such\nas observables, measurement, and complementarity, to MUC framework.\nFurthermore, using the MUC framework, this thesis establishes a connection\nbetween the complementary observables of quantum mechanics and the exponential\nmodalities of linear logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 18:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

For quantum computing,\nerror-correction is essential as well, but harder to realize, coming along with\nsubstantial resource overheads and being concomitant with needs for substantial\nclassical computing. Quantum error-correcting codes play a central role on the\navenue towards fault-tolerant quantum computation beyond presumed near-term\napplications. Among those, color codes constitute a particularly important\nclass of quantum codes that have gained interest in recent years due to\nfavourable properties over other codes. As in classical computing, decoding is\nthe problem of inferring an operation to restore an uncorrupted state from a\ncorrupted one and is central in the development of fault-tolerant quantum\ndevices. In this work, we show how the decoding problem for color codes can be\nreduced to a slight variation of the well-known LightsOut puzzle.

Our approach\nchanges a given motion sequence of a virtual agent as needed to adjust to the\nobstacles and objects in the environment. We first take the individual frames\nof the motion sequence most important for modeling interactions with the scene\nand pair them with the relevant scene geometry, obstacles, and semantics such\nthat interactions in the agents motion match the affordances of the scene\n(e.g., standing on a floor or sitting in a chair). We then optimize the motion\nof the human by directly altering the high-DOF pose at each frame in the motion\nto better account for the unique geometric constraints of the scene. Our\nformulation uses novel loss functions that maintain a realistic flow and\nnatural-looking motion. We compare our method with prior motion generating\ntechniques and highlight the benefits of our method with a perceptual study and\nphysical plausibility metrics. Human raters preferred our method over the prior\napproaches. Specifically, they preferred our method 57.1% of the time versus\nthe state-of-the-art method using existing motions, and 81.0% of the time\nversus a state-of-the-art motion synthesis method. Additionally, our method\nperforms significantly higher on established physical plausibility and\ninteraction metrics.

The dynamics\nof these blob-filaments, in particular their radial motion, can influence the\nscrape-off layer width and plasma interactions with both the divertor target\nand with the main chamber walls. Motivated by recent results from the XGC1\ngyrokinetic simulation code reported on elsewhere [J. Cheng et al. submitted to\nNucl. Fusion and available at arXiv:2302.02877v1], a theory of rapidly spinning\nblob-filaments has been developed. The theory treats blob filaments in the\nclosed flux surface region or the region that is disconnected from sheaths in\nthe SOL. It extends previous work by treating blob spin, arising from partially\nor fully adiabatic electrons, as the leading order effect and retaining\ninertial (ion charge polarization) physics in next order. Spin helps to\nmaintain blob coherency and affects the blob's propagation speed. Dipole charge\npolarization, treated perturbatively, gives rise to blob-filaments with\nrelatively slow radial velocity, comparable to that observed in the\nsimulations. The theory also treats the interaction of rapidly spinning blob\nfilaments with a zonal flow layer. It is shown analytically that the flow layer\ncan act like a transport barrier for these structures. Finally parallel\nelectron kinetic effects are incorporated into the theory. Various asymptotic\nparameter regimes are discussed and asymptotic expressions for the radial and\npoloidal motion of the blob-filaments are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 21:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

The target was observed by TESS in Full-Frame Images in sectors\n14-16, 21-23, 41, 48 and 49, and produced two sets of primary and secondary\neclipses. These show strongly non-linear eclipse timing variations (ETVs) with\nan amplitude of $\\sim$0.1 days, where the ETVs of the primary and secondary\neclipses, and of the two binaries are all largely positively correlated. This\nhighlights the strong dynamical interactions between the two binaries and\nconfirms the compact quadruple configuration of TIC 219006972.

However, needlessly increasing the\ndimension of the state can slow learning and obfuscate the learned policy. We\nintroduce the notion of a minimal sufficient state in a Markov decision process\n(MDP) as the smallest subvector of the original state under which the process\nremains an MDP and shares the same optimal policy as the original process.

Previous studies have suggested that HIP\n41378 f has a low apparent bulk density of $0.09\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$ and\na flat near-infrared transmission spectrum, suggesting that it may possess\ncircumplanetary rings. Given the planet's long orbital period ($P\\approx1.5$\nyr), it may also host a large exomoon. Here, we consider a hypothetical exomoon\norbiting HIP 41378 f with the same satellite-to-planet mass ratio as the\nMoon-Earth system and assess its orbital stability using a suite of N-body and\ntidal migration simulations. We find that satellites up to this size are\nlargely stable against Hill sphere escape and collisions with the host planet,\nconsistent with theoretical stability limits determined by previous studies. We\nthen simulate the expected transit signal from the exomoon and show that\ncurrent transit observations likely cannot constrain the presence of exomoons\norbiting HIP 41378 f, though future observations may be capable of detecting\nexomoons in other systems. Finally, we simulate the combined transmission\nspectrum of HIP 41378 f and an exomoon with a low-metallicity atmosphere, and\nshow that the total effective spectrum is contaminated at the $\\sim$10 ppm\nlevel. Our work not only demonstrates the feasibility of exomoons orbiting HIP\n41378 f, but also shows that large exomoons may be a source of uncertainty in\nfuture high-precision measurements of exoplanet systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 22:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

In this\nwork, we investigat the receiver-agnostic transmitter fingerprinting problem,\nand propose a novel two-stage supervised learning framework (RXA) to address\nit.

However, the data\nscarcity of IoT hinders the effectiveness of traditional intrusion detection\nmethods. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose the Adaptive\nBi-Recommendation and Self-Improving Network (ABRSI) based on unsupervised\nheterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA). The ABRSI transfers enrich intrusion\nknowledge from a data-rich network intrusion source domain to facilitate\neffective intrusion detection for data-scarce IoT target domains. The ABRSI\nachieves fine-grained intrusion knowledge transfer via adaptive\nbi-recommendation matching. Matching the bi-recommendation interests of two\nrecommender systems and the alignment of intrusion categories in the shared\nfeature space form a mutual-benefit loop. Besides, the ABRSI uses a\nself-improving mechanism, autonomously improving the intrusion knowledge\ntransfer from four ways. A hard pseudo label voting mechanism jointly considers\nrecommender system decision and label relationship information to promote more\naccurate hard pseudo label assignment. To promote diversity and target data\nparticipation during intrusion knowledge transfer, target instances failing to\nbe assigned with a hard pseudo label will be assigned with a probabilistic soft\npseudo label, forming a hybrid pseudo-labelling strategy. Meanwhile, the ABRSI\nalso makes soft pseudo-labels globally diverse and individually certain.\nFinally, an error knowledge learning mechanism is utilised to adversarially\nexploit factors that causes detection ambiguity and learns through both current\nand previous error knowledge, preventing error knowledge forgetfulness.\nHolistically, these mechanisms form the ABRSI model that boosts IoT intrusion\ndetection accuracy via HDA-assisted intrusion knowledge transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 01:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

For this purpose, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network\narchitecture for spatial and spatio-temporal classification using satellite\nimagery. We propose a hybrid attention method to learn the relative importance\nof irregular neighbors in remote sensing data. Instead of classifying each\npixel, we propose a method based on Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC)\nimage segmentation and Graph Attention GAT. The superpixels obtained from SLIC\nbecome the nodes of our Graph Convolution Network (GCN). We then construct a\nregion adjacency graph (RAG) where each superpixel is connected to every other\nadjacent superpixel in the image, enabling information to propagate globally.\nFinally, we propose a Spatially driven Attention Graph Neural Network (SAG-NN)\nto classify each RAG.

Unlike regular grids of pixels in images, superpixels are\nirregular in nature and cannot be used to create spatio-temporal graphs.

The electron transfer in turn creates an electric field across the\ninterface that modifies the interfacial dipole associated with bonding between\nSrTiO3 and Si, leading to a change in the band alignment from type-II to\ntype-III. By capping the SrTiO3 surface with ultra-thin layers of BaO, SrO or\nTiO2, charge transfer across the interface can be weakened or inhibited.

Existing backdoor attacking systems face two severe issues:firstly,\nmost backdoor triggers follow a uniform and usually input-independent pattern,\ne.g., insertion of specific trigger words, synonym replacement. This\nsignificantly hinders the stealthiness of the attacking model, leading the\ntrained backdoor model being easily identified as malicious by model probes.\nSecondly, trigger-inserted poisoned sentences are usually disfluent,\nungrammatical, or even change the semantic meaning from the original sentence,\nmaking them being easily filtered in the pre-processing stage. To resolve these\ntwo issues, in this paper, we propose an input-unique backdoor attack(NURA),\nwhere we generate backdoor triggers unique to inputs. IDBA generates\ncontext-related triggers by continuing writing the input with a language model\nlike GPT2. The generated sentence is used as the backdoor trigger. This\nstrategy not only creates input-unique backdoor triggers, but also preserves\nthe semantics of the original input, simultaneously resolving the two issues\nabove. Experimental results show that the IDBA attack is effective for attack\nand difficult to defend: it achieves high attack success rate across all the\nwidely applied benchmarks, while is immune to existing defending methods.

We investigated the influence\nof the Kondo couplings with the helical liquids on both the static and dynamic\nproperties of the ground state. The number and distinct spatial structures of\nthe active natural orbitals (ANOs), which play essential roles in constructing\nthe ground-state wave function, were first analyzed. Our numerical results\nindicate that two ANOs emerge, equal to the number of helical liquids.\nSpecifically, at the coupling symmetry point, both ANOs are fully active with\ntheir spatial structures being respectively constituted by the different\nhelical liquids. In comparison, when deviating from the symmetry point, only\none ANO remains fully active, which is dominantly constructed by the helical\nliquid with the larger Kondo coupling. Local screening of the impurity,\ndescribed by the impurity spin polarization and susceptibility, was further\nstudied. It shows that at the coupling symmetry point, the impurity is\nmaximally polarized and the spin susceptibility reaches the maximum. On the\ncontrary, the impurity tends to be screened without polarization when the Kondo\ncouplings deviate well from the symmetry point. The Kondo screening cloud,\nmanifested by the spin correlation between the impurity and the conduction\nelectrons, was finally explored. It is demonstrated that the Kondo cloud is\nmainly formed by the helical liquid with the larger Kondo coupling to the\nimpurity. On the other hand, the spin-orbital coupling breaks the symmetry in\nspatial distribution of the spin correlation, leading to anisotropy in the\nKondo cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 02:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Radiation escapes from the outermost layers of a star,\ncarrying direct physical information.

The trained path detection model was used to develop a full\nnavigation framework consisting of row tracking and row switching modules,\nenabling a robot to traverse within a crop row and transit between crop rows to\ncover an entire vineyard autonomously. Extensive field trials were conducted in\nthree different vineyards to demonstrate that the developed path detection\nmodel and navigation framework provided a cost-effective, accurate, and robust\nautonomous navigation solution in the vineyard and could be generalized to\nunseen vineyards with stable performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 03:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Just with this change, we are able\nto achieve both of the aforementioned goals, with the added benefit of no\nlonger requiring external semantic knowledge. Technically, ours is a\ntransformer-based cross-modal network, with three novel components (i) a\nself-attention module with a learnable tokenizer to produce visual tokens that\ncorrespond to the most informative local regions, (ii) a cross-attention module\nto compute local correspondences between the visual tokens across two\nmodalities, and finally (iii) a kernel-based relation network to assemble local\nputative matches and produce an overall similarity metric for a sketch-photo\npair.

Despite showing high predictive accuracy, recently,\nseveral works have revealed that they tend to provide overconfident predictions\nand thus are poorly calibrated. The majority of the works addressing the\nmiscalibration of DNNs fall under the scope of classification and consider only\nin-domain predictions. However, there is little to no progress in studying the\ncalibration of DNN-based object detection models, which are central to many\nvision-based safety-critical applications. In this paper, inspired by the\ntrain-time calibration methods, we propose a novel auxiliary loss formulation\nthat explicitly aims to align the class confidence of bounding boxes with the\naccurateness of predictions (i.e. precision). Since the original formulation of\nour loss depends on the counts of true positives and false positives in a\nminibatch, we develop a differentiable proxy of our loss that can be used\nduring training with other application-specific loss functions. We perform\nextensive experiments on challenging in-domain and out-domain scenarios with\nsix benchmark datasets including MS-COCO, Cityscapes, Sim10k, and BDD100k.

An election campaign among two\nor more parties is viewed as a game of two or more players. Each of them has\nits own candidates as the pure strategies to play. People, as voters, comprise\nsupporters for each party, and a candidate brings utility for the the\nsupporters of each party. Each player nominates exactly one of its candidates\nto compete against the other party's. A candidate is assumed to win the\nelection with higher odds if it brings more utility for all the people. The\npayoff of each player is the expected utility its supporters get. The game is\negoistic if every candidate benefits her party's supporters more than any\ncandidate from the competing party does. In this work, we first argue that the\nelection game always has a pure Nash equilibrium when the winner is chosen by\nthe hardmax function, while there exist game instances in the three-party\nelection game such that no pure Nash equilibrium exists even the game is\negoistic. Next, we propose two sufficient conditions for the egoistic election\ngame to have a pure Nash equilibrium. Based on these conditions, we propose a\nfixed-parameter tractable algorithm to compute a pure Nash equilibrium of the\negoistic election game. Finally, perhaps surprisingly, we show that the price\nof anarchy of the egoistic election game is upper bounded by the number of\nparties. Our findings suggest that the election becomes unpredictable when more\nthan two parties are involved and, moreover, the social welfare deteriorates\nwith the number of participating parties in terms of possibly increasing price\nof anarchy.

Existing face\ngenerators exhibit exceptional performance on faces in small to medium poses\n(with respect to frontal faces) but struggle to produce realistic results for\nlarge poses. The distorted rendering results on large poses in 3D-aware\ngenerators further show that the generated 3D face shapes are far from the\ndistribution of 3D faces in reality. We find that the above issues are caused\nby the training dataset's pose imbalance.\n  In this paper, we present LPFF, a large-pose Flickr face dataset comprised of\n19,590 high-quality real large-pose portrait images. We utilize our dataset to\ntrain a 2D face generator that can process large-pose face images, as well as a\n3D-aware generator that can generate realistic human face geometry. To better\nvalidate our pose-conditional 3D-aware generators, we develop a new FID measure\nto evaluate the 3D-level performance. Through this novel FID measure and other\nexperiments, we show that LPFF can help 2D face generators extend their latent\nspace and better manipulate the large-pose data, and help 3D-aware face\ngenerators achieve better view consistency and more realistic 3D reconstruction\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 09:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

To address this, we ask: can we quickly compress\nlarge generalist models into accurate and efficient specialists? For this, we\npropose a simple and versatile technique called Few-Shot Task-Aware Compression\n(TACO). Given a large vision model that is pretrained to be accurate on a broad\ntask, such as classification over ImageNet-22K, TACO produces a smaller model\nthat is accurate on specialized tasks, such as classification across vehicle\ntypes or animal species. Crucially, TACO works in few-shot fashion, i.e. only a\nfew task-specific samples are used, and the procedure has low computational\noverheads. We validate TACO on highly-accurate ResNet, ViT/DeiT, and ConvNeXt\nmodels, originally trained on ImageNet, LAION, or iNaturalist, which we\nspecialize and compress to a diverse set of \"downstream\" subtasks.

In this work,\nwe explore the freestyle capability of the model, i.e., how far can it generate\nunseen semantics (e.g., classes, attributes, and styles) onto a given layout,\nand call the task Freestyle LIS (FLIS). Thanks to the development of\nlarge-scale pre-trained language-image models, a number of discriminative\nmodels (e.g., image classification and object detection) trained on limited\nbase classes are empowered with the ability of unseen class prediction.\nInspired by this, we opt to leverage large-scale pre-trained text-to-image\ndiffusion models to achieve the generation of unseen semantics. The key\nchallenge of FLIS is how to enable the diffusion model to synthesize images\nfrom a specific layout which very likely violates its pre-learned knowledge,\ne.g., the model never sees \"a unicorn sitting on a bench\" during its\npre-training. To this end, we introduce a new module called Rectified\nCross-Attention (RCA) that can be conveniently plugged in the diffusion model\nto integrate semantic masks. This \"plug-in\" is applied in each cross-attention\nlayer of the model to rectify the attention maps between image and text tokens.\nThe key idea of RCA is to enforce each text token to act on the pixels in a\nspecified region, allowing us to freely put a wide variety of semantics from\npre-trained knowledge (which is general) onto the given layout (which is\nspecific). Extensive experiments show that the proposed diffusion network\nproduces realistic and freestyle layout-to-image generation results with\ndiverse text inputs, which has a high potential to spawn a bunch of interesting\napplications.

We propose to analyze the average monthly demand in a station-based\ncar-sharing service with spatially-aware learning algorithms that offer high\npredictive performance as well as interpretability. In particular, we compare\nthe spatially-implicit Random Forest model with spatially-aware methods for\npredicting average monthly per-station demand. The study utilizes a rich set of\nsocio-demographic, location-based (e.g., POIs), and car-sharing-specific\nfeatures as input, extracted from a large proprietary car-sharing dataset and\npublicly available datasets. We show that the global Random Forest model with\ngeo-coordinates as an input feature achieves the highest predictive performance\nwith an R-squared score of 0.87, while local methods such as Geographically\nWeighted Regression perform almost on par and additionally yield exciting\ninsights into the heterogeneous spatial distributions of factors influencing\ncar-sharing behaviour. Additionally, our study offers effective as well as\nhighly interpretable methods for diagnosing and planning the placement of\ncar-sharing stations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 10:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

It becomes particularly critical in applications where additional\nconstraints force a strong reduction of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) per\nimage. These constraints may result from limitations on the maximum available\nflux or permissible dose and the associated restriction on exposure time.\nOften, a high SNR per image is traded for the ability to distribute a given\ntotal exposure capacity per pixel over multiple channels, thus obtaining\nadditional information about the object by the same total exposure time. These\ncan be energy channels in the case of spectroscopic imaging or time channels in\nthe case of time-resolved imaging. In this paper, we report on a method for\nimproving the quality of noisy multi-channel (time or energy-resolved) imaging\ndatasets. The method relies on the recent Noise2Noise (N2N) self-supervised\ndenoising approach that learns to predict a noise-free signal without access to\nnoise-free data. N2N in turn requires drawing pairs of samples from a data\ndistribution sharing identical signals while being exposed to different samples\nof random noise. The method is applicable if adjacent channels share enough\ninformation to provide images with similar enough information but independent\nnoise. We demonstrate several representative case studies, namely spectroscopic\n(k-edge) X-ray tomography, in vivo X-ray cine-radiography, and\nenergy-dispersive (Bragg edge) neutron tomography. In all cases, the N2N method\nshows dramatic improvement and outperforms conventional denoising methods. For\nsuch imaging techniques, the method can therefore significantly improve image\nquality, or maintain image quality with further reduced exposure time per\nimage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 10:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Protein-protein interactions (PPI) of DEGs were analyzed\nusing the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database (STRING)\nand visualized by Cytoscape. UALCAN was also used to perform prognostic\nanalyses.\n  Results: In Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, we discovered 2264 upregulated\nDEGs (uDEGs) and 723 downregulated DEGs (dDEGs). The Gene Ontology (GO)\nindicated that extracellular matrix organization, extracellular structure\norganization, collagen catabolic process and also the uDEGs are enriched in\nfocal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction by KEGG\nanalysis. The top ten hub genes were identified from the PPI network: COL1A1,\nCOL3A1, COL1A2, FN1, COL5A2, ITGA3, FBN1, MET, COL6A3, and BGN. These 10 hub\ngenes are highly upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, according to\nGEPIA research. The UALCAN prognostic analysis of the 10 hub genes revealed\nthat two of the elevated genes, ITGA3 and MET, significantly shortened PDAC\npatient survival time. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is linked to Focal\nadhesion, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and ECM-receptor interaction,\naccording to Module analysis from the PPI network.\n  Conclusion: This investigation identified hub genes and important signal\npathways, which adds to our knowledge of molecular mechanisms and could be\nexploited as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for Pancreatic ductal\nadenocarcinoma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 11:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

We\nfind that although density is supposed to capture relatedness between a\ncountry's current specialization pattern and potential products that it may\ndiversify into, density is also correlated strongly to the level of\ndiversification of the country, and (less strongly) to the ubiquity of the\nproduct. Together, diversity and ubiquity capture 93% of the variance of\ndensity. We split density into a part that corresponds to related variety, and\na part that does not (i.e., unrelated variety). In regressions for predicting\ngain or loss of specialization, both these parts are significant. The relative\ninfluence of related variety increases with the level of diversification of the\ncountry: only countries that are already diversified show a strong influence of\nrelated variety. In our empirical analysis, we put equal emphasis on gains and\nlosses of specialization. Our data show that the specializations that were lost\nby a country often represented higher product complexity than the\nspecializations that were gained over the same period. This suggests that\n'smart' specialization should be aimed at preserving (some) existing\nspecializations in addition to gaining new ones. Our regressions indicate that\nthe relative roles of related and unrelated variety for explaining loss of\nspecialization are similar to the case of specialization gains.

We show\nthat this simple procedure allows factorised Gaussian CNPs to model highly\ndependent, non-Gaussian predictive distributions.

When the background\nvalue of the scalar field is stabilised at the minimum of the scalar potential,\nthe scalar field fluctuations only couple quadratically to the massive fields\nof the standard model preventing the scalar direct decay into standard model\nparticles. Cosmologically and prior to the electroweak symmetry breaking, the\nscalar field rolls down along its effective potential before eventually\noscillating and settling down at the electroweak minimum. These oscillations\ncan be at the origin of dark matter due to the initial misalignment of the\nscalar field compared to the electroweak minimum, and we find that, when the\nmass of the scalar field is less than the eV scale and acts as a condensate\nbehaving like dark matter on large scales, the scalar particles cannot\nthermalise with the standard model thermal bath. As matter couples in a\ncomposition-dependent manner to the oscillating scalar, this could lead to a\nviolation of the equivalence principle aboard satellites such as the MICROSCOPE\nexperiment and the next generation of tests of the equivalence principle.

Many new coming concepts need to be added to an\nexisting taxonomy. The traditional taxonomy expansion task aims only at finding\nthe best position for new coming concepts in the existing taxonomy. However,\nthey have two drawbacks when being applied to the real-scenarios. The previous\nmethods suffer from low-efficiency since they waste much time when most of the\nnew coming concepts are indeed noisy concepts. They also suffer from\nlow-effectiveness since they collect training samples only from the existing\ntaxonomy, which limits the ability of the model to mine more hypernym-hyponym\nrelationships among real concepts. This paper proposes a pluggable framework\ncalled Generative Adversarial Network for Taxonomy Entering Evaluation (GANTEE)\nto alleviate these drawbacks. A generative adversarial network is designed in\nthis framework by discriminative models to alleviate the first drawback and the\ngenerative model to alleviate the second drawback. Two discriminators are used\nin GANTEE to provide long-term and short-term rewards, respectively. Moreover,\nto further improve the efficiency, pre-trained language models are used to\nretrieve the representation of the concepts quickly.

Inspired by recent advances\nin self-supervised knowledge distillation and masked image modeling (MIM), we\npropose a novel Supervised Masked Knowledge Distillation model (SMKD) for\nfew-shot Transformers which incorporates label information into\nself-distillation frameworks.
