Scaling the model and dataset size has helped improve the\nperformance of LLMs, but unfortunately, this also leads to highly prohibitive\ncomputational costs. Pre-training LLMs often require orders of magnitude more\nFLOPs than fine-tuning and the model capacity often remains the same between\nthe two phases. To achieve training efficiency w.r.t training FLOPs, we propose\nto decouple the model capacity between the two phases and introduce Sparse\nPre-training and Dense Fine-tuning (SPDF). In this work, we show the benefits\nof using unstructured weight sparsity to train only a subset of weights during\npre-training (Sparse Pre-training) and then recover the representational\ncapacity by allowing the zeroed weights to learn (Dense Fine-tuning). We\ndemonstrate that we can induce up to 75% sparsity into a 1.3B parameter GPT-3\nXL model resulting in a 2.5x reduction in pre-training FLOPs, without a\nsignificant loss in accuracy on the downstream tasks relative to the dense\nbaseline. By rigorously evaluating multiple downstream tasks, we also establish\na relationship between sparsity, task complexity, and dataset size. Our work\npresents a promising direction to train large GPT models at a fraction of the\ntraining FLOPs using weight sparsity while retaining the benefits of\npre-trained textual representations for downstream tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 17:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

On the\ncontrary, existing visual reasoning methods assume training samples that\ncapture every possible object and reasoning problem, and rely on black-boxed\nmodels that commonly exploit statistical priors. They have yet to develop the\ncapability to address novel objects or spurious biases in real-world scenarios,\nand also fall short of interpreting the rationales behind their decisions.\nInspired by humans' reasoning of the visual world, we tackle the aforementioned\nchallenges from a compositional perspective, and propose an integral framework\nconsisting of a principled object factorization method and a novel neural\nmodule network. Our factorization method decomposes objects based on their key\ncharacteristics, and automatically derives prototypes that represent a wide\nrange of objects. With these prototypes encoding important semantics, the\nproposed network then correlates objects by measuring their similarity on a\ncommon semantic space and makes decisions with a compositional reasoning\nprocess. It is capable of answering questions with diverse objects regardless\nof their availability during training, and overcoming the issues of biased\nquestion-answer distributions. In addition to the enhanced generalizability,\nour framework also provides an interpretable interface for understanding the\ndecision-making process of models.

At the single particle level, diffusion across\na semi-permeable interface can be formulated in terms of so-called snapping out\nBrownian motion (SNOBM). The latter sews together successive rounds of\nreflected BM, each of which is restricted to one side of the interface. Each\nround of reflected BM is killed when the local time at the interface exceeds an\nindependent, exponentially distributed random variable. (The local time\nspecifies the amount of time a reflected Brownian particle spends in a\nneighborhood of the interface.) The particle then immediately resumes reflected\nBM on the same side or the other side of the interface according to a\nstochastic switch, and the process is iterated.

Traditional APR tools typically focus on specific bug\ntypes and fixes through the use of templates, heuristics, and formal\nspecifications. However, these techniques are limited in terms of the bug types\nand patch variety they can produce. As such, researchers have designed various\nlearning-based APR tools with recent work focused on directly using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) for APR. While LLM-based APR tools are able to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on many repair datasets, the LLMs used for direct\nrepair are not fully aware of the project-specific information such as unique\nvariable or method names.\n  The plastic surgery hypothesis is a well-known insight for APR, which states\nthat the code ingredients to fix the bug usually already exist within the same\nproject. Traditional APR tools have largely leveraged the plastic surgery\nhypothesis by designing manual or heuristic-based approaches to exploit such\nexisting code ingredients. However, as recent APR research starts focusing on\nLLM-based approaches, the plastic surgery hypothesis has been largely ignored.\nIn this paper, we ask the following question: How useful is the plastic surgery\nhypothesis in the era of LLMs? Interestingly, LLM-based APR presents a unique\nopportunity to fully automate the plastic surgery hypothesis via fine-tuning\nand prompting. To this end, we propose FitRepair, which combines the direct\nusage of LLMs with two domain-specific fine-tuning strategies and one prompting\nstrategy for more powerful APR.

The purpose of this\nstudy was to quantify longitudinal representativeness of the demographic\ncharacteristics of the primary imaging dataset compared to the United States\ngeneral population (US Census) and COVID-19 positive case counts from the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Approach: The Jensen Shannon\ndistance (JSD) was used to longitudinally measure the similarity of the\ndistribution of (1) all unique patients in the MIDRC data to the 2020 US Census\nand (2) all unique COVID-19 positive patients in the MIDRC data to the case\ncounts reported by the CDC. The distributions were evaluated in the demographic\ncategories of age at index, sex, race, ethnicity, and the intersection of race\nand ethnicity. Results: Representativeness the MIDRC data by ethnicity and the\nintersection of race and ethnicity was impacted by the percentage of CDC case\ncounts for which data in these categories is not reported. The distributions by\nsex and race have retained their level of representativeness over time.\nConclusion: The representativeness of the open medical imaging datasets in the\ncurated public data commons at MIDRC has evolved over time as both the number\nof contributing institutions and overall number of subjects has grown. The use\nof metrics such as the JSD support measurement of representativeness, one step\nneeded for fair and generalizable AI algorithm development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 21:17:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

The designs of gains for controllers and observers\nfor PDEs, such as PDE backstepping, are mappings of system model functions into\ngain functions. These infinite dimensional nonlinear operators are given in an\nimplicit form through PDEs, in spatial variables, which need to be solved to\ndetermine the gain function for each new functional coefficient of the PDE. The\nneed for solving such PDEs can be eliminated by learning and approximating the\nsaid design mapping in the form of a neural operator. Learning the neural\noperator requires a sufficient number of prior solutions for the design PDEs,\noffline, as well as the training of the operator. In recent work, we developed\nthe neural operators for PDE backstepping designs for first order hyperbolic\nPDEs. Here we extend this framework to the more complex class of parabolic\nPDEs. The key theoretical question is whether the controllers are still\nstabilizing, and whether the observers are still convergent, if they employ the\napproximate functional gains generated by the neural operator. We provide\naffirmative answers to these questions, namely, we prove stability in closed\nloop under gains produced by neural operators. We illustrate the theoretical\nresults with numerical tests and publish our code on github.

However, common practice fine-tunes all of the\nparameters in a pre-trained model, which becomes prohibitive when a large\nnumber of downstream tasks are present. Therefore, many fine-tuning methods are\nproposed to learn incremental updates of pre-trained weights in a parameter\nefficient way, e.g., low-rank increments. These methods often evenly distribute\nthe budget of incremental updates across all pre-trained weight matrices, and\noverlook the varying importance of different weight parameters.

LR constructs a hyperplane based on a\nselection of optimal parameters, named features, and hyper-parameters whose\nvalues control the learning process and determine the values of features that a\nlearning algorithm ends up learning, to discriminate TeV blazars from non-TeV\nblazars. In addition, it gives the probability (or logistic) that a source may\nbe considered as a TeV blazar candidate. Non-TeV blazars with logistics greater\nthan 80% are considered high-confidence TeV candidates. Using this technique,\nwe identify 40 high-confidence TeV candidates from the 4FGL-DR2 / 4LAC-DR2\nblazars and we build the feature hyper-plane to distinguish TeV and non-TeV\nblazars. We also calculate the hyper-planes for the 3FHL, 3HSP, and 2BIGB.\nFinally, we construct the broadband spectral energy distributions (SED) for the\n40 candidates, testing for their detectability with various instruments.

However, adequately accounting for the spatial and temporal variability\nof the endmembers in MTHU is challenging, and has not been fully addressed so\nfar in unsupervised frameworks. In this work, we propose an unsupervised MTHU\nalgorithm based on variational recurrent neural networks. First, a stochastic\nmodel is proposed to represent both the dynamical evolution of the endmembers\nand their abundances, as well as the mixing process. Moreover, a new model\nbased on a low-dimensional parametrization is used to represent spatial and\ntemporal endmember variability, significantly reducing the amount of variables\nto be estimated. We propose to formulate MTHU as a Bayesian inference problem.\nHowever, the solution to this problem does not have an analytical solution due\nto the nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity of the model. Thus, we propose a\nsolution based on deep variational inference, in which the posterior\ndistribution of the estimated abundances and endmembers is represented by using\na combination of recurrent neural networks and a physically motivated model.\nThe parameters of the model are learned using stochastic backpropagation.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state of the art\nMTHU algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2023 04:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

However, acquiring reward/penalty in all open-ended tasks is\nunrealistic, making the Reinforcement Learning (RL) training procedure\nimpossible. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal contrastive learning\nframework architecture, CLIP4MC, aiming to learn an RL-friendly vision-language\nmodel that serves as a reward function for open-ended tasks. Therefore, no\nfurther task-specific reward design is needed. Intuitively, it is more\nreasonable for the model to address the similarity between the video snippet\nand the language prompt at both the action and entity levels. To this end, a\nmotion encoder is proposed to capture the motion embeddings across different\nintervals. The correlation scores are then used to construct the auxiliary\nreward signal for RL agents. Moreover, we construct a neat YouTube dataset\nbased on the large-scale YouTube database provided by MineDojo.

This paper proposes a\ngeneral-purpose asynchronous non-maximum suppression pipeline (ANMS), and\napplies it to corner event detection. The proposed pipeline extract fine\nfeature stream from the output of original detectors and adapts to the speed of\nmotion. The ANMS runs directly on the asynchronous event stream with extremely\nlow latency, which hardly affects the speed of original detectors.\nAdditionally, we evaluate the DAVIS-based ground-truth labeling method to fill\nthe gap between frame and event. Evaluation on public dataset indicates that\nthe proposed ANMS pipeline significantly improves the performance of three\nclassical asynchronous detectors with negligible latency. More importantly, the\nproposed ANMS framework is a natural extension of NMS, which is applicable to\nother asynchronous scoring tasks for event cameras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2023 05:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Although subgraph GNNs are able to count\ncomplicated substructures, they suffer from high computational and memory\ncosts. In this paper, we address a non-trivial question: can we count\nsubstructures efficiently with GNNs? To answer the question, we first\ntheoretically show that the distance to the rooted nodes within subgraphs is\nkey to boosting the counting power of subgraph GNNs. We then encode such\ninformation into structural embeddings, and precompute the embeddings to avoid\nextracting information over all subgraphs via GNNs repeatedly.

The recent paradigms in\nVMC construct neural networks as trial wave functions, sample quantum\nconfigurations using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and train neural networks\nwith stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. However, the theoretical\nconvergence of VMC is still unknown when SGD interacts with MCMC sampling given\na well-designed trial wave function. Since MCMC reduces the difficulty of\nestimating gradients, it has inevitable bias in practice. Moreover, the local\nenergy may be unbounded, which makes it harder to analyze the error of MCMC\nsampling. Therefore, we assume that the local energy is sub-exponential and use\nthe Bernstein inequality for non-stationary Markov chains to derive error\nbounds of the MCMC estimator.

For\nhighly anharmonic systems, non perturbative approaches are needed, which result\nin renormalized theories of lattice dynamics. In this article, we apply the\nMori-Zwanzig projector formalism to derive an exact generalized Langevin\nequation describing the quantum dynamics of nuclei in a crystal. By projecting\nthis equation on quasiparticles in reciprocal space, and with results from\nlinear response theory, we obtain a formulation of vibrational spectra that\nfully accounts for the anharmonicity. Using a mode-coupling approach, we\nconstruct a systematic perturbative expansion in which each new order is built\nto minimize the following ones. With a truncation to the lowest order, we show\nhow to obtain a set of self-consistent equations that can describe the\nlineshapes of quasiparticles.

Whereas, the cross-plane one is\nfar from sufficient. Based on the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics\nsimulations and Boltzmann transport equation, here we reveal the stacking and\nthickness effects on the cross-plane thermal conductivity (K) of h-BN. We find\nthat K can be significantly modulated by both the stacking structure and\nthickness (d) of h-BN, which is unexpected from the viewpoint of its smooth\nin-plane structure and weak interlayer interaction. In the small thickness\nregion (d<6 nm), K of h-BN at room temperature significantly increases with\nthickness, following a power law of K ~ d^b with b=0.84, 0.66, and 0.92 for\nAA', AB, and AB' stacking structures, respectively. Moreover, K of AB'\nstructure reaches up to 60% larger than that of AA' and AB structures with\nd=5.3 nm, showing the remarkable stacking effect. We also find that the\nstacking effect on K changes dramatically with d increasing, where AA' stacking\nhas the largest K with d > 200 nm. We finally clarify that such exotic stacking\nand thickness dependence of K is owing to the competing effect of excited\nnumber of phonons and phonon relaxation time, both of which directly affect the\nthermal conductivity.

This\npaper proposes a novel algorithm referred to as Neighborhood Conformal\nPrediction (NCP) to improve the efficiency of uncertainty quantification from\nCP for deep classifiers (i.e., reduce prediction set size). The key idea behind\nNCP is to use the learned representation of the neural network to identify k\nnearest-neighbors calibration examples for a given testing input and assign\nthem importance weights proportional to their distance to create adaptive\nprediction sets. We theoretically show that if the learned data representation\nof the neural network satisfies some mild conditions, NCP will produce smaller\nprediction sets than traditional CP algorithms. Our comprehensive experiments\non CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets using diverse deep neural\nnetworks strongly demonstrate that NCP leads to significant reduction in\nprediction set size over prior CP methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2023 15:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

To this end, this paper presents three different algorithms of\nDecentralized Federated Learning (DFL) in the presence of imperfect information\nsharing modeled as noisy communication channels. The first algorithm, Federated\nNoisy Decentralized Learning (FedNDL1), comes from the literature, where the\nnoise is added to their parameters to simulate the scenario of the presence of\nnoisy communication channels. This algorithm shares parameters to form a\nconsensus with the clients based on a communication graph topology through a\nnoisy communication channel. The proposed second algorithm (FedNDL2) is similar\nto the first algorithm but with added noise to the parameters, and it performs\nthe gossip averaging before the gradient optimization. The proposed third\nalgorithm\n  (FedNDL3), on the other hand, shares the gradients through noisy\ncommunication channels instead of the parameters.

Moreover, a power spectrum is\nintroduced based on the estimation of the power of interference and noise\ncomponents, which allows the development of a robust approach to IPN covariance\nmatrix reconstruction.

Simulation results show that the performance of the\nproposed IPN-PSEUR beamformer is almost always close to the optimal value\nacross a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 23:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}
