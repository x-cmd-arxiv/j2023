To guide CAM to find more non-discriminating object patterns,\nthis paper turns to an interesting working mechanism in agent learning named\nComplementary Learning System (CLS). CLS holds that the neocortex builds a\nsensation of general knowledge, while the hippocampus specially learns specific\ndetails, completing the learned patterns. Motivated by this simple but\neffective learning pattern, we propose a General-Specific Learning Mechanism\n(GSLM) to explicitly drive a coarse-grained CAM to a fine-grained pseudo mask.\nSpecifically, GSLM develops a General Learning Module (GLM) and a Specific\nLearning Module (SLM).

Current BNNs use latent real-valued\nweights during training, where several training hyper-parameters are inherited\nfrom real-valued networks. The interpretation of several of these\nhyperparameters is based on the magnitude of the real-valued weights. For BNNs,\nhowever, the magnitude of binary weights is not meaningful, and thus it is\nunclear what these hyperparameters actually do. One example is weight-decay,\nwhich aims to keep the magnitude of real-valued weights small. Other examples\nare latent weight initialization, the learning rate, and learning rate decay,\nwhich influence the magnitude of the real-valued weights. The magnitude is\ninterpretable for real-valued weights, but loses its meaning for binary\nweights. In this paper we offer a new interpretation of these magnitude-based\nhyperparameters based on higher-order gradient filtering during network\noptimization. Our analysis makes it possible to understand how magnitude-based\nhyperparameters influence the training of binary networks which allows for new\noptimization filters specifically designed for binary neural networks that are\nindependent of their real-valued interpretation.

A\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) is then trained in a supervised fashion to\ndetect the residual signature of synthetic sources. Finally, the trained\nnetwork delivers a detection map. The photometry of detected sources is\nestimated by a second CNN. We apply the proposed approach to several datasets\nfrom the VLT/SPHERE instrument. Our results show that its detection stage\nperforms significantly better than baseline methods (cADI, PCA), and leads to a\ncontrast improvement up to half a magnitude compared to PACO. The\ncharacterization stage of the proposed method performs on average on par with\nor better than the comparative algorithms (PCA, PACO) for angular separation\nabove 0.5''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 17:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

But how is our choice of randomness informed by known network\nproperties? And how does it affect the network's behavior? Previous approaches\nhave focused on prescribing increasingly sophisticated statistics of synaptic\nstrengths and motifs. However, at the same time experimental data on parallel\ndynamics of neurons is readily accessible. We therefore propose a complementary\napproach, specifying connectivity in the space that directly controls the\ndynamics - the space of eigenmodes. We develop a theory for a novel ensemble of\nlarge random matrices, whose eigenvalue distribution can be chosen arbitrarily.\nWe show analytically how varying such distribution induces a diverse range of\ncollective network behaviors, including power laws that characterize the\ndimensionality, principal components spectrum, autocorrelation, and\nautoresponse of neuronal activity. The power-law exponents are controlled by\nthe density of nearly critical eigenvalues, and provide a minimal and robust\nmeasure to directly link observable dynamics and connectivity. The density of\nnearly critical modes also characterizes a transition from high to low\ndimensional dynamics, while their maximum oscillation frequency determines a\ntransition from an exponential to power-law decay in time of the correlation\nand response functions. We prove that the wide range of dynamical behaviors\nresulting from the proposed connectivity ensemble is caused by structures that\nare invisible to a motif analysis. Their presence is captured by motifs\nappearing with vanishingly small probability in the number of neurons. Only\nreciprocal motifs occur with finite probability. In other words, a motif\nanalysis can be blind to synaptic structures controlling the dynamics, which\ninstead become apparent in the space of eigenmode statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 18:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

There is NO\ncorrelation of CKDu with agriculture since affected farming villages are often\nsurrounded by other farming villages free of CKDu. Initial studies looked for a\ncorrelation of CKDu with toxic heavy metal residues of arsenic, cadmium etc.,\nor herbicides like glyphosate that may be present in the environment, as the\ncausative factors. There is now considerable consensus that their\nconcentrations are below danger thresholds, be it in Mesoamerica or south-east\nAsia. The conceptual basis of a search for etiology within a systems approach\nis discussed, and attempts to name the disease to bias the identification of\nits etiology are reviewed. Current research has narrowed down the etiology to\ngeochemical electrolytic contaminants like fluorides and ionic components in\nhard water, nanosilica (found in water as well as in the air), as well as renal\ntoxins similar to indoxyl sulphates that may arise from interactions of ions\nwith humic acids contained in aqueous organic matter. However, while\nagrochemical toxins are increasingly considered less relevant to the etiology\nof CKDu, it has become a firm public belief. In Sri Lanka this has spawned\nideology-based agricultural policies for partial and complete banning of\nagrochemicals (2014-2021), followed by some back-tracking, disrupting the\neconomy and the food supply. A farmer's uprising in 2022 was spawned by poor\nharvests. It triggered a larger popular uprising that led to the collapse of a\ngovernment wedded to romanticized eco-extremist agricultural policies in a\ncountry already facing difficulties in the wake of Covid and Ukraine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 18:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

However, controlling the energy splitting between the two\nlow-energy conduction-band valleys remains a critical challenge for scaling up\nto large numbers of reliable qubits. Broad distributions of valley splittings\nare commonplace, even among quantum dots formed on the same chip. Such behavior\nhas previously been attributed to imperfections such as steps at the quantum\nwell interface. The most common approaches for addressing this problem have\nsought to engineer design improvements into the quantum well. In this work, we\ndevelop a simple, universal theory of valley splitting based on the\nreciprocal-space profile of the quantum well confinement potential, which\nsimultaneously explains the effects of steps, wide interfaces, alloy disorder,\nand custom heterostructure designs. We use this understanding to characterize\ntheoretically the valley splitting in a variety of heterostructures, finding\nthat alloy disorder can explain the observed variability of the valley\nsplitting, even in the absence of steps. Moreover we show that steps have a\nsignificant effect on the valley splitting only when the top interface is very\nsharp. We predict a universal crossover from a regime where low valley\nsplittings are rare to a regime dominated by alloy disorder, in which valley\nsplittings can approach zero. We show that many recent experiments fall into\nthe latter category, with important implications for large-scale qubit\nimplementations. We finally propose a strategy to suppress the incidence of low\nvalley splittings by (i) increasing the random alloy disorder (to increase the\nvalley splitting variance), and then (ii) allowing for electrostatic tuning of\nthe dot position (to access locations with higher valley splitting).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 20:51:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:39:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 22:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 01:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

The SM and\nEinstein gravity admit a natural embedding in Weyl integrable geometry which is\na special limit of Weyl conformal (non-metric) geometry. The theory has a {\\it\nlocal} Weyl scale symmetry but no associated gauge boson. Unlike previous\nmodels with such symmetry, this embedding is truly minimal i.e. with no\nadditional fields beyond SM and underlying geometry. This theory is compared to\na similar minimal embedding of SM and Einstein gravity in Weyl conformal\ngeometry (SMW) which has a full {\\it gauged} scale invariance, with an\nassociated Weyl gauge boson. At large field values, both theories give\nrealistic, Starobinsky-Higgs like inflation. The broken phase of the current\nmodel is the decoupling limit of the massive Weyl gauge boson of the broken\nphase of SMW, while the local scale symmetry of the current model is part of\nthe larger gauged scale symmetry of SMW. Hence, the current theory has a gauge\nembedding in SMW. Unlike in the SMW, we note that in models with local scale\nsymmetry the associated current is trivial, which is a concern for the physical\nmeaning of this symmetry. Therefore, the SMW is a more fundamental UV\ncompletion of SM in a full gauge theory of scale invariance that generates\nEinstein gravity in the (spontaneously) broken phase, as an effective theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 22:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Abell 1213, a low-richness galaxy system, is known to host an\nanomalous radio halo detected in data of the VLA.

Our aim is to analyze the cluster in the optical, X-ray,\nand radio bands to characterize the environment of its diffuse radio emission\nand to shed new light on its nature. Methods. We used optical data from the\nSDSS to study the internal dynamics of the cluster. We also analyzed archival\nXMM-Newton X-ray data to unveil the properties of its hot intracluster medium.\nFinally, we used recent data from LOFAR at 144 MHz, together with VLA data at\n1.4 GHz, to study the spectral behavior of the diffuse radio source. Results.\nBoth our optical and X-ray analysis reveal that this low-mass cluster exhibits\ndisturbed dynamics. In fact, it is composed of several galaxy groups in the\nperipheral regions and, in particular, in the core, where we find evidence of\nsubstructures oriented in the NE-SW direction, with hints of a merger nearly\nalong the line of sight. The analysis of the X-ray emission adds further\nevidence that the cluster is in an unrelaxed dynamical state. At radio\nwavelengths, the LOFAR data show that the diffuse emission is ~510 kpc in size.\nMoreover, there are hints of low-surface-brightness emission permeating the\ncluster center. Conclusions. The environment of the diffuse radio emission is\nnot what we would expect for a classical halo. The spectral index map of the\nradio source is compatible with a relic interpretation, possibly due to a\nmerger in the N-S or NE-SW directions, in agreement with the substructures\ndetected through the optical analysis. The fragmented, diffuse radio emissions\nat the cluster center could be attributed to the surface brightness peaks of a\nfaint central radio halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 23:44:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 16:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

However, most\nexisting min-max solution techniques are either single-machine or distributed\nalgorithms coordinated by a central server. In this paper, we focus on the\ndecentralized min-max optimization for learning with domain constraints, where\nmultiple agents collectively solve a nonconvex-strongly-concave min-max saddle\npoint problem without coordination from any server. Decentralized min-max\noptimization problems with domain constraints underpins many important ML\napplications, including multi-agent ML fairness assurance, and policy\nevaluations in multi-agent reinforcement learning. We propose an algorithm\ncalled PRECISION (proximal gradient-tracking and stochastic recursive variance\nreduction) that enjoys a convergence rate of $O(1/T)$, where $T$ is the maximum\nnumber of iterations. To further reduce sample complexity, we propose\nPRECISION$^+$ with an adaptive batch size technique. We show that the fast\n$O(1/T)$ convergence of PRECISION and PRECISION$^+$ to an $\\epsilon$-stationary\npoint imply $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ communication complexity and\n$O(m\\sqrt{n}\\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity, where $m$ is the number of\nagents and $n$ is the size of dataset at each agent.

Automated testing\ncan help to quickly identify CRLF vulnerabilities, and is particularly useful\nfor companies to test their applications before releasing them. However, CRLF\nvulnerabilities foster a better approach to mitigate CRLF vulnerabilities in\nthe early stage and help secure applications against high-risk known\nvulnerabilities. There has been less research on CRLF vulnerabilities and how\nto detect them with automated testing. There is room for further research to be\ndone on this subject matter in order to develop creative solutions to problems.\nIt will also help to reduce false positive alerts by checking the header\nresponse of each request. Security automation is an important issue for\ncompanies trying to protect themselves against security threats. Automated\nalerts from security systems can provide a quicker and more accurate\nunderstanding of potential vulnerabilities and can help to reduce false\npositive alerts. Despite the extensive research on various types of\nvulnerabilities in web applications, CRLF vulnerabilities have only recently\nbeen included in the research. Utilizing automated testing as a recurring task\ncan assist companies in receiving consistent updates about their systems and\nenhance their security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 03:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

However, imitating behaviors fully offline typically requires\nnumerous expert data. To tackle this issue, we study the setting where we have\nlimited expert data and supplementary suboptimal data. In this case, a\nwell-known issue is the distribution shift between the learned policy and the\nbehavior policy that collects the offline data. Prior works mitigate this issue\nby regularizing the KL divergence between the stationary state-action\ndistributions of the learned policy and the behavior policy. We argue that such\nconstraints based on exact distribution matching can be overly conservative and\nhamper policy learning, especially when the imperfect offline data is highly\nsuboptimal. To resolve this issue, we present RelaxDICE, which employs an\nasymmetrically-relaxed f-divergence for explicit support regularization.\nSpecifically, instead of driving the learned policy to exactly match the\nbehavior policy, we impose little penalty whenever the density ratio between\ntheir stationary state-action distributions is upper bounded by a constant.\nNote that such formulation leads to a nested min-max optimization problem,\nwhich causes instability in practice. RelaxDICE addresses this challenge by\nsupporting a closed-form solution for the inner maximization problem. Extensive\nempirical study shows that our method significantly outperforms the best prior\noffline IL method in six standard continuous control environments with over 30%\nperformance gain on average, across 22 settings where the imperfect dataset is\nhighly suboptimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 03:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

However, manipulation of DLOs is challenging as large\ngeometrically nonlinear deformations may occur during the manipulation process.\nThis problem is made even more difficult as the different deformation modes\n(e.g., stretching, bending, and twisting) may result in elastic instabilities\nduring manipulation. In this paper, we formulate a physics-guided data-driven\nmethod to solve a challenging manipulation task -- accurately deploying a DLO\n(an elastic rod) onto a rigid substrate along various prescribed patterns. Our\nframework combines machine learning, scaling analysis, and physics-based\nsimulations to develop a physically informed neural controller for deployment.\nWe explore the complex interplay between the gravitational and elastic energies\nof the manipulated DLO and obtain a control method for DLO deployment that is\nrobust against friction and material properties. Out of the numerous\ngeometrical and material properties of the rod and substrate, we show that only\nthree non-dimensional parameters are needed to describe the deployment process\nwith physical analysis. Therefore, the essence of the controlling law for the\nmanipulation task can be constructed with a low-dimensional model, drastically\nincreasing the computation speed. The effectiveness of our optimal control\nscheme is shown through a comprehensive robotic case study comparing against a\nheuristic control method for deploying rods for a wide variety of patterns. In\naddition to this, we also showcase the practicality of our control scheme by\nhaving a robot accomplish challenging high-level tasks such as mimicking human\nhandwriting and tying knots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 04:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

In many cases, the law prohibits\nthe collection of such information to prevent direct racial discrimination. As\na result, many analysts have adopted Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding\n(BISG), which combines individual names and addresses with the Census data to\npredict race. Although BISG tends to produce well-calibrated racial\npredictions, its residuals are often correlated with the outcomes of interest,\nyielding biased estimates of racial disparities. We propose an alternative\nidentification strategy that corrects this bias. The proposed strategy is\napplicable whenever one's surname is conditionally independent of the outcome\ngiven their (unobserved) race, residence location, and other observed\ncharacteristics. Leveraging this identification strategy, we introduce a new\nclass of models, Bayesian Instrumental Regression for Disparity Estimation\n(BIRDiE), that estimate racial disparities by using surnames as a\nhigh-dimensional instrumental variable for race. Our estimation method is\nscalable, making it possible to analyze large-scale administrative data. We\nalso show how to address potential violations of the key identification\nassumptions. A validation study based on the North Carolina voter file shows\nthat BIRDiE reduces error by up to 84% in comparison to the standard approaches\nfor estimating racial differences in party registration.

From the perspective of\napproximation theory, SRNO first embeds the LR input into a higher-dimensional\nlatent representation space, trying to capture sufficient basis functions, and\nthen iteratively approximates the implicit image function with a kernel\nintegral mechanism, followed by a final dimensionality reduction step to\ngenerate the RGB representation at the target coordinates.

Even though\nthere are some attempts that approach explainability and robustness issues in\nVQA models, very few of them employ counterfactuals as a means of probing such\nchallenges in a model-agnostic way. In this work, we propose a systematic\nmethod for explaining the behavior and investigating the robustness of VQA\nmodels through counterfactual perturbations. For this reason, we exploit\nstructured knowledge bases to perform deterministic, optimal and controllable\nword-level replacements targeting the linguistic modality, and we then evaluate\nthe model's response against such counterfactual inputs. Finally, we\nqualitatively extract local and global explanations based on counterfactual\nresponses, which are ultimately proven insightful towards interpreting VQA\nmodel behaviors. By performing a variety of perturbation types, targeting\ndifferent parts of speech of the input question, we gain insights to the\nreasoning of the model, through the comparison of its responses in different\nadversarial circumstances.

Among them, mapping and demapping convert a sequence of bits into\na sequence of complex numbers and vice versa. This operation is performed by a\nsystem of constellations~ -- by a set of labeled points on the complex plane.\nUsually, the geometry of the constellation is fixed, and constellation points\nare uniformly spaced, e.g., the same quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is\nused in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). By eliminating the\nuniformity of constellations, it is possible to achieve greater values of\ncapacity. Due to the current standard restrictions, it is difficult to change\nthe constellation both on the mapper or demapper side. In this case, one can\noptimize the constellation only on the mapper or the demapper side using\noriginal methodology.

Recent research on UAV motion planning in static\nenvironments has been unable to cope with the rapidly changing surroundings,\nresulting in trajectories that may not be feasible. Moreover, previous\napproaches that have addressed dynamic obstacles or external disturbances in\nisolation are insufficient to handle the complexities of such environments.\nThis paper proposes a reliable motion planning framework for UAVs, integrating\nvarious uncertainties into a chance constraint that characterizes the\nuncertainty in a probabilistic manner.

These approaches are questionable, at\nleast, whenever quantum and anharmonic effects on the nuclei vibrational\nproperties are large, such as in hydrogenous systems, high-$T_c$\nsuperconductors, and when systems are close to displacive phase transitions.\nHere we propose a novel non-perturbative approach to compute the\nelectron-phonon interaction from first principles that includes non-linear\neffects and takes into account the quantum nature of nuclei. The method is\nbased on the $GW^{(en)}$ approximation for the electron self-energy, given by\nthe effective nuclei-mediated electron-electron interaction $W^{(en)}$ and the\nelectron Green's function $G$. The electrons are treated at a mean-field level\nand the nuclei dynamics is described with a Gaussian distribution function,\nwhich can effectively take into account anharmonic effects at a mean-field\nlevel, e.g. within the self-consistent harmonic approximation. Pivotal\nquantities of the Gaussian $GW^{(en)}$ self-energy are the renormalized average\nvertices, which are computed in supercells with a stochastic approach, using\nthe the self-consistent electronic potential computed for different atomic\nconfigurations. In order to validate the method, $GW^{(en)}$ calculations are\nperformed on aluminum, a highly harmonic system with weak electron-phonon\ncoupling. The obtained results coincide with the ones obtained with standard\nlinear electron-phonon calculations. However, calculations performed on\npalladium hydride, a very anharmonic system, show a highly non-linear\nelectron-phonon interaction, with $GW^{(en)}$ bringing corrections as high as\nthe linear-order result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 09:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is the mainstream approach in\ndistributed learning to address AIM problems.

The indoor area can be divided\ninto a two-dimensional grid of discrete points, and the targets are located in\nonly a few grid points, which has a sparse property. Thus, the multitarget\nlocalization problem can be transferred into a sparse recovery problem.\nSpecifically, a CS-based framework is formulated exploiting the superposition\nof the received visible light signals at the multiple targets to be located via\nintertarget cooperation.

An event camera generates asynchronous streams of events\ntriggered independently by each of the pixels upon changes in the observed\nintensity. Providing great advantages in low-light and rapid-motion scenarios,\nsuch unconventional data present significant research challenges as traditional\nvision algorithms are not directly applicable to this sensing modality. The\nproposed method decomposes the tracking problem into a local SE(2)\nmotion-compensation step followed by a homography registration of small\nmotion-compensated event batches. The first component relies on Gaussian\nProcess (GP) theory to model the continuous occupancy field of the events in\nthe image plane and embed the camera trajectory in the covariance kernel\nfunction. In doing so, estimating the trajectory is done similarly to GP\nhyperparameter learning by maximising the log marginal likelihood of the data.\nThe continuous occupancy fields are turned into distance fields and used as\ntemplates for homography-based registration. By benchmarking the proposed\nmethod against other state-of-the-art techniques, we show that our open-source\nimplementation performs high-accuracy motion compensation and produces\nhigh-quality tracks in real-world scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 13:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

As many non-stationary\nenvironments exhibit gradual drifting patterns, the weighted strategy is\ncommonly adopted in real-world applications. However, previous theoretical\nstudies show that its analysis is more involved and the algorithms are either\ncomputationally less efficient or statistically suboptimal. This paper revisits\nthe weighted strategy for non-stationary parametric bandits. In linear bandits\n(LB), we discover that this undesirable feature is due to an inadequate regret\nanalysis, which results in an overly complex algorithm design.

We aim\nto clarify the relationship between the radiation field and the spatial\ndistribution of physical quantities through pseudo-observations using global 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation results. In particular, we focus on using\nthe depolarization effect to verify the polarization model and to identify the\nemission region. First, we show that wavelength-independent depolarization,\nwhich takes into account anisotropic turbulence, does not work efficiently\nbecause the polarized emission is stronger in regions of ordered spiral fields\nthan in regions dominated by isotropic turbulent fields. Beam depolarization\nbecomes more effective below 1 GHz. Although close to the equatorial plane\nthere will be strong depolarization which increases with observing wavelength,\nthis effect is less in the halo, making halo magnetic fields detectable through\ntheir polarized emission at meter-wavelength bands. Although polarized emission\nfrom the halo is below the detection limit of current facilities, it will be\ndetectable within the SKA era. In addition, we found that the spiral\npolarization projected on a screen is produced by overlapping magnetic flux\ntubes extending to different heights from the equatorial plane. This suggests\nthat the traditional classification of global magnetic fields has difficulty\nreproducing the global structure of the magnetic fields.

Additionally, the crosstalk between individual\nregulons (Rv0821c and Rv0144; Rv1152 and Rv2359) was shown to be critical in\nfacilitating bacterial persistence and allowing MTB to gain control over key\nmicronutrients within the cell. Defense antioxidants and nutritional immunity\nwere also identified as future avenues to explore further. In providing some of\nthe first insights into the methods utilized by MTB to endure in a hypoxic\nstate, this research suggests a range of strategies that might aid in improved\nclinical outcomes of TB treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 18:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

In Octo-Tiger, we rely on Kokkos and\nits various execution spaces for portable compute kernels. In turn, we use HPX\nto coordinate kernel launches, CPU tasks, and communication. This combination\nallows us to have a fine interleaving between portable CPU/GPU computations and\ncommunication, enabling scalability on various supercomputers. However, for HPX\nand Kokkos to work together optimally, we need to be able to treat Kokkos\nkernels as HPX tasks. Otherwise, instead of integrating asynchronous Kokkos\nkernel launches into HPX's task graph, we would have to actively wait for them\nwith fence commands, which wastes CPU time better spent otherwise. Using an\nintegration layer called HPX-Kokkos, treating Kokkos kernels as tasks already\nworks for some Kokkos execution spaces (like the CUDA one), but not for others\n(like the SYCL one). In this work, we started making Octo-Tiger and HPX itself\ncompatible with SYCL. To do so, we introduce numerous software changes, most\nnotably an HPX-SYCL integration. This integration allows us to treat SYCL\nevents as HPX tasks, which in turn allows us to better integrate Kokkos by\nextending the support of HPX-Kokkos to also fully support Kokkos' SYCL\nexecution space. We show two ways to implement this HPX-SYCL integration and\ntest them using Octo-Tiger and its Kokkos kernels, on both an NVIDIA A100 and\nan AMD MI100.

Their virtually infinite degrees of freedom allow precise\ncontrol over the final shape. The same enabling high dimensionality, however,\nposes a challenge for solving the inverse design problem involving this class\nof structures: to achieve desired 3D structures it typically requires\nmanufacturing technologies with extensive local actuation and control during\nfabrication, and a trial and error search over a large design space. We address\nboth of these shortcomings by first developing a simplified planar fabrication\napproach that combines two ingredients: strain mismatch between two layers of a\ncomposite shell and kirigami cuts that relieves localized stress. In principle,\nit is possible to generate targeted 3-D shapes by designing the appropriate\nkirigami cuts and selecting the right amount of prestretch, thereby eliminating\nthe need for local control. Second, we formulate a data-driven physics-guided\nframework that reduces the dimensionality of the inverse design problem using\nautoencoders and efficiently searches through the ``latent\" parameter space in\nan active learning approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the rapid\ndesign procedure via a range of target shapes, such as peanuts, pringles,\nflowers, and pyramids.

Urban\nparks reemerged as a savior of leisure activities and social joints under\nstrict social-distancing measures.

This paper aims to examine the\ndifference between before and after the COVID-19 pandemic by applying a gravity\nmodel. We examine variations in the service areas of urban parks, dependig on\nthe accessibility and design components of the park, using a dataset consisting\nof the park visitor's 'origin (home)' and 'destination (park)'. This LBD\n(Location-based Big Data) provides the home location of the urban park visitor.\nThe data was constructed by SK Telecom, using individual smartphone signal data\non a daily basis. Adjusted coefficients are estimated by OLS(ordinary least\nsquares) with cluster-robust standard errors to compare the difference between\n2019 and 2020. Contrary to a common belief, the transit accessibility of the\npark plays a more significant role than the physical traits of each parks.\nAccessibility itself determines a lot of the threshold distance of the park\nvisit. While previous studies have identified the factors influencing the\nreaching distance of park services, this study also attempts to determine how\nthe effects of the factors have changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As proven\nin this study, the marginal effects of those factors vary before and after the\npandemic. By identifying the factors that determine the distance to visit in\nurban parks, it is possible to see which factors should be more focused on in\nplanning small parks for residents in the neighborhood or large parks for more\nvisitors from the entire region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 22:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}
