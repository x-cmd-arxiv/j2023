The intercalates are found to crystallize in the\ntetragonal $ThCr_2Si_2$-type structure at the average level, however, with an\nenhanced interlayer iron-selenide spacing (d= 16.2 \\r{A}) that accommodates the\nheterocyclic molecular spacers. Quantitative atomic pair distribution function\n(PDF) analysis at variable times, suggests distorted $FeSe_4$ tetrahedral local\nenvironments that appear swollen with respect to those in the parent\n$\\beta$-FeSe. Simultaneously acquired, in-situ synchrotron X-ray powder\ndiffraction data disclose that secondary phases ($\\alpha$-Fe and $Li_2Se$),\ngrow significantly when higher Li-concentration is used in the solvothermal\nreaction or when the solution is aged. These observations are in line with the\nstrongly reducing character of the intercalation medium's solvated electrons\nthat mediate the defect chemistry of the expanded lattice superconductor. In\nthe latter, intralayer correlated local distortions indicate electron donating\naspects that reflect in somewhat enlarged Fe-Se bonds. They also reveal a\ndegree of relief of chemical pressure associated with a large distance between\nFe and Se sheets ('taller' anion height) and a stretched Fe-Fe square planar\ntopology. The elongation of the latter, derived from the in-situ PDF study,\nspeaks for a plausible increase in the Fe-site vacancy concentration. The\nevolution of the local structural parameters suggests an optimum reaction\nwindow where kinetically stabilized phases resemble the distortions of the\nedge-sharing Fe-Se tetrahedra, required for high-$T_c$ in expanded lattice\niron-chalcogenides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2023 16:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

To bridge this gap,\nin this paper, we propose a novel NeRF-based LiDAR odometry and mapping\napproach, NeRF-LOAM, consisting of three modules neural odometry, neural\nmapping, and mesh reconstruction.

However, most of these\nmethods employ manually crafted heuristics or expensive hyper-parameter\nsearches, which prevent them from scaling up to large datasets and neural\nnetworks. To solve this problem, we propose Trainable Projected Gradient Method\n(TPGM) to automatically learn the constraint imposed for each layer for a\nfine-grained fine-tuning regularization. This is motivated by formulating\nfine-tuning as a bi-level constrained optimization problem. Specifically, TPGM\nmaintains a set of projection radii, i.e., distance constraints between the\nfine-tuned model and the pre-trained model, for each layer, and enforces them\nthrough weight projections. To learn the constraints, we propose a bi-level\noptimization to automatically learn the best set of projection radii in an\nend-to-end manner. Theoretically, we show that the bi-level optimization\nformulation could explain the regularization capability of TPGM. Empirically,\nwith little hyper-parameter search cost, TPGM outperforms existing fine-tuning\nmethods in OOD performance while matching the best in-distribution (ID)\nperformance.

TF is gaining relevance due to\nits ability to mitigate traffic congestion by forecasting future traffic\nstates. However, TF poses one big challenge to the ML paradigm, known as the\nModel Selection Problem (MSP): deciding the most suitable combination of data\npreprocessing techniques and ML method for traffic data collected under\ndifferent transportation circumstances. In this context, Automated Machine\nLearning (AutoML), the automation of the ML workflow from data preprocessing to\nmodel validation, arises as a promising strategy to deal with the MSP in\nproblem domains wherein expert ML knowledge is not always an available or\naffordable asset, such as TF. Various AutoML frameworks have been used to\napproach the MSP in TF. Most are based on online optimisation processes to\nsearch for the best-performing pipeline on a given dataset. This online\noptimisation could be complemented with meta-learning to warm-start the search\nphase and/or the construction of ensembles using pipelines derived from the\noptimisation process. However, given the complexity of the search space and the\nhigh computational cost of tuning-evaluating pipelines generated, online\noptimisation is only beneficial when there is a long time to obtain the final\nmodel. Thus, we introduce AutoEn, which is a simple and efficient method for\nautomatically generating multi-classifier ensembles from a predefined set of ML\npipelines. We compare AutoEn against Auto-WEKA and Auto-sklearn, two AutoML\nmethods commonly used in TF. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoEn can\nlead to better or more competitive results in the general-purpose domain and in\nTF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2023 18:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

However, they depend on the all-in-focus\n(AIF) images, which cannot be captured in real-world scenarios. Such limitation\ndiscourages the applications of DFD methods. To tackle this issue, we propose a\ncompletely self-supervised framework that estimates depth purely from a sparse\nfocal stack. We show that our framework circumvents the needs for the depth and\nAIF image ground-truth, and receives superior predictions, thus closing the gap\nbetween the theoretical success of DFD works and their applications in the real\nworld. In particular, we propose (i) a more realistic setting for DFD tasks,\nwhere no depth or AIF image ground-truth is available; (ii) a novel\nself-supervision framework that provides reliable predictions of depth and AIF\nimage under the challenging setting. The proposed framework uses a neural model\nto predict the depth and AIF image, and utilizes an optical model to validate\nand refine the prediction.

In the past two decades, another\ntransistor based on conducting polymers called the organic electrochemical\ntransistor (ECT) was shown and largely studied. The main difference between\nECTs and FETs is the mode and extent of channel doping: while in FETs the\nchannel only has surface doping through dipoles, the mixed ionic-electronic\nconductivity of the channel material in Organic ECTs enables bulk\nelectrochemical doping. As a result, the organic ECT maximizes conductance\nmodulation at the expense of speed. Until now ECTs have been based on\nconducting polymers, but here we show for the first time that MXenes, a class\nof 2D materials beyond graphene, have mixed ionic-electronic properties that\nenable the realization of electrochemical transistors (ECTs).

The metabolic\nrate and oxygen consumption of the brain are reflected in internal jugular\nvenous oxygen saturation (sijvO2). The current gold standard for monitoring\nbrain oxygenation is invasive; it requires jugular vein catheterization under\nfluoroscopic guidance and therefore is rarely used. Photoacoustic (PA)\nmeasurement, on the other hand, can estimate the oxygen consumption of the\nbrain non-invasively in real time. Such a convenient method can potentially aid\nearlier detection and prevention of impending hypoxic brain injury. A\ndual-wavelength photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and ultrasound imaging (US)\nsystem was used to image the internal jugular vein (IJV) and estimate the\nsijvO2 in seven healthy volunteers. The system captured simultaneous\nco-registered PAT and US images at a rate of five frames per second. For each\nvolunteer, the internal jugular vein was identified under ultrasound guidance,\nthen, additional PA images from two optical wavelengths were collected and used\nto estimate the oxygen saturation of the internal jugular vein. For each\nvolunteer, the oxygen saturation was calculated from transverse and\nlongitudinal views of the internal jugular vein. The average sijvO2 was 72 +/-\n7 %. The preliminary results are encouraging and agree with those reported in\nthe literature. Photoacoustic images were successfully used to calculate the\nblood hemoglobin oxygen saturation in the internal jugular vein. These results\nraise confidence that this emerging technology can be used clinically for\naccurate, noninvasive estimation of sijvO2. In addition, the fast\nco-registration with US images makes the technique suitable for studying the\ntemporal variations of oxygen saturation in response to physiologic challenges\nin clinical settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2023 21:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

However, today's quantum\ncomputers are in their early stages, and hardware quality issues hinder the\nscale of program execution. Benchmarking and simulation of quantum circuits on\nclassical computers is therefore essential to advance the understanding of how\nquantum computers and programs operate, enabling both algorithm discovery that\nleads to high-impact quantum computation and engineering improvements that\ndeliver to more powerful quantum systems. Unfortunately, the nature of quantum\ninformation causes simulation complexity to scale exponentially with problem\nsize. In this paper, we debut Super.tech's SuperSim framework, a new approach\nfor high fidelity and scalable quantum circuit simulation. SuperSim employs two\nkey techniques for accelerated quantum circuit simulation: Clifford-based\nsimulation and circuit cutting. Through the isolation of Clifford subcircuit\nfragments within a larger non-Clifford circuit, resource-efficient Clifford\nsimulation can be invoked, leading to significant reductions in runtime. After\nfragments are independently executed, circuit cutting and recombination\nprocedures allow the final output of the original circuit to be reconstructed\nfrom fragment execution results. Through the combination of these two\nstate-of-art techniques, SuperSim is a product for quantum practitioners that\nallows quantum circuit evaluation to scale beyond the frontiers of current\nsimulators. Our results show that Clifford-based circuit cutting accelerates\nthe simulation of near-Clifford circuits, allowing 100s of qubits to be\nevaluated with modest runtimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2023 22:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

In this paper, we develop a multiple decoder\nU-net architecture where a noisy auxiliary decoder is used to generate noisy\nsegmentation. The segmentation from the main branch and the noisy segmentation\nfrom the auxiliary branch are used together to estimate the attention.

Additionally, our\nevaluation of the best-fitting result of the entire GRB sample suggests that\nthe expected number of GRBs with energy greater than $10^{55}$ ergs at a low\nredshift is 0.2, so that the emergence of GRB 221009A is consistent with\nexpected energy/luminosity functions within $\\sim 2\\sigma$ Poisson fluctuation\nerror, still adhering to the principles of small number statistics.\nFurthermore, we find that GRB 221009A and other energetic bursts, defined as\n$E_{\\gamma,\\rm iso} \\gtrsim10^{54} {\\rm ergs}$, exhibit no significant\ndifferences in terms of distributions of $T_{90}$, minimum timescale, Amati\nrelation, $E_{\\rm \\gamma,iso}$-$E_{\\rm X,iso}$ relation, $L_{\\gamma,\\rm\niso}-\\Gamma_0$ relation, $E_{\\gamma,\\rm iso}-\\Gamma_0$ relation, $L_{\\gamma,\\rm\niso}-E_{\\rm p,i}-\\Gamma_0$ relation, and host galaxy properties, compared to\nnormal long GRBs. This suggests that energetic GRBs (including GRB 221009A) and\nother long GRBs likely have similar progenitor systems and undergo similar\nenergy dissipation and radiation processes. The generation of energetic GRBs\nmay be due to more extreme central engine properties or, more likely, a rarer\nviewing configuration of a quasi-universal structured jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 00:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Owing to the\nemergence of high-dimensional data with structural breaks, there has been a\nrecent surge of interest in developing methods to accommodate\nhigh-dimensionality. In practice, when the dimension is less than the sample\nsize but is not small, it is often unclear whether a method that is tailored to\nhigh-dimensional data or simply a classical method that is developed and\njustified for low-dimensional data is preferred. In addition, the methods\ndesigned for low-dimensional data may not work well in the high-dimensional\nenvironment and vice versa. This naturally brings up the question of whether\nthere is a change point test that can work for data of low, medium, and high\ndimensions.\n  In this paper, we first propose a dimension-agnostic testing procedure\ntargeting a single change point in the mean of multivariate time series. Our\nnew test is inspired by the recent work of arXiv:2011.05068, who formally\ndeveloped the notion of ``dimension-agnostic\" in several testing problems for\niid data. We develop a new test statistic by adopting their sample splitting\nand projection ideas, and combining it with the self-normalization method for\ntime series. Using a novel conditioning argument, we are able to show that the\nlimiting null distribution for our test statistic is the same regardless of the\ndimensionality and the magnitude of cross-sectional dependence. The power\nanalysis is also conducted to understand the large sample behavior of the\nproposed test. Furthermore, we present an extension to test for multiple change\npoints in the mean and derive the limiting distributions of the new test\nstatistic under both the null and alternatives. Through Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we show that the finite sample results strongly corroborate the\ntheory and suggest that the proposed tests can be used as a benchmark for many\ntime series data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 01:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Small spanwise spacing ($\\lambda_z = 2.5h$) inhibits\nthe formation of counter-rotating vortices (CVP) and as a result, hairpin\nvortices are not generated and the downstream shear layer is steady. For\n$\\lambda_z = 5h$, the CVP and hairpin vortices are induced by the first row of\nroughness, perturbing the downstream shear layer and causing transition. The\ntemporal periodicity of the primary hairpin vortices appears to be independent\nof the streamwise spacing. Distributed roughness leads to a lower critical Reh\nfor instability to occur and a more significant breakdown of the boundary layer\ncompared to isolated roughness. When the streamwise spacing is comparable to\nthe region of flow separation ($\\lambda_x = 5h$), the high-momentum fluid\nbarely moves downward into the cavities and the wake flow has little impact on\nthe following roughness elements.

Despite many\nefforts into TTT, there is a confusion over the experimental settings, thus\nleading to unfair comparisons. In this work, we first revisit TTT assumptions\nand categorize TTT protocols by two key factors. Among the multiple protocols,\nwe adopt a realistic sequential test-time training (sTTT) protocol, under which\nwe develop a test-time anchored clustering (TTAC) approach to enable stronger\ntest-time feature learning. TTAC discovers clusters in both source and target\ndomains and matches the target clusters to the source ones to improve\nadaptation.

Finally, self-training~(ST) has\ndemonstrated great success in learning from unlabeled data and we empirically\nfigure out that applying ST alone to TTT is prone to confirmation bias.\nTherefore, a more effective TTT approach is introduced by regularizing\nself-training with anchored clustering, and the improved model is referred to\nas TTAC++.

Decision markets are well-suited mechanisms\nto elicit such information and aggregate it into conditional forecasts that can\nbe used for decision-making. However, for incentive-compatible elicitation,\ndecision markets rely on stochastic decision rules which entails that sometimes\nactions have to be taken that have been predicted to be sub-optimal. In this\nwork, we propose three closely related mechanisms that elicit and aggregate\ninformation similar to a decision market, but are incentive compatible despite\nusing a deterministic decision rule. Following ideas from peer prediction\nmechanisms, proxies rather than observed future outcomes are used to score\npredictions. The first mechanism requires the principal to have her own signal,\nwhich is then used as a proxy to elicit information from a group of\nself-interested agents. The principal then deterministically maps the\naggregated forecasts and the proxy to the best possible decision. The second\nand third mechanisms expand the first to cover a scenario where the principal\ndoes not have access to her own signal.

Aggregation and decision-making then follow the first mechanism. We\nevaluate our first mechanism using a multi-agent bandit learning system.

Although many\nadvanced approaches have achieved great success on few-shot learning (FSL)\ntasks, straightforwardly extending them into FSSGG is not applicable due to two\nintrinsic characteristics of predicate concepts: 1) Each predicate category\ncommonly has multiple semantic meanings under different contexts. 2) The visual\nappearance of relation triplets with the same predicate differs greatly under\ndifferent subject-object pairs.

However, both the two operations easily generate plenty of redundant\ninformation, which will weaken the complementarity between different level\nfeatures, resulting in inaccurate localization and blurred edges of lesions. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a general multi-scale in multi-scale\nsubtraction network (M$^{2}$SNet) to finish diverse segmentation from medical\nimage. Specifically, we first design a basic subtraction unit (SU) to produce\nthe difference features between adjacent levels in encoder. Next, we expand the\nsingle-scale SU to the intra-layer multi-scale SU, which can provide the\ndecoder with both pixel-level and structure-level difference information. Then,\nwe pyramidally equip the multi-scale SUs at different levels with varying\nreceptive fields, thereby achieving the inter-layer multi-scale feature\naggregation and obtaining rich multi-scale difference information. In addition,\nwe build a training-free network ``LossNet'' to comprehensively supervise the\ntask-aware features from bottom layer to top layer, which drives our\nmulti-scale subtraction network to capture the detailed and structural cues\nsimultaneously.

Emerging diffusion models have revealed their tremendous\nrepresentation capacities in numerous generation tasks, showing potential for\nstochastic trajectory prediction. However, expensive time consumption prevents\ndiffusion models from real-time prediction, since a large number of denoising\nsteps are required to assure sufficient representation ability. To resolve the\ndilemma, we present LEapfrog Diffusion model (LED), a novel diffusion-based\ntrajectory prediction model, which provides real-time, precise, and diverse\npredictions. The core of the proposed LED is to leverage a trainable leapfrog\ninitializer to directly learn an expressive multi-modal distribution of future\ntrajectories, which skips a large number of denoising steps, significantly\naccelerating inference speed. Moreover, the leapfrog initializer is trained to\nappropriately allocate correlated samples to provide a diversity of predicted\nfuture trajectories, significantly improving prediction performances. Extensive\nexperiments on four real-world datasets, including NBA/NFL/SDD/ETH-UCY, show\nthat LED consistently improves performance and achieves 23.7%/21.9% ADE/FDE\nimprovement on NFL.

Previous studies have successfully adopted\ncapsule networks to decompose the digits and faces into parts in an\nunsupervised manner to investigate the similar perception mechanism of neural\nnetworks. However, their descriptions are restricted to the 2D space, limiting\ntheir capacities to imitate the intrinsic 3D perception ability of humans. In\nthis paper, we propose an Inverse Graphics Capsule Network (IGC-Net) to learn\nthe hierarchical 3D face representations from large-scale unlabeled images. The\ncore of IGC-Net is a new type of capsule, named graphics capsule, which\nrepresents 3D primitives with interpretable parameters in computer graphics\n(CG), including depth, albedo, and 3D pose. Specifically, IGC-Net first\ndecomposes the objects into a set of semantic-consistent part-level\ndescriptions and then assembles them into object-level descriptions to build\nthe hierarchy. The learned graphics capsules reveal how the neural networks,\noriented at visual perception, understand faces as a hierarchy of 3D models.\nBesides, the discovered parts can be deployed to the unsupervised face\nsegmentation task to evaluate the semantic consistency of our method. Moreover,\nthe part-level descriptions with explicit physical meanings provide insight\ninto the face analysis that originally runs in a black box, such as the\nimportance of shape and texture for face recognition. Experiments on CelebA,\nBP4D, and Multi-PIE demonstrate the characteristics of our IGC-Net.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 06:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

There are many challenges in solving SFPDEs\nnumerically, especially for long-time integration since such problems are\nhigh-dimensional and nonlocal. Here, we combine the bi-orthogonal (BO) method\nfor representing stochastic processes with physics-informed neural networks\n(PINNs) for solving partial differential equations to formulate the\nbi-orthogonal PINN method (BO-fPINN) for solving time-dependent SFPDEs.\nSpecifically, we introduce a deep neural network for the stochastic solution of\nthe time-dependent SFPDEs, and include the BO constraints in the loss function\nfollowing a weak formulation. Since automatic differentiation is not currently\napplicable to fractional derivatives, we employ discretization on a grid to to\ncompute the fractional derivatives of the neural network output. The weak\nformulation loss function of the BO-fPINN method can overcome some drawbacks of\nthe BO methods and thus can be used to solve SFPDEs with eigenvalue crossings.\nMoreover, the BO-fPINN method can be used for inverse SFPDEs with the same\nframework and same computational complexity as for forward problems.

This paper\nproposes a novel two-stage KD framework to distil the knowledge from multiple\nspeech foundation models as teachers into a single student neural transducer\nmodel for ASR. In the first stage, the student model encoder is pre-trained\nusing the embeddings extracted from multiple teacher models.

Experiments on the LibriSpeech 100-hour subset show that the proposed\nKD framework improves the performance of both streaming and non-streaming\nstudent models when using only one teacher. The performance of the student\nmodel can be further enhanced when multiple teachers are used jointly,\nachieving word error rate reductions (WERRs) of 17.5% and 10.6%.

This paper describes a pipeline for creating synthetic\npoint clouds for specific use cases in order to train a model for point cloud\nsemantic segmentation. We show that models trained with our data achieve high\nper-class accuracy (> 90%) for semantic point cloud segmentation on unseen\nreal-world data. Our approach is applicable not only to the 3D camera used in\ntraining data generation but also to other depth cameras based on different\ntechnologies. The application tested in this work is a industry-related\npeg-in-the-hole process. With our approach the necessity of user assistance\nduring a robot's commissioning can be reduced to a minimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 08:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Transition from the\nelastic scattering regime to the inelastic scattering regime is regulated\nautomatically by the dependence of the form factors on the momentum transferred\nto the nucleus. At small momentum transfers elastic scattering dominates. AS\nthe transferred momentum increases, the contribution of the inelastic\nscattering increases, and the latter becomes dominant at sufficiently large\ntransferred momenta. The scattering of massive (anti)neutrinos interacting with\nnucleons through the $V\\mp A$ currents of the Standard Model is considered in\ndetail. Because of the nonzero masses, an additional channel arises for elastic\nand inelastic scattering of these (anti)neutrinos on nuclei due to the\npossibility of changing the helicity of these (anti)neutrinos.

However, such models can exhibit\nparametric uncertainty that propagates to the generated data. In addition, DNNs\nexhibit uncertainty in the parameters learnt during training.

Recently, it is found that the massless entanglement island\nappears in wedge holography with DGP gravity on the branes. In this paper, we\ngeneralize the discussions to the codim-n holography named cone holography. For\nsimplicity, we focus on the case with a codim-2 E brane and a codim-1 Q brane.\nWe discuss the effective action, mass spectrum and holographic entanglement\nentropy for cone holography with DGP terms. We verify that there is massless\ngravity on the branes, and recover non-trivial entanglement islands and Page\ncurves. Besides, we work out the parameter space which allows entanglement\nislands and Page curves. Compared with wedge holography, there are several new\nfeatures. First, one can not add DGP gravity on the codim-2 E brane. That is\nbecause the energy density has to be a constant on codim-2 branes for Einstein\ngravity in bulk. Second, the Hartman-Maldacena surface ends only on the codim-1\nQ brane. Third, the Hartman-Maldacena surface can be defined only in a finite\ntime.

It naturally enables a\nsix-degrees-of-freedom viewing experience and deep user engagement in virtual\nreality. Compared to 2D image assessment, light field image quality assessment\n(LFIQA) needs to consider not only the image quality in the spatial domain but\nalso the quality consistency in the angular domain. However, there is a lack of\nmetrics to effectively reflect the angular consistency and thus the angular\nquality of a light field image (LFI). Furthermore, the existing LFIQA metrics\nsuffer from high computational costs due to the excessive data volume of LFIs.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel concept of \"anglewise attention\" by\nintroducing a multihead self-attention mechanism to the angular domain of an\nLFI. This mechanism better reflects the LFI quality. In particular, we propose\nthree new attention kernels, including anglewise self-attention, anglewise grid\nattention, and anglewise central attention. These attention kernels can realize\nangular self-attention, extract multiangled features globally or selectively,\nand reduce the computational cost of feature extraction. By effectively\nincorporating the proposed kernels, we further propose our light field\nattentional convolutional neural network (LFACon) as an LFIQA metric. Our\nexperimental results show that the proposed LFACon metric significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art LFIQA metrics.

However, current NMT systems suffer from a lack of\nreliability, as their outputs that are often affected by lexical or syntactic\nchanges in inputs, resulting in large variations in quality. This limitation\nhinders the practicality and trustworthiness of NMT. A contributing factor to\nthis problem is that NMT models trained with the one-to-one paradigm struggle\nto handle the source diversity phenomenon, where inputs with the same meaning\ncan be expressed differently. In this work, we treat this problem as a bilevel\noptimization problem and present a consistency-aware meta-learning (CAML)\nframework derived from the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm to\naddress it. Specifically, the NMT model with CAML (named CoNMT) first learns a\nconsistent meta representation of semantically equivalent sentences in the\nouter loop. Subsequently, a mapping from the meta representation to the output\nsentence is learned in the inner loop, allowing the NMT model to translate\nsemantically equivalent sentences to the same target sentence. We conduct\nexperiments on the NIST Chinese to English task, three WMT translation tasks,\nand the TED M2O task. The results demonstrate that CoNMT effectively improves\noverall translation quality and reliably handles diverse inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 09:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

A solar eruption on 17 April 2021 produced a widespread Solar\nEnergetic Particle (SEP) event that was observed by five longitudinally\nwell-separated observers in the inner heliosphere at heliocentric distances of\n0.42 to 1 au: BepiColombo, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, and\nnear-Earth spacecraft. The event produced relativistic electrons and protons.\nIt was associated with a long-lasting solar hard X-ray flare and a medium fast\nCoronal Mass Ejection (CME) with a speed of 880 km/s driving a shock, an EUV\nwave as well as long-lasting radio burst activity showing four distinct type\nIII burst. Methods. A multi-spacecraft analysis of remote-sensing and in-situ\nobservations is applied to attribute the SEP observations at the different\nlocations to the various potential source regions at the Sun. An ENLIL\nsimulation is used to characterize the interplanetary state and its role for\nthe energetic particle transport. The magnetic connection between each\nspacecraft and the Sun is determined. Based on a reconstruction of the coronal\nshock front we determine the times when the shock establishes magnetic\nconnections with the different observers. Radio observations are used to\ncharacterize the directivity of the four main injection episodes, which are\nthen employed in a 2D SEP transport simulation. Results. Timing analysis of the\ninferred SEP solar injection suggests different source processes being\nimportant for the electron and the proton event. Comparison among the\ncharacteristics and timing of the potential particle sources, such as the\nCME-driven shock or the flare, suggests a stronger shock contribution for the\nproton event and a more likely flare-related source of the electron event.\nConclusions. We find that in this event an important ingredient for the wide\nSEP spread was the wide longitudinal range of about 110 degrees covered by\ndistinct SEP injections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 09:43:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

In\nradiation therapy (RT), radiation from linear accelerators is used to kill\nmalignant tumor cells. Scheduling patients for RT is difficult both due to the\nnumerous medical and technical constraints, and because of the stochastic\ninflow of patients with different urgency levels. In this paper, a Column\nGeneration (CG) approach is proposed for the RT patient scheduling problem. The\nmodel includes all the constraints necessary for the generated schedules to\nwork in practice, including for example different machine compatibilities,\nindividualized patient protocols, and multiple hospital sites. The model is the\nfirst to include planned interruptions in treatments due to maintenance on\nmachines, which is an important aspect when scheduling patients in practice, as\nit can create bottlenecks in the patient flow. Different methods to ensure that\nthere are available resources for high priority patients at arrival are\ncompared, including static and dynamic time reservation. Data from Iridium\nNetwerk, the largest cancer center in Belgium, is used to evaluate the CG\napproach. The results show that the dynamic time reservation method outperforms\nthe other methods used to handle uncertainty in future urgent patients. A\nsensitivity analysis also shows that the dynamic time reservation method is\nrobust to fluctuations in arrival rates. The CG approach produces schedules\nthat fulfill all the medical and technical constraints posed at Iridium Netwerk\nwith acceptable computation times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 10:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

In 1924, David Hilbert highlighted the strangeness of\ninfinity through a thought experiment now referred to as the Hilbert Hotel\nparadox, or simply Hilbert's Hotel. The paradox describes an \"fully\" occupied\nimaginary hotel having infinite number of single-occupancy rooms, the manager\ncan always find a room for new guest by simply shifting current guests to the\nnext highest room, leaving first room vacant. The investigation of wavefield\nsingularities has uncovered the existence of a direct optical analogy to\nHilbert's thought experiment.

However, creating such datasets for whole slide images\n(WSIs) in histopathology is a challenging task due to their gigapixel size. In\nrecent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an alternative\nsolution to reduce the annotation overheads in WSIs, as it does not require\nlabels for training. These SSL approaches, however, are not designed for\nhandling multi-resolution WSIs, which limits their performance in learning\ndiscriminative image features. In this paper, we propose a Dual-branch SSL\nFramework for WSI tumour segmentation (DSF-WSI) that can effectively learn\nimage features from multi-resolution WSIs. Our DSF-WSI connected two branches\nand jointly learnt low and high resolution WSIs in a self-supervised manner.\nMoreover, we introduced a novel Context-Target Fusion Module (CTFM) and a\nmasked jigsaw pretext task to align the learnt multi-resolution features.\nFurthermore, we designed a Dense SimSiam Learning (DSL) strategy to maximise\nthe similarity of different views of WSIs, enabling the learnt representations\nto be more efficient and discriminative.

Besides, the common solutions, e.g., self-attention, have\nquadratic complexity for input tokens, which makes them computationally\nunaffordable when applied to the feature maps with large sizes in TDNN. To\naddress these issues, we propose the Global Filter for TDNN, which applies\nlog-linear complexity FFT/IFFT and a set of differentiable frequency-domain\nfilters to efficiently model the long-term dependencies in speech. Besides, a\ndynamic filtering strategy, and a sparse regularization method are specially\ndesigned to enhance the performance of the global filter and prevent it from\noverfitting. Furthermore, we construct a dual-stream TDNN (DS-TDNN), which\nsplits the basic channels for complexity reduction and employs the global\nfilter to increase recognition performance.

Using these\nconditions and Farkas' lemma, sufficient conditions suitable for design are\nformulated. The proposed method is called a closed-loop design, as only the\nexistence of feasible inputs at the next time step is enforced by design. This\nis in contrast to most existing formulations, which compute control policies\nthat are feasible under the worst-case realizations of all model perturbations\nand exogenous disturbances in the MPC prediction horizon. The proposed method\nhas an online computational complexity similar to nominal MPC methods while\npreserving guarantees of constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility and\nstability.

According to the World Health Organization, the burden of\nMDs continues to grow with significant impact on health and major social and\nhuman rights. A large number of MDs exhibit pathological rhythms, which serve\nas the disorders characteristic biomarkers. These rhythms are the targets for\nneurostimulation techniques. Open-loop neurostimulation employs stimulation\nprotocols, which are rather independent of the patients health and brain state\nin the moment of treatment. Most alternative closed-loop stimulation protocols\nconsider real-time brain activity observations but appear as adaptive open-loop\nprotocols, where e.g. pre-defined stimulation sets in if observations fulfil\npre-defined criteria. The present theoretical work proposes a fully-adaptive\nclosed-loop neurostimulation setup, that tunes the brain activities power\nspectral density (PSD) according to a user-defined PSD. The utilized brain\nmodel is non-parametric and estimated from the observations via magnitude\nfitting in a pre-stimulus setup phase. Moreover, the algorithm takes into\naccount possible conduction delays in the feedback connection between\nobservation and stimulation electrode. All involved features are illustrated on\npathological alpha- and gamma-rhythms known from psychosis. To this end, we\nsimulate numerically a linear neural population brain model and a non-linear\ncortico-thalamic feedback loop model recently derived to explain brain activity\nin psychosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 11:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Prior studies have suggested methods that\nemploy 3D geometry information from the ICE transducer to create a sparse ICE\nvolume by placing 2D frames in a 3D grid, enabling training of 3D segmentation\nmodels. However, the resulting 3D masks from these models can be inaccurate and\nmay lead to serious clinical complications due to the sparse sampling in ICE\ndata, frames misalignment, and cardiac motion. To address this issue, we\npropose an interactive editing framework that allows users to edit segmentation\noutput by drawing scribbles on a 2D frame. The user interaction is mapped to\nthe 3D grid and utilized to execute an editing step that modifies the\nsegmentation in the vicinity of the interaction while preserving the previous\nsegmentation away from the interaction. Furthermore, our framework accommodates\nmultiple edits to the segmentation output in a sequential manner without\ncompromising previous edits. This paper presents a novel loss function and a\nnovel evaluation metric specifically designed for editing. Results from\ncross-validation and testing indicate that our proposed loss function\noutperforms standard losses and training strategies in terms of segmentation\nquality and following user input. Additionally, we show quantitatively and\nqualitatively that subsequent edits do not compromise previous edits when using\nour method, as opposed to standard segmentation losses. Overall, our approach\nenhances the accuracy of the segmentation while avoiding undesired changes away\nfrom user interactions and without compromising the quality of previously\nedited regions, leading to better patient outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 11:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

It can\nrepresent games with multiple decision points and incomplete information, and\nhence it is helpful in formulating games with uncertain inputs, such as poker.\nWe consider an extended-form game with two players and zero-sum, i.e., the sum\nof their payoffs is always zero. In such games, the problem of finding the\noptimal strategy can be formulated as a bilinear saddle-point problem. This\nformulation grows huge depending on the size of the game, since it has\nvariables representing the strategies at all decision points for each player.\nTo solve such large-scale bilinear saddle-point problems, the excessive gap\ntechnique (EGT), a smoothing method, has been studied. This method generates a\nsequence of approximate solutions whose error is guaranteed to converge at\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$, where $k$ is the number of iterations. However, it has the\ndisadvantage of having poor theoretical bounds on the error related to the game\nsize. This makes it inapplicable to large games.\n  Our goal is to improve the smoothing method for solving extensive-form games\nso that it can be applied to large-scale games. To this end, we make two\ncontributions in this work. First, we slightly modify the strongly convex\nfunction used in the smoothing method in order to improve the theoretical\nbounds related to the game size. Second, we propose a heuristic called\ncentering trick, which allows the smoothing method to be combined with other\nmethods and consequently accelerates the convergence in practice. As a result,\nwe combine EGT with CFR+, a state-of-the-art method for extensive-form games,\nto achieve good performance in games where conventional smoothing methods do\nnot perform well. The proposed smoothing method is shown to have the potential\nto solve large games in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 11:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

The prepared\nscaffolds exhibit levels of porosity and mechanical strength that are well\nsuited for osteoporotic bone repair.

The\nlatest methods (e.g., FixMatch) use a combination of consistency regularization\nand pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable successes. However, these methods all\nsuffer from the waste of complicated examples since all pseudo-labels have to\nbe selected by a high threshold to filter out noisy ones. Hence, the examples\nwith ambiguous predictions will not contribute to the training phase. For\nbetter leveraging all unlabeled examples, we propose two novel techniques:\nEntropy Meaning Loss (EML) and Adaptive Negative Learning (ANL). EML\nincorporates the prediction distribution of non-target classes into the\noptimization objective to avoid competition with target class, and thus\ngenerating more high-confidence predictions for selecting pseudo-label. ANL\nintroduces the additional negative pseudo-label for all unlabeled data to\nleverage low-confidence examples. It adaptively allocates this label by\ndynamically evaluating the top-k performance of the model. EML and ANL do not\nintroduce any additional parameter and hyperparameter. We integrate these\ntechniques with FixMatch, and develop a simple yet powerful framework called\nFullMatch. Extensive experiments on several common SSL benchmarks\n(CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, STL-10 and ImageNet) demonstrate that FullMatch exceeds\nFixMatch by a large margin. Integrated with FlexMatch (an advanced\nFixMatch-based framework), we achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Existing evaluations often fall short because they only evaluate\non popular subjects, or sample already existing facts from KBs. In this work,\nwe introduce a novel, more challenging benchmark dataset, and a methodology\ntailored for a realistic assessment of the KBC potential of LMs. For automated\nassessment, we curate a dataset called WD-KNOWN, which provides an unbiased\nrandom sample of Wikidata, containing over 3.9 million facts. In a second step,\nwe perform a human evaluation on predictions that are not yet in the KB, as\nonly this provides real insights into the added value over existing KBs. Our\nkey finding is that biases in dataset conception of previous benchmarks lead to\na systematic overestimate of LM performance for KBC. However, our results also\nreveal strong areas of LMs. We could, for example, perform a significant\ncompletion of Wikidata on the relations nativeLanguage, by a factor of ~21\n(from 260k to 5.8M) at 82% precision, usedLanguage, by a factor of ~2.1 (from\n2.1M to 6.6M) at 82% precision, and citizenOf by a factor of ~0.3 (from 4.2M to\n5.3M) at 90% precision. Moreover, we find that LMs possess surprisingly strong\ngeneralization capabilities: even on relations where most facts were not\ndirectly observed in LM training, prediction quality can be high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 13:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Most of\nthe existing deep learning works were designed based on pre-segmented sensor\nstreams and they have treated activity segmentation and recognition as two\nseparate tasks. In practice, performing data stream segmentation is very\nchallenging. We believe that both activity segmentation and recognition may\nconvey unique information which can complement each other to improve the\nperformance of the two tasks. In this paper, we firstly proposes a new\nmultitask deep neural network to solve the two tasks simultaneously. The\nproposed neural network adopts selective convolution and features multiscale\nwindows to segment activities of long or short time durations. First, multiple\nwindows of different scales are generated to center on each unit of the feature\nsequence. Then, the model is trained to predict, for each window, the activity\nclass and the offset to the true activity boundaries. Finally, overlapping\nwindows are filtered out by non-maximum suppression, and adjacent windows of\nthe same activity are concatenated to complete the segmentation task. Extensive\nexperiments were conducted on eight popular benchmarking datasets, and the\nresults show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\nboth for activity recognition and segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 13:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Fortunately, the recent self-supervised learning (SSL) is a\npromising approach to pretrain a model without annotations, serving as an\neffective initialization for any downstream tasks. Since SSL does not rely on\nthe presence of annotation, in general, it utilizes the large-scale unlabeled\ndataset, referred to as an open-set. In this sense, we introduce a novel\nOpen-Set Self-Supervised Learning problem under the assumption that a\nlarge-scale unlabeled open-set is available, as well as the fine-grained target\ndataset, during a pretraining phase.

However, after years of\ndevelopment, no device model can match the Pao-Sah model for standard\nsilicon-based transistors in terms of physical accuracy and computational\nefficiency to support large-scale integrated circuit design. One remaining\ncritical obstacle is the contacts of 2DM-FETs. In order to self-consistently\ninclude the contact effect in the current model, it is necessary to perform\nself-consistent calculations, which is a fatal flaw for applications that\nprioritize efficiency. Here, we report that the Landauer-QFLPS model\neffectively overcomes the above contradiction, where QFLPS means\nquasi-Fermi-level phase space theory. By connecting the physical pictures of\nthe contact and the intrinsic channel part, we have successfully derived a\ndrain-source current formula including the contact effect. To verify the model,\nwe prepared transistors based on two typical 2DMs, black phosphorus (BP) and\nmolybdenum disulfide (MoS2), the former having ambipolar transport and the\nlatter showing electron-dominant unipolar transport. The proposed new formula\ncould describe both 2DM-FETs with Schottky or Ohmic contacts. Moreover,\ncompared with traditional methods, the proposed model has the advantages of\naccuracy and efficiency, especially in describing non-monotonic drain\nconductance characteristics, because the contact effect is self-consistently\nand compactly packaged as an exponential term. More importantly, we also\nexamined the model at the circuit level. Here, we fabricated a three-bit\nthreshold inverter quantizer circuit based on ambipolar-BP process and\nexperimentally demonstrated that the model can accurately predict the circuit\nperformance. This industry-benign 2DM-FET model is supposed to be very useful\nfor the development of 2DM-FET-based integrated circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 13:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

This paper focuses on facial image editing via dialogue and\nintroduces a new benchmark dataset, Multi-turn Interactive Image Editing\n(I2Edit), for evaluating image editing quality and interaction ability in\nreal-world interactive facial editing scenarios. The dataset is constructed\nupon the CelebA-HQ dataset with images annotated with a multi-turn dialogue\nthat corresponds to the user editing requirements. I2Edit is challenging, as it\nneeds to 1) track the dynamically updated user requirements and edit the images\naccordingly, as well as 2) generate the appropriate natural language response\nto communicate with the user. To address these challenges, we propose a\nframework consisting of a dialogue module and an image editing module. The\nformer is for user edit requirements tracking and generating the corresponding\nindicative responses, while the latter edits the images conditioned on the\ntracked user edit requirements. In contrast to previous works that simply treat\nmulti-turn interaction as a sequence of single-turn interactions, we extract\nthe user edit requirements from the whole dialogue history instead of the\ncurrent single turn. The extracted global user edit requirements enable us to\ndirectly edit the input raw image to avoid error accumulation and attribute\nforgetting issues. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the\nI2Edit dataset demonstrate the advantage of our proposed framework over the\nprevious single-turn methods.

In addition, we observed a single pointing at 6.0 GHz\ntoward PSR J1913+1011 to look for a radio pulsar wind nebula. We also studied\nthe properties of the surrounding interstellar medium using data of the 13CO,\nHI, and infrared emissions, obtained from public surveys.

We detect faint diffuse emission around PSR J1913+1011 at 6.0 GHz, which\ncould represent a radio pulsar wind nebula powered by the pulsar.

Interestingly, we observe that the attention mechanism of ViTs\ntends to rely on few important tokens, a phenomenon we call token overfocusing.\nMore critically, these tokens are not robust to corruptions, often leading to\nhighly diverging attention patterns. In this paper, we intend to alleviate this\noverfocusing issue and make attention more stable through two general\ntechniques: First, our Token-aware Average Pooling (TAP) module encourages the\nlocal neighborhood of each token to take part in the attention mechanism.\nSpecifically, TAP learns average pooling schemes for each token such that the\ninformation of potentially important tokens in the neighborhood can adaptively\nbe taken into account. Second, we force the output tokens to aggregate\ninformation from a diverse set of input tokens rather than focusing on just a\nfew by using our Attention Diversification Loss (ADL). We achieve this by\npenalizing high cosine similarity between the attention vectors of different\ntokens. In experiments, we apply our methods to a wide range of transformer\narchitectures and improve robustness significantly. For example, we improve\ncorruption robustness on ImageNet-C by 2.4% while simultaneously improving\naccuracy by 0.4% based on state-of-the-art robust architecture FAN.

Most previous studies\nof MHD waves in Braginskii MHD considered the strict linear limit of vanishing\nwave perturbations. We show that those former linear results only apply to\nAlfv\\'en wave amplitudes in the corona that are so small as to be of little\ninterest, typically a wave energy less than $10^{-11}$ times the energy of the\nbackground magnetic field. For observed wave amplitudes, the Braginskii viscous\ndissipation of coronal Alfv\\'en waves is nonlinear and a factor around $10^9$\nstronger than predicted by the linear theory. Furthermore, the dominant damping\noccurs through the parallel viscosity coefficient $\\eta_0$, rather than the\nperpendicular viscosity coefficient $\\eta_2$ in the linearized solution. This\npaper develops the nonlinear theory, showing that the wave energy density\ndecays with an envelope $(1+z/L_d)^{-1}$. The damping length $L_d$ exhibits an\noptimal damping solution, beyond which greater viscosity leads to lower\ndissipation as the viscous forces self-organise the longitudinal flow to\nsuppress damping. Although the nonlinear damping greatly exceeds the linear\ndamping, it remains negligible for many coronal applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 14:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

At\nthe same time, the defense for adversarial examples has been mainly\ninvestigated in the context of training from random initialization on simple\nclassification tasks. To better exploit the potential of pre-trained models in\nadversarial robustness, this paper focuses on the fine-tuning of an\nadversarially pre-trained model in various classification tasks. Existing\nresearch has shown that since the robust pre-trained model has already learned\na robust feature extractor, the crucial question is how to maintain the\nrobustness in the pre-trained model when learning the downstream task. We study\nthe model-based and data-based approaches for this goal and find that the two\ncommon approaches cannot achieve the objective of improving both generalization\nand adversarial robustness. Thus, we propose a novel statistics-based approach,\nTwo-WIng NormliSation (TWINS) fine-tuning framework, which consists of two\nneural networks where one of them keeps the population means and variances of\npre-training data in the batch normalization layers. Besides the robust\ninformation transfer, TWINS increases the effective learning rate without\nhurting the training stability since the relationship between a weight norm and\nits gradient norm in standard batch normalization layer is broken, resulting in\na faster escape from the sub-optimal initialization and alleviating the robust\noverfitting. Finally, TWINS is shown to be effective on a wide range of image\nclassification datasets in terms of both generalization and robustness.

Reference-based line drawing colorization is a challenging task that\nrelies on the precise cross-domain long-range dependency modelling between the\nline drawing and reference image. Existing learning methods still utilize\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) as one key module of their model\narchitecture. In this paper, we propose a novel method called AnimeDiffusion\nusing diffusion models that performs anime face line drawing colorization\nautomatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion model\ntailored for anime content creation. In order to solve the huge training\nconsumption problem of diffusion models, we design a hybrid training strategy,\nfirst pre-training a diffusion model with classifier-free guidance and then\nfine-tuning it with image reconstruction guidance. We find that with a few\niterations of fine-tuning, the model shows wonderful colorization performance,\nas illustrated in Fig. 1. For training AnimeDiffusion, we conduct an anime face\nline drawing colorization benchmark dataset, which contains 31696 training data\nand 579 testing data. We hope this dataset can fill the gap of no available\nhigh resolution anime face dataset for colorization method evaluation. Through\nmultiple quantitative metrics evaluated on our dataset and a user study, we\ndemonstrate AnimeDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art GANs-based models for\nanime face line drawing colorization. We also collaborate with professional\nartists to test and apply our AnimeDiffusion for their creation work. We\nrelease our code on https://github.com/xq-meng/AnimeDiffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 14:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

While gains have been made towards the\ndevelopment of these factories of the future, many challenges remain to fully\nrealize this vision. To consider the challenges and opportunities associated\nwith this topic, a panel of experts from Industry, Academia, and Government was\ninvited to participate in an active discussion at the 2022 Modeling, Estimation\nand Control Conference (MECC) held in Jersey City, New Jersey from October 3-\n5, 2022. The panel discussion focused on the challenges and opportunities to\nmore fully integrate AI into manufacturing systems. Three overarching themes\nemerged from the panel discussion. First, to be successful, AI will need to\nwork seamlessly, and in an integrated manner with humans (and vice versa).\nSecond, significant gaps in the infrastructure needed to enable the full\npotential of AI into the manufacturing ecosystem, including sufficient data\navailability, storage, and analysis, must be addressed.

This universality allows us to easily analyze\nthe classic push, pull, and push-pull protocols both in their pure version and\nin several variations such as messages failing with constant probability or\nnodes calling a random number of others each round. Some dynamic models can be\nanalyzed as well, e.g., when the network is a $G(n,p)$ random graph sampled\nindependently each round [Clementi et al.

Although minimizing the statistics does improve the\nreceived information's freshness for status update systems in the sense of\naverage, the time-varying fading characteristics of wireless channels often\ncause uncertain yet frequent age violations. The recently-proposed statistical\nAoI metric can better characterize more features of AoI dynamics, which\nevaluates the achievable minimum peak AoI under the certain constraint on age\nviolation probability. In this paper, we study the statistical AoI minimization\nproblem for status update systems over multi-state fading channels, which can\neffectively upper-bound the AoI violation probability but introduce the\nprohibitively-high computing complexity.

For a large AoI exponent,\nthe problem is converted to a convex problem. Solving the two problems\nrespectively, we derive the near-optimal sampling interval for diverse status\nupdate systems. Insightful observations are obtained on how sampling interval\nshall be tuned as a decreasing function of channel state information (CSI).\nSurprisingly, for the extremely stringent AoI requirement, the sampling\ninterval converges to a constant regardless of CSI's variation.

To address this\nissue, we present a simple yet effective self-imitation scheme which distills a\nsubgoal-conditioned policy into the target-goal-conditioned policy.

We perform simulations of both of these\naccretion processes onto gas-rich star clusters using coupled smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics to model the gas, and N-body dynamics to model the stars. We find\nthat, for both accretion processes, the accreting star cluster loses some of\nits original mass while gaining mass from either the ambient background or the\ndense filament. The amount of mass lost from both these processes is small\ncompared to the total mass of the cluster. However, in the case of accretion\nfrom a background medium, the net effect can be a decrease in the total mass of\nthe cluster if it is travelling fast enough through the ambient medium ($>\n4$kms$^{-1}$). We find that the amount of mass lost from the cluster through\nfilamentary accretion is independent of the density, width, or number of\nfilaments funneling gas into the cluster and is always such that the mass of\nthe cluster is constantly increasing with time.

Demonstration Learning is a paradigm in which\nan agent learns to perform a task by imitating the behavior of an expert shown\nin demonstrations. It is a relatively recent area in machine learning, but it\nis gaining significant traction due to having tremendous potential for learning\ncomplex behaviors from demonstrations. Learning from demonstration accelerates\nthe learning process by improving sample efficiency, while also reducing the\neffort of the programmer.

However, trustworthy AI\ndiscourses postulate the homogeneity of AI, aim to derive common causes\nregarding the harms they generate, and demand uniform human interventions. Such\nAI monism has spurred legislation for omnibus AI laws requiring any high-risk\nAI systems to comply with a full, uniform package of rules on fairness,\ntransparency, accountability, human oversight, accuracy, robustness, and\nsecurity, as demonstrated by the EU AI Regulation and the U.S. draft\nAlgorithmic Accountability Act.

Accordingly, this paper proposes the following\ncategorizations, subject to ongoing empirical reassessments.

For periods less than 10 days, any companion\nwould have to have a mass less than 1Mo. We argue that scenarios where any such\ncompanion is a compact object are unlikely. The absorption lines indicate a\nnormal projected rotational velocity, making it unlikely that these stars\nevolved with the aid of a companion star that has since merged.

Our objective in this work\nis to propose a benchmark for evaluating DG algorithms, in addition to\nintroducing a novel architecture for tackling DG in biosignal classification.\nIn this paper, we describe the Domain Generalization problem for biosignals,\nfocusing on electrocardiograms (ECG) and electroencephalograms (EEG) and\npropose and implement an open-source biosignal DG evaluation benchmark.\nFurthermore, we adapt state-of-the-art DG algorithms from computer vision to\nthe problem of 1D biosignal classification and evaluate their effectiveness.\nFinally, we also introduce a novel neural network architecture that leverages\nmulti-layer representations for improved model generalizability. By\nimplementing the above DG setup we are able to experimentally demonstrate the\npresence of the DG problem in ECG and EEG datasets. In addition, our proposed\nmodel demonstrates improved effectiveness compared to the baseline algorithms,\nexceeding the state-of-the-art in both datasets. Recognizing the significance\nof the distribution shift present in biosignal datasets, the presented\nbenchmark aims at urging further research into the field of biomedical DG by\nsimplifying the evaluation process of proposed algorithms. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first attempt at developing an open-source framework for evaluating\nECG and EEG DG algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 09:19:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 11:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Many\ntheoretical studies of this model have ignored inter-radical interactions,\nparticularly the electron-electron dipolar coupling (EED), which have a\ndetrimental effect on the magnetosensitivity. Here, we set out to elucidate if\na radical pair allowed to undergo internal motion can yield enhanced\nmagneto-sensitivity. Our model considers the effects of diffusive motion of one\nradical partner along a one-dimensional reaction coordinate. Such dynamics\ncould in principle be realized either via actual diffusion of a mobile radical\nthrough a protein channel, or via bound radical pairs subjected to protein\nstructural rearrangements and fluctuations. We demonstrate that the suppressive\neffect of the EED interactions can be alleviated in these scenarios as a result\nof the quantum Zeno effect and intermittent reduction of the EED coupling\nduring the radical's diffusive excursions. Our results highlight the importance\nof the dynamic environment entwined with the radical pair and ensuing\nmagnetosensitivity under strong EED coupling, where it had not previously been\nanticipated, and demonstrate that a triplet-born radical pair can develop\nsuperior sensitivity over a singlet-born one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 13:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

To obtain paired synthetic medical images\nand segmentations, conditional generative models that use segmentation masks as\nsynthesis conditions were proposed. However, these segmentation\nmask-conditioned generative models still relied on large, varied, and labeled\ntraining datasets, and they could only provide limited constraints on human\nanatomical structures, leading to unrealistic image features. Moreover, the\ninvariant pixel-level conditions could reduce the variety of synthetic lesions\nand thus reduce the efficacy of data augmentation. To address these issues, in\nthis work, we propose a novel strategy for medical image synthesis, namely\nUnsupervised Mask (UM)-guided synthesis, to obtain both synthetic images and\nsegmentations using limited manual segmentation labels. We first develop a\nsuperpixel based algorithm to generate unsupervised structural guidance and\nthen design a conditional generative model to synthesize images and annotations\nsimultaneously from those unsupervised masks in a semi-supervised multi-task\nsetting.

On the one hand, we numerically show the\nvisualized evolution process of Kekul\\'{e} quasiparticles; while on the other\nhand, we analytically obtain the centroid trajectory of the quasiparticles, and\nboth of them agree well with each other. The results reveal that the\nrelativistic Zitterbewegung (ZB) phenomenon occurs in the Kekul\\'{e} systems.\nFurthermore, through analyzing the frequency of ZB, we unveil the one-to-one\nrelationship between ZB and Kekul\\'{e} textures, i.e., the ZB frequenies of\nKekul\\'{e}-O, Kekul\\'{e}-Y and Kekul\\'{e}-M quasiparticles feature single,\ndouble and six frequencies, respectively. Finally, we propose a scheme to\ndistinguish among different Kekul\\'{e} textures from the dynamical perspective.\nThe predictions in this paper are expected to be experimentally verified in the\nnear future, so as to facilitate further research of Kekul\\'{e} structures in\nsolid materials or artificial systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 14:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Breaking the translational\nsymmetry of the periodic microstrip can also lead to the localization of the\nmicrowaves at the microstrip edge. In this paper, we investigated periodic\nmicrostrip transmission line represented as 1D photonic crystal operating at\nthe GHz frequencies. On the ground of topology, we explain the condition of\nsurface state existence. The transmission measurements and numerical\ncalculations support our theoretical predictions. Moreover, we show that in the\nsymmetric microstrip the surface states split into symmetric and antisymmetric\nmodes due to evanescent wave coupling between the modes localized on the\nopposite sides of the microstrip. Interestingly, both modes offer significant\nmicrowave transmission inside the frequency gap, which is promising for\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 14:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

The study is, then, extended to include the case of\ndirected VANETs, resulting from the utilization of different communication\nranges by different vehicles.
