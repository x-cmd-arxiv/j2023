While light-matter interaction mediated by\nstrong exciton-plasmon coupling has been demonstrated to improve absorbance and\nspontaneous emission in a coupled TMDC and metallic nanostructures, the\nfabrication of tunable broadband phototransistor with high quantum yield is\nstill a challenging task. By synthesizing Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) capped with\na thin layer of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) through chemical route, we report a\nlithography-free fabrication of a large area broadband superior gate-tunable\nhybrid phototransistor based on monolayer graphene decorated by WS$_2$-Ag NPs\nin a three-terminal device configuration. The fabricated device exhibits\nextremely high photoresponsivity (up to $3.2\\times 10^4$ A/W) which is more\nthan 5 times higher than the bare graphene/WS$_2$ hybrid device, along with a\nlow noise equivalent power (NEP) (~10$^{-13}$ W/Hz$^{0.5}$, considering 1/f\nnoise) and high specific detectivity ~1010 Jones in the wide (325-730 nm)\nwavelength region. The additional PVP capping of Ag NPs helps to suppress the\ndirect charge and heat transfer and most importantly, increases the device\nstability by preventing the degradation of WS$_2$-Ag hybrid system. The\nenhanced optical properties of the hybrid device are explained via dipole\nmediated strong exciton-plasmon coupling, corroborated by COMSOL Multiphysics\nsimulation. Our work demonstrates a strategy towards obtaining an\nenvironment-friendly, scalable, high-performance broadband phototransistor by\ntuning the exciton-plasmon coupling for new generation opto-electronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2023 16:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

The management and query processing of imperfect databases is a very\nchallenging problem as it requires incorporating the data's qualities within\nthe database engine. Even more challenging, the qualities are typically not\nstatic and may evolve over time. Unfortunately, most of the state-of-art\ntechniques deal with the data quality problem as an offline task that is in\ntotal isolation of the query processing engine (carried out outside the DBMS).\nHence, end-users will receive the queries' results with no clue on whether or\nnot the results can be trusted for further analysis and decision making. In\nthis paper, we propose the it \"QTrail-DB\" system that fundamentally extends the\nstandard DBMSs to support imperfect databases with evolving qualities.\nQTrail-DB introduces a new quality model based on the new concept of \"Quality\nTrails\", which captures the evolution of the data's qualities over time.\nQTrail-DB extends the relational data model to incorporate the quality trails\nwithin the database system.

This problem intensifies for continuous\nsystems undergoing distributed, coupled interactions, such as in the case of\ntopography measurement systems, measuring narrow and deep grooves. Presented is\na method to invert a set of nonlinear coupled equations, which can be functions\nof unknown distributed physical quantities. The method employs a successive\napproach to iteratively converge to the exact solution of the set of nonlinear\nequations. The latter utilizes an approximate yet invertible model providing an\ninexact solution, which is evaluated using the hard-to-invert exact model of\nthe system. This method is applied to the problem of reconstructing the\ntopography of surface contours using a thin and long vibrating fiber. In\nnanoscale metrology, measuring inaccessible deep and narrow grooves or steep\nwalls becomes difficult and singular when attempting to extract distributed\nnonlinear interactions that depend on the topography. We verify our method\nnumerically by simulating the Van der Waals (VdW) interaction forces between a\nnanofiber and a nanoscale deep groove, and experimentally by exploiting\nmagnetic interactions between a magnetic topography and a vibrating, elastic\nbeam.

Ductile damage and its\nprecursors are represented by extreme values in stress and material state\nquantities, the spatial PDF of which are highly non-Gaussian with strong fat\ntails. Traditional deterministic forecasts using physical models often fail to\ncapture the statistics of structural evolution during material deformation.\nThis study proposes a data-driven statistical reduced-order modeling framework\nto provide a probabilistic forecast of the deformation process leading to\nporosity-based ductile damage, with uncertainty quantification. The framework\nstarts with computing the time evolution of the leading moments of specific\nstate variables from full-field polycrystal simulations. Then a sparse model\nidentification algorithm based on causation entropy, including essential\nphysical constraints, is used to discover the governing equations of these\nmoments. An approximate solution of the time evolution of the PDF is obtained\nfrom the predicted moments exploiting the maximum entropy principle. Numerical\nexperiments based on polycrystal realizations show that the model can\ncharacterize the time evolution of the non-Gaussian PDF of the von Mises stress\nand quantify the probability of extreme events. The learning process also\nreveals that the mean stress interacts with higher-order moments and extreme\nevents in a strongly nonlinear and multiplicative fashion. In addition, the\ncalibrated moment equations provide a reasonably accurate forecast when applied\nto the realizations outside the training data set, indicating the robustness of\nthe model and the skill for extrapolation. Finally, an information-based\nmeasurement shows that the leading four moments are sufficient to characterize\nthe crucial non-Gaussian features throughout the entire deformation history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2023 20:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

In this work, we propose DNN-Alias, an obfuscation method for\nDNNs that forces all the layers in a given network to have similar execution\ntraces, preventing attack models from differentiating between the layers.\nTowards this, DNN-Alias performs various layer-obfuscation operations, e.g.,\nlayer branching, layer deepening, etc, to alter the run-time traces while\nmaintaining the functionality. DNN-Alias deploys an evolutionary algorithm to\nfind the best combination of obfuscation operations in terms of maximizing the\nsecurity level while maintaining a user-provided latency overhead budget. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our DNN-Alias technique by obfuscating the\narchitecture of 700 randomly generated and obfuscated DNNs running on multiple\nNvidia RTX 2080 TI GPU-based machines. Our experiments show that\nstate-of-the-art side-channel architecture stealing attacks cannot extract the\noriginal DNN accurately. Moreover, we obfuscate the architecture of various\nDNNs, such as the VGG-11, VGG-13, ResNet-20, and ResNet-32 networks.

While the\nrandom sampling of latent variable $z$ is useful in generating diverse\nphoto-realistic images, it is not desirable for image rescaling when accurate\nrestoration of the HR image is more important. Hence, in places of random\nsampling of $z$, we propose auxiliary encoding modules to further push the\nlimit of image rescaling performance.

This work deals with protecting quantum procrastinators: users\nthat failed to migrate to post-quantum cryptography in time.\n  To address this problem in the context of digital signatures, we introduce a\ntechnique called signature lifting, that allows us to lift a deployed\npre-quantum signature scheme satisfying a certain property to a post-quantum\nsignature scheme that uses the same keys. Informally, the said property is that\na post-quantum one-way function is used \"somewhere along the way\" to derive the\npublic-key from the secret-key. Our constructions of signature lifting relies\nheavily on the post-quantum digital signature scheme Picnic (Chase et al.,\nCCS'17).\n  Our main case-study is cryptocurrencies, where this property holds in two\nscenarios: when the public-key is generated via a key-derivation function or\nwhen the public-key hash is posted instead of the public-key itself. We propose\na modification, based on signature lifting, that can be applied in many\ncryptocurrencies for securely spending pre-quantum coins in presence of quantum\nadversaries. Our construction improves upon existing constructions in two major\nways: it is not limited to pre-quantum coins whose ECDSA public-key has been\nkept secret (and in particular, it handles all coins that are stored in\naddresses generated by HD wallets), and it does not require access to\npost-quantum coins or using side payments to pay for posting the transaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2023 21:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

However, cell\nbiologists usually bump into the difficulty of plotting and computing these\ndata sets into biologically meaningful figures and metrics. Methods: This\nreport describes MigraR, an intuitive graphical user interface executed from\nthe RStudioTM (via the R package Shiny), which greatly simplifies the task of\ntranslating coordinate positions of moving cells into measurable parameters of\ncell migration (velocity, straightness, and direction of movement), as well as\nof plotting cell trajectories and migration metrics.

While significant research progress has been made toward the development\nof dark pattern taxonomies, developers and users currently lack guidance to\nhelp recognize, avoid, and navigate these often subtle design motifs.

Thermal management\nis even more critical in 3D integrated circuits (3D ICs) as the prevalence of\nthermal hotspots is expected to increase due to the presence of polymers and\nsolder materials that are of low thermal conductivity. Understanding how\nthermal conductivity is affected by the presence of these materials is required\nfor developing thermally aware IC design. The 3{\\omega} method can measure\nthermal conductivities spanning several orders of magnitude and is appropriate\nfor measuring the thermal properties of layered structures such as 3D ICs. In\nthis work, we use the 3{\\omega} method with planar and cylindrical heat flow\ngeometries to determine thermal conductivities of the memory layers and layers\nwith polymer and solder bumps in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) Random Access\nMemory (RAM). We determine the in-plane thermal conductivity of the memory\nlayers in HBM as 140 W/m-K, while the through-plane conductivity of the\npolymer/solder bump layer is 2 W/m-K. Combining the results of x-ray tomography\nand the 3-omega measurements, we estimate that the effective in-plane thermal\nconductivity of the overall HBM device is 100 W/m-K while the effective\nthrough-plane thermal conductivity is 7 W/m-K.

In this paper we extend the notion\nof extended phase space to all gauge theories with arbitrary combinations of\ninternal and spacetime local symmetries. We formulate this in terms of a\ncorresponding Atiyah Lie algebroid, a geometric object derived from a principal\nbundle which features internal symmetries and diffeomorphisms on an equal\nfooting. In this language, gauge transformations are understood as morphisms\nbetween Atiyah Lie algebroids that preserve the geometric structures encoded\ntherein. The extended configuration space of a gauge theory can subsequently be\nunderstood as the space of pairs $(\\varphi, \\Phi)$, where $\\varphi$ is a Lie\nalgebroid morphism and $\\Phi$ is a field configuration in the non-extended\nsense. Starting from this data, we outline a very powerful, manifestly\ngeometric approach to the extended phase space. Using this approach, we find\nthat the action of the group of gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms on\nthe symplectic geometry of any covariant theory is integrable. We motivate our\nconstruction by carefully examining the need for extended phase space in\nChern-Simons gauge theories and display its usefulness by re-computing the\ncharge algebra.

Last, a graph Structure-Trajectory Prompted Reconstruction\n(STPR) mechanism is proposed to exploit the spatial and temporal contexts of\ngraph nodes to prompt skeleton graph reconstruction, which facilitates\ncapturing more valuable patterns and graph semantics for person re-ID.\nEmpirical evaluations demonstrate that TranSG significantly outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art methods. We further show its generality under\ndifferent graph modeling, RGB-estimated skeletons, and unsupervised scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 02:27:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 03:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

As a model study, we let a massless quantum field be\nsubjected to a parametric process for a finite time interval such that the mode\nfrequency of the field transits from one constant value to another. This\nconfiguration mimics a statically-bounded universe, but not a continuously\nevolving one. The field squeezed by this process should contain information of\nthe process itself. If an atom is coupled to the field after the parametric\nprocess, its response will depend on the squeezing, and any quantum radiation\nemitted by the atom will carry this information away so that an observer at a\nmuch later time may still identify it. Our analyses show that 1) a remote\nobserver cannot measure the generated squeezing via the radiation energy flux\nfrom the atom because the net radiation energy flux is canceled.

Thus, until now only the total iteration complexity of these methods has\nbeen analyzed. In this paper, we derive a lower bound on the step size\nparameter that holds with high probability for a large class of adaptive\nstochastic methods. We then use this lower bound to derive a framework for\nanalyzing the expected and high probability total oracle complexity of any\nmethod in this class. Finally, we apply this framework to analyze the total\nsample complexity of two particular algorithms, STORM and SASS, in the expected\nrisk minimization problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 03:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2023 02:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

For efficient pain management and treatment, accurate\nclassification and evaluation of pain severity are necessary. However, this can\nbe challenging as pain is a subjective sensation-driven experience. Traditional\ntechniques for measuring pain intensity, e.g. self-report scales, are\nsusceptible to bias and unreliable in some instances. Consequently, there is a\nneed for more objective and automatic pain intensity assessment strategies. In\nthis paper, we develop PainAttnNet (PAN), a novel transfomer-encoder\ndeep-learning framework for classifying pain intensities with physiological\nsignals as input. The proposed approach is comprised of three feature\nextraction architectures: multiscale convolutional networks (MSCN), a\nsqueeze-and-excitation residual network (SEResNet), and a transformer encoder\nblock. On the basis of pain stimuli, MSCN extracts short- and long-window\ninformation as well as sequential features. SEResNet highlights relevant\nextracted features by mapping the interdependencies among features. The third\nmodule employs a transformer encoder consisting of three temporal convolutional\nnetworks (TCN) with three multi-head attention (MHA) layers to extract temporal\ndependencies from the features. Using the publicly available BioVid pain\ndataset, we test the proposed PainAttnNet model and demonstrate that our\noutcomes outperform state-of-the-art models.

The proposed\nmethods, termed Projected Zeroth-Order (P-ZO) dynamics, incorporate projection\nmaps into a class of continuous-time model-free dynamics that make use of\nperiodic dithering for the purpose of gradient learning. In particular, the\nproposed P-ZO algorithms can be interpreted as new extremum-seeking algorithms\nthat autonomously drive an unknown system toward a neighborhood of the set of\nsolutions of an optimization problem using only output feedback, while\nsystematically guaranteeing that the input trajectories remain in a feasible\nset for all times. In this way, the P-ZO algorithms can properly handle hard\nand asymptotical constraints in model-free optimization problems without using\npenalty terms or barrier functions.

Commonly\nused post-hoc interpretability methods may not be always useful because\ndifferent such methods can produce several plausible but different\ninterpretations of a given model, leading to confusion about which one to\nchoose. {In this work, an {inherently} interpretable encoder-decoder model\ncoupled with a single-layer fully connected network with unity weights is\nproposed for binary medical image classification problems. The feature\nextraction component of a trained black-box network for the same task is\nemployed as the pre-trained encoder of the interpretable model. The model is\ntrained to estimate the decision statistic of the given trained black-box deep\nbinary classifier to maintain a similar accuracy.} The decoder output\nrepresents a transformed version of the to-be-classified image that, when\nprocessed by the fixed fully connected layer, produces the same decision\nstatistic value as the original classifier. This is accomplished by minimizing\nthe mean squared error between the decision statistic values of the black-box\nmodel and encoder-decoder based model during training. The decoder output image\nis referred to as an equivalency map. Because the single-layer network is fully\ninterpretable, the equivalency map provides a visualization of the transformed\nimage features that contribute to the decision statistic value and, moreover,\npermits quantification of their relative contributions.

Then, TCL\ndetects the examples with wrong labels as the out-of-distribution examples by\nanother two-component GMM, taking into account the data distribution.

However, the previous methods struggle with imprecise bounding boxes\nas the logical representation lacks local visual information. To address this\nissue, we propose an end-to-end sequential modeling framework for table\nstructure recognition called VAST.

In the coordinate sequence decoder, we model the bounding\nbox coordinates as a language sequence, where the left, top, right and bottom\ncoordinates are decoded sequentially to leverage the inter-coordinate\ndependency.

However,\nconventional fully-passive RISs generally suffer from the so-called\n``multiplicative fading'' effect which thereby limits RISs' practicability and\nmanufacturability. In this paper, a novel architecture of ``Reconfigurable\nDistributed Antennas and Reflecting Surfaces (RDARS)'' is first proposed to\novercome this limitation from the ``multiplicative fading'' effect.\nSpecifically, unlike existing active RIS variants, RDARS inherits the low-cost\nand low-energy-consumption benefits of fully-passive RISs by default\nconfiguring all the elements as passive to perform the reflection mode. On the\nother hand, based on the design of the additional direct-through state, any\nelement of the RDARS can be dynamically programmed to connect with the base\nstation (BS) via fibers and perform the connected mode as remote distributed\nantennas of the BS to receive signals. Consequently, a controllable trade-off\nbetween the reflection gain and the distribution gain can be achieved via RDARS\nat the BS. To unveil the system behavior of the RDARS-aided system, we analyze\nthe received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under maximum ratio combining (MRC) at\nBS. Closed-form outage probability and ergodic achievable rate are also\nprovided and are verified through extensive simulations. To demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed RDARS, experiments are carried out using a\nprototype of RDARS with a total number of 256 elements which revealed extra 76%\nthroughput improvement could be achieved by deploying RDARS with only three\nelements performing connected mode. This thus confirms the effectiveness of the\nproposed RDARS and envisions it as a promising candidate for future 6G wireless\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 09:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

At this\nstage, identifying muscular deficits becomes important. Hence, in this study,\nthree discriminative features based on surface electromyographic signals (sEMG)\nacquired in a dynamic protocol are introduced to assess the damping ability and\ninterpret activation patterns in lower-limb muscles of ACLR athletes. Methods:\nThe features include the median frequency of the power spectrum density (PSD),\nthe relative percentage of the equivalent damping or equivalent stiffness\nderived from the median frequency, and the energy of the signals in the\ntime-frequency plane of the pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution (PWVD). To\nevaluate the features, 11 healthy and 11 ACLR athletes (6 months\npost-reconstruction surgery) were recruited to acquire the sEMG signals from\nthe medial and the lateral parts of the hamstrings, quadriceps, and\ngastrocnemius muscles in pre- and post-fatigue single-leg landings. Results: A\nsignificant damping deficiency is observed in the hamstring muscles of ACLR\nathletes by evaluating the proposed features.

The aim of this study is to propose a novel methodology to assist\nphysicians in their decision-making. Methods: A retrospective study between\n2012 and 2020 with 333 cases that underwent an ODX assay from three hospitals\nin Bourgogne Franche-Comt{\\'e} was conducted. Clinical and pathological reports\nwere used to collect the data. A methodology based on distributional random\nforest was developed using 9 clinico-pathological characteristics. This\nmethodology can be used particularly to identify the patients of the training\ncohort that share similarities with the new patient and to predict an estimate\nof the distribution of the ODX score. Results: The mean age of participants id\n56.9 years old. We have correctly classified 92% of patients in low risk and\n40.2% of patients in high risk. The overall accuracy is 79.3%. The proportion\nof low risk correct predicted value (PPV) is 82%. The percentage of high risk\ncorrect predicted value (NPV) is approximately 62.3%. The F1-score and the Area\nUnder Curve (AUC) are of 0.87 and 0.759, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed\nmethodology makes it possible to predict the distribution of the ODX score for\na patient and provides an explanation of the predicted score. The use of the\nmethodology with the pathologist's expertise on the different histological and\nimmunohistochemical characteristics has a clinical impact to help oncologist in\ndecision-making regarding breast cancer therapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 10:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

In\nthis work, we present a unifying view of existing MI bounds from the\nperspective of importance sampling, and propose three novel bounds based on\nthis approach. Since accurate estimation of MI without density information\nrequires a sample size exponential in the true MI, we assume either a single\nmarginal or the full joint density information is known.

Our\nMINE-AIS method improves upon existing energy-based methods such as MINE-DV and\nMINE-F by directly optimizing a tighter lower bound on MI. MINE-AIS uses MCMC\nsampling to estimate gradients for training and Multi-Sample AIS for evaluating\nthe bound. Our methods are particularly suitable for evaluating MI in deep\ngenerative models, since explicit forms of the marginal or joint densities are\noften available.

While\nseveral sophisticated degradation models have been manually designed to\nsynthesize LQ images from their HQ counterparts, the distribution gap between\nthe synthesized and real-world LQ images remains large. We propose a new\napproach to synthesizing realistic image restoration training pairs using the\nemerging denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM).\n  First, we train a DDPM, which could convert a noisy input into the desired LQ\nimage, with a large amount of collected LQ images, which define the target data\ndistribution.

Its key concept is how and where to make the aggregation of each set\nof user information into an individual entity, such as a ranked recommendation\nlist, a virtual user, or a multi-hot input vector encoding. This paper proposes\nan innovative strategy where aggregation is made in the multi-hot vector that\nfeeds the neural network model. The aggregation provides a probabilistic\nsemantic, and the resulting input vectors feed a model that is able to\nconveniently generalize the group recommendation from the individual\npredictions. Furthermore, using the proposed architecture, group\nrecommendations can be obtained by simply feedforwarding the pre-trained model\nwith individual ratings; that is, without the need to obtain datasets\ncontaining group of user information, and without the need of running two\nseparate trainings (individual and group). This approach also avoids\nmaintaining two different models to support both individual and group learning.\nExperiments have tested the proposed architecture using three representative\ncollaborative filtering datasets and a series of baselines; results show\nsuitable accuracy improvements compared to the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 10:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Qubit\ntechnologies such as superconducting qubits or spin qubits require detecting\nminuscule signals, typically achieved by reflecting a microwave tone off a\nresonator that is coupled to the qubit. Noise from cabling and amplification,\ne.g. from temperature variations, can be detrimental to readout fidelity. We\npresent an approach to detect phase and amplitude changes of a device under\ntest based on the differential measurement of microwave tones generated by two\nfirst-order sidebands of a carrier signal. The two microwave tones are sent\nthrough the same cable to the measured device that exhibits a narrow-band\nresponse for one sideband and leaves the other unaffected.

A problem in the HO management is to deal with\nincreasing HOs due to network densification in the 5G evolution and various HO\nskipping techniques have so far been studied in the literature to suppress\nexcessive HOs. In this paper, we propose yet another HO skipping scheme, called\nperiodic HO skipping. The proposed scheme prohibits the HOs of a mobile user\nequipment (UE) for a certain period of time, referred to as skipping period,\nthereby enabling flexible operation of the HO skipping by adjusting the length\nof the skipping period. We investigate the performance of the proposed scheme\non the basis of stochastic geometry. Specifically, we derive analytical\nexpressions of two performance metrics -- the HO rate and the expected downlink\ndata rate -- when a UE adopts the periodic HO skipping. Numerical results based\non the analysis demonstrate that the periodic HO skipping scenario can\noutperform the scenario without any HO skipping in terms of a certain utility\nmetric representing the trade-off between the HO rate and the expected downlink\ndata rate, in particular when the UE moves fast. Furthermore, we numerically\nshow that there can exist an optimal length of the skipping period, which\nlocally maximizes the utility metric, and approximately provide the optimal\nskipping period in a simple form. Numerical comparison with some other HO\nskipping techniques is also conducted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 11:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

The present contribution focuses on balance theory, stating that\nsocial agents tend to avoid the formation of `unbalanced', or `frustrated',\ncycles, i.e. cycles with an odd number of negative links. Such a statement can\nbe made statistically rigorous only after a comparison with a null model. Since\nthe existing ones cannot account for the heterogeneity of individual actors,\nwe, first, extend the Exponential Random Graphs framework to binary,\nundirected, signed networks with local constraints and, then, employ both\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous benchmarks to compare the empirical abundance of\nshort cycles with its expected value, on several, real-world systems. What\nemerges is that the level of balance in real-world networks crucially depends\non (at least) three factors, i.e. the measure adopted to quantify it, the\nnature of the data, the null model employed for the analysis. As an example,\nthe study of triangles reveals that homogeneous null models with global\nconstraints tend to favour the weak version of balance theory, according to\nwhich only the triangle with one negative link should be under-represented in\nreal, social and political networks; on the other hand, heterogeneous null\nmodels with local constraints tend to favour the strong version of balance\ntheory, according to which also the triangle with all negative links should be\nunder-represented in real, social networks.

However, in many cases, the underlying graph is either\nunavailable or naively obtained, calling for more advanced methods to its\nestimation. Indeed, graph topology inference methods that estimate the network\nstructure from a set of signal observations have a long and well established\nhistory. By assuming that the observations are both Gaussian and stationary in\nthe sought graph, this paper proposes a new scheme to learn the network from\nnodal observations. Consideration of graph stationarity overcomes some of the\nlimitations of the classical Graphical Lasso algorithm, which is constrained to\na more specific class of graphical models. On the other hand, Gaussianity\nallows us to regularize the estimation, requiring less samples than in existing\ngraph stationarity-based approaches.

These events may be seen as examples of the kind of unsteady and\nintermittent dynamics relevant to the flow around airfoils and wings in a\nvariety of laboratory and real-world applications. W investigate the\ninstability mechanisms at the heart of these extreme events, and how knowledge\nthereof may be harnessed for efficient data driven forecasting. Through a\nwavelet and spectral analysis of the flow we find that the extreme events arise\ndue to the instability of a specific frequency component distinct from the\nvortex shedding mode. During these events this extreme event manifold draws\nenergy from the energetically dominant vortex shedding flow and undergoes an\nabrupt energy transfer from small to large scales. We also investigate the\nspatial dependence of the temporal correlation and mutual information between\nthe surface pressure and the aerodynamic forces, with the aim of identifying\nregions of the airfoil amenable to sparse sensing and the efficient forecasting\nof extremes. Building on previous work, we show that relying solely on the\nmutual information for optimal sensor placement fails to improve model\nprediction over uniform or random sensor placement. However, we show that by\nisolating the extreme event frequency component offline through a wavelet\ntransform we are able to circumvent the requirement for a recursive long-short\nterm memory (LSTM) network -- resulting in a significant reduction in\ncomputational complexity over the previous state of the art. Using the wavelet\npre-processed data in conjunction with an extreme event-tailored loss function\nwe find that our model is capable of forecasting extreme events using only\nthree pressure sensors. Furthermore, we find our model to be robust to sensor\nlocation -- showing promise for the use of our model in dynamically varying\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 12:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

We analyzed the\ncorrelation of participants' efficacy with popular programming experience\nmeasures.\n  Results: We found that programmers with high efficacy read source code more\ntargeted and with lower cognitive load. Commonly used experience levels do not\npredict programmer efficacy well, but self-estimation and indicators of\nlearning eagerness are fairly accurate.\n  Implications: The identified correlates of programmer efficacy can be used\nfor future research and practice (e.g., hiring). Future research should also\nconsider efficacy as a group sampling method, rather than using simple\nexperience measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 12:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Sequential optimization\nmethods, which are often used in quantum circuit tensor networks, are popular\nfor optimizing the parametrized gates of PQCs. This paper focuses on the case\nwhere the components to be optimized are single-qubit gates, in which the\nanalytic optimization of a single-qubit gate is sequentially performed. The\nanalytical solution is given by diagonalization of a matrix whose elements are\ncomputed from the expectation values of observables specified by a set of\npredetermined parameters which we call the parameter configurations. In this\nstudy, we first show that the optimization accuracy significantly depends on\nthe choice of parameter configurations due to the statistical errors in the\nexpectation values.

We investigate the\nexistence of a chromospheric canopy as a necessary condition for the formation\nof a penumbra and aim to find the origin of the inclined magnetic fields.\nSpectropolarimetric observations of NOAA AR 12776 from the GRIS@GREGOR\ninstrument were analyzed. Atmospheric parameters were obtained from the deep\nphotospheric Ca I 10839 {\\AA} line (VFISV inversion code), the mostly\nphotospheric Si I 10827 {\\AA} line (SIR inversion code) and the chromospheric\nHe I 10830 {\\AA} triplet (HAZEL inversion code). In the deepest atmospheric\nlayers, we find that the magnetic properties (inclination and field strength\ndistribution) measured on the sunspot sector with fully fledged penumbra are\nsimilar to those measured on the sector without penumbra. Yet, in higher\nlayers, magnetic properties are different. In the region showing no penumbra,\nalmost vertical chromospheric magnetic fields are observed. Additionally, thin\nfilamentary structures with a maximum width of 0.1 arcsec are seen in\nphotospheric high-resolution TiO-band images in this region. The existence of a\npenumbra is found to be discriminated by the conditions in the chromosphere.\nThis indicates that a chromospheric canopy is a necessary condition for the\nformation of a penumbra. However, our results demonstrate that inclined fields\nin the chromospheric canopy are not needed for the development of inclined\nfields in the photosphere. We question the `fallen-magnetic-flux-tubes'\npenumbra formation scenario and favor a scenario, in which inclined fields\nemerge from below the surface and are blocked by the overlying chromospheric\ncanopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 13:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

However, the highly volatile\ne-fuels, such as short-chain oxymethylene ethers are prone to flash\nvaporization phenomena, which is associated with the formation and growth of\nvapor bubbles, followed by explosive bursting of the liquid jet. The simulation\nof a flash boiling spray of such highly volatile liquid fuels in the context of\nautomotive or cryogenic engines is numerically challenging due to several\nreasons, including (1) the complexity of the bubble growth process in the\npresence of multiple vapor bubbles and (2) the need to use an extremely small\ntime step size to accurately capture the underlying physics associated with the\nflash boiling process. In this paper, we first present a bubble growth model in\nflash boiling microdroplets considering bubble interactions along with the\nfinite droplet size effects. Based on the dimensional analysis of the newly\nderived Rayleigh Plesset equation, a simplified semi-analytical solution for\nbubble growth, which also includes the bubble interactions, is then derived to\nestimate the bubble growth behavior with reasonable accuracy using the larger\ntime step sizes for a wide range of operating conditions. The derived\nsemi-analytical solution is shown to be a good approximation for describing the\nbubble growth rate over the whole lifetime of the bubble. The bubble\ninteractions are found to delay the onset of droplet bursting due to the slower\ngrowth of the vapor bubble compared to the bubble growth without bubble\ninteractions. Furthermore, in a comparison with DNS results, the proposed\nbubble growth model is shown to reasonably capture the impact of bubble\ninteractions leading to smaller volumetric droplet expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 13:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Firstly, we\npropose a lower bound on the minimum symplectic distance of 1-generator\nquasi-cyclic codes of index even. Further, we get many binary quasi-cyclic\ncodes with large symplectic distances utilizing computer-supported combination\nand search methods, all corresponding to good quaternary additive codes.\nNotably, $15$ additive codes have greater distances than best-known quaternary\nlinear codes in Grassl's code table (bounds on the minimum distance of\nquaternary linear codes http://www.codetables.de) for the same lengths and\ndimensions. Moreover, employing a combinatorial approach, we partially\ndetermine the parameters of optimal quaternary additive $3.5$-dimensional codes\nwith lengths from $28$ to $254$. Finally, as an extension, we also construct\nsome good additive complementary dual codes with larger distances than\nbest-known quaternary linear complementary dual codes in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 14:30:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 14:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

Our method is data-driven as we consider for each\ngame on Steam how many players assigned each tag to it. We introduce a new\nmetric, the priority of a Steam tag, that we find interesting in itself. This\nallows us to create taxonomies and meronomies of some of the Steam tags. In\nparticular, in addition to providing a list of game genres, we distinguish what\ntags are essential or not for describing games according to players.\nFurthermore, we provide a small group of tags that summarise all information\ncontained in the Steam tags.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 15:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

In this complex representation learning problem,\nthree main challenges can be characterized as follows: i) How to learn\nconsistent representations of samples across all views? ii) How to exploit and\nutilize category correlations of multi-label to guide inference? iii) How to\navoid the negative impact resulting from the incompleteness of views or labels?\nTo cope with these problems, we propose a general multi-view multi-label\nlearning framework named label-guided masked view- and category-aware\ntransformers in this paper. First, we design two transformer-style based\nmodules for cross-view features aggregation and multi-label classification,\nrespectively. The former aggregates information from different views in the\nprocess of extracting view-specific features, and the latter learns subcategory\nembedding to improve classification performance. Second, considering the\nimbalance of expressive power among views, an adaptively weighted view fusion\nmodule is proposed to obtain view-consistent embedding features. Third, we\nimpose a label manifold constraint in sample-level representation learning to\nmaximize the utilization of supervised information. Last but not least, all the\nmodules are designed under the premise of incomplete views and labels, which\nmakes our method adaptable to arbitrary multi-view and multi-label data.\nExtensive experiments on five datasets confirm that our method has clear\nadvantages over other state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 15:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

The resulting point cloud sampling of the scene\ngeometry can be meshed in order to create a continuous representation for\ndifferent applications: visualization, simulation, navigation, etc. Because of\nthe highly dynamic nature of these urban scenes, long term mapping should rely\non frequent map updates. A trivial solution is to simply replace old data with\nnewer data each time a new acquisition is made. However it has two drawbacks:\n1) the old data may be of higher quality (resolution, precision) than the new\nand 2) the coverage of the scene might be different in various acquisitions,\nincluding varying occlusions. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic\npipeline to address these two issues by formulating the problem of merging\nmeshes with different quality, coverage and acquisition time.

The most advanced\nmethods typically present boxes and masks as vertex sequences to model\nreferring detection and segmentation as an autoregressive sequential vertex\ngeneration paradigm. However, generating high-dimensional vertex sequences\nsequentially is error-prone because the upstream of the sequence remains static\nand cannot be refined based on downstream vertex information, even if there is\na significant location gap. Besides, with limited vertexes, the inferior\nfitting of objects with complex contours restricts the performance upper bound.\nTo deal with this dilemma, we propose a parallel vertex generation paradigm for\nsuperior high-dimension scalability with a diffusion model by simply modifying\nthe noise dimension. An intuitive materialization of our paradigm is Parallel\nVertex Diffusion (PVD) to directly set vertex coordinates as the generation\ntarget and use a diffusion model to train and infer. We claim that it has two\nflaws: (1) unnormalized coordinate caused a high variance of loss value; (2)\nthe original training objective of PVD only considers point consistency but\nignores geometry consistency. To solve the first flaw, Center Anchor Mechanism\n(CAM) is designed to convert coordinates as normalized offset values to\nstabilize the training loss value. For the second flaw, Angle summation loss\n(ASL) is designed to constrain the geometry difference of prediction and ground\ntruth vertexes for geometry-level consistency.

However, the inherent conflict between these two concepts\nmakes it seemingly impossible to devise a satisfactory solution to both of them\nsimultaneously. Therefore, we ask, \"is it possible to divide them into two\nproblems to conquer independently?\" To this end, we propose a\nprompt-tuning-based method termed PromptFusion to enable the decoupling of\nstability and plasticity.

In this paper, we\npropose an altering resolution framework called AR-Seg for compressed videos to\nachieve efficient VSS. AR-Seg aims to reduce the computational cost by using\nlow resolution for non-keyframes. To prevent the performance degradation caused\nby downsampling, we design a Cross Resolution Feature Fusion (CReFF) module,\nand supervise it with a novel Feature Similarity Training (FST) strategy.\nSpecifically, CReFF first makes use of motion vectors stored in a compressed\nvideo to warp features from high-resolution keyframes to low-resolution\nnon-keyframes for better spatial alignment, and then selectively aggregates the\nwarped features with local attention mechanism. Furthermore, the proposed FST\nsupervises the aggregated features with high-resolution features through an\nexplicit similarity loss and an implicit constraint from the shared decoding\nlayer. Extensive experiments on CamVid and Cityscapes show that AR-Seg achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and is compatible with different segmentation\nbackbones.

Our recent paper (Spencer et al., 2022) looked again at the minor flares\n(flux density S of a few 100 mJy) and compared their properties with those of a\nsample of major flares (S > 1 Jy). We find that the minor flares have rise\ntimes and duration of ~ 1 hour, as opposed to ~ days for the major flares.\nMinor flares show more rapid expansion of the synchrotron radiation emitting\nmaterial than in the strong flares. They also appear closer to the binary,\nwhereas the large flares form a more developed jet, i.e. the jets formed in\nminor flares are short and wide, those in major flares are long and thin. We\nused the results of Fender & Bright (2019) to calculate the magnetic field and\nexpansion velocity as a fraction B of the speed of light under minimum energy\nconditions when the source is optically thick for samples of minor and major\nflares. The minimum power in the source was found using the rise time of the\nflares. The minor flares have lower minimum power but have larger velocities\nand energy densities than the major flares. Minor flares can occur while a\nmajor flare is in progress, suggesting an indirect coupling between them. The\nspectral evolution of the minor flares can be explained by either an expanding\nsynchrotron source or a shock model. Further investigation requires high\nresolution VLBI observations at the 1 mas level if we wish to understand the\ndevelopment of the source. The problem is that Cygnus X-3 is strongly scattered\nby the interstellar medium so high frequencies in the several 10s of GHz are\nrequired for the resolution needed.

The answers that these economists had provided were mostly\nwrong, above all by defining the equivalence of commodities at the level of\nexchange, but also because of a confusion made between values and prices, and\nwrong views of what production really is and the role of fixed capital. Using\nthe mathematical theory of measurement and the physical theory of dimensional\nanalysis, this book provides a coherent theory of value based on an equivalence\nrelation not at the level of exchange, but of production. Indeed exchange is\nconsidered here as an equivalence relation between money and a monetary price,\nand not between commodities, modern monetary theory having demonstrated that\nmoney is not a commodity. The book rejects the conception of production as a\nsurplus, which owes much to Sraffa's theory of production prices, and is shown\nto be severely flawed. It founds the equivalence of commodities at the level of\na production process considered as a transformation process. It rehabilitates\nthe labor theory of value, based on the connection between money and labor due\nthe monetary payment of wages, which allows the homogenization of various kinds\nof concrete labor into abstract labor. It shows that value is then a dimension\nof commodities and that this dimension is time, i.e. the time of physics. On\nthis background, the book shows that the calculation of values for all\ncommodities is always possible, even in the case of joint production, and that\nthere cannot be any commodity residue left by this calculation. As a further\nstep, this book provides a coherent theory of the realization of the product,\nwhich occurs in the circulation process. Using an idea - the widow's cruse -\nintroduced by Keynes in his Treatise on Money, it brings to light the mechanism\nbehind the transformation of money values into money prices and of\nsurplus-value into profits and other transfer incomes, ensuring the formation\nof monetary profits. The book sheds some light on the rate of profit, its\ndeterminants and its evolution, showing in particular the paramount importance\nof capitalist consumption as one of its main determinants. In passing it\nexplains the reasons why in the real world there is a multiplicity of profit\nrates. Finally, it allows to solve in a precise and illustrated way the\nproblems raised by the Marxist law of the tendency of the rate of profit to\nfall. Most of the results obtained translate into principles, the first ones\nbeing truly basic, the following ones less basic, but all of them being\nfundamental. All in all, this book might provide the first building blocks to\ndevelop a full-fledged and scientific economic theory to many fellow\neconomists, critical of neo-classical theory, but who have not yet dicovered\nthe bases of a complete and coherent alternative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 10:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

This problem has applications in different fields,\nsuch as transportation infrastructure (rail and road networks),\ntelecommunications, and sewage facilities. To solve the TRSP, we propose an\nenhanced iterated local search (eILS) approach. The enhancement of the ILS\nfirstly includes an intensification procedure that incorporates a set of local\nsearch operators and removal-repair heuristics crafted for the TRSP. Next, four\ndifferent mechanisms are used in the perturbation phase. Finally, an elite set\nof solutions is used to extensively explore the neighborhood of local optima as\nwell as to enhance diversification during search space exploration. To measure\nthe performance of the proposed method, experiments were conducted based on\nbenchmark instances from the literature, and the results obtained were compared\nwith those of an existing method. Our method achieved very good results, since\nit reached the best overall gap, which is three times lower than that of the\nliterature. Furthermore, eILS improved the best-known solution for $34$\ninstances among a total of $56$ while maintaining reasonable computational\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2023 23:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

A probabilistic risk-based\nframework for decision-making has already been proposed. However, in order to\nlearn the statistical models necessary for decision-making, measured data from\nthe structure of interest are required. Unfortunately, these data are seldom\navailable across the range of environmental and operational conditions\nnecessary to ensure good generalisation of the model.\n  Recently, technologies have been developed that overcome this challenge, by\nextending SHM to populations of structures, such that valuable knowledge may be\ntransferred between instances of structures that are sufficiently similar. This\nnew approach is termed population-based structural heath monitoring (PBSHM).\n  The current paper presents a formal representation of populations of\nstructures, such that risk-based decision processes may be specified within\nthem. The population-based representation is an extension to the hierarchical\nrepresentation of a structure used within the probabilistic risk-based decision\nframework to define fault trees. The result is a series, consisting of systems\nof systems ranging from the individual component level up to an inventory of\nheterogeneous populations. The current paper considers an inventory of wind\nfarms as a motivating example and highlights the inferences and decisions that\ncan be made within the hierarchical representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 15:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

The paradigm under which this revolution takes\nplace is prompt-based learning (or in-context learning). This paradigm has\nfound fruitful application in text-to-image generation where it is being used\nto synthesize digital images from zero-shot text prompts in natural language\nfor the purpose of creating AI art. This activity is referred to as prompt\nengineering - the practice of iteratively crafting prompts to generate and\nimprove images. In this paper, we investigate prompt engineering as a novel\ncreative skill for creating prompt-based art. In three studies with\nparticipants recruited from a crowdsourcing platform, we explore whether\nuntrained participants could 1) recognize the quality of prompts, 2) write\nprompts, and 3) improve their prompts. Our results indicate that participants\ncould assess the quality of prompts and respective images. This ability\nincreased with the participants' experience and interest in art. Participants\nfurther were able to write prompts in rich descriptive language. However, even\nthough participants were specifically instructed to generate artworks,\nparticipants' prompts were missing the specific vocabulary needed to apply a\ncertain style to the generated images. Our results suggest that prompt\nengineering is a learned skill that requires expertise and practice. Based on\nour findings and experience with running our studies with participants\nrecruited from a crowdsourcing platform, we provide ten recommendations for\nconducting experimental research on text-to-image generation and prompt\nengineering with a paid crowd. Our studies offer a deeper understanding of\nprompt engineering thereby opening up avenues for research on the future of\nprompt engineering. We conclude by speculating on four possible futures of\nprompt engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 14:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}
