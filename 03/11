In this paper, we propose a method of combining visibility\nanalysis and neural networks for enriching 3D models with window and door\nfeatures. In the method, occupancy voxels are fused with classified point\nclouds, which provides semantics to voxels. Voxels are also used to identify\nconflicts between laser observations and 3D models. The semantic voxels and\nconflicts are combined in a Bayesian network to classify and delineate\nfa\\c{c}ade openings, which are reconstructed using a 3D model library.\nUnaffected building semantics is preserved while the updated one is added,\nthereby upgrading the building model to LoD3. Moreover, Bayesian network\nresults are back-projected onto point clouds to improve points' classification\naccuracy.

If bettors can leverage data to accurately\npredict the probability of an outcome, they can recognise when the bookmaker's\nodds are in their favour. As sports betting is a multi-billion dollar industry\nin the USA alone, identifying such opportunities could be extremely lucrative.\nMany researchers have applied machine learning to the sports outcome prediction\nproblem, generally using accuracy to evaluate the performance of forecasting\nmodels. We hypothesise that for the sports betting problem, model calibration\nis more important than accuracy. To test this hypothesis, we train models on\nNBA data over several seasons and run betting experiments on a single season,\nusing published odds.

Our tactile sensing provides us with a lot of information regarding\ncontact formations as well as geometric information about objects during any\ninteraction. With this motivation, vision-based tactile sensors are being\nwidely used for various robotic perception and control tasks. In this paper, we\npresent a method for interactive perception using vision-based tactile sensors\nfor a part mating task, where a robot can use tactile sensors and a feedback\nmechanism using a particle filter to incrementally improve its estimate of\nobjects (pegs and holes) that fit together. To do this, we first train a deep\nneural network that makes use of tactile images to predict the probabilistic\ncorrespondence between arbitrarily shaped objects that fit together. The\ntrained model is used to design a particle filter which is used twofold. First,\ngiven one partial (or non-unique) observation of the hole, it incrementally\nimproves the estimate of the correct peg by sampling more tactile observations.\nSecond, it selects the next action for the robot to sample the next touch (and\nthus image) which results in maximum uncertainty reduction to minimize the\nnumber of interactions during the perception task. We evaluate our method on\nseveral part-mating tasks with novel objects using a robot equipped with a\nvision-based tactile sensor.

It appears that NSBHs with\nmass ratios $q \\simeq 0.2$ are more common than equally asymmetric BBHs, but\nthe reason for this remains unclear. In this work, we use the binary population\nsynthesis code COSMIC to investigate the evolutionary pathways leading to the\nformation of asymmetric compact binaries and the factors that cause them to\nmerge. We find that within the context of isolated binary stellar evolution,\nmost asymmetric binary mergers start off as asymmetric stellar binaries.\nBecause of the initial asymmetry, these systems tend to first undergo a\ndynamically unstable mass transfer phase. However, after the first star\ncollapses to a compact object, the mass ratio is close to unity and the second\nphase of mass transfer is usually stable. According to our simulations, this\nstable mass transfer fails to shrink the orbit enough on its own for the system\nto merge. Instead, we find that the natal kick received by the second-born\ncompact object during its stellar collapse plays a key role in determining how\nmany of these systems can merge. For the most asymmetric systems with mass\nratios $q \\leq 0.1$, the merging systems in our models receive an average kick\nmagnitude of 255 km s$^{-1}$ during the second collapse, while the average kick\nfor non-merging systems is 59 km s$^{-1}$. Because lower mass compact objects,\nlike NSs, are expected to receive larger natal kicks than higher mass BHs, this\nmay explain why asymmetric NSBH systems merge more frequently than asymmetric\nBBH systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 16:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

They are usually pretrained,\nfinetuned, and evaluated on the same data distribution, i.e., within an\nin-distribution setting. However, they tend to perform poorly in\nout-of-distribution evaluation scenarios, a challenge that Unsupervised Domain\nGeneralization (UDG) seeks to address.\n  This paper introduces a novel method to standardize the styles of images in a\nbatch. Batch styles standardization, relying on Fourier-based augmentations,\npromotes domain invariance in SSL by preventing spurious correlations from\nleaking into the features. The combination of batch styles standardization with\nthe well-known contrastive-based method SimCLR leads to a novel UDG method\nnamed CLaSSy ($\\textbf{C}$ontrastive $\\textbf{L}$e$\\textbf{a}$rning with\n$\\textbf{S}$tandardized $\\textbf{S}$t$\\textbf{y}$les). CLaSSy offers serious\nadvantages over prior methods, as it does not rely on domain labels and is\nscalable to handle a large number of domains. Experimental results on various\nUDG datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CLaSSy compared to\nexisting UDG methods. Finally, the versatility of the proposed batch styles\nstandardization is demonstrated by extending respectively the contrastive-based\nand non-contrastive-based SSL methods, SWaV and MSN, while considering\ndifferent backbone architectures (convolutional-based, transformers-based).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 17:09:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 10:05:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 10:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

However, it's difficult to identify\nwhen a partition is corrupted enough to block retraining. Blocking too often\nyields stale model snapshots in production; blocking too little yields broken\nmodel snapshots in production.\n  In this paper, we present an automatic data validation system for ML\npipelines implemented at Meta. We employ what we call a Partition Summarization\n(PS) approach to data validation: each timestamp-based partition of data is\nsummarized with data quality metrics, and summaries are compared to detect\ncorrupted partitions.

However, to maintain an ideal growing climate in\na greenhouse requires resources and operational costs. In order to achieve\neconomical and sustainable crop growth, efficient climate control of greenhouse\nproduction becomes essential. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is the most\ncommonly used approach in the scientific literature for greenhouse climate\ncontrol. However, with the developments of sensing and computing techniques,\nreinforcement learning (RL) is getting increasing attention recently. With each\ncontrol method having its own way to state the control problem, define control\ngoals, and seek for optimal control actions, MPC and RL are representatives of\nmodel-based and learning-based control approaches, respectively. Although\nresearchers have applied certain forms of MPC and RL to control the greenhouse\nclimate, very few effort has been allocated to analyze connections,\ndifferences, pros and cons between MPC and RL either from a mathematical or\nperformance perspective. Therefore, this paper will 1) propose MPC and RL\napproaches for greenhouse climate control in an unified framework; 2) analyze\nconnections and differences between MPC and RL from a mathematical perspective;\n3) compare performance of MPC and RL in a simulation study and afterwards\npresent and interpret comparative results into insights for the application of\nthe different control approaches in different scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 17:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

Model validation usually involves the comparison of\nexperimental data (outputs from the system of interest) and model predictions,\nboth obtained at a specific validation scenario. The design of this validation\nexperiment should be directly relevant to the objective of the model, that of\npredicting a quantity of interest at a prediction scenario. In this paper, we\naddress two specific issues arising when designing validation experiments. The\nfirst issue consists in determining an appropriate validation scenario in cases\nwhere the prediction scenario cannot be carried out in a controlled\nenvironment. The second issue concerns the selection of observations when the\nquantity of interest cannot be readily observed. The proposed methodology\ninvolves the computation of influence matrices that characterize the response\nsurface of given model functionals. Minimization of the distance between\ninfluence matrices allow one for selecting a validation experiment most\nrepresentative of the prediction scenario.

If one models a galaxy\nas an axisymmetric, stationary, rotating, non-relativistic and pressureless\n'dust' of stars in the gravitoelectromagnetic (GEM) formalism, we show that GEM\neffects on the circular velocity $v$ of a star are $O(10^{-6})$ smaller than\nthe standard Newtonian (gravitoelectric) effects. Moreover, we find that\ngravitomagnetic effects are $O(10^{-6})$ too small to provide the vertical\nsupport necessary to maintain the dynamical equilibrium assumed. These issues\nare obscured if one constructs a single equation for $v$, as considered\npreviously. We nevertheless solve this equation for a galaxy having a\nMiyamoto--Nagai density profile. We show that for the values of the mass, $M$,\nand semi-major and semi-minor axes, $a$ and $b$, typical for a dwarf galaxy,\nthe rotation curve depends only very weakly on $M$. Moreover, for aspect ratios\n$a/b > 2$, the rotation curves are concave over their entire range, which does\nnot match observations in any galaxy. Most importantly, we show that for the\npoloidal gravitomagnetic flux $\\psi$ to provide the necessary vertical support,\nit must become singular at the origin. This originates from the unwitting, but\nforbidden, inclusion of free-space solutions of the Poisson-like equation that\ndetermines $\\psi$, hence ruling out the methodology as a means of explaining\nflat galaxy rotation curves. We further show that recent deliberate attempts to\nleverage such free-space solutions against the rotation curve problem yield no\ndeterministic modification outside the thin disk approximation, and that, in\nany case, the homogeneous contributions to $\\psi$ are ruled out by the boundary\nvalue problem posed by any physical axisymmetric galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 18:04:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 20:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

Meanwhile,\nthe implementation of the mining strategy disrupts the difficulty distribution\nof samples in the real dataset, which may cause the model to over-fit these\ndifficult samples. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate how to trade off\nthe difficulty of the mined samples in order to obtain and exploit high-quality\nnegative samples, and try to solve the problem in terms of both the loss\nfunction and the training strategy. The proposed balance loss provides an\neffective discriminant for the quality of negative samples by combining a\nself-supervised approach to the loss function, and uses a dynamic gradient\nmodulation strategy to achieve finer gradient adjustment for samples of\ndifferent difficulties. The proposed annealing training strategy then\nconstrains the difficulty of the samples drawn from negative sample mining to\nprovide data sources with different difficulty distributions for the loss\nfunction, and uses samples of decreasing difficulty to train the model.\nExtensive experiments show that our new descriptors outperform previous\nstate-of-the-art descriptors for patch validation, matching, and retrieval\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 18:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

In this\npaper, we design an observer for soft robots based on the well-known Cosserat\nrod theory which models soft robots by nonlinear partial differential equations\n(PDEs). The observer is able to estimate all the\ncontinuous/infinite-dimensional robot states (poses, strains, and velocities)\nby only sensing the tip velocity of the robot (and hence it is called a\n``boundary'' observer).

Cloud-free atmospheric\nmodels also predict that their flux should not be polarized, as polarization is\nproduced by the light-scattering of particles in the inhomogeneous cloud layers\nof brown dwarf atmospheres. To shed light on this dichotomy, we monitored the\nlinear polarization and photometric variability of the most variable brown\ndwarf, 2MASS J21392676+0220226.

The nearby satellites (<100 kpc) have a bulk\nmotion with an amplitude of 140-230 km/s while the more distant ones show an\nisotropic distribution of the radial velocities.

If we exclude the\nLMC and its most closely related members from our sample, this does not\nsuppress the bulk motion of the nearby satellites strongly enough.\nNevertheless, we have demonstrated that the observed peculiar kinematics of the\nMW satellites can be explained by a perturbation caused by the first infall of\nthe LMC.

This motivates recent research that demonstrates\nthat the correlations between the morphological information present in the\nH&E-stained slides and the molecular information in the IHC-stained slides can\nbe used for H&E-to-IHC stain translation. However, due to a lack of\npixel-perfect H&E-IHC groundtruth pairs, most existing methods have resorted to\nrelying on expert annotations. To remedy this situation, we present a new loss\nfunction, Adaptive Supervised PatchNCE (ASP), to directly deal with the input\nto target inconsistencies in a proposed H&E-to-IHC image-to-image translation\nframework.

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a widespread transition to hybrid\nwork models (combinations of co-located and remote work) as software\nprofessionals' demanded more flexibility and improved work-life balance.\nHowever, hybrid work models reduce the spontaneous, informal face-to-face\ninteractions that promote group maturation, cohesion, and resilience. Little is\nknown about how software companies can successfully transition to a hybrid\nworkforce or the factors that influence the resilience of hybrid software\ndevelopment teams. Goal. The purpose of this study is to explore the\nrelationship between hybrid work and team resilience in the context of software\ndevelopment. Method. Constructivist Grounded Theory was used, based on\ninterviews of 26 software professionals. This sample included professionals of\ndifferent genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and levels of experience.\nInterviewees came from eight different companies, 22 different projects, and\nfour different countries. Consistent with grounded theory methodology, data\ncollection, and analysis were conducted iteratively, in waves, using\ntheoretical sampling, constant comparison, and initial, focused, and\ntheoretical coding.

The\nconfiguration of a hybrid team (who works where and when) can promote or hinder\ngroup maturity depending on the level of intra-group interaction it supports.\nConclusion. This paper presents the first study on the resilience of hybrid\nsoftware teams. Software teams need resilience to maintain their performance in\nthe face of disruptions and crises. Software professionals strongly value\nhybrid work; therefore, team resilience is a key factor to be considered in the\nsoftware industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 21:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

The VM is known to exhibit a transition between rigid\nand fluid-like, or floppy, states driven by geometric incompatibility. Target\nperimeter and area set a target shape which may not be geometrically\nachievable, thereby engendering frustration. Previously, an asymmetry in the\nlinear elastic response was identified at the rigidity transition between\ncompression and dilation. Here we show and characterize how the asymmetry\nextends away from the transition point for finite strains. Under finite\ncompression, an initially solid VM can totally relax perimeter tension, and\nthereby have reduced bulk and shear modulus. Conversely, an initially floppy VM\nunder dilation can rigidify and have a higher bulk and shear modulus. These\nobservations imply that re-scaling of cell area shifts the transition between\nrigid and floppy states.

We propose to use hyperbolic uncertainty to\ndetermine the algorithmic learning pace, under the assumption that less\nuncertain samples should be more strongly driving the training, with a larger\nweight and pace. Hyperbolic uncertainty is a by-product of the adopted\nhyperbolic neural networks, it matures during training and it comes with no\nextra cost, compared to the established Euclidean SSL framework counterparts.\nWhen tested on three established skeleton-based action recognition datasets,\nHYSP outperforms the state-of-the-art on PKU-MMD I, as well as on 2 out of 3\ndownstream tasks on NTU-60 and NTU-120. Additionally, HYSP only uses positive\npairs and bypasses therefore the complex and computationally-demanding mining\nprocedures required for the negatives in contrastive techniques.

We propose Zone-based Federated Learning (ZoneFL) to address\nthese requirements. ZoneFL divides the physical space into geographical zones\nmapped to a mobile-edge-cloud system architecture for good model accuracy and\nscalability. Each zone has a federated training model, called a zone model,\nwhich adapts well to data and behaviors of users in that zone.

ZMS optimizes zone models by adapting the zone geographical\npartitions through merging of neighboring zones or splitting of large zones\ninto smaller ones. Different from ZMS, ZGD maintains fixed zones and optimizes\na zone model by incorporating the gradients derived from neighboring zones'\ndata. ZGD uses a self-attention mechanism to dynamically control the impact of\none zone on its neighbors.

To\nreduce the human effort in evaluating outlier detection results and effectively\nturn the outliers into actionable insights, the users often expect a system to\nautomatically produce interpretable summarizations of subgroups of outlier\ndetection results. Unfortunately, to date no such systems exist. To fill this\ngap, we propose STAIR which learns a compact set of human understandable rules\nto summarize and explain the anomaly detection results. Rather than use the\nclassical decision tree algorithms to produce these rules, STAIR proposes a new\noptimization objective to produce a small number of rules with least\ncomplexity, hence strong interpretability, to accurately summarize the\ndetection results. The learning algorithm of STAIR produces a rule set by\niteratively splitting the large rules and is optimal in maximizing this\nobjective in each iteration. Moreover, to effectively handle high dimensional,\nhighly complex data sets which are hard to summarize with simple rules, we\npropose a localized STAIR approach, called L-STAIR. Taking data locality into\nconsideration, it simultaneously partitions data and learns a set of localized\nrules for each partition. Our experimental study on many outlier benchmark\ndatasets shows that STAIR significantly reduces the complexity of the rules\nrequired to summarize the outlier detection results, thus more amenable for\nhumans to understand and evaluate, compared to the decision tree methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2023 00:53:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 02:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

We aim to demonstrate that although the\nmodels have different inflationary phenomenology, the neutron star\nphenomenology predictions of the two models are quite similar. We solve\nnumerically the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in the Einstein frame\nusing a powerful double shooting numerical technique, and after deriving the\nmass-radius graphs for three types of polytropic equations of state, we derive\nthe Jordan frame mass and radii.

It is useful for the design of many applications\nincluding robotics and autonomous driving. Traditionally, autogregressive\nmodels have been used to predict human motion. However, these models have high\ncomputation needs and error accumulation that make it difficult to use them for\nrealtime applications. In this paper, we present a non-autogressive model for\nhuman motion prediction. We focus on learning spatio-temporal representations\nnon-autoregressively for generation of plausible future motions. We propose a\nnovel architecture that leverages the recently proposed Transformers. Human\nmotion involves complex spatio-temporal dynamics with joints affecting the\nposition and rotation of each other even though they are not connected\ndirectly.

In this paper, with theoretical and\nempirical studies, we show that quadratic networks enjoy parametric efficiency,\nthereby confirming that the superior performance of quadratic networks is due\nto the intrinsic expressive capability.

In complex distributed DNN training scenarios, manual hardcoding is\nthe only practical way for deadlock prevention, which poses significant\nchallenges to the development of artificial intelligence. This paper presents\nOCCL, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first deadlock-free\ncollective communication library for GPU supporting dynamic decentralized\npreemption and gang-scheduling for collectives.

In doing so, the main challenge is to strike a balance between\nexploitation, i.e., re-visiting previously-located targets, and exploration,\ni.e., finding new targets or re-acquiring lost ones. Encouraged by recent\nadvances in deep reinforcement learning, we introduce an attention-based neural\nsolution to the persistent monitoring problem, where the agent can learn the\ninter-dependencies between targets, i.e., their spatial and temporal\ncorrelations, conditioned on past measurements.

Coronary CT\nangiography (CCTA) is widely used for artery imaging and determining the\nstenosis degree. However, the limited spatial resolution and susceptibility to\nartifacts fail CCTA in obtaining lumen morphological characteristics and plaque\ncomposition. It can be settled by invasive optical coherence tomography (OCT)\nwithout much trouble for physicians, but bringing higher costs and potential\nrisks to patients. Therefore, it is clinically critical to introduce\nannotations of plaque tissue and lumen characteristics from OCT to paired CCTA\nscans, denoted as \\textbf{the O2CTA problem} in this paper. We propose a method\nto handle the O2CTA problem. CCTA scans are first reconstructed into\nmulti-planar reformatted (MPR) images, which agree with OCT images in term of\nsemantic contents. The artery segment in OCT, which is manually labelled, is\nthen spatially aligned with the entire artery in MPR images via the proposed\nalignment strategy. Finally, a classification model involving a 3D CNN and a\nTransformer, is learned to extract local features and capture dependence along\narteries. Experiments on 55 paired OCT and CCTA we curate demonstrate that it\nis feasible to classify the CCTA based on the OCT labels, with an accuracy of\n86.2%, while the manual readings of OCT and CCTA vary significantly, with a\nKappa coefficient of 0.113.

This paper aims to\npresent a generic method for ecological research that allows analysing\nspatio-temporal patterns of biological processes at large spatial scales by\nincluding the time-varying variables that drive these dynamics. Methods: We\nintroduce a method called relational event modelling (REM), which relies on\ntemporal interaction dynamics, that encode sequences of relational events\nconnecting a sender node to a recipient node at a specific point in time. We\napply REM to the spread of alien species around the globe between 1880 and\n2005, following accidental or deliberate introductions into geographical\nregions outside of their native range. In this context, a relational event\nrepresents the new occurrence of an alien species given its former\ndistribution. Results: The application of REM to the first reported invasions\nof 4835 established alien species outside of their native ranges from four\nmajor taxonomic groups enables us to unravel the main drivers of the dynamics\nof the spread of invasive alien species. Combining the alien species first\nrecords data with other spatio-temporal information enables us to discover\nwhich factors have been responsible for the spread of species across the globe.\nBesides the usual drivers of species invasions, such as trade, land use and\nclimatic conditions, we also find evidence for species-interconnectedness in\nalien species spread.

The rapid neutron capture process (or\nr-process) is known to synthesize about 50\\% of these heavy elements and the\nlong-lived actinides observed in our solar system and so-called metal-poor\nr-process-enhanced stars. This thesis aims to study the r-process\nnucleosynthesis and some of the uncertainties that still govern our\npredictions, namely, nuclear yields and heating rates. Our focus will be on the\nr-process in neutron star (NS) mergers, which is in the spotlight after recent\n``multi-messenger'' observations, including the combined detection of\ngravitational waves from a NS-NS merger event and its subsequent\nelectromagnetic counterpart. In this work, we base our nucleosynthesis\ncalculations on hydrodynamical simulations of NS merger systems, which estimate\nthe amount of ejected mass and its properties during ejection. Through our\nr-process calculations, we estimate the composition of this gravitationally\nunbound material, which can contribute to the r-process enrichment of the\nGalaxy. This work is divided into two studies, each addressing a remaining open\nquestion regarding the r-process nucleosynthesis. First, a coherent study of\nthe impact of neutrino interactions on the r-process element nucleosynthesis\nand the heating rate produced by the radioactive decay of nuclei synthesized in\nthe dynamical ejecta of NS-NS mergers is presented. We have studied the\nmaterial ejected from four NS-NS merger systems based on hydrodynamical\nsimulations...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2023 10:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

In studying brain signals such as\nelectroencephalograms (EEG), this may be explored via an information-theoretic\ncausal measure, called transfer entropy (TE), which does not impose any\ndistributional assumption on the variables and covers any form of relationship\n(beyond linear) between them. To improve utility of TE in brain signal\nanalysis, we propose a novel methodology to capture cross-channel information\ntransfer in the frequency domain. Specifically, we introduce a new causal\nmeasure, the spectral transfer entropy (STE), to quantify the magnitude and\ndirection of information flow from a certain frequency-band oscillation of a\nchannel to an oscillation of another channel. In contrast with previous works\non TE in the frequency domain, we differentiate our work by considering an\nextreme value perspective that employs the maximum magnitude of filtered series\nwithin time blocks. The main advantages of our proposed approach is that it is\nrobust to the inherent problems of linear filtering and allows adjustments for\nmultiple comparisons to control family-wise error rate (FWER).

Also, object awareness and foreground-to-background\ndiscrimination are neglected, making contrastive learning less effective. To\ntackle these issues, we propose a general foreground-aware feature contrast\n(FAC) framework to learn more effective point cloud representations in\npre-training. FAC consists of two novel contrast designs to construct more\neffective and informative contrast pairs. The first is building positive pairs\nwithin the same foreground segment where points tend to have the same\nsemantics. The second is that we prevent over-discrimination between 3D\nsegments/objects and encourage foreground-to-background distinctions at the\nsegment level with adaptive feature learning in a Siamese correspondence\nnetwork, which adaptively learns feature correlations within and across point\ncloud views effectively.

The data reveal a two-armed\nphase spiral pattern in the local $z-v_z$ plane inside the solar radius, which\nappears clearly when colour-coded by $\\langle v_R \\rangle (z,v_z)$: this is\ncharacteristic of a breathing mode that can in principle be produced by\nin-plane non-axisymmetric perturbations. We note that, on the contrary, the\nphase spiral pattern becomes single armed when outside the solar radius. When a\nrealistic analytic model with an axisymmetric background potential plus a\nrealistic steadily rotating central bar and 2-armed spiral arms as perturbation\nis used to perform particle test integrations, the pseudo stars get a prominent\nspiral pattern in the $\\langle v_R \\rangle$ map in the $x-y$ plane.\nAdditionally, clear breathing mode evidence at a few $\\rm{kms}^{-1}$ level can\nbe seen in the $\\langle v_z \\rangle$ map on the $x-z$ plane, confirming that\nsuch breathing modes are non-negligible in the joint presence of a bar and\nspiral arms. However, no phase-spiral is perceptible in the $(z, v_z)$ plane.\nWhen an initial vertical perturbation is added to all pseudo stars and the same\norbital integrating scheme is adopted to carry out the simulation, we find that\nphase spirals can clearly be seen 500~Myr after the perturbation and gradually\ndisappear inside-out; in that case, they are, however, one-armed. Finally, we\nshow as a proof of concept how a toy model of a time-varying non-axisymmetric\nin-plane perturbation with varying amplitude and pattern speed can, on the\nother hand, produce a strong two-armed phase-spiral.

In contrast to Shubnikov - de Haas oscillations, the\nkagom\\'e oscillations are robust against thermal smearing and they can be\ndetected even when the Hofstadter butterfly spectrum is undermined by\nelectron's scattering. We expect that kagom\\'e quantum oscillations are generic\nto rotationally-symmetric two-dimensional crystals close to Lifshitz\ntransitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2023 12:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 08:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

Predominant approaches learn the\ndiscrete representation either in a deterministic manner by selecting the\nbest-matching token or in a stochastic manner by sampling from a predicted\ndistribution. However, deterministic quantization suffers from severe codebook\ncollapse and misalignment with inference stage while stochastic quantization\nsuffers from low codebook utilization and perturbed reconstruction objective.\nThis paper presents a regularized vector quantization framework that allows to\nmitigate above issues effectively by applying regularization from two\nperspectives. The first is a prior distribution regularization which measures\nthe discrepancy between a prior token distribution and the predicted token\ndistribution to avoid codebook collapse and low codebook utilization. The\nsecond is a stochastic mask regularization that introduces stochasticity during\nquantization to strike a good balance between inference stage misalignment and\nunperturbed reconstruction objective. In addition, we design a probabilistic\ncontrastive loss which serves as a calibrated metric to further mitigate the\nperturbed reconstruction objective. Extensive experiments show that the\nproposed quantization framework outperforms prevailing vector quantization\nmethods consistently across different generative models including\nauto-regressive models and diffusion models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2023 15:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Adversarial training (AT for short) is a\nwidely used approach to enhance the robustness of DCNN models by data\naugmentation. In AT, the DCNN models are trained with clean examples and\nadversarial examples (AE for short) which are generated using a specific attack\nmethod, aiming to gain ability to defend themselves when facing the unseen AEs.\nHowever, in practice, the trained DCNN models are often fooled by the AEs\ngenerated by the novel attack methods. This naturally raises a question: can a\nDCNN model learn certain features which are insensitive to small perturbations,\nand further defend itself no matter what attack methods are presented. To\nanswer this question, this paper makes a beginning effort by proposing a\nshallow binary feature module (SBFM for short), which can be integrated into\nany popular backbone. The SBFM includes two types of layers, i.e., Sobel layer\nand threshold layer. In Sobel layer, there are four parallel feature maps which\nrepresent horizontal, vertical, and diagonal edge features, respectively. And\nin threshold layer, it turns the edge features learnt by Sobel layer to the\nbinary features, which then are feeded into the fully connected layers for\nclassification with the features learnt by the backbone. We integrate SBFM into\nVGG16 and ResNet34, respectively, and conduct experiments on multiple datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate, under FGSM attack with $\\epsilon=8/255$, the\nSBFM integrated models can achieve averagely 35\\% higher accuracy than the\noriginal ones, and in CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets, the SBFM integrated\nmodels can achieve averagely 75\\% classification accuracy.

There is a need of expanding the diameters of the arteries in order\nto facilitate the transport of medicaments. Recent research has pointed to\nvarious ways to improve this situation; in particular, the use ultrasound\nacting on microbubbles in the blood stream has turned out to be a promising\noption. Here, a different possibility of enlarging the diameters of arteries is\ndiscussed, namely to exploit the electrostrictive pressure produced by internal\nstrong, ultrashort and repetitive laser pulses. Each pulse will at first give\nrise to inward directed optical forces, and once the pulse terminates there\nwill be a hydrodynamical bouncing flow in the outward radial direction giving\nan outward impulse to the vessel wall. In the absence of friction a symmetric\noscillation picture emerges. Clearly, a supply of repetitive pulses will be\nneeded (at parametric resonance) to make the effect appreciable. The effect has\nto our knowledge not been discussed before. We give an approximate optical and\nhydrodynamical theory of it. The calculations indicate promising results for\nthe wall pressure, although experimental work is desirable to show whether the\nidea can be useful in practice.

Anomaly detection in\npower grids aims to detect and discriminate anomalies caused by cyber attacks\nagainst the power system, which is essential for keeping power grids working\ncorrectly and efficiently. Different methods have been applied for anomaly\ndetection, such as statistical methods and machine learning-based methods.\nUsually, machine learning-based methods need to model the normal data\ndistribution. In this work, we propose a novel anomaly detection method by\nmodeling the data distribution of normal samples via multiple encoders and\ndecoders. Specifically, the proposed method maps input samples into a latent\nspace and then reconstructs output samples from latent vectors. The extra\nencoder finally maps reconstructed samples to latent representations. During\nthe training phase, we optimize parameters by minimizing the reconstruction\nloss and encoding loss. Training samples are re-weighted to focus more on\nmissed correlations between features of normal data. Furthermore, we employ the\nlong short-term memory model as encoders and decoders to test its\neffectiveness. We also investigate a meta-learning-based framework for\nhyper-parameter tuning of our approach.

At long times the OTOC attains\nan average equilibrium value with possible oscillations. For fully chaotic\nsystems the approach to the asymptotic regime is exponential with a rate given\nby the classical Ruelle-Pollicott resonances.

Activity-induced structural vibrations,\nparticularly footstep-induced signals, are useful for analyzing the movement of\nbiological systems such as the human body and animals, providing valuable\ninformation regarding an individual's gait, body mass, and posture, making them\nan attractive tool for health monitoring, security, and human-computer\ninteraction.

The proposed model\nconsists of three stages: preprocessing, hybrid modeling, and ensemble. In the\npreprocessing stage, features are extracted using the Fast Fourier Transform\nand wavelet transform to capture the underlying physics-governed dynamics of\nthe system and extract spatial and temporal features. In the hybrid modeling\nstage, a bi-directional LSTM is used to denoise the noisy signal concatenated\nwith FFT results, and a CNN is used to obtain a condensed feature\nrepresentation of the signal.
