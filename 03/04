To\ncarry out this study, a treatment plan utilizing a single energy level and\nrequiring the use of a patient-specific range modulator was employed. The dose\nrate values were compared both locally and by means of dose rate volume\nhistograms (DRVHs).\n  Results: The PBS dose rate, the percentile dose rate, and the maximum\npercentile dose are definitions that are specifically designed to take into\naccount the time structure of the delivery of a PBS treatment plan. Although\nthey may appear similar, our study shows that they can vary locally by up to\n10%. On the other hand, the DADR values were approximately twice as high as\nthose of the PBS, percentile and maximum percentile dose rates, since the DADR\ndisregards the periods when a voxel does not receive any dose. Finally, the\naverage dose rate can be defined in various ways, as discussed in this paper.\nThe average dose rate is found to be lower by a factor of approximately 1/2\nthan the PBS, percentile and maximum percentile dose rates.\n  Conclusions: We have shown that using different definitions for the dose rate\nin FLASH proton therapy can lead to variations in calculated values ranging\nfrom a few percent to a factor of two. Since the dose rate is a critical\nparameter in FLASH radiation therapy, it is essential to carefully consider the\nchoice of definition. However, to make an informed decision, additional\nbiological data and models are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 16:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

In a stochastic context, the well-known deterministic\nresult that ventilation driven by the competing effects of buoyancy and wind\nadmits multiple steady states can be misleading, due to two distinct phenomena.\nFirst, with unbounded fluctuations in the buoyancy exchanged with an external\nenvironment, such systems eventually reside in the vicinity of global minima of\ntheir potential, rather than local minima associated with meta-stable\nequilibria. In the particular context of one heated space with a leeward\nlow-level and windward high-level opening, sustained buoyancy-driven flow\nopposing the wind direction is unlikely for wind strengths that exceed a\nstatistically critical value, which is slightly larger than the critical value\nof the wind strength at which bifurcation in the deterministic system occurs.\nSecond, fluctuations in the applied wind modify the topology of the system's\npotential due to the nonlinear role that wind strength has in the equation for\nbuoyancy conservation. Sufficiently large fluctuations in the wind rule out the\npossibility of ventilation opposing the wind direction at large base wind\nstrengths. Although the phenomena described above might be perceived as making\nprediction easier, the results also highlight that certainty in the eventual\nstate of the system goes hand in hand with uncertainty associated with longer\ntransient effects.

Our proposed mechanism\nutilises and builds upon the recent stable diffusion model by proposing\nimage-based conditioning for paired data generation.

We present a systematic benchmarking setup and perform a\nrigorous comparison of different coreset selection methods on CNNs and\ntransformers. Our investigation reveals that under certain circumstances,\nrandom selection of subsets is more robust and stable when compared with the\nSOTA selection methods. We demonstrate that the conventional concept of uniform\nsubset sampling across the various classes of the data is not the appropriate\nchoice. Rather samples should be adaptively chosen based on the complexity of\nthe data distribution for each class.

We further show that\nwhen no pretraining is done or when the pretrained transformer models are used\nwith non-natural images (e.g. medical data), CNNs tend to generalize better\nthan transformers at even very small coreset sizes. Lastly, we demonstrate that\nin the absence of the right pretraining, CNNs are better at learning the\nsemantic coherence between spatially distant objects within an image, and these\ntend to outperform transformers at almost all choices of the coreset size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 17:24:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 08:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

Specifically, we introduce a method to consistently attack both the\nsensors measurements and camera images over time, in order to cause control\nperformance degradation (e.g., by failing the mission) while remaining stealthy\n(i.e., undetected by the deployed anomaly detector).

However, this task becomes more challenging in poor lighting\nconditions or when dealing with textureless objects. To address this issue,\ndepth images are becoming an increasingly popular choice due to their\ninvariance to a scene's appearance and the implicit incorporation of essential\ngeometric characteristics. However, fully leveraging depth information to\nimprove the performance of pose estimation remains a difficult and\nunder-investigated problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel\nframework called SwinDePose, that uses only geometric information from depth\nimages to achieve accurate 6D pose estimation. SwinDePose first calculates the\nangles between each normal vector defined in a depth image and the three\ncoordinate axes in the camera coordinate system. The resulting angles are then\nformed into an image, which is encoded using Swin Transformer. Additionally, we\napply RandLA-Net to learn the representations from point clouds. The resulting\nimage and point clouds embeddings are concatenated and fed into a semantic\nsegmentation module and a 3D keypoints localization module. Finally, we\nestimate 6D poses using a least-square fitting approach based on the target\nobject's predicted semantic mask and 3D keypoints. In experiments on the\nLineMod and Occlusion LineMod datasets, SwinDePose outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods for 6D object pose estimation using depth images. This\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and highlights its potential for\nimproving performance in real-world scenarios.

To address this limitation, we propose a planning\nalgorithm that maintains multiple data association hypotheses, represented as a\nbelief mixture, where each component corresponds to a different data\nassociation hypothesis. However, this method can lead to an exponential growth\nin the number of hypotheses, resulting in significant computational overhead.\nTo overcome this challenge, we introduce a pruning-based approach for planning\nwith ambiguous data associations.

Then, we generate synthetic images via DALL-E\nto expand the few-shot training data without any manpower. At last, we\nintroduce a learnable cache model to adaptively blend the predictions from CLIP\nand DINO. By such collaboration, CaFo can fully unleash the potential of\ndifferent pre-training methods and unify them to perform state-of-the-art for\nfew-shot classification.

Unlike the unconditional\ngenerative models that focus on low-level attributes and details, text-to-image\ndiffusion models contain more high-level knowledge thanks to the\nvision-language pre-training. In this paper, we propose VPD (Visual Perception\nwith a pre-trained Diffusion model), a new framework that exploits the semantic\ninformation of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model in visual perception\ntasks. Instead of using the pre-trained denoising autoencoder in a\ndiffusion-based pipeline, we simply use it as a backbone and aim to study how\nto take full advantage of the learned knowledge. Specifically, we prompt the\ndenoising decoder with proper textual inputs and refine the text features with\nan adapter, leading to a better alignment to the pre-trained stage and making\nthe visual contents interact with the text prompts. We also propose to utilize\nthe cross-attention maps between the visual features and the text features to\nprovide explicit guidance.

Central to QHiFFS is the\nconcept of a kick operator which transforms the system into a basis where the\ndynamics is governed by a time-independent effective Hamiltonian.

In TPSCI, a large\norbital active space is first partitioned into disjoint sets (clusters) for\nwhich the exact local many-body eigenstates are obtained. Tensor products of\nthese locally correlated many-body states are taken as the basis for the full,\nglobal Hilbert space. By folding correlation into the basis states themselves,\nthe low-energy eigenstates become increasingly sparse, creating a more compact\nselected CI expansion. While we demonstrated that this approach can improve\naccuracy for a variety of systems, there is even greater potential for\napplications to excited states, particularly those which have some excitonic\ncharacter. In this paper, we report on the accuracy of TPSCI for excited\nstates, including a far more efficient implementation in the Julia programming\nlanguage. In traditional SCI methods that use a Slater determinant basis,\naccurate excitation energies are obtained only after a linear extrapolation and\nat a large computational cost. We find that TPSCI with perturbative corrections\nprovides accurate excitation energies for several excited states of various\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) with respect to the extrapolated result\n(i.e. near exact result). Further, we use TPSCI to report highly accurate\nestimates of the lowest 31 eigenstates for a tetracene tetramer system with an\nactive space of 40 electrons in 40 orbitals, giving direct access to the\ninitial bright states and the resulting 18 biexcitonic states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 21:48:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 21:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

This paper\naddresses low-latency hardware architectures for long polynomial modular\nmultiplication using the number-theoretic transform (NTT) and inverse NTT\n(iNTT). Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) is used to decompose the modulus into\nmultiple smaller moduli. Our proposed architecture, namely PaReNTT, makes four\nnovel contributions. First, parallel NTT and iNTT architectures are proposed to\nreduce the number of clock cycles to process the polynomials. This can enable\nreal-time processing for HE applications, as the number of clock cycles to\nprocess the polynomial is inversely proportional to the level of parallelism.\nSecond, the proposed architecture eliminates the need for permuting the NTT\noutputs before their product is input to the iNTT. This reduces latency by n/4\nclock cycles, where n is the length of the polynomial, and reduces buffer\nrequirement by one delay-switch-delay circuit of size n. Third, an approach to\nselect special moduli is presented where the moduli can be expressed in terms\nof a few signed power-of-two terms. Fourth, novel architectures for\npre-processing for computing residual polynomials using the CRT and\npost-processing for combining the residual polynomials are proposed. These\narchitectures significantly reduce the area consumption of the pre-processing\nand post-processing steps. The proposed long modular polynomial multiplications\nare ideal for applications that require low latency and high sample rate as\nthese feed-forward architectures can be pipelined at arbitrary levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 22:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Such attacks occur when Trojan models\nbehave normally for standard inputs but generate malicious output for inputs\nthat contain a specific trigger. Syntactic-structure triggers, which are\ninvisible, are becoming more popular for Trojan attacks because they are\ndifficult to detect and defend against. However, these types of attacks require\na large corpus of training data to generate poisoned samples with the necessary\nsyntactic structures for Trojan insertion. Obtaining such data can be difficult\nfor attackers, and the process of generating syntactic poisoned triggers and\ninserting Trojans can be time-consuming.

Several approaches have been\nproposed to potentially prevent an asteroid impact with Earth by deflecting or\ndisrupting an asteroid. A test of kinetic impact technology was identified as\nthe highest priority space mission related to asteroid mitigation. NASA's\nDouble Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is the first full-scale test of\nkinetic impact technology. The mission's target asteroid was Dimorphos, the\nsecondary member of the S-type binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos. This\nbinary asteroid system was chosen to enable ground-based telescopes to quantify\nthe asteroid deflection caused by DART's impact. While past missions have\nutilized impactors to investigate the properties of small bodies those earlier\nmissions were not intended to deflect their targets and did not achieve\nmeasurable deflections. Here we report the DART spacecraft's autonomous kinetic\nimpact into Dimorphos and reconstruct the impact event, including the timeline\nleading to impact, the location and nature of the DART impact site, and the\nsize and shape of Dimorphos. The successful impact of the DART spacecraft with\nDimorphos and the resulting change in Dimorphos's orbit demonstrates that\nkinetic impactor technology is a viable technique to potentially defend Earth\nif necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 22:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Accounting for and\nleveraging this influence has mostly been studied in settings where it is\nsufficient to assume that human behavior is near-optimal: competitive games, or\ngeneral-sum settings like autonomous driving alongside human drivers. Instead,\nwe focus on influence in settings where there is a need to capture human\nsuboptimality. For instance, imagine a collaborative task in which, due either\nto cognitive biases or lack of information, people do not perform very well --\nhow could an agent influence them towards more optimal behavior? Assuming\nnear-optimal human behavior will not work here, and so the agent needs to learn\nfrom real human data. But experimenting online with humans is potentially\nunsafe, and creating a high-fidelity simulator of the environment is often\nimpractical.

The training data is severely heterogeneous as various devices have\ndifferent amount of data and sensor noise level.

The proposed\ntrajectory optimization approach is aware of both the devices data\ncharacteristics (i.e., local dataset size and noise level) and their wireless\nchannel conditions, and significantly improves the convergence rate and final\naccuracy in comparison with baselines that only consider data characteristics\nor channel conditions.

Task-specialized approaches for training\nregression networks have shown significant improvement over generic approaches,\nsuch as direct regression. More recently, a generic approach based on\nregression by binary classification using binary-encoded labels has shown\nsignificant improvement over direct regression. The space of label encodings\nfor regression is large. Lacking heretofore have been automated approaches to\nfind a good label encoding for a given application. This paper introduces\nRegularized Label Encoding Learning (RLEL) for end-to-end training of an entire\nnetwork and its label encoding. RLEL provides a generic approach for tackling\nregression. Underlying RLEL is our observation that the search space of label\nencodings can be constrained and efficiently explored by using a continuous\nsearch space of real-valued label encodings combined with a regularization\nfunction designed to encourage encodings with certain properties. These\nproperties balance the probability of classification error in individual bits\nagainst error correction capability. Label encodings found by RLEL result in\nlower or comparable errors to manually designed label encodings. Applying RLEL\nresults in 10.9% and 12.4% improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over direct\nregression and multiclass classification, respectively. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that RLEL can be combined with off-the-shelf feature extractors\nand is suitable across different architectures, datasets, and tasks.

The single-hop interruption probability is derived and extended\nto the multi-hop interruption probability using a stochastic geometry-based\napproach. Since the interruption probability in HSTRN highly depends on the\npriority of selecting communication devices at different tiers, we propose\nthree priority strategies: (i) stationary optimal priority strategy, (ii)\nsingle-hop interruption probability inspired strategy, and (iii) density\ninspired strategy. Among them, the interruption probability under the\nstationary optimal priority strategy can approach the ideal lower bound.\nHowever, when analyzing an HSTRN with a large number of tiers, the stationary\noptimal priority strategy is computationally expensive.

This paper proposes a fast yet effective backbone, termed\nVirConvNet, based on a new operator VirConv (Virtual Sparse Convolution), for\nvirtual-point-based 3D object detection. VirConv consists of two key designs:\n(1) StVD (Stochastic Voxel Discard) and (2) NRConv (Noise-Resistant Submanifold\nConvolution). StVD alleviates the computation problem by discarding large\namounts of nearby redundant voxels. NRConv tackles the noise problem by\nencoding voxel features in both 2D image and 3D LiDAR space.

Yet, recent works\nhave found that the optimality of the originally-proposed IRM optimization\n(IRM) may be compromised in practice or could be impossible to achieve in some\nscenarios. Therefore, a series of advanced IRM algorithms have been developed\nthat show practical improvement over IRM. In this work, we revisit these recent\nIRM advancements, and identify and resolve three practical limitations in IRM\ntraining and evaluation. First, we find that the effect of batch size during\ntraining has been chronically overlooked in previous studies, leaving room for\nfurther improvement. We propose small-batch training and highlight the\nimprovements over a set of large-batch optimization techniques. Second, we find\nthat improper selection of evaluation environments could give a false sense of\ninvariance for IRM. To alleviate this effect, we leverage diversified test-time\nenvironments to precisely characterize the invariance of IRM when applied in\npractice. Third, we revisit (Ahuja et al. (2020))'s proposal to convert IRM\ninto an ensemble game and identify a limitation when a single invariant\npredictor is desired instead of an ensemble of individual predictors. We\npropose a new IRM variant to address this limitation based on a novel viewpoint\nof ensemble IRM games as consensus-constrained bi-level optimization. Lastly,\nwe conduct extensive experiments (covering 7 existing IRM variants and 7\ndatasets) to justify the practical significance of revisiting IRM training and\nevaluation in a principled manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 07:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

It often performs in a weakly supervised\nmanner, where only video event labels are provided, i.e., the modalities and\nthe timestamps of the labels are unknown. Due to the lack of densely annotated\nlabels, recent work attempts to leverage pseudo labels to enrich the\nsupervision. A commonly used strategy is to generate pseudo labels by\ncategorizing the known event labels for each modality. However, the labels are\nstill limited to the video level, and the temporal boundaries of event\ntimestamps remain unlabeled. In this paper, we propose a new pseudo label\ngeneration strategy that can explicitly assign labels to each video segment by\nutilizing prior knowledge learned from the open world. Specifically, we exploit\nthe CLIP model to estimate the events in each video segment based on visual\nmodality to generate segment-level pseudo labels. A new loss function is\nproposed to regularize these labels by taking into account their\ncategory-richness and segmentrichness. A label denoising strategy is adopted to\nimprove the pseudo labels by flipping them whenever high forward binary cross\nentropy loss occurs. We perform extensive experiments on the LLP dataset and\ndemonstrate that our method can generate high-quality segment-level pseudo\nlabels with the help of our newly proposed loss and the label denoising\nstrategy.

We have studied the hydrogen-storage capability on a\nrecently synthesized Biphenylene (BPh) decorated with Sc using the\nfirst-principles density functional theory (DFT) and ab-initio molecular\ndynamics (AIMD) techniques. Scandium attaches BPh sheet strongly with binding\nenergy -3.84 eV, and single Sc decorated on BPh can absorb a maximum of five\nH$_2$ molecules resulting in a high gravimetric weight percentage of 11.07,\nwhich is significantly higher than DoE's ultimate criteria (6.5 wt%). Using\nvan't Hoff equation, strongly and weakly attached hydrogens correspond to\ndesorption temperatures of 200 K and 397 K with an average of 305 K. The high\nbinding of Sc to BPh is due to charge donation of 3d orbital of Sc to 2p\norbital of C. The interactions between absorbed H$_2$ and BPh+Sc are due to\ncharge transfer from 3d-orbital of Sc to ${\\sigma}$* bond of H$_2$ molecules\nand backdonation from ${\\sigma}$ bond of H$_2$ to empty 3d-orbital of Sc known\nas Kubas type interaction. Furthermore, phonon and AIMD simulation confirm\nBPh+Sc stability, and the presence of an energy barrier shows no probability of\nSc-Sc clustering on BPh.

By examining 135M publicly\navailable Venmo transactions from 22.1M unique users, we found significant\nspikes in the use of COVID-19 related keywords in March 2020. Using\nFacebook-based geotags for 9K users along with transaction geo-parsing (i.e.,\nparsing text to detect place names), we identified 38K location-based clusters.\nWithin these groups, we found a strong correlation (0.81) between the use of\nCOVID-19 keywords in a region and the number of reported COVID-19 cases as well\nas an aggregate decrease in transactions during lockdowns and an increase when\nlockdowns are lifted. Surprisingly, we saw a weak negative correlation between\nthe number of transactions and reported cases over time (-0.49).

Do such correlations help or hinder catalysis, and does the\nclassicality or quantumness of such correlations matter? To answer this\nquestion, we first focus on the existence of a non-invasively measurable\nobservable that yields the same outcomes for repeated measurements, since this\nsignifies macro-realism, a key property distinguishing classical systems from\nquantum systems. We show that a system quantumly correlated with an external\nsystem so that the joint state is necessarily perturbed by any repeatable\nquantum measurement, also has the same property against general quantum\nchannels.

In this paper, we conduct the first study to\naddress the problem of UGC audio and video quality assessment (AVQA).\nSpecifically, we construct the first UGC AVQA database named the SJTU-UAV\ndatabase, which includes 520 in-the-wild UGC audio and video (A/V) sequences,\nand conduct a user study to obtain the mean opinion scores of the A/V\nsequences. The content of the SJTU-UAV database is then analyzed from both the\naudio and video aspects to show the database characteristics. We also design a\nfamily of AVQA models, which fuse the popular VQA methods and audio features\nvia support vector regressor (SVR). We validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed models on the three databases. The experimental results show that with\nthe help of audio signals, the VQA models can evaluate the perceptual quality\nmore accurately.

However, the lack of explicit features in sequence data\nmakes it difficult for machine learning models. While Neural Network (NN)\nmodels address this with learning features automatically, they are limited to\ncapturing adjacent structural connections and ignore global, higher-order\ninformation between the sequences. To address these challenges in the sequence\nclassification problems, we propose a novel Hypergraph Attention Network model,\nnamely Seq-HyGAN. To capture the complex structural similarity between sequence\ndata, we first create a hypergraph where the sequences are depicted as\nhyperedges and subsequences extracted from sequences are depicted as nodes.\nAdditionally, we introduce an attention-based Hypergraph Neural Network model\nthat utilizes a two-level attention mechanism. This model generates a sequence\nrepresentation as a hyperedge while simultaneously learning the crucial\nsubsequences for each sequence. We conduct extensive experiments on four data\nsets to assess and compare our model with several state-of-the-art methods.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed Seq-HyGAN model can\neffectively classify sequence data and significantly outperform the baselines.\nWe also conduct case studies to investigate the contribution of each module in\nSeq-HyGAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 11:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2023 22:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

In order to avoid particle degeneration, the filter step is not\nperformed at once. Instead, the particles progressively flow from prior to\nposterior.

In each sub-step, optimal resampling is done by a map that replaces\nnon-equally weighted particles with equally weighted ones. Inversions of the\nmaps or monotonicity constraints are not required, greatly simplifying the\nprocedure. The parameters of the mapping network are optimized w.r.t.\\ to a\nparticle set distance. This distance is differentiable, and compares\nnon-equally and equally weighted particles. Composition of the map sequence\nprovides a final mapping from prior to posterior particles. Radial basis\nfunction neural networks are used as maps. It is important that no intermediate\ncontinuous density representation is required. The entire flow works directly\nwith particle representations.

There are numerous methods for this vital\nmodel-building stage, ranging from domain-specific manual tuning guidelines\nsuggested by the oracles to the utilization of general-purpose black-box\noptimization techniques. This paper proposes an agent-based collaborative\ntechnique for finding near-optimal values for any arbitrary set of\nhyper-parameters (or decision variables) in a machine learning model (or\ngeneral function optimization problem). The developed method forms a\nhierarchical agent-based architecture for the distribution of the searching\noperations at different dimensions and employs a cooperative searching\nprocedure based on an adaptive width-based random sampling technique to locate\nthe optima. The behavior of the presented model, specifically against the\nchanges in its design parameters, is investigated in both machine learning and\nglobal function optimization applications, and its performance is compared with\nthat of two randomized tuning strategies that are commonly used in practice.\nAccording to the empirical results, the proposed model outperformed the\ncompared methods in the experimented classification, regression, and\nmulti-dimensional function optimization tasks, notably in a higher number of\ndimensions and in the presence of limited on-device computational resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 21:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

Existing literature generally focuses on a single control approach,\nwhile few studies have explored the effectiveness of integrated and coordinated\ncontrol approaches. This study considers two representative control approaches:\nramp metering for freeways and perimeter control for homogeneous urban roads,\nand we aim to develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based coordinated\ncontrol framework for large-scale networks. The main challenges are 1) there is\na lack of efficient dynamic models for both freeways and urban roads; 2) the\nstandard DRL method becomes ineffective due to the complex and non-stationary\nnetwork dynamics. In view of this, we propose a novel meso-macro dynamic\nnetwork model and first time develop a demonstration-guided DRL method to\nachieve large-scale coordinated ramp metering and perimeter control. The\ndynamic network model hybridizes the link and generalized bathtub models to\ndepict the traffic dynamics of freeways and urban roads, respectively. For the\nDRL method, we incorporate demonstration to guide the DRL method for better\nconvergence by introducing the concept of \"teacher\" and \"student\" models. The\nteacher models are traditional controllers (e.g., ALINEA, Gating), which\nprovide control demonstrations. The student models are DRL methods, which learn\nfrom the teacher and aim to surpass the teacher's performance. To validate the\nproposed framework, we conduct two case studies in a small-scale network and a\nreal-world large-scale traffic network in Hong Kong. The research outcome\nreveals the great potential of combining traditional controllers with DRL for\ncoordinated control in large-scale networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2023 11:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

Guided\nby the available theoretical formulations in the field, we introduce a\nsystematic numerical approach based on a novel set of holistic performance\nmetrics to answer both objectives. In the first objective, we explore in detail\nthe convergence of the PINN training error and the global error against the\nnetwork size and the training sample size. We demonstrate a consistent\nconverging behavior of the two error types for any investigated combination of\nnetwork complexity, dataset size and choice of hyperparameters, which\nempirically proves the conformance of the PINN setup and implementation to the\navailable convergence theories.
