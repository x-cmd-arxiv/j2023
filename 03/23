We resort to mock catalogs of standard siren (SS) events to see\nwhether data from future gravitational wave (GWs) observatories will be able to\ndistinguish these models from $\\Lambda$CDM.\n  The first model is the most general $f(Q)$ formulation that replicates a\n$\\Lambda$CDM background, with deviations appearing only at the perturbative\nlevel. It has one additional free parameter compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, $\\alpha$,\nwhich when set to zero falls back to $\\Lambda$CDM. We show that LIGO-Virgo is\nunable to constrain $\\alpha$, due to the high error and low redshift of the\nmeasurements, whereas LISA and the ET will, with the ET outperforming LISA. The\ncatalogs for both LISA and LIGO-Virgo show non-negligible statistical\nfluctuations, where we consider three representative catalogs (the best, median\nand worst), whereas for the ET, only a single catalog is considered, as the\nnumber of events is large enough for statistical fluctuations to be neglected.\nThe best LISA catalog is the one with more low redshift events, while the worst\nLISA catalog features fewer low redshift events. Additionally, if we are to\nobserve a bad LISA catalog, we can rely on data from LIGO-Virgo to improve the\nquality of the constrains, bringing it closer to a median LISA catalog.\n  The second model attempts to replace dark energy by making use of a specific\nform of the function $f(Q)$. We study this model resorting to dynamical system\ntechniques to show the regions in parameter space with viable cosmologies.\nUsing model selection criteria, we show that no number of SS events is, by\nitself, able to tell this model and $\\Lambda$CDM apart. We then show that if we\nadd current type Ia Supernova (SnIa) data, tensions in this model arise when\ncompared to the constrains set by the SS events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 16:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

In such\ncharacterizations, a connectivity network is typically measured at each time\npoint for a subject over a common set of nodes representing brain regions,\ntogether with rich subject-level information. A common approach to analyzing\nsuch data is an edge-based method that models the connectivity between each\npair of nodes separately. However, such approach may have limited performance\nwhen the noise level is high and the number of subjects is limited, as it does\nnot take advantage of the inherent network structure. To better understand if\nand how the subject-level covariates affect the dynamic brain connectivity, we\nintroduce a semi-parametric dynamic network response regression that relates a\ndynamic brain connectivity network to a vector of subject-level covariates.

ADO dynamically\nidentifies stimuli that, in expectation, yield the most information about a\nhypothetical construct of interest (e.g., parameters of a cognitive model). To\ncalculate this expectation, ADO leverages the modeler's existing knowledge,\nspecified in the form of a prior distribution. Informative priors align with\nthe distribution of the focal construct in the participant population. This\nalignment is assumed by ADO's internal assessment of expected information gain.\nIf the prior is instead misinformative, i.e., does not align with the\nparticipant population, ADO's estimates of expected information gain could be\ninaccurate. In many cases, the true distribution that characterizes the\nparticipant population is unknown, and experimenters rely on heuristics in\ntheir choice of prior and without an understanding of how this choice affects\nADO's behavior.\n  Our work introduces a mathematical framework that facilitates investigation\nof the consequences of the choice of prior distribution on the efficiency of\nexperiments designed using ADO.

There are many,\nmany innovative things happening. To name a few, promising new approaches to\nEnhanced Geothermal Systems, geothermal projects in sedimentary and lower\nenthalpy formations, new approaches for geothermal exploration, lithium\nextraction from produced brines, geothermal energy storage, integrations with\nCO2 storage and capture, and new technologies for producing energy from hot\nwater that is coproduced with oil and gas. However, this post is about a\nconcept about which I remain skeptical, deep closed-loop heat exchangers. These\ndesigns are sometimes called Advanced Geothermal Systems, AGS. To clarify, this\nblog post discusses the use of closed-loop heat exchangers in deep geothermal\nwells, 1000s of ft deep. This is a different application than the use of\nclosed-loop heat exchangers in very shallow wells, 10s of ft deep, for ground\nsource heat pumps. The fundamental challenge is that closed-loop heat exchanger\ndesigns rely on conduction, and sometimes free convection, to bring energy into\nthe well. These processes are inherently much slower than forced convection,\nwhich is what drives energy transport into a conventional geothermal well.\nSlower energy transport means less revenue, and therefore, worse economics. In\nthe past few years, there have been many creative new ideas for using\nclosed-loop heat exchangers for geothermal energy production.

While effective from\na computational standpoint, these methods lead to models that grow quickly with\nthe number of tasks. A new NE method, dense network expansion (DNE), is\nproposed to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and model complexity.\nThis is accomplished by the introduction of dense connections between the\nintermediate layers of the task expert networks, that enable the transfer of\nknowledge from old to new tasks via feature sharing and reusing. This sharing\nis implemented with a cross-task attention mechanism, based on a new task\nattention block (TAB), that fuses information across tasks. Unlike traditional\nattention mechanisms, TAB operates at the level of the feature mixing and is\ndecoupled with spatial attentions. This is shown more effective than a joint\nspatial-and-task attention for CIL. The proposed DNE approach can strictly\nmaintain the feature space of old classes while growing the network and feature\nscale at a much slower rate than previous methods.

This raises the question of whether such correlations are\nof a classical or quantum nature, namely, whether they are accessible through\nlocal measurements on the correlated degrees of freedom. We address this\nproblem by considering fermionic and bosonic Gaussian systems. We show that for\nfermions the entropy production is mostly quantum due to the parity\nsuperselection rule which restricts the set of physically allowed measurements\nto projections on the Fock states, thus significantly limiting the amount of\nclassically accessible correlations. In contrast, in bosonic systems a much\nlarger amount of correlations can be accessed through Gaussian measurements.\nSpecifically, while the quantum contribution may be important at low\ntemperatures, in the high temperature limit the entropy production corresponds\nto purely classical position-momentum correlations. Our results demonstrate an\nimportant difference between fermionic and bosonic systems regarding the\nexistence of a quantum-to-classical transition in the microscopic formulation\nof the entropy production. They also show that entropy production can be mainly\ncaused by quantum correlations even in the weak coupling limit, which admits a\ndescription in terms of classical rate equations for state populations, as well\nas in the low particle density limit, where the transport properties of both\nbosons and fermions converge to those of classical particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 17:05:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 15:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 10:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

In this setting, coarse labels are much\neasier to acquire as they do not require expert knowledge. In this work, we\npropose a contrastive learning method, called $\\textbf{Mask}$ed\n$\\textbf{Con}$trastive learning~($\\textbf{MaskCon}$) to address the\nunder-explored problem setting, where we learn with a coarse-labelled dataset\nin order to address a finer labelling problem. More specifically, within the\ncontrastive learning framework, for each sample our method generates\nsoft-labels with the aid of coarse labels against other samples and another\naugmented view of the sample in question. By contrast to self-supervised\ncontrastive learning where only the sample's augmentations are considered hard\npositives, and in supervised contrastive learning where only samples with the\nsame coarse labels are considered hard positives, we propose soft labels based\non sample distances, that are masked by the coarse labels.

As both sparse\nand dense queries are problematic, then what are the expected queries in\nend-to-end object detection? This paper shows that the solution should be Dense\nDistinct Queries (DDQ).

Yet, learning the entire correspondences from scratch\nis highly challenging, particularly for ambiguous pose solutions, where the\nglobally optimal pose is theoretically non-differentiable w.r.t. the points.

However, this approach suffers from background noise accumulation and\nloss of density due to the use of broad Gaussian kernels to create the ground\ntruth density maps. This issue can be overcome by narrowing the Gaussian\nkernel. However, existing approaches perform poorly when trained with such\nground truth density maps. To overcome this limitation, we propose using\nconditional diffusion models to predict density maps, as diffusion models are\nknown to model complex distributions well and show high fidelity to training\ndata during crowd-density map generation. Furthermore, as the intermediate time\nsteps of the diffusion process are noisy, we incorporate a regression branch\nfor direct crowd estimation only during training to improve the feature\nlearning. In addition, owing to the stochastic nature of the diffusion model,\nwe introduce producing multiple density maps to improve the counting\nperformance contrary to the existing crowd counting pipelines. Further, we also\ndiffer from the density summation and introduce contour detection followed by\nsummation as the counting operation, which is more immune to background noise.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on public datasets to validate the\neffectiveness of our method.

Considering\nthis character, we formulate sign language retrieval as a cross-lingual\nretrieval problem as well as a video-text retrieval task. Concretely, we take\ninto account the linguistic properties of both sign languages and natural\nlanguages, and simultaneously identify the fine-grained cross-lingual (i.e.,\nsign-to-word) mappings while contrasting the texts and the sign videos in a\njoint embedding space.

While recent studies suggest that low-mass\nNSCs in dwarf galaxies form largely out of the merger of globular clusters and\nNSCs in massive galaxies have assembled most of their mass through central star\nformation, the formation channel of the Milky Way's NSC is still uncertain. In\nthis work, we use GigaEris, a very high resolution $N$-body hydrodynamical\ncosmological ``zoom-in'' simulation, to investigate NSC formation in the\nprogenitor of a Milky Way-sized galaxy, as well as its relation to the assembly\nand evolution of the galactic nuclear region. We study the possibility that\nbound, young, gas-rich, stellar clusters within a radius of 1.5~kpc of the main\ngalaxy's centre at $z>4$ are the NSC predecessors (NSCPs). We identify 53\nsystems which satisfy our criteria, with a total baryonic mass of\n$10^{7.7}$~M$_{\\odot}$. They have a relatively low mean stellar metallicity\n($-0.47 \\lesssim {\\rm [Fe/H]} \\lesssim -0.11$) in comparison to the present-day\nstars in the Milky Way's NSC. The NSCPs with a `born thin-disc' star fraction,\n$F_{\\rm thin}$, higher than 0.5 are older and display slightly different\nproperties than the clusters with $F_{\\rm thin} \\leq 0.5$. We demonstrate that\nboth stellar cluster accretion and in-situ star formation will contribute to\nthe formation of the NSC, providing evidence for an hybrid formation scenario\nfor the first time in an $N$-body, hydrodynamical, cosmological ``zoom-in''\nsimulation. Furthermore, we also identify a nuclear stellar ring in the\nsimulation, with properties similar to those of the Milky Way's nuclear stellar\ndisc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

The morphology of galaxies will therefore change with z. For\ninstance, an early spiral galaxy observed in the V band would show a prominent\nbulge at z=0, whereas, if at z=1, the V filter probes the rest-frame near-UV\nwhere the bulge is faint and the disk relatively brighter, thus the galaxy may\nappear as bulgeless. For galaxies with strong nebular emission, an additional\neffect is that the shifting of strong nebular features in or out of filters\nwill result in a non-monotonous color evolution with z. Hence, unlike the\neffects of distance, cosmological surface brightness dimming, and gravitational\nlensing, which are all achromatic, the fact that most galaxies have a spatially\nvarying SED leads to a chromatic surface brightness modulation (CMOD) with z.\nWhile the CMOD effects are in principle easy to grasp, they affect the\ncharacterization of galaxies in a complex fashion. Properties such as the\nbulge-to-disk ratio, Sersic exponent, effective radius, radial color gradients,\nand stellar mass determinations from SED fitting will depend on z, the filters\nemployed, and the rest-frame 2D SED patterns in a galaxy, and will bias results\ninferred on galaxy evolution across cosmic time (e.g., the evolution of the\nmass-size, bulge-SMBH, and Tully-Fisher relation), if these effects are not\nproperly taken into account. In this article we quantify the CMOD effects for\nidealized galaxies built from spectral synthesis models and from galaxies with\nobserved integral field spectroscopy, and we show that they are significant and\nshould be taken into account in studies of resolved galaxy properties and their\nevolution with z.

Searches for\nthe light scalars are performed in many ongoing experiments and planned for the\nnext generation projects. Applying dispersion relations changes the leading\norder estimate of the scalar decay rate into pions by a factor of about a\nhundred indicating the strong final state interaction.

In this paper, we perform\nhigh-resolution re-simulations of a massive (M_star~10^11 M_sol) galaxy at\nz~2.3, drawn from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. In the\nsimulation without AGN feedback, the galaxy experiences a rapid starburst and\nshrinking of its half-mass radius. We experiment with driving mechanical AGN\nwinds, using a state-of-the-art hyper-Lagrangian refinement technique to\nincrease particle resolution. These winds reduce the gas surface density in the\ninner regions of the galaxy, suppressing the compact starburst and maintaining\nan approximately constant half-mass radius. Using radiative transfer, we study\nthe impact of AGN feedback on the magnitude and extent of the multi-wavelength\ncontinuum emission. When AGN winds are included, the suppression of the\ncompact, dusty starburst results in lowered flux at FIR wavelengths (due to\ndecreased star formation) but increased flux at optical-to-near-IR wavelengths\n(due to decreased dust attenuation, in spite of the lowered star formation\nrate), relative to the case without AGN winds. The FIR half-light radius\ndecreases from ~1 kpc to ~0.1 kpc in <40 Myr when AGN winds are not included,\nbut increases to ~2 kpc when they are.

In this work, we consider quantum\nnetworks composed of photonic channels characterized by a trade-off between the\nentanglement generation rate and fidelity. For such networks we look at the two\nfollowing problems: the one of finding the best path to connect any two given\nnodes in the network bipartite entanglement routing, and the problem of finding\nthe best starting node in order to connect three nodes in the network\nmultipartite entanglement routing. We consider two entanglement distribution\nmodels: one where entangled qubit are distributed one at a time, and a flow\nmodel where a large number of entangled qubits are distributed simultaneously.\nWe propose the use of continuous fidelity curves (i.e., entanglement generation\nfidelity vs rate) as the main routing metric.

The resulting normal modes (polaritons) in the bulk material become\nhyperbolic over a broad frequency range, which is furthermore tunable by the\ndoping level. The propagation, reflection, and polarization properties of the\nhyperbolic polaritons not only provide valuable information about the\nelectronic structure of these fascinating materials in the most interesting\nregion near the nodal rings but also pave the way to tunable hyperbolic\nmaterials with applications ranging from anomalous refraction and waveguiding\nto perfect absorption in ultrathin subwavelength films.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 20:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

They can be\ndefined through the non-analytic behavior of thermodynamic potentials in the\nthermodynamic limit. This limit is obtained when the number of available\nconfigurations of the system approaches infinity, which is conventionally\nassociated to spatially-extended systems formed by an infinite number of\ndegrees of freedom (infinite number of particles or modes). Taking previous\nideas to the extreme, we argue that such a limit can be defined even in\nnon-extended systems, providing a specific example in the simplest form of a\nsingle-mode bosonic Hamiltonian. In contrast to previous non-extended models,\nthe simplicity of our model allows us to find approximate analytical\nexpressions that can be confronted with precise numerical simulations in all\nthe parameter space, particularly as close to the thermodynamic limit as we\nwant. We are thus able to show that the system undergoes a change displaying\nall the characteristics of a second-order phase transition as a function of a\ncontrol parameter. We derive critical exponents and scaling laws revealing the\nuniversality class of the model, which coincide with that of more elaborate\nnon-extended models such as the quantum Rabi or Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models.\nAnalyzing our model, we are also able to offer insights into the features of\nthis type of phase transitions, by showing that the thermodynamic and classical\nlimits coincide. In other words, quantum fluctuations must be tamed in order\nfor the system to undergo a true phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 20:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

Most of these systems\nare likely formed via standard stellar evolution pathways. However, it has long\nbeen thought that a fraction of GRBs may instead be an outcome of dynamical\ninteractions in dense environments, channels which could also contribute\nsignificantly to the samples of compact object mergers detected as\ngravitational wave sources. Here we report the case of GRB 191019A, a long GRB\n(T_90 = 64.4 +/- 4.5 s) which we pinpoint close (<100 pc projected) to the\nnucleus of an ancient (>1~Gyr old) host galaxy at z=0.248. The lack of evidence\nfor star formation and deep limits on any supernova emission make a massive\nstar origin difficult to reconcile with observations, while the timescales of\nthe emission rule out a direct interaction with the supermassive black hole in\nthe nucleus of the galaxy, We suggest that the most likely route for progenitor\nformation is via dynamical interactions in the dense nucleus of the host,\nconsistent with the centres of such galaxies exhibiting interaction rates up to\ntwo orders of magnitude larger than typical field galaxies. The burst\nproperties could naturally be explained via compact object mergers involving\nwhite dwarfs (WD), neutron stars (NS) or black holes (BH). These may form\ndynamically in dense stellar clusters, or originate in a gaseous disc around\nthe supermassive black hole. Future electromagnetic and gravitational-wave\nobservations in tandem thus offer a route to probe the dynamical fraction and\nthe details of dynamical interactions in galactic nuclei and other high density\nstellar systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 21:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

The results revealed that small\nnano-clusters are formed in highly excited rotational-vibrational states, and\nthe relaxation of internal energy and growth of these nascent clusters are\nconcurrent processes with a strong mutual influence. Under non-equilibrium\ngrowth conditions, the relaxation of internal energy can delay the cluster\ngrowth process.

A\n\"cross-context\" setting is enabled using test sets that are distinct from the\ntraining data. Specifically, in the news classification task, the models are\ndeveloped on local news from India and tested on the local news from China. In\nthe sentiment analysis task, the models are trained on movie reviews and tested\non customer reviews. This comparison is aimed at exploring the limits of the\nrepresentative power of today's Natural Language Processing systems on the path\nto the systems that are generalizable to real-life scenarios. The models are\nfine-tuned and fed into a Feed-Forward Neural Network and a Bidirectional Long\nShort Term Memory network. Multinomial Naive Bayes and Linear Support Vector\nMachine are used as traditional baselines. The results show that, in binary\ntext classification, DistilBERT is significantly better than ELMo on\ngeneralizing to the cross-context setting. ELMo is observed to be significantly\nmore robust to the cross-context test data than both baselines. On the other\nhand, the baselines performed comparably well to ELMo when the training and\ntest data are subsets of the same corpus (no cross-context).

Drones have been increasingly\nused since Hurricane Katrina (2005) for disaster response, however getting the\ndata from the drone to the appropriate decision makers throughout incident\ncommand in a timely fashion has been problematic. These delays have persisted\neven as countries such as the USA have made significant investments in wireless\ninfrastructure, rapidly deployable nodes, and an increase in commercial\nsatellite solutions. Hurricane Ian serves as a case study of the mismatch\nbetween communications needs and capabilities. In the first four days of the\nresponse, nine drone teams flew 34 missions under the direction of the State of\nFlorida FL-UAS1, generating 636GB of data. The teams had access to six\ndifferent wireless communications networks but had to resort to physically\ntransferring data to the nearest intact emergency operations center in order to\nmake the data available to the relevant agencies. The analysis of the mismatch\ncontributes a model of the drone data-to-decision workflow in a disaster and\nquantifies wireless network communication requirements throughout the workflow\nin five factors. Four of the factors-availability, bandwidth, burstiness, and\nspatial distribution-were previously identified from analyses of Hurricanes\nHarvey (2017) and Michael (2018). This work adds upload rate as a fifth\nattribute. The analysis is expected to improve drone design and edge computing\nschemes as well as inform wireless communication research and development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 22:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

The interatomic\npotential, including the atomic electronegativities and the charge-independent\nshort-range part of the potential and force terms, are modeled by the linear\natomic cluster expansion (ACE), which provides a computationally efficient\nalternative to many machine learning methods. The shadow molecular dynamics\nscheme is based on extended Lagrangian (XL) Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics\n(BOMD) [Eur. Phys. J. B 94, 164 (2021)]. XL-BOMD provides a stable dynamics,\nwhile avoiding the costly computational overhead associated with solving an\nall-to-all system of equations, which normally is required to determine the\nrelaxed electronic ground state prior to each force evaluation.

The National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) air quality forecasting guidance\nis challenged by the increasing presence of extreme air quality events due to\nextreme weather events such as wild fires and heatwaves. These extreme air\nquality events further affect human health. Traditional methods used to correct\nmodel bias make assumptions about linearity and the underlying distribution.\nExtreme air quality events tend to occur without a strong signal leading up to\nthe event and this behavior tends to cause existing methods to either under or\nover compensate for the bias. Deep learning holds promise for air quality\nforecasting in the presence of extreme air quality events due to its ability to\ngeneralize and learn nonlinear problems. However, in the presence of these\nanomalous air quality events, standard deep network approaches that use a\nsingle network for generalizing to future forecasts, may not always provide the\nbest performance even with a full feature-set including geography and\nmeteorology. In this work we describe a method that combines unsupervised\nlearning and a forecast-aware bi-directional LSTM network to perform bias\ncorrection for operational air quality forecasting using AirNow station data\nfor ozone and PM2.5 in the continental US. Using an unsupervised clustering\nmethod trained on station geographical features such as latitude and longitude,\nurbanization, and elevation, the learned clusters direct training by\npartitioning the training data for the LSTM networks. LSTMs are forecast-aware\nand implemented using a unique way to perform learning forward and backwards in\ntime across forecasting days. When comparing the RMSE of the forecast model to\nthe RMSE of the bias corrected model, the bias corrected model shows\nsignificant improvement (27\\% lower RMSE for ozone) over the base forecast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 00:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

However, their response depends on the classK\nfunction that is used to restrict the rate of change of the barrier function\nalong the system trajectories. This paper introduces the notion of Rate Tunable\nControl Barrier Function (RT-CBF), which allows for online tuning of the\nresponse of CBF-based controllers. In contrast to the existing CBF approaches\nthat use a fixed (predefined) classK function to ensure safety, we parameterize\nand adapt the classK function parameters online. Furthermore, we discuss the\nchallenges associated with multiple barrier constraints, namely ensuring that\nthey admit a common control input that satisfies them simultaneously for all\ntime. In practice, RT-CBF enables designing parameter dynamics for (1) a\nbetter-performing response, where performance is defined in terms of the cost\naccumulated over a time horizon, or (2) a less conservative response.

The ever-increasing availability of\ndata and rapid advancement in deep learning (DL) have opened new avenues to\ntackle these challenges through data-enabled modeling. The seamless integration\nof DL and classic numerical techniques through the differentiable programming\nframework can significantly improve data-driven modeling performance.

Recently, FL has been interpreted\nwithin a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework, which brings FL\nsignificant advantages in fast adaptation and convergence over heterogeneous\ndatasets. However, existing research simply combines MAML and FL without\nexplicitly addressing how much benefit MAML brings to FL and how to maximize\nsuch benefit over mobile edge networks. In this paper, we quantify the benefit\nfrom two aspects: optimizing FL hyperparameters (i.e., sampled data size and\nthe number of communication rounds) and resource allocation (i.e., transmit\npower) in mobile edge networks. Specifically, we formulate the MAML-based FL\ndesign as an overall learning time minimization problem, under the constraints\nof model accuracy and energy consumption. Facilitated by the convergence\nanalysis of MAML-based FL, we decompose the formulated problem and then solve\nit using analytical solutions and the coordinate descent method. With the\nobtained FL hyperparameters and resource allocation, we design a MAML-based FL\nalgorithm, called Automated Federated Learning (AutoFL), that is able to\nconduct fast adaptation and convergence. Extensive experimental results verify\nthat AutoFL outperforms other benchmark algorithms regarding the learning time\nand convergence performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 02:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

We\ndecompose the KD loss and find the non-target loss from it forces the student's\nnon-target logits to match the teacher's, but the sum of the two non-target\nlogits is different, preventing them from being identical.

Rather than relying on a carefully\ndesigned test set to assess ML models' failures, fairness, or robustness, this\npaper proposes Semantic Image Attack (SIA), a method based on the adversarial\nattack that provides semantic adversarial images to allow model diagnosis,\ninterpretability, and robustness. Traditional adversarial training is a popular\nmethodology for robustifying ML models against attacks. However, existing\nadversarial methods do not combine the two aspects that enable the\ninterpretation and analysis of the model's flaws: semantic traceability and\nperceptual quality. SIA combines the two features via iterative gradient ascent\non a predefined semantic attribute space and the image space.

(1) Model diagnosis: SIA generates a histogram of attributes\nthat highlights the semantic vulnerability of the ML model (i.e., attributes\nthat make the model fail). (2) Stronger attacks: SIA generates adversarial\nexamples with visually interpretable attributes that lead to higher attack\nsuccess rates than baseline methods. The adversarial training on SIA improves\nthe transferable robustness across different gradient-based attacks.

This research proposes using Augmented Reality (AR) applications to\nprovide humans with sensor feedback and control of actuators and robots. This\nmethod improves cognition by allowing the operator to maintain awareness of\nstructures while adjusting conditions accordingly with the assistance of the\nnew real-time interface. One interface application is developed to plot sensor\ndata in addition to voltage, frequency, and duration controls for vibration\ngeneration. Two more applications are developed under similar framework, one to\ncontrol the position of a mediating robot and one to control the frequency of\nthe robot movement. This paper presents the proposed model for the new control\nloop and then compares the new approach with a traditional method by measuring\ntime delay in control input and user efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 03:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

In this\npaper, we propose an online Mono3D framework, called MonoATT, which leverages a\nnovel vision transformer with heterogeneous tokens of varying shapes and sizes\nto facilitate mobile Mono3D. The core idea of MonoATT is to adaptively assign\nfiner tokens to areas of more significance before utilizing a transformer to\nenhance Mono3D. To this end, we first use prior knowledge to design a scoring\nnetwork for selecting the most important areas of the image, and then propose a\ntoken clustering and merging network with an attention mechanism to gradually\nmerge tokens around the selected areas in multiple stages. Finally, a\npixel-level feature map is reconstructed from heterogeneous tokens before\nemploying a SOTA Mono3D detector as the underlying detection core.

Deep learning has emerged as\nan alternate modeling tool that can learn the mapping between the linear input\nof an N-body simulation and the final nonlinear displacements at redshift zero,\nwhich can significantly accelerate the forward modeling. However, this does not\nhelp reduce the search space for initial conditions. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate for the first time that a deep learning model can be trained for\nthe reverse mapping.

We\nintroduce a grid of self-consistent line-force parameters for a set of standard\nevolutionary tracks.

This decrease impacts strongly on\nthe tracks of the most massive models. Weaker winds allow the star to retain\nmore mass, but also more angular momentum. As a consequence, weaker wind models\nrotate faster and show a less efficient mixing in their inner stellar\nstructure.\n  The new tracks predict an evolution of the rotational velocities through the\nMS in close agreement with the range of $\\varv\\sin i$ values found by recent\nsurveys of Galactic O-type stars.

Though great progress has\nbeen achieved, such an LR-HR pair generation scheme has several limitations.\nFirst, the perceptual quality of HR images may not be high enough, limiting the\nquality of Real-ISR outputs. Second, existing schemes do not consider much\nhuman perception in GT generation, and the trained models tend to produce\nover-smoothed results or unpleasant artifacts. With the above considerations,\nwe propose a human guided GT generation scheme.

ANN-SNN conversion is an efficient way to achieve\ndeep SNNs by converting well-trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).\nHowever, the existing methods commonly use constant threshold for conversion,\nwhich prevents neurons from rapidly delivering spikes to deeper layers and\ncauses high time delay. In addition, the same response for different inputs may\nresult in information loss during the information transmission. Inspired by the\nbiological model mechanism, we propose a multi-stage adaptive threshold (MSAT).\nSpecifically, for each neuron, the dynamic threshold varies with firing history\nand input properties and is positively correlated with the average membrane\npotential and negatively correlated with the rate of depolarization. The\nself-adaptation to membrane potential and input allows a timely adjustment of\nthe threshold to fire spike faster and transmit more information. Moreover, we\nanalyze the Spikes of Inactivated Neurons error which is pervasive in early\ntime steps and propose spike confidence accordingly as a measurement of\nconfidence about the neurons that correctly deliver spikes.

We focus on the mass of the scalar field\nin the range of $10^{-13}-10^{-11}~{\\rm eV}$ for which the signal falls within\nthe detectors' sensitivity band. We first formulate the cross-correlation\nstatistics that can be readily compared with publically available data. It is\nfound that inclusion of the anisotropies of the velocity distribution of dark\nmatter caused by the motion of the solar system in the Milky Way Galaxy\nenhances the signal by a factor of $\\sim 2$ except for the narrow mass range\naround $\\simeq 3\\times 10^{-13}~{\\rm eV}$ for which the correlation between the\ninterferometer at Livingston and the one at Hanford is suppressed. From the\nnon-detection of the signal, we derive the upper limits on the coupling\nconstants between the elementary particles and the scalar field for five\nrepresentative cases. For all the cases where the weak equivalence principle is\nnot satisfied, tests of the violation of the weak equivalence principle provide\nthe tightest upper limit on the coupling constants. Upper limits from the\nfifth-force experiment are always stronger than the ones from LIGO, but the\ndifference is less than a factor of $\\sim 5$ at large-mass range. Our study\ndemonstrates that gravitational-wave experiments are starting to bring us\nmeaningful information about the nature of dark matter. The formulation\nprovided in this paper may be applied to the data of upcoming experiments as\nwell and is expected to probe much wider parameter range of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 08:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

We\nrevisit the definition of stability for SGD and use the \\textit{convergence in\nprobability} condition to define the \\textit{probabilistic stability} of SGD.\nThe proposed stability directly answers a fundamental question in deep learning\ntheory: how SGD selects a meaningful solution for a neural network from an\nenormous number of solutions that may overfit badly. To achieve this, we show\nthat only under the lens of probabilistic stability does SGD exhibit rich and\npractically relevant phases of learning, such as the phases of the complete\nloss of stability, incorrect learning, convergence to low-rank saddles, and\ncorrect learning. When applied to a neural network, these phase diagrams imply\nthat SGD prefers low-rank saddles when the underlying gradient is noisy,\nthereby improving the learning performance. This result is in sharp contrast to\nthe conventional wisdom that SGD prefers flatter minima to sharp ones, which we\nfind insufficient to explain the experimental data. We also prove that the\nprobabilistic stability of SGD can be quantified by the Lyapunov exponents of\nthe SGD dynamics, which can easily be measured in practice.

Recent studies on\nnon-Hermitian physics have revealed many unconventional effects. However, in\nall cases, the non-Hermiticity such as material loss is only considered for the\nHamiltonian, even when studying scattering properties. Another important\ncomponent-the scattering channel, is always assumed to be lossless and\ntime-reversal symmetric. This assumption hinders the exploration on the more\ngeneral and fundamental properties of non-Hermitian scattering. Here, we\nidentify a novel kind of scattering channel that obeys time-reversal\nanti-symmetry. Such diffusive scattering channels overturn the conventional\nunderstanding about scattering symmetry by linking the positive and negative\nfrequencies. By probing non-Hermitian systems with the diffusive channels, we\nreveal a hidden anti-parity-time (APT) scattering symmetry, which is distinct\nfrom the APT symmetry of Hamiltonians studied before.

In the current UGKWP method, the\ncell's Knudsen number, defined as the ratio of collision time to numerical time\nstep, is used to distribute the components in the wave-particle decomposition.\nHowever, the adaptation of particle in UGKWP is mainly for the capturing of the\nnon-equilibrium transport, and the cell's Knudsen number alone is not enough to\nidentify the non-equilibrium state. For example, in the equilibrium flow regime\nwith a Maxwellian distribution function, even at a large cell's Knudsen number,\nthe flow evolution can be still modelled by the Navier-Stokes solver.\nTherefore, to further improve the efficiency, an adaptive UGKWP (AUGKWP) method\nwill be developed with the introduction of an additional local flow variable\ngradient-dependent Knudsen number. As a result, the wave-particle decomposition\nin UGKWP will be determined by both cell's and gradient's Knudsen numbers, and\nthe particle in UGKWP is solely used to capture the non-equilibrium flow\ntransport.

Based on the\nmagnitudes of such disorder levels, semiconductors are commonly grouped into\nthe low- or high-radiation tolerant. Nevertheless, upon exposing to\nsufficiently high fluences, in all cases known by far, it ends up with either\nextremely high disorder levels or amorphization. Here we show that gamma/beta\ndouble polymorph Ga2O3 structures exhibit unprecedently high radiation\ntolerance. Specifically, for room temperature experiments, they tolerate a\ndisorder equivalent to hundreds of displacements per atom, without severe\ndegradations of crystallinity; in comparison with, e.g., Si amorphizable\nalready with the lattice atoms displaced just once. We explain this behavior by\nan interesting combination of the Ga- and O-sublattice properties in\ngamma-Ga2O3. In particular, O-sublattice exhibits a strong recrystallization\ntrend to recover the face-centered-cubic stacking despite high mobility of O\natoms in collision cascades compared to Ga. Concurrently, the characteristic\nstructure of the Ga-sublattice is nearly insensitive to the accumulated\ndisorder. Jointly it explains macroscopically negligible structural\ndeformations in gamma-Ga2O3 observed in experiment. Notably, we also explained\nthe origin of the beta-to-gamma Ga2O3 transformation, as a function of\nincreased disorder in beta-Ga2O3 and studied the phenomena as a function of the\nchemical nature of the implanted atoms. As a result, we conclude that\ngamma-beta double polymorph Ga2O3 structures, in terms of their radiation\ntolerance properties, benchmark a new class of universal radiation tolerant\nsemiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 09:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

Whereas methods were proposed to generate\nnatural and realistic human motions, most only focus on modeling humans and\nlargely ignore object movements. Generating task-oriented human-object\ninteraction motions in simulation is challenging. For different intents of\nusing the objects, humans conduct various motions, which requires the human\nfirst to approach the objects and then make them move consistently with the\nhuman instead of staying still. Also, to deploy in downstream applications, the\nsynthesized motions are desired to be flexible in length, providing options to\npersonalize the predicted motions for various purposes. To this end, we propose\nTOHO: Task-Oriented Human-Object Interactions Generation with Implicit Neural\nRepresentations, which generates full human-object interaction motions to\nconduct specific tasks, given only the task type, the object, and a starting\nhuman status. TOHO generates human-object motions in three steps: 1) it first\nestimates the keyframe poses of conducting a task given the task type and\nobject information; 2) then, it infills the keyframes and generates continuous\nmotions; 3) finally, it applies a compact closed-form object motion estimation\nto generate the object motion. Our method generates continuous motions that are\nparameterized only by the temporal coordinate, which allows for upsampling or\ndownsampling of the sequence to arbitrary frames and adjusting the motion\nspeeds by designing the temporal coordinate vector. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

As a countermeasure, various\ndetection approaches have been proposed and achieved promising performance.\nHowever, most existing detectors struggle to maintain performance on unseen\nface swapping methods and low-quality images. Apart from the generalization\nproblem, current detection approaches have been shown vulnerable to evasion\nattacks crafted by detection-aware manipulators. Lack of robustness under\nadversary scenarios leaves threats for applying face swapping detection in real\nworld. In this paper, we propose a novel face swapping detection approach based\non face identification probability distributions, coined as IdP_FSD, to improve\nthe generalization and robustness. IdP_FSD is specially designed for detecting\nswapped faces whose identities belong to a finite set, which is meaningful in\nreal-world applications. Compared with previous general detection methods, we\nmake use of the available real faces with concerned identities and require no\nfake samples for training. IdP_FSD exploits face swapping's common nature that\nthe identity of swapped face combines that of two faces involved in swapping.\nWe reflect this nature with the confusion of a face identification model and\nmeasure the confusion with the maximum value of the output probability\ndistribution. What's more, to defend our detector under adversary scenarios, an\nattention-based finetuning scheme is proposed for the face identification\nmodels used in IdP_FSD. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IdP_FSD\nnot only achieves high detection performance on different benchmark datasets\nand image qualities but also raises the bar for manipulators to evade the\ndetection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 09:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

Existing horizontal FL methods generally assume that\nthe FL server and clients hold the same model structure. However, due to system\nheterogeneity and the need for personalization, enabling clients to hold models\nwith diverse structures has become an important direction. Existing\nmodel-heterogeneous FL approaches often require publicly available datasets and\nincur high communication and/or computational costs, which limit their\nperformances. To address these limitations, we propose the Federated Global\nprediction Header (FedGH) approach.

Importantly, unlike the generally\nmore structured transition region and chromosphere, the diffuse corona appears\nto be rather featureless. The magnetic nature of the diffuse corona, and in\nparticular, its footpoints in the lower atmosphere, are not well understood. We\nstudy the origin of the diffuse corona above the quiet-Sun network on\nsupergranular scales. We identified regions of diffuse EUV emission in the\ncoronal images from the SDO/AIA. To investigate their connection to the lower\natmosphere, we combined these SDO/AIA data with the transition region\nspectroscopic data from the IRIS and with the underlying surface magnetic field\ninformation from the SDO/HMI. The region of the diffuse emission is of\nsupergranular size and persists for more than five hours, during which it shows\nno obvious substructure. It is associated with plasma at about 1 MK that is\nlocated within and above a magnetic canopy. The canopy is formed by unipolar\nmagnetic footpoints that show highly structured spicule-like emission in the\noverlying transition region. Our results suggest that the diffuse EUV emission\npatch forms at the base of long-ranging loops, and it overlies spicular\nstructures in the transition region. Heated material might be supplied to it by\nmeans of spicular upflows, conduction-driven upflows from coronal heating\nevents, or perhaps by flows originating from the farther footpoint. Therefore,\nthe question remains open how the diffuse EUV patch might be sustained.\nNevertheless, our study indicates that heated plasma trapped by long-ranging\nmagnetic loops might substantially contribute to the featureless ambient\ncoronal emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 10:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

Yet, some\nOSs, in particular recently emerged high-mobility organic molecular crystals,\nfeature reduced mobility at increasing temperature, a hallmark for delocalized\nband transport. Here we present the temperature-dependent mobility in two\nrecord-mobility OSs: DNTT (dinaphtho[2,3-b:2',3'-f]thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene),\nand its alkylated derivative, C8-DNTT-C8. By combining terahertz\nphotoconductivity measurements with fully atomistic non-adiabatic molecular\ndynamics simulations, we show that while both crystals display a power-law\ndecrease of the mobility (\\mu) with temperature (T, following: \\mu \\propto\nT^(-n)), the exponent n differs substantially. Modelling provides n values in\ngood agreement with experiments and reveals that the differences in the falloff\nparameter between the two chemically closely related semiconductors can be\ntraced to the delocalization of the different states thermally accessible by\ncharge carriers, which in turn depends on the specific electronic band\nstructure of the two systems. The emerging picture is that of holes surfing on\na dynamic manifold of vibrationally-dressed extended states with a\ntemperature-dependent mobility that provides a sensitive fingerprint for the\nunderlying density of states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 10:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

We present early results from the\nhigh-mass star formation region IRAS23385+6053. Methods: The JOYS program uses\nthe MIRI MRS with its IFU to investigate a sample of high- and low-mass\nstar-forming protostellar systems. Results: The 5 to 28mum MIRI spectrum of\nIRAS23385+6053 shows a plethora of features. While the general spectrum is\ntypical for an embedded protostar, we see many atomic and molecular gas lines\nboosted by the higher spectral resolution and sensitivity compared to previous\nspace missions. Furthermore, ice and dust absorption features are also present.\nHere, we focus on the continuum emission, outflow tracers like the H2, [FeII]\nand [NeII] lines as well as the potential accretion tracer Humphreys alpha\nHI(7--6). The short-wavelength MIRI data resolve two continuum sources A and B,\nwhere mid-infrared source A is associated with the main mm continuum peak. The\ncombination of mid-infrared and mm data reveals a young cluster in its making.\nCombining the mid-infrared outflow tracer H2, [FeII] and [NeII] with mm SiO\ndata shows a complex interplay of at least three molecular outflows driven by\nprotostars in the forming cluster. Furthermore, the Humphreys alpha line is\ndetected at a 3-4sigma level towards the mid-infrared sources A and B.\nFollowing Rigliaco et al.

In this setting, GNNs can now directly learn both\ntemporal and spatial dependencies, jointly, while also alleviating the need for\nadditional temporal networks.

During this stage, the stars accrete mass and\nangular momentum and may experience accretion enhanced-magnetised winds. At the\nsame time, the accretion of mass and energy has a significant impact on the\nevolution of stellar structure and moment of inertia. We compute evolution\nmodels of accreting very young stars and determine, in a self-consistent way,\nthe effect of accretion on stellar structure and the angular momentum exchanges\nbetween the stars and their disc. We then vary the deuterium content, the\naccretion history, the entropy content of the accreted material, and the\nmagnetic field as well as the efficiency of the accretion-enhanced winds. It\ncomes that the models are driven alternatively both by the evolution of the\nmomentum of inertia, and by the star-disc interaction torques. Of all the\nparameters we tested, the magnetic field strength, the accretion history and\nthe Deuterium content have the largest impact. The injection of heat only plays\na major role early in the evolution. This work demonstrates the importance of\nthe moment of inertia's evolution under the influence of accretion to explain\nthe constant rotation rates distributions that are observed over the star-disc\ninteractions. When accounting for rotation, the models computed with an\nup-to-date torque along with a consistent structural evolution of the accreting\nstar are able to explain the almost constant spin evolution for the whole range\nof parameter we investigated, albeit only reproducing a narrow range around the\nmedian of the observed spin rate distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 11:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

In this work, we develop a\nbaseline method, First Session Adaptation (FSA), that sheds light on the\nefficacy of existing CIL approaches and allows us to assess the relative\nperformance contributions from head and body adaption. FSA adapts a pre-trained\nneural network body only on the first learning session and fixes it thereafter;\na head based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), is then placed on top of\nthe adapted body, allowing exact updates through CIL. FSA is replay-free\ni.e.~it does not memorize examples from previous sessions of continual\nlearning. To empirically motivate FSA, we first consider a diverse selection of\n22 image-classification datasets, evaluating different heads and body\nadaptation techniques in high/low-shot offline settings. We find that the LDA\nhead performs well and supports CIL out-of-the-box. We also find that\nFeaturewise Layer Modulation (FiLM) adapters are highly effective in the\nfew-shot setting, and full-body adaption in the high-shot setting.

These results indicate that current\napproaches to continuous body adaptation are not working as expected.

However, the detection alone is not enough since energy thefts can\ncrucially affect the electricity supply leading to some blackouts. Moreover,\nprivacy is one of the major challenges that must be preserved when dealing with\nclients' energy data. This is often overlooked in energy theft detection\nresearch as most current detection techniques rely on raw, unencrypted data,\nwhich may potentially expose sensitive and personal data. To solve this issue,\nwe present a privacy-preserving energy theft detection technique with effective\ndemand management that employs two layers of privacy protection. We explore a\nsplit learning mechanism that trains a detection model in a decentralised\nfashion without the need to exchange raw data. We also employ a second layer of\nprivacy by the use of a masking scheme to mask clients' outputs in order to\nprevent inference attacks. A privacy-enhanced version of this mechanism also\nemploys an additional layer of privacy protection by training a randomisation\nlayer at the end of the client-side model. This is done to make the output as\nrandom as possible without compromising the detection performance. For the\nenergy theft detection part, we design a multi-output machine learning model to\nidentify energy thefts, estimate their volume, and effectively predict future\ndemand. Finally, we use a comprehensive set of experiments to test our proposed\nscheme. The experimental results show that our scheme achieves high detection\naccuracy and greatly improves the privacy preservation degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 11:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

We observed a previously unreported\nchain of six distinct knots in a roughly S-shaped pattern, and by comparing\nthem with HST images we estimated proper motions in the redshifted knots of 9.5\nmas yr$^{-1}$ with an inclination angle of $73^{\\circ}$, though these\nquantities could not be measured for the blueshifted lobe. Analysis of the\n[FeII] and [NiII] lines suggests jet densities on the order of $\\sim 10^5$\ncm$^{-3}$. We propose that the observed S-shaped morphology originates from a\njet launched by a smaller source with $M_\\star < 0.2$ M$_{\\odot}$ in orbital\nmotion around a larger companion of $M_\\star \\simeq 0.5$ M$_{\\odot}$ at a\nseparation of 30-40 au.

While the brightness asymmetry between\nthe redshifted and blueshifted lobes is consistent with external irradiation,\nfurther analysis of the [NiII] and [FeII] lines suggests that photoionization\nof the jet is not likely to be a dominant factor, and that the emission is\ndominated by collisional excitation. The dynamical age of the jet compared to\nthe anticipated survival time of the proplyd demonstrates that photoevaporation\nof the proplyd occurred prior to jet launching, and that this is still an\nactive source. These two points suggest that the envelope of the proplyd may\nshield the jet from the majority of external radiation, and that\nphotoionization of the proplyd does not appear to impact the ability of a star\nto launch a jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 12:01:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 09:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

To alleviate the above feature misalignment\nissue, existing works mainly focus on spatially aligning the feature maps of\nthe teacher and the student, with pixel-wise transformation.

While this often increases system effectiveness, developing a\nproduction-ready AI-based system is a difficult task. Thus, solid AI\nengineering practices are required to ensure the quality of the resulting\nsystem and to improve the development process. While several practices have\nalready been proposed for the development of AI-based systems, detailed\npractical experiences of applying these practices are rare.\n  In this paper, we aim to address this gap by collecting such experiences\nduring a case study, namely the development of an autonomous stock trading\nsystem that uses machine learning functionality to invest in stocks. We\nselected 10 AI engineering practices from the literature and systematically\napplied them during development, with the goal to collect evidence about their\napplicability and effectiveness. Using structured field notes, we documented\nour experiences. Furthermore, we also used field notes to document challenges\nthat occurred during the development, and the solutions we applied to overcome\nthem. Afterwards, we analyzed the collected field notes, and evaluated how each\npractice improved the development. Lastly, we compared our evidence with\nexisting literature.\n  Most applied practices improved our system, albeit to varying extent, and we\nwere able to overcome all major challenges. The qualitative results provide\ndetailed accounts about 10 AI engineering practices, as well as challenges and\nsolutions associated with such a project. Our experiences therefore enrich the\nemerging body of evidence in this field, which may be especially helpful for\npractitioner teams new to AI engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 12:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

Simply coupling NeRF with photorealistic style transfer (PST) will\nresult in cross-view inconsistency and degradation of stylized view syntheses.\nThrough a thorough analysis, we demonstrate that this non-trivial task can be\nsimplified in a new light: When transforming the appearance representation of a\npre-trained NeRF with Lipschitz mapping, the consistency and photorealism\nacross source views will be seamlessly encoded into the syntheses. That\nmotivates us to build a concise and flexible learning framework namely LipRF,\nwhich upgrades arbitrary 2D PST methods with Lipschitz mapping tailored for the\n3D scene. Technically, LipRF first pre-trains a radiance field to reconstruct\nthe 3D scene, and then emulates the style on each view by 2D PST as the prior\nto learn a Lipschitz network to stylize the pre-trained appearance. In view of\nthat Lipschitz condition highly impacts the expressivity of the neural network,\nwe devise an adaptive regularization to balance the reconstruction and\nstylization.

For\nspeech recognition of complex languages, on the one hand, a small head size\nwill lead to an obvious shortage of learnable aspects. On the other hand, we\nneed to reduce the dimension of each subspace to keep the size of the overall\nfeature space unchanged when we increase the number of heads, which will\nsignificantly weaken the ability to represent the feature of each subspace.\nTherefore, this paper explores how to use a small attention subspace to\nrepresent complete speech features while ensuring many heads.

We first establish the\nwell-known fact that the number of degrees of freedom is equal to the dimension\nof the configuration space, but show that this is only a local description.

By leveraging this topology, we gain\na deeper understanding of the physics. We can then use that topology to\nunderstand the physics better as well as vice versa: intuition about the\nconfiguration space of a physical system can be used to understand non-trivial\ntopological spaces better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 13:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

In place of\nthe standard Fourier form, the constitutive law of the heat flux is assumed in\nthe form given by the theory developed by Green and Naghdi, which accounts for\na possible thermal memory of the evolution.

The existing methods are based on a forward stochastic process\nwherein the training images are scaled to zero over time and white noise is\ngradually added such that the final time step is approximately zero-mean\nidentity-covariance Gaussian noise. A neural network is then trained to\napproximate the time-dependent score function, or the gradient of the logarithm\nof the probability density, for that time step. Using this score estimator, it\nis possible to run an approximation of the time-reversed stochastic process to\nsample new images from the training data distribution. These score-based\ngenerative models have been shown to out-perform generative adversarial neural\nnetworks using standard benchmarks and metrics. However, one issue with this\napproach is that it requires a large number of forward passes of the neural\nnetwork. Additionally, the images at intermediate time steps are not useful,\nsince the signal-to-noise ratio is low. In this work we present a new method\ncalled Fourier Diffusion Models which replaces the scalar operations of the\nforward process with shift-invariant convolutions and the additive white noise\nwith additive stationary noise. This allows for control of MTF and NPS at\nintermediate time steps. Additionally, the forward process can be crafted to\nconverge to the same MTF and NPS as the measured images. This way, we can model\ncontinuous probability flow from true images to measurements. In this way, the\nsample time can be used to control the tradeoffs between measurement\nuncertainty and generative uncertainty of posterior estimates. We compare\nFourier diffusion models to existing scalar diffusion models and show that they\nachieve a higher level of performance and allow for a smaller number of time\nsteps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 14:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

Specifically, we first adopt a network to learn posterior\nprobability distributions of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) from point clouds.\nTo handle partial point cloud registration, we apply the Sinkhorn algorithm to\npredict the distribution-level correspondences under the constraint of the\nmixing weights of GMMs. To enable unsupervised learning, we design three\ndistribution consistency-based losses: self-consistency, cross-consistency, and\nlocal contrastive. The self-consistency loss is formulated by encouraging GMMs\nin Euclidean and feature spaces to share identical posterior distributions. The\ncross-consistency loss derives from the fact that the points of two partially\noverlapping point clouds belonging to the same clusters share the cluster\ncentroids. The cross-consistency loss allows the network to flexibly learn a\ntransformation-invariant posterior distribution of two aligned point clouds.\nThe local contrastive loss facilitates the network to extract discriminative\nlocal features. Our UDPReg achieves competitive performance on the\n3DMatch/3DLoMatch and ModelNet/ModelLoNet benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 14:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

However, these claims are understood\nintuitively, rather than mathematically. Our explorations empirically reveal\nthat the correlation between model generalization and the diversity of domains\nmay be not strictly positive, which limits the effectiveness of domain\naugmentation. This work therefore aim to guarantee and further enhance the\nvalidity of this strand. To this end, we propose a new perspective on DG that\nrecasts it as a convex game between domains.

We study the dynamics of the qubits\nconcurrence starting from a separable state and assuming that the chain\nspectrum is gapped. We identify three relevant regimes that depend on the\nstrength of the qubit-chain coupling in relation to the spectral gap.

In standard matching models, there is some unemployment, but labor\ndemand is perfectly elastic so new entrants into the labor force are absorbed\nwithout affecting jobseekers' prospects.

This paper shows that in a matching model with job\nrationing, in contrast, the entry of immigrants reduces the employment rate of\nnative workers. Moreover, the reduction in employment rate is sharper when the\nlabor market is depressed -- because jobs are more scarce then. Because\nimmigration reduces labor-market tightness, it makes it easier for firms to\nrecruit and improves firm profits.

Several\ndozen supersoft X-ray sources, in which a white dwarf accretes hydrogen-rich\nmatter from a non-degenerate donor star, have been observed and suggested as\nType Ia supernovae progenitors. However, observational evidence for hydrogen,\nwhich is expected to be stripped off the donor star during the supernova\nexplosion, is lacking.

Usually, the search directions of SMCG\nmethods are generated by minimizing approximate models with the approximation\nmatrix $ B_k $ of the objective function at the current iterate over the\nsubspace spanned by the current gradient $ g_k $ and the latest search\ndirection. The $ g_k^TB_kg_k $ must be estimated properly in the calculation of\nthe search directions, which is crucial to the theoretical properties and the\nnumerical performance of SMCG methods. It is a great challenge to estimate it\nproperly. The projection technique has been used successfully to generate\nconjugate gradient directions such as Dai-Kou conjugate gradient direction.\nMotivated by the above two observations, in the paper we present a new subspace\nminimization conjugate gradient methods by using a projection technique based\non the memoryless quasi-Newton method. More specially, we project the search\ndirection of the memoryless quasi-Newton method into the subspace spanned by\nthe current gradient and the latest search direction and drive a new search\ndirection, which is proved to be descent. Remarkably, the proposed method\nwithout any line search enjoys the finite termination property for two\ndimensional convex quadratic functions, which is helpful for designing\nalgorithm. An adaptive scaling factor in the search direction is given based on\nthe above finite termination property.

In this zero-sum game, a\nHider picks a point to hide on the tree and a Searcher picks a unit speed\ntrajectory starting at the root. The payoff (to the Hider) is the search time.\nIn Gal's model (and many subsequent investigations), the Searcher receives no\nadditional information after the Hider chooses his location. In reality, the\nSearcher will often receive such locational information. For homeland security,\nmobile sensors on vehicles have been used to locate radioactive material\nstashed in an urban environment. In a military setting, mobile sensors can\ndetect chemical signatures from land mines. In predator-prey search, the\npredator often has specially attuned senses (hearing for wolves, vision for\neagles, smell for dogs, sonar for bats, pressure sensors for sharks) that may\nhelp it locate the prey. How can such noisy locational information be used by\nthe Searcher to modify her route? We model such information as signals which\nindicate which of two branches of a binary tree should be searched first, where\nthe signal has a known accuracy p<1. Our solution calculates which branch (at\nevery branch node) is favored, meaning it should always be searched first when\nthe signal is in that direction. When the signal is in the other direction, we\ncalculate the probability the signal should be followed. Compared to the\noptimal Hider strategy in the classic search game of Gal, the Hider's optimal\ndistribution for this model is more skewed towards leaf nodes that are further\nfrom the root.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 15:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

To this end, we utilize a pose\ndetection network to estimate the pose of the camera and then construct a\nfeature map portraying pixel-level ground depth according to the 3D-to-2D\nperspective geometry. Moreover, to improve Mono3D with the estimated ground\ndepth, we design an RGB-D feature fusion network based on the transformer\nstructure, where the long-range self-attention mechanism is utilized to\neffectively identify ground-contacting points and pin the corresponding ground\ndepth to the image feature map. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nreal-world KITTI dataset. The results demonstrate that MoGDE can effectively\nimprove the Mono3D accuracy and robustness for both near and far objects. MoGDE\nyields the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods by a\nlarge margin and is ranked number one on the KITTI 3D benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 04:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

On the TL, we propose a resilient topology reconfiguration strategy by\nadding a minimum number of key edges to improve network resilience. It is\nstrictly proved that the control strategy is sufficient to achieve asymptotic\nconsensus in finite time with the topology on the TL satisfying strongly\n$(2f+1)$-robustness. On the CPL, decentralized chattering-free controllers are\nproposed to guarantee the resilient output consensus for the heterogeneous MASs\nagainst Byzantine node attacks. Moreover, the obtained controller shows\nexponential convergence. The effectiveness and practicality of the theoretical\nresults are verified by numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 18:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

The second phase of World Wide Web, named\nWeb 2.0, has been extensively attracting worldwide people that participate in\nbuilding and enjoying the virtual world. Nowadays, the next internet\nrevolution: Web3 is going to open new opportunities for traditional social\nmodels. The decentralization property of Web3 is capable of breaking the\nmonopoly of the internet companies. Moreover, Web3 will lead a paradigm shift\nfrom the Web as a publishing medium to a medium of interaction and\nparticipation. This change will deeply transform the relations among users and\nplatforms, forces and relations of production, and the global economy.\nTherefore, it is necessary that we technically, practically, and more broadly\ntake an overview of Web3. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of\nWeb3, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and\noutlook. This article first introduces several major technologies of Web3.\nThen, we illustrate the type of Web3 applications in detail. Blockchain and\nsmart contracts ensure that decentralized organizations will be less trusted\nand more truthful than that centralized organizations. Decentralized finance\nwill be global, and open with financial inclusiveness for unbanked people. This\npaper also discusses the relationship between the Metaverse and Web3, as well\nas the differences and similarities between Web 3.0 and Web3. Inspired by the\nMaslow's hierarchy of needs theory, we further conduct a novel hierarchy of\nneeds theory within Web3. Finally, several worthwhile future research\ndirections of Web3 are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 23:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

They can be\ndecoded by machine learning models in order to estimate the ongoing brain state\nof a patient or healthy user. In a brain-computer interface (BCI), this decoded\nbrain state information can be used with minimal time delay to either control\nan application, e.g., for communication or for rehabilitation after stroke, or\nto passively monitor the ongoing brain state of the subject, e.g., in a\ndemanding work environment. A specific challenge in such decoding tasks is\nposed by the small dataset sizes in BCI compared to other domains of machine\nlearning like computer vision or natural language processing. A possibility to\ntackle classification or regression problems in BCI despite small training data\nsets is through transfer learning, which utilizes data from other sessions,\nsubjects or even datasets to train a model. In this exploratory study, we\npropose novel domain-specific embeddings for neurophysiological data. Our\napproach is based on metric learning and builds upon the recently proposed\nladder loss. Using embeddings allowed us to benefit, both from the good\ngeneralisation abilities and robustness of deep learning and from the fast\ntraining of classical machine learning models for subject-specific calibration.\nIn offline analyses using EEG data of 14 subjects, we tested the embeddings'\nfeasibility and compared their efficiency with state-of-the-art deep learning\nmodels and conventional machine learning pipelines. In summary, we propose the\nuse of metric learning to obtain pre-trained embeddings of EEG-BCI data as a\nmeans to incorporate domain knowledge and to reach competitive performance on\nnovel subjects with minimal calibration requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 09:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

However, it is\nchallenging for users to understand and document these parameters correctly.\nThis paper develops an API workbench to help users learn and debug APIs. Based\non this workbench, much exploratory work has been proposed to reduce the\noverhead of learning and debugging APIs. We explore the knowledge, such as\nparameter characteristics (e.g., enumerability) and constraints (e.g.,\nmaximum/minimum value), from the massive API call logs to narrow the range of\nparameter values. Then, we propose a fine-grained approach to enrich the API\ndocumentation by extracting dependency knowledge between APIs. Finally, we\npresent a learning-based prediction method to predict API execution results\nbefore the API is called, significantly reducing user debugging cycles. The\nexperiments evaluated on the online system show that this work's approach\nsubstantially improves the user experience of debugging OpenAPIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 05:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

This framework\nis fundamentally altered if we include the fluctuating forces that originate\nfrom the actual charge granularity. We thereby perform the transition from a\nreversible description to a statistical mechanics' description covering also\nthe irreversible aspects of beam dynamics. Taking into account contributions\nfrom fluctuating forces is mandatory if we want to describe effects like\nintrabeam scattering or temperature balancing within beams. Furthermore, the\nappearance of ``discreteness errors'' in computer simulations of beams can be\nmodeled as ``exact'' beam dynamics that is being modified by fluctuating\n``error forces''. It will be shown that the related emittance increase depends\non two distinct quantities: the magnitude of the fluctuating forces embodied in\na friction coefficient $\\gamma$, and the correlation time dependent average\ntemperature anisotropy. These analytical results are verified by various\ncomputer simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 16:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Specifically, we utilize the advantage that videos often not\nonly show the exercises, but also provide language as an additional source of\ninformation. With push-ups as an example, we show that through the analysis of\nsubtitle data using natural language processing (NLP), it is possible to create\na labeled (irrelevant, relevant correct, relevant incorrect) dataset containing\nrelevant information for pose analysis.
