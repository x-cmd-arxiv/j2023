We use\nprevious detections of interstellar objects to calibrate our object density\nestimates.

This setting does not require time-consuming manual annotations\nand can fully utilize existing abundant video corpora. First, based on movie\ntrailers, we leverage scene segmentation to obtain complete shots, which are\nregarded as noisy labels. Then, we propose a Collaborative noisy Label Cleaner\n(CLC) framework to learn from noisy highlight moments.

To overcome the necessity of using\nprevious tasks' data, in this work, we start with strong representation\nlearning methods that have been shown to be less prone to forgetting.

However, it\nis often difficult to obtain a large number of real queries from users due to\nuser privacy restrictions or low frequency of database access. Query generation\nis one of the approaches to solve this problem. Existing query generation\nmethods, such as random generation and template-based generation, do not\nconsider the relationship between the generated queries and existing queries,\nor even generate semantically incorrect queries. In this paper, we propose a\nquery generation framework based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) to\ngenerate query load that is similar to the given query load. In our framework,\nwe use a syntax parser to transform the query into a parse tree and traverse\nthe tree to obtain the sequence of production rules corresponding to the query.\nThe generator of GAN takes a fixed distribution prior as input and outputs the\nquery sequence, and the discriminator takes the real query and the fake query\ngenerated by the generator as input and outputs a gradient to guide the\ngenerator learning. In addition, we add context-free grammar and semantic rules\nto the generation process, which ensures that the generated queries are\nsyntactically and semantically correct. We conduct experiments to evaluate our\napproach on real-world dataset, which show that our approach can generate new\nquery loads with a similar distribution to a given query load, and that the\ngenerated queries are syntactically correct with no semantic errors.

However, the\nsignificant appearance gap between modalities limits the feature representation\nability of certain modalities during the fusion process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Progressive Fusion Transformer called ProFormer,\nwhich progressively integrates single-modality information into the multimodal\nrepresentation for robust RGBT tracking. In particular, ProFormer first uses a\nself-attention module to collaboratively extract the multimodal representation,\nand then uses two cross-attention modules to interact it with the features of\nthe dual modalities respectively. In this way, the modality-specific\ninformation can well be activated in the multimodal representation. Finally, a\nfeed-forward network is used to fuse two interacted multimodal representations\nfor the further enhancement of the final multimodal representation. In\naddition, existing learning methods of RGBT trackers either fuse multimodal\nfeatures into one for final classification, or exploit the relationship between\nunimodal branches and fused branch through a competitive learning strategy.\nHowever, they either ignore the learning of single-modality branches or result\nin one branch failing to be well optimized.

Optimizing lens models, where the\ncluster mass distribution is modeled by a smooth component and subhalos\nassociated with the locations of individual cluster galaxies, has enabled\nderiving the subhalo mass function, providing important constraints on the\nnature and granularity of dark matter. In this work, we explore and present a\nnovel method to detect and measure individual perturbers (subhalos,\nline-of-sight halos, and wandering supermassive black holes) by exploiting\ntheir proximity to highly distorted lensed arcs in galaxy clusters, and by\nmodeling the local lensing distortions with curved arc bases.

The first problem is that the loss function\ntypically encodes a diverse set of equilibrium conditions, such as market\nclearing and households' or firms' optimality conditions. Hence the training\nalgorithm trades off errors between those -- potentially very different --\nequilibrium conditions. This renders the interpretation of the remaining errors\nchallenging. The second problem is that portfolio choice in models with\nmultiple assets is only pinned down for low errors in the corresponding\nequilibrium conditions. In the beginning of training, this can lead to\nfluctuating policies for different assets, which hampers the training process.\nTo alleviate these issues, we propose two complementary innovations. First, we\nintroduce Market Clearing Layers, a neural network architecture that\nautomatically enforces all the market clearing conditions and borrowing\nconstraints in the economy. Encoding economic constraints into the neural\nnetwork architecture reduces the number of terms in the loss function and\nenhances the interpretability of the remaining equilibrium errors.

However, they suffer from two\nmajor limitations: less effective locality modeling and insufficient feature\naggregation in decoders, which are not conducive to camouflaged object\ndetection that explores subtle cues from indistinguishable backgrounds. To\naddress these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based\nFeature Shrinkage Pyramid Network (FSPNet), which aims to hierarchically decode\nlocality-enhanced neighboring transformer features through progressive\nshrinking for camouflaged object detection. Specifically, we propose a nonlocal\ntoken enhancement module (NL-TEM) that employs the non-local mechanism to\ninteract neighboring tokens and explore graph-based high-order relations within\ntokens to enhance local representations of transformers. Moreover, we design a\nfeature shrinkage decoder (FSD) with adjacent interaction modules (AIM), which\nprogressively aggregates adjacent transformer features through a layer-bylayer\nshrinkage pyramid to accumulate imperceptible but effective cues as much as\npossible for object information decoding.

Assuming realistic junction parameters, we\nevaluate the polarity-dependent critical currents to quantify the efficiency of\nthese Josephson junctions as supercurrent diodes, and discuss the tunability of\nthe Josephson supercurrent diode effect in terms of spin-orbit coupling,\nmagnetic exchange, and transparency of the nonsuperconducting weak link.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the junctions might undergo current-reversing\n$ 0 $-$ \\pi $-like phase transitions at large enough magnetic exchange, which\nappear as sharp peaks followed by a sudden suppression in the\nsupercurrent-diode-effect efficiency. The characteristics of the Josephson\nsupercurrent diode effect obtained from our model convincingly reproduce many\nunique features observed in recent experiments, validating its robustness and\nsuitability for further studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2023 21:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

This macroscopic transport\nprediction is then confirmed numerically for a reduced model of\nelectron-temperature-gradient-driven turbulence. The system realises this\nscaling through a turbulent cascade from large to small perpendicular spatial\nscales.

In this work, we study the dynamics of QNNs and show that contrary to\npopular belief it is qualitatively different from that of any kernel\nregression: due to the unitarity of quantum operations, there is a\nnon-negligible deviation from the tangent kernel regression derived at the\nrandom initialization.

Recent works employ different graph editions to\ngenerate augmented environments and learn an invariant GNN for generalization.\nHowever, the label shift usually occurs in augmentation since graph structural\nedition inevitably alters the graph label. This brings inconsistent predictive\nrelationships among augmented environments, which is harmful to generalization.\nTo address this issue, we propose \\textbf{LiSA}, which generates\nlabel-invariant augmentations to facilitate graph OOD generalization. Instead\nof resorting to graph editions, LiSA exploits \\textbf{L}abel-\\textbf{i}nvariant\n\\textbf{S}ubgraphs of the training graphs to construct \\textbf{A}ugmented\nenvironments.

In this manner, LiSA generates diverse\naugmented environments with a consistent predictive relationship and\nfacilitates learning an invariant GNN.

However, direct aligning cross-modal\ninformation using such representations is challenging, as visual patches and\ntext tokens differ in semantic levels and granularities. To alleviate this\nissue, we propose a Finite Discrete Tokens (FDT) based multimodal\nrepresentation. FDT is a set of learnable tokens representing certain\nvisual-semantic concepts. Both images and texts are embedded using shared FDT\nby first grounding multimodal inputs to FDT space and then aggregating the\nactivated FDT representations.

As a result, the granularity gap between the two\nmodalities is reduced.

Here we show that a reconciliation between algorithmic behaviour\nand thermodynamic prediction is nonetheless possible at least up to some\nthreshold $\\alpha_d^{\\rm opt}\\geq\\alpha_d$, which is defined as the maximum\nvalue of the dynamical threshold computed on all possible probability measures\nover the solutions. We consider a simple Monte Carlo-based optimization\nalgorithm, which is restricted to the solution space, and we demonstrate that\nsampling the equilibrium distribution of a biased measure improving on\n$\\alpha_d$ is still possible even beyond the ergodicity breaking point for the\nuniform measure, where other algorithms hopelessly enter the out-of-equilibrium\nregime. The conjecture we put forward is that many smart algorithms sample the\nsolution space according to a biased measure: once this measure is identified,\nthe algorithmic threshold is given by the corresponding ergodicity-breaking\ntransition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 02:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Despite the\nstate-of-the-art performance of transformer models, they are not yet ready for\nexecution on resource-constrained hardware platforms. High memory requirements\nand low parallelizability of the transformer architecture exacerbate this\nproblem. Recently-proposed accelerators attempt to optimize the throughput and\nenergy consumption of transformer models. However, such works are either\nlimited to a one-sided search of the model architecture or a restricted set of\noff-the-shelf devices. Furthermore, previous works only accelerate model\ninference and not training, which incurs substantially higher memory and\ncompute resources, making the problem even more challenging. To address these\nlimitations, this work proposes a dynamic training framework, called DynaProp,\nthat speeds up the training process and reduces memory consumption. DynaProp is\na low-overhead pruning method that prunes activations and gradients at runtime.\nTo effectively execute this method on hardware for a diverse set of transformer\narchitectures, we propose ELECTOR, a framework that simulates transformer\ninference and training on a design space of accelerators. We use this simulator\nin conjunction with the proposed co-design technique, called TransCODE, to\nobtain the best-performing models with high accuracy on the given task and\nminimize latency, energy consumption, and chip area.

Most previous bottom-up methods try to consider the relation\nof instances to identify different body parts during the post processing, while\nignoring to model the relation among instances or environment in the feature\nlearning process. In addition, most existing works adopt the operations of\nupsampling and downsampling. During the sampling process, there will be a\nproblem of misalignment with the source features, resulting in deviations in\nthe keypoint features learned by the model.\n  To overcome the above limitations, we propose a convolutional neural network\nfor bottom-up human pose estimation. It invovles two basic modules: (i) Global\nRelation Modeling (GRM) module globally learns relation (e.g., environment\ncontext, instance interactive information) among region of image by fusing\nmultiple stages features in the feature learning process. It combines with the\nspatial-channel attention mechanism, which focuses on achieving adaptability in\nspatial and channel dimensions. (ii) Multi-branch Feature Align (MFA) module\naggregates features from multiple branches to align fused feature and obtain\nrefined local keypoint representation. Our model has the ability to focus on\ndifferent granularity from local to global regions, which significantly boosts\nthe performance of the multi-person pose estimation.

First, we optimize the\ninverse dynamics to encourage the world model to isolate controllable state\ntransitions from the mixed spatiotemporal variations of the environment.\nSecond, we perform policy optimization based on the decoupled latent\nimaginations, where we roll out noncontrollable states into the future and\nadaptively associate them with the current controllable state. This enables\nlong-horizon visuomotor control tasks to benefit from isolating mixed dynamics\nsources in the wild, such as self-driving cars that can anticipate the movement\nof other vehicles, thereby avoiding potential risks. On top of our previous\nwork, we further consider the sparse dependencies between controllable and\nnoncontrollable states, address the training collapse problem of state\ndecoupling, and validate our approach in transfer learning setups.

The cross-lingual distillation ability across TKGs becomes increasingly\ncrucial, in light of the unsatisfying performance of existing reasoning methods\non those severely incomplete TKGs, especially in low-resource languages.\nHowever, it poses tremendous challenges in two aspects. First, the\ncross-lingual alignments, which serve as bridges for knowledge transfer, are\nusually too scarce to transfer sufficient knowledge between two TKGs. Second,\ntemporal knowledge discrepancy of the aligned entities, especially when\nalignments are unreliable, can mislead the knowledge distillation process. We\ncorrespondingly propose a mutually-paced knowledge distillation model MP-KD,\nwhere a teacher network trained on a source TKG can guide the training of a\nstudent network on target TKGs with an alignment module. Concretely, to deal\nwith the scarcity issue, MP-KD generates pseudo alignments between TKGs based\non the temporal information extracted by our representation module. To maximize\nthe efficacy of knowledge transfer and control the noise caused by the temporal\nknowledge discrepancy, we enhance MP-KD with a temporal cross-lingual attention\nmechanism to dynamically estimate the alignment strength.

Sure independent screening procedure\nhas been demonstrated to be an effective method to reduce the dimensionality of\ndata from a large scale to a relatively moderate scale. For censored survival\ndata, the existing screening methods mainly adopt the Kaplan--Meier estimator\nto handle censoring, which may not perform well for scenarios which have heavy\ncensoring rate. In this article, we propose a model-free screening procedure\nbased on the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). The proposed method\navoids the complication to specify an actual model from a large number of\ncovariates. Compared with existing screening procedures, this new approach has\nseveral advantages. First, it does not involve the Kaplan--Meier estimator,\nthus its performance is much more robust for the cases with a heavy censoring\nrate. Second, the empirical estimate of HSIC is very simple as it just depends\non the trace of a product of Gram matrices. In addition, the proposed procedure\ndoes not require any complicated numerical optimization, so the corresponding\ncalculation is very simple and fast.

An emerging\nmore-than-human design philosophy encourages designers to consider such\ninterrelations between humans and non-human entities. Yet, the design research\ncommunity has focused on situated or embodied experiences for designers, rather\nthan developing processes to legitimate the perspectives of non-human entities\nthrough participatory design. This paper explores how adopting the `intentional\nstance', a concept from philosophy, might provide a heuristic for\nmore-than-human participatory design. Through experimentation with the\nintentional stance in the context of smart lighting systems, the paper\ndemonstrates that the approach has potential for non-human entities from the\necological world, but less so for the biophysical world.

Together, small satellites with\nlightweight instruments and solar sails offer affordable access to deep regions\nof the solar system, also making it possible to realize hard-to-reach\ntrajectories that are not constrained to the ecliptic plane. Combining these\ntwo technologies can drastically reduce travel times within the solar system,\nwhile delivering robust science. With solar sailing propulsion capable of\nreaching the velocities of ~5-10 AU/yr, missions using a rideshare launch may\nreach the Jovian system in two years, Saturn in three. The same technologies\ncould allow reaching solar polar orbits in less than two years. Fast,\ncost-effective, and maneuverable sailcraft that may travel outside the ecliptic\nplane open new opportunities for affordable solar system exploration, with\ngreat promise for heliophysics, planetary science, and astrophysics.

One class of\nsuch repeaters utilizes quantum error correction to overcome losses in the\ncommunication channel. Here we propose a novel strategy of using the bosonic\nGottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code in a two-way repeater architecture with\nmultiplexing. The crucial feature of the GKP code that we make use of is the\nfact that GKP qubits easily admit deterministic two-qubit gates, hence allowing\nfor multiplexing without the need for generating large cluster states as\nrequired in previous all-photonic architectures based on discrete-variable\ncodes. Moreover, alleviating the need for such clique-clusters entails that we\nare no longer limited to extraction of at most one end-to-end entangled pair\nfrom a single protocol run. In fact, thanks to the availability of the analog\ninformation generated during the measurements of the GKP qubits, we can design\nbetter entanglement swapping procedures in which we connect links based on\ntheir estimated quality. This enables us to use all the multiplexed links so\nthat large number of links from a single protocol run can contribute to the\ngeneration of the end-to-end entanglement. We find that our architecture allows\nfor high-rate end-to-end entanglement generation and is resilient to\nimperfections arising from finite squeezing in the GKP state preparation and\nhomodyne detection inefficiency. In particular we show that long-distance\nquantum communication over more than 1000 km is possible even with less than 13\ndB of GKP squeezing. We also quantify the number of GKP qubits needed for the\nimplementation of our scheme and find that for good hardware parameters our\nscheme requires around $10^3-10^4$ GKP qubits per repeater per protocol run.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 05:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

However, most methods focus on dealing with spatially\nindependent noise, and they have little practicality on real-world sRGB images\nwith spatially correlated noise. Although pixel-shuffle downsampling has been\nsuggested for breaking the noise correlation, it breaks the original\ninformation of images, which limits the denoising performance. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel perspective to solve this problem, i.e., seeking for\nspatially adaptive supervision for real-world sRGB image denoising.\nSpecifically, we take into account the respective characteristics of flat and\ntextured regions in noisy images, and construct supervisions for them\nseparately. For flat areas, the supervision can be safely derived from\nnon-adjacent pixels, which are much far from the current pixel for excluding\nthe influence of the noise-correlated ones. And we extend the blind-spot\nnetwork to a blind-neighborhood network (BNN) for providing supervision on flat\nareas. For textured regions, the supervision has to be closely related to the\ncontent of adjacent pixels. And we present a locally aware network (LAN) to\nmeet the requirement, while LAN itself is selectively supervised with the\noutput of BNN. Combining these two supervisions, a denoising network (e.g.,\nU-Net) can be well-trained. Extensive experiments show that our method performs\nfavorably against state-of-the-art SSID methods on real-world sRGB photographs.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/nagejacob/SpatiallyAdaptiveSSID.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 06:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Compared with other biometric\ntechnologies, gait recognition is more difficult to disguise and can be applied\nto the condition of long-distance without the cooperation of subjects. Thus, it\nhas unique potential and wide application for crime prevention and social\nsecurity. At present, most gait recognition methods directly extract features\nfrom the video frames to establish representations. However, these\narchitectures learn representations from different features equally but do not\npay enough attention to dynamic features, which refers to a representation of\ndynamic parts of silhouettes over time (e.g. legs). Since dynamic parts of the\nhuman body are more informative than other parts (e.g. bags) during walking, in\nthis paper, we propose a novel and high-performance framework named DyGait.\nThis is the first framework on gait recognition that is designed to focus on\nthe extraction of dynamic features. Specifically, to take full advantage of the\ndynamic information, we propose a Dynamic Augmentation Module (DAM), which can\nautomatically establish spatial-temporal feature representations of the dynamic\nparts of the human body. The experimental results show that our DyGait network\noutperforms other state-of-the-art gait recognition methods.

In this paper, we present\na regularized EM algorithm for GMM-s that can make efficient use of such prior\nknowledge as well as cope with LSS situations. The method aims to maximize a\npenalized GMM likelihood where regularized estimation may be used to ensure\npositive definiteness of covariance matrix updates and shrink the estimators\ntowards some structured target covariance matrices. We show that the\ntheoretical guarantees of convergence hold, leading to better performing EM\nalgorithm for structured covariance matrix models or with low sample settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 08:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

The transport of MPs and natural sediment in\naquatic flows could be somewhat comparable, as particles are similar in size.\nHowever, it is unknown how the lower density of MPs and their different\nmaterial properties impact their transport dynamics. To answer this, novel\nlaboratory experiments on bed load saltation dynamics in an open-channel flow,\nusing high-speed camera imaging and the detection of 11,035 individual\nsaltation events were used to identify the similarities and differences between\nspherical MPs and spherical natural sediments transport. The tested MPs varied\nin terms of size and material properties (density and elasticity). Our analysis\nshows that the Rouse number accurately describes saltation length, height,\ntransport velocity and collision angles equally well for both MPs and natural\nsediments. Through statistical inference, the distribution functions of\nsaltation trajectory characteristics for MPs were analogous to natural sediment\nwith only one sediment experiment (1.4 % of cases) differing from all other\nplastic experiments. Similarly, only nine experiments (9.3 % of cases) showed\nthat collision angles for MPs differed from those of natural sediment\nexperiments. Differences observed in terms of restitution become negligible in\noverall transport dynamics as turbulence overcomes the kinetic energy lost at\nparticle-bed impact, which keeps particle motion independent from impact.\nOverall, spherical MP particles behave similarly to spherical natural sediments\nin aquatic environments under the examined experimental conditions. This is\nsignificant because there is an established body of knowledge for sediment\ntransport that can serve as a foundation for the study of MP transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 08:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Although the recent work\nemploying the vision transformer (ViT) backbone shows exceptional performance,\nthere is still a lack of consideration for task-specific training guidance and\nlocal semantic consistency. To tackle these issues, we leverage contrastive\nlearning by excavating hidden positives to learn rich semantic relationships\nand ensure semantic consistency in local regions. Specifically, we first\ndiscover two types of global hidden positives, task-agnostic and task-specific\nones for each anchor based on the feature similarities defined by a fixed\npre-trained backbone and a segmentation head-in-training, respectively. A\ngradual increase in the contribution of the latter induces the model to capture\ntask-specific semantic features. In addition, we introduce a gradient\npropagation strategy to learn semantic consistency between adjacent patches,\nunder the inherent premise that nearby patches are highly likely to possess the\nsame semantics. Specifically, we add the loss propagating to local hidden\npositives, semantically similar nearby patches, in proportion to the predefined\nsimilarity scores.

However, in real-world scenarios, it often faces the open set\nproblem with the dynamically increased class set as the time passes by. This\nwill bring two big challenges to the existing dynamic GNN methods: (i) How to\ndynamically propagate appropriate information in an open temporal graph, where\nnew class nodes are often linked to old class nodes. This case will lead to a\nsharp contradiction. This is because typical GNNs are prone to make the\nembeddings of connected nodes become similar, while we expect the embeddings of\nthese two interactive nodes to be distinguishable since they belong to\ndifferent classes. (ii) How to avoid catastrophic knowledge forgetting over old\nclasses when learning new classes occurred in temporal graphs. In this paper,\nwe propose a general and principled learning approach for open temporal graphs,\ncalled OTGNet, with the goal of addressing the above two challenges.

We\ndemonstrate that the local antiferromagnetic ordering and doping play key roles\nin determining the electron-phonon coupling, thus Tc. Initially, the La2CuO4\npossesses a checkerboard local antiferromagnetic ground state. As the hole\ndoping increases, Tc increases with the increase of the density of states at\nthe Fermi surface. But as the doping increases further, the strength of the\nantiferromagnetic interaction weakens. At the critical doping level, a magnetic\nphase transition occurs that reduces the local antiferromagnetism-assisted\nelectron-phonon coupling, thus diminishing the Tc. The superconductivity\ndisappears in the heavily overdoped region when the antiferromagnetic ordering\ndisappears.

Often, HSs are\nnaturally modelled by concurrent processes that communicate with each other.\nHowever, existing specification logics cannot easily handle such models. In\nthis paper, we present a specification logic and proof system for Hybrid\nCommunicating Sequential Processes (HCSP), that extends CSP with ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODE) and interrupts to model interactions between\ncontinuous and discrete evolution. Because it includes a rich set of algebraic\noperators, complicated hybrid systems can be easily modelled in an algebra-like\ncompositional way in HCSP. Our logic can be seen as a generalization and\nsimplification of existing hybrid Hoare logics (HHL) based on duration calculus\n(DC), as well as a conservative extension of existing Hoare logics for\nconcurrent programs. Its assertion logic is the first-order theory of\ndifferential equations (FOD), together with assertions about traces recording\ncommunications, readiness, and continuous evolution. We prove continuous\nrelative completeness of the logic w.r.t. FOD, as well as discrete relative\ncompleteness in the sense that continuous behaviour can be arbitrarily\napproximated by discretization. Besides, we discuss how to simplify proofs\nusing the logic by providing a simplified assertion language and a set of sound\nand complete rules for differential invariants for ODEs.

In this paper, we tackle the task of animal pose\nestimation with scarce annotations, where only a small set of labeled data and\nunlabeled images are available. At the core of the solution to this problem\nsetting is the use of the unlabeled data to compensate for the lack of\nwell-labeled animal pose data. To this end, we propose the ScarceNet, a pseudo\nlabel-based approach to generate artificial labels for the unlabeled images.\nThe pseudo labels, which are generated with a model trained with the small set\nof labeled images, are generally noisy and can hurt the performance when\ndirectly used for training. To solve this problem, we first use a small-loss\ntrick to select reliable pseudo labels. Although effective, the selection\nprocess is improvident since numerous high-loss samples are left unused. We\nfurther propose to identify reusable samples from the high-loss samples based\non an agreement check. Pseudo labels are re-generated to provide supervision\nfor those reusable samples. Lastly, we introduce a student-teacher framework to\nenforce a consistency constraint since there are still samples that are neither\nreliable nor reusable. By combining the reliable pseudo label selection with\nthe reusable sample re-labeling and the consistency constraint, we can make\nfull use of the unlabeled data.

Recent studies have applied Bayesian\nnonparametrics (BNPs) to develop learning-augmented versions of the popular\ncount-min sketch (CMS) recovery algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel\nBNP approach to frequency recovery, which is not built from the CMS but still\nrelies on a sketch obtained by random hashing. Assuming data to be modeled as\nrandom samples from an unknown discrete distribution, which is endowed with a\nPoisson-Kingman (PK) prior, we provide the posterior distribution of the\nempirical frequency of a symbol, given the sketch. Estimates are then obtained\nas mean functionals. An application of our result is presented for the\nDirichlet process (DP) and Pitman-Yor process (PYP) priors, and in particular:\ni) we characterize the DP prior as the sole PK prior featuring a property of\nsufficiency with respect to the sketch, leading to a simple posterior\ndistribution; ii) we identify a large sample regime under which the PYP prior\nleads to a simple approximation of the posterior distribution. Then, we develop\nour BNP approach to a \"traits\" formulation of the frequency recovery problem,\nnot yet studied in the CMS literature, in which data belong to more than one\nsymbol (trait), and exhibit nonnegative integer levels of associations with\neach trait. In particular, by modeling data as random samples from a\ngeneralized Indian buffet process, we provide the posterior distribution of the\nempirical frequency level of a trait, given the sketch. This result is then\napplied under the assumption of a Poisson and Bernoulli distribution for the\nlevels of associations, leading to a simple posterior distribution and a simple\napproximation of the posterior distribution, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 09:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

To resolve this\nproblem, most previous works have focused on filtering out degradation-causing\nlow-quality images while ignoring their potential value for models. Through\neffectively learning and leveraging the knowledge of degradations, models can\nbetter resist their adverse effects and avoid misdiagnosis. In this paper, we\nraise the problem of image quality-aware diagnosis, which aims to take\nadvantage of low-quality images and image quality labels to achieve a more\naccurate and robust diagnosis. However, the diversity of degradations and\nsuperficially unrelated targets between image quality assessment and disease\ndiagnosis makes it still quite challenging to effectively leverage quality\nlabels to assist diagnosis. Thus, to tackle these issues, we propose a novel\nmeta-knowledge co-embedding network, consisting of two subnets: Task Net and\nMeta Learner. Task Net constructs an explicit quality information utilization\nmechanism to enhance diagnosis via knowledge co-embedding features, while Meta\nLearner ensures the effectiveness and constrains the semantics of these\nfeatures via meta-learning and joint-encoding masking. Superior performance on\nfive datasets with four widely-used medical imaging modalities demonstrates the\neffectiveness and generalizability of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 09:35:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 07:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

Many existing methods rely on manually designed features to detect\nthese bright spots, but they often fail to identify reflective flares created\nby various types of light and may even mistakenly remove the light sources in\nscenarios with multiple light sources. To address these challenges, we propose\nan optical center symmetry prior, which suggests that the reflective flare and\nlight source are always symmetrical around the lens's optical center.

The\ndroplets of a millimetric size have a nearly spherical shape by the moment the\nbubble is nucleated. We have investigated the nucleation of secondary bubbles\ninduced by the rarefaction wave that is produced when the shock wave emitted by\nthe laser-induced plasma reflects at the drop surface.

Their shape is\ncompared with the negative pressure distribution computed with a CFD model and\nallows us to estimate a cavitation threshold value. High-speed recordings of\nthe drop/bubble dynamics are complemented by the velocity and pressure fields\nsimulated for the same initial conditions. The effect of the proximity of a\ncurved free surface on the jetting dynamics of the bubbles was qualitatively\nassessed by classifying the cavitation events using a non-dimensional stand-off\nparameter which depends on the drop size, the bubble maximum radius and the\nrelative position of the bubble inside the drop.

One possible plasma-surface interaction\nis the generation of secondary electrons (SEs), which significantly influence\nthe discharge when accelerated in the sheath electric field. However, SEs, in\nparticular electron-induced SEs ($\\updelta$-electrons), are frequently\nneglected in theory and simulations. Due to the relatively high threshold\nenergy for the effective generation of $\\updelta$-electrons at surfaces, their\ndynamics are closely connected and entangled with the dynamics of the\nion-induced SEs ($\\upgamma$-electrons). Thus, a fundamental understanding of\nthe electron dynamics has to be achieved on a nanosecond timescale, and the\neffects of the different electron groups have to be segregated.

Although recent methods perform well in still\nscenes or scenes with regular movement, they always lack robustness in moving\nscenes due to their weak ability in modeling long-term dependency both\nspatially and temporally, leading to color fading, color discontinuity or other\nartifacts. To solve this problem, we propose an exemplar-based video\ncolorization framework with long-term spatiotemporal dependency. To enhance the\nlong-term spatial dependency, a parallelized CNN-Transformer block and a double\nhead non-local operation are designed. The proposed CNN-Transformer block can\nbetter incorporate long-term spatial dependency with local texture and\nstructural features, and the double head non-local operation further leverages\nthe performance of augmented feature. While for long-term temporal dependency\nenhancement, we further introduce the novel linkage subnet. The linkage subnet\npropagate motion information across adjacent frame blocks and help to maintain\ntemporal continuity.

Taking advantage of the similar detection paradigm of\ndifferent detectors in BEV, UniDistill easily supports LiDAR-to-camera,\ncamera-to-LiDAR, fusion-to-LiDAR and fusion-to-camera distillation paths.\nFurthermore, the three distillation losses can filter the effect of misaligned\nbackground information and balance between objects of different sizes,\nimproving the distillation effectiveness.

One reason for this is\npartly unsatisfactory control performance under varying operating conditions,\nwhich can result in poor modulation and part load capability. A promising\napproach to tackle this issue is using dynamic, model-based control strategies,\nwhose effectiveness, however, strongly depend on the model being used.

Although considerable efforts have been developed on improving\nthe transferability of adversarial examples generated by transfer-based\nadversarial attacks, our investigation found that, the big deviation between\nthe actual and steepest update directions of the current transfer-based\nadversarial attacks is caused by the large update step length, resulting in the\ngenerated adversarial examples can not converge well. However, directly\nreducing the update step length will lead to serious update oscillation so that\nthe generated adversarial examples also can not achieve great transferability\nto the victim models. To address these issues, a novel transfer-based attack,\nnamely direction tuning attack, is proposed to not only decrease the update\ndeviation in the large step length, but also mitigate the update oscillation in\nthe small sampling step length, thereby making the generated adversarial\nexamples converge well to achieve great transferability on victim models. In\naddition, a network pruning method is proposed to smooth the decision boundary,\nthereby further decreasing the update oscillation and enhancing the\ntransferability of the generated adversarial examples. The experiment results\non ImageNet demonstrate that the average attack success rate (ASR) of the\nadversarial examples generated by our method can be improved from 87.9\\% to\n94.5\\% on five victim models without defenses, and from 69.1\\% to 76.2\\% on\neight advanced defense methods, in comparison with that of latest\ngradient-based attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 11:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Detecting\nbreach or penetration of the surgical tool to the cortical wall during\npilot-hole drilling is essential to avoid damage to vital anatomical structures\nadjacent to the pedicle, such as the spinal cord, blood vessels, and nerves.\nCurrently, the guidance of pedicle drilling is done using image-guided methods\nthat are radiation intensive and limited to the preoperative information. This\nwork proposes a new radiation-free breach detection algorithm leveraging a\nnon-visual sensor setup in combination with deep learning approach. Multiple\nvibroacoustic sensors, such as a contact microphone, a free-field microphone, a\ntri-axial accelerometer, a uni-axial accelerometer, and an optical tracking\nsystem were integrated into the setup. Data were collected on four cadaveric\nhuman spines, ranging from L5 to T10. An experienced spine surgeon drilled the\npedicles relying on optical navigation. A new automatic labeling method based\non the tracking data was introduced. Labeled data was subsequently fed to the\nnetwork in mel-spectrograms, classifying the data into breach and non-breach.\nDifferent sensor types, sensor positioning, and their combinations were\nevaluated.

Furthermore, we construct a new multi-frame point cloud\ninterpolation dataset called NL-Drive for large nonlinear motions in autonomous\ndriving scenes to better demonstrate the superiority of our method. Ultimately,\nNeuralPCI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both DHB (Dynamic Human\nBodies) and NL-Drive datasets. Beyond the interpolation task, our method can be\nnaturally extended to point cloud extrapolation, morphing, and auto-labeling,\nwhich indicates its substantial potential in other domains.

These methods add stealthy perturbations to the original image, thereby\nmaking it difficult for deep learning models to learn from these training data\neffectively. Current research suggests that adversarial training can, to a\ncertain degree, mitigate the impact of unlearnable example attacks, while\ncommon data augmentation methods are not effective against such poisons.\nAdversarial training, however, demands considerable computational resources and\ncan result in non-trivial accuracy loss. In this paper, we introduce the\nUEraser method, which outperforms current defenses against different types of\nstate-of-the-art unlearnable example attacks through a combination of effective\ndata augmentation policies and loss-maximizing adversarial augmentations. In\nstark contrast to the current SOTA adversarial training methods, UEraser uses\nadversarial augmentations, which extends beyond the confines of $ \\ell_p $\nperturbation budget assumed by current unlearning attacks and defenses. It also\nhelps to improve the model's generalization ability, thus protecting against\naccuracy loss. UEraser wipes out the unlearning effect with error-maximizing\ndata augmentations, thus restoring trained model accuracies. Interestingly,\nUEraser-Lite, a fast variant without adversarial augmentations, is also highly\neffective in preserving clean accuracies. On challenging unlearnable CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet-subset datasets produced with various attacks, it\nachieves results that are comparable to those obtained during clean training.\nWe also demonstrate its efficacy against possible adaptive attacks.

Systems containing magnetic materials, such as\nplatinum-cobalt, have been studied because of their potential for technological\napplications, e.g. spintronics, magnetic storage and magnetic sensors. Since\nthe magnetic properties of thin layers are strongly related to the growth\nparameters, the fine tuning of these parameters is necessary to produce\nmultilayers with specific properties required in various applications. Here, an\nefficient approach to tune the coercive field of Co ultrathin films in the\nmultilayer by varying the underlayer thickness is demonstrated. Using magnetron\nsputtering, we prepared multilayer systems of Au(x)/Pt(5nm)/Co(0.7nm)/Au(5nm)\nwith various thicknesses of Au underlayer. The surface morphology of\nAu(x)/Pt(5nm) stack on which Co layer was deposited was studied by atomic force\nmicroscopy. We show the possibility to control the interfacial roughness by\nchanging the Au underlayer thickness due to its island-like growth mechanism\n(Volmer-Weber mode). As the nominal thickness of Au increases, the islands grow\nin larger lateral size, resulting in a higher overall roughness of the layer\nsurface. Magnetization measurements indicate a direct influence of the\nunderlayer roughness on the coercivity of the multilayers by promoting\nadditional magnetic anisotropy. With thickness of the Au layer up to 20 nm, we\ncan change the coercive field in the range from ~200 Oe to ~1100 Oe, while\nremaining a nearly constant saturation magnetization.

They are used in numerous protocols and\napplications to secure authenticity as well as key agreement, and quantum-safe\nalternatives are urgently needed. NIST therefore initiated a standardization\nprocess. This requires intensive evaluation, also with regard to performance\nand integrability. Here, the integration into TLS 1.3 plays an important role,\nsince it is used for 90% of all Internet connections. In the present work,\nalgorithms for quantum-safe key exchange during TLS 1.3 handshake were\nreviewed. The focus is on the influence of dedicated network parameters such as\ntransmission rate or packet loss in order to gain insights regarding the\nsuitability of the algorithms under corresponding network conditions. For the\nimplementation, a framework by Paquin et al. was extended to emulate network\nscenarios and capture the handshake duration for selected algorithms. It is\nshown that the evaluated candidates Kyber, Saber and NTRU as well as the\nalternative NTRU Prime have a very good overall performance and partly undercut\nthe handshake duration of the classical ECDH. The choice of a higher security\nlevel or hybrid variants does not make a significant difference here. This is\nnot the case with alternatives such as FrodoKEM, SIKE, HQC or BIKE, which have\nindividual disadvantages and whose respective performance varies greatly\ndepending on the security level and hybrid implementation. This is especially\ntrue for the data-intensive algorithm FrodoKEM. In general, the prevailing\nnetwork characteristics should be taken into account when choosing scheme and\nvariant. Further it becomes clear that the performance of the handshake is\ninfluenced by external factors such as TCP mechanisms or MTU, which could\ncompensate for possible disadvantages due to PQC if configured appropriately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 12:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

The exploration of such innate properties of human\nsketches has, however, been limited to that of image retrieval. In this paper,\nfor the first time, we cultivate the expressiveness of sketches but for the\nfundamental vision task of object detection. The end result is a sketch-enabled\nobject detection framework that detects based on what \\textit{you} sketch --\n\\textit{that} ``zebra'' (e.g., one that is eating the grass) in a herd of\nzebras (instance-aware detection), and only the \\textit{part} (e.g., ``head\" of\na ``zebra\") that you desire (part-aware detection). We further dictate that our\nmodel works without (i) knowing which category to expect at testing (zero-shot)\nand (ii) not requiring additional bounding boxes (as per fully supervised) and\nclass labels (as per weakly supervised). Instead of devising a model from the\nground up, we show an intuitive synergy between foundation models (e.g., CLIP)\nand existing sketch models build for sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR), which\ncan already elegantly solve the task -- CLIP to provide model generalisation,\nand SBIR to bridge the (sketch$\\rightarrow$photo) gap. In particular, we first\nperform independent prompting on both sketch and photo branches of an SBIR\nmodel to build highly generalisable sketch and photo encoders on the back of\nthe generalisation ability of CLIP. We then devise a training paradigm to adapt\nthe learned encoders for object detection, such that the region embeddings of\ndetected boxes are aligned with the sketch and photo embeddings from SBIR.\nEvaluating our framework on standard object detection datasets like PASCAL-VOC\nand MS-COCO outperforms both supervised (SOD) and weakly-supervised object\ndetectors (WSOD) on zero-shot setups.

To account for these effects,\nincluding the presence of a quasi-adiabatic temperature profile and entropy\nsources due to dissipation, the compressibility is expressed through a\ndissipation number, $\\mathcal{D}$, proportional to the planet's radius and\ngravity. In Earth's mantle, compressibility effects are moderate, but in large\nrocky or liquid exoplanets (Super-Earths), the dissipation number can become\nvery large. This paper explores the properties of compressible convection when\nthe dissipation number is significant. We start by selecting a simple Murnaghan\nequation of state that embodies the fundamental properties of condensed matter\nat planetary conditions. Next, we analyze the characteristics of adiabatic\nprofiles and demonstrate that the ratio between the bottom and top adiabatic\ntemperatures is relatively small and probably less than 2. We examine the\nmarginal stability of compressible mantles and reveal that they can undergo\nconvection with either positive or negative superadiabatic Rayleigh numbers.\nLastly, we delve into simulations of convection performed using the exact\nequations of mechanics, neglecting inertia (infinite Prandtl number case), and\nexamine their consequences for Super-Earths dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 12:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

To evaluate the planet b flux contribution, we extracted\nthe photometry and compared it to the flux published in the literature.

While we did not detect the planet b, we were able\nto put constraints on the presence of circumplanetary material, ruling out the\nequivalent of a Saturn-like planetary ring around the planet.

However, little light has been shed on measuring the aesthetic quality\nof artistic images, and the existing datasets only contain relatively few\nartworks. Such a defect is a great obstacle to the aesthetic assessment of\nartistic images. To fill the gap in the field of artistic image aesthetics\nassessment (AIAA), we first introduce a large-scale AIAA dataset: Boldbrush\nArtistic Image Dataset (BAID), which consists of 60,337 artistic images\ncovering various art forms, with more than 360,000 votes from online users. We\nthen propose a new method, SAAN (Style-specific Art Assessment Network), which\ncan effectively extract and utilize style-specific and generic aesthetic\ninformation to evaluate artistic images. Experiments demonstrate that our\nproposed approach outperforms existing IAA methods on the proposed BAID dataset\naccording to quantitative comparisons.

In pebble accretion, planets grow\nby accreting from a flux of solids (pebbles) that radially drift inwards from\nthe pebble production front. If external photoevaporation truncates the outer\ndisc fast enough, it can shorten the time before the pebble production front\nreaches the disc outer edge, cutting off the supply of pebble flux for\naccretion, hence limiting the pebble mass reservoir for planet growth.\nConversely, cloud shielding can protect the disc from strong external\nphotoevaporation and preserve the pebble reservoir. Because grain growth and\ndrift can occur quickly, shielding even on a short time-scale (<1 Myr) can have\na non-linear impact on the properties of planets growing by pebble accretion.\nFor example a $10^{-3} M_\\oplus$ planetary seed at 25 au stays at 25 au with a\nlunar mass if the disc is immediately irradiated by a $10^3$ G$_0$ field, but\ngrows and migrates to be approximately Earth-like in both mass and orbital\nradius if the disc is shielded for just 1 Myr.

A new attention-based interpretability method\ncalled CLaSsification-Attention (CLS-A) is proposed. CLS-A computes an\ninterpretability score for each word based on the attention coefficient\ndistribution related to the part specific to the classification task within the\nTransformer architecture. A human-grounded experiment is conducted to evaluate\nand compare CLS-A to other interpretability methods. The experimental protocol\nrelies on the capacity of an interpretability method to provide explanation in\nline with human reasoning. Experiment design includes measuring reaction times\nand correct response rates by human subjects. CLS-A performs comparably to\nusual interpretability methods regarding average participant reaction time and\naccuracy. The lower computational cost of CLS-A compared to other\ninterpretability methods and its availability by design within the classifier\nmake it particularly interesting. Data analysis also highlights the link\nbetween the probability score of a classifier prediction and adequate\nexplanations.

The composition of these tails offers an avenue for studying the\ncomposition of rocky exoplanets, but only if the evolution of the underlying\ninterior is understood. This is because it is the interior evolution that sets\nthe composition at the base of the mass outflow. In this work, we present a\nmodel of the evolution of the interiors of catastrophically evaporating\nplanets. Its basis is a one-dimensional code that takes into account energy\nflow through conduction and convection as well as melting. We find that these\nplanets are likely to be entirely solid when significant mass loss occurs,\nother than a thin magma pool on the day side. Consequently, the outflows from\nthe planets, and thus the dust tails, sample material only from the surface of\nthe planet.

As an\nArecibo population, many or most of the objects tend to fall in the Galactic\nanticenter region and/or at high Galactic latitudes, so overall it includes a\nnumber of nearer, older pulsars.

In addition, ME and missing\ndata are typically treated as two separate problems, despite practical and\ntheoretical similarities. Here, we exploit the fact that missing data in a\ncontinuous covariate is an extreme case of classical ME, allowing us to use\nexisting methodology that accounts for ME via a Bayesian framework that employs\nintegrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA), and thus to simultaneously\naccount for both ME and missing data in the same covariate.

For a given Riemann matrix\n$\\mathbb{B}\\in\\mathbb{H}^{g}$, the Fay identity establishes linear dependence\nof secants in the Kummer variety if and only if the Riemann matrix corresponds\nto a Jacobian variety as shown by Krichever. The theta functions in terms of\nwhich these secants are expressed depend on the Abel maps of four arbitrary\npoints on a Riemann surface. However, there is no concept of an Abel map for\ngeneral $\\mathbb{B} \\in \\mathbb{H}^{g}$. To establish linear dependence of the\nsecants, four components of the vectors entering the theta functions can be\nchosen freely. The remaining components are determined by a Newton iteration to\nminimize the residual of the Fay identity. Krichever's theorem assures that if\nthis residual vanishes within the finite numerical precision for a generic\nchoice of input data, then the Riemann matrix is with this numerical precision\nthe period matrix of a Riemann surface. The algorithm is compared in genus 4\nfor some examples to the Schottky-Igusa modular form, known to give the Jacobi\nlocus in this case. It is shown that the same residuals are achieved by the\nSchottky-Igusa form and the approach based on the Fay identity in this case.

Various\ntypes of slow fluctuators in the Josephson junctions and the passive parts of\nthese superconducting circuits can be the cause, and devices usually suffer\nfrom a combination of different noise sources, which are hard to disentangle\nand therefore hard to eliminate. One contribution is magnetic 1/f noise caused\nby fluctuating magnetic moments of magnetic impurities or dangling bonds in\nsuperconducting inductances, surface oxides, insulating oxide layers, and\nadsorbates.

A series of recent studies\nsuggested that there is a significant correlation between the standardized\nluminosity and the progenitor age of SNe Ia. The correlation found in the most\nrecent work by Lee et al. is strong enough to explain the extra dimming of\ndistant SNe Ia, and therefore casts doubts on the direct evidence of cosmic\nacceleration. The present work improves the previous work by incorporating the\nuncertainties of progenitor ages, which were ignored in Lee et al., into a\nfully Bayesian inference framework. We find a weaker dependence of supernova\nstandardized luminosity on the progenitor age, but the detection of correlation\nremains significant (3.3$\\sigma$). Assuming that such correlation can be\nextended to high redshift and applying it to the Pantheon SN Ia data set, we\nfind that the correlation cannot be the primary cause of the observed extra\ndimming of distant SNe Ia. Further more, we use the PAge formalism, which is a\ngood approximation to many dark energy and modified gravity models, to do a\nmodel comparison. The concordance Lambda cold dark matter model remains a good\nfit when the progenitor-age dependence of SN Ia luminosity is corrected. The\nbest-fit parameters, however, are in $\\sim 2\\sigma$ tension with the standard\nvalues inferred from cosmic microwave background observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 14:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

The proposed method sparsely aggregates keypoint features in a\ncascaded manner based on prior knowledge of the data structure (which is\ninherent in skeletons), such as the instances and frames to which each keypoint\nbelongs, and achieves robustness against input errors.

One potential solution is to leverage unlabeled data (e.g.,\nunlabeled LiDAR point clouds) collected from the end-users' environments (i.e.\ntarget domain) to adapt the system to the difference between training and\ntesting environments. While extensive research has been done on such an\nunsupervised domain adaptation problem, one fundamental problem lingers: there\nis no reliable signal in the target domain to supervise the adaptation process.\nTo overcome this issue we observe that it is easy to collect unsupervised data\nfrom multiple traversals of repeated routes. While different from conventional\nunsupervised domain adaptation, this assumption is extremely realistic since\nmany drivers share the same roads. We show that this simple additional\nassumption is sufficient to obtain a potent signal that allows us to perform\niterative self-training of 3D object detectors on the target domain.\nConcretely, we generate pseudo-labels with the out-of-domain detector but\nreduce false positives by removing detections of supposedly mobile objects that\nare persistent across traversals. Further, we reduce false negatives by\nencouraging predictions in regions that are not persistent. We experiment with\nour approach on two large-scale driving datasets and show remarkable\nimprovement in 3D object detection of cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, bringing\nus a step closer to generalizable autonomous driving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 15:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

In this paper, we deploy the dual semantic-visual\ntransformer module (DSVTM) to progressively model the correspondences between\nattribute prototypes and visual features, constituting a progressive\nsemantic-visual mutual adaption (PSVMA) network for semantic disambiguation and\nknowledge transferability improvement.

However, this assumption is unrealistic as an individual's\ninfectiousness depends on its viral load and varies over time. In this paper,\nwe present a SIRVS epidemic model incorporating non-Markovian infection\nprocesses. The model can be easily adapted to accurately capture the generation\ntime distributions of emerging infectious diseases, which is essential for\naccurate epidemic prediction. We observe noticeable variations in the transient\nbehavior under different infectiousness profiles and the same basic\nreproduction number R0. The theoretical analyses show that only R0 and the mean\nimmunity period of the vaccinated individuals have an impact on the critical\nvaccination rate needed to achieve herd immunity. A vaccination level at the\ncritical vaccination rate can ensure a relatively low incidence among the\npopulation in case of future epidemics, regardless of the infectiousness\nprofiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 15:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

In this\npaper we provide an optimal procedure for simulating general message passing in\nthe beeping and noisy beeping models. We show that a round of \\textsf{Broadcast\nCONGEST} can be simulated in $O(\\Delta\\log n)$ round of the noisy (or\nnoiseless) beeping model, and a round of \\textsf{CONGEST} can be simulated in\n$O(\\Delta^2\\log n)$ rounds (where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the\nnetwork). We also prove lower bounds demonstrating that no simulation can use\nasymptotically fewer rounds.\n  This allows a host of graph algorithms to be efficiently implemented in\nbeeping models. As an example, we present an $O(\\log n)$-round\n\\textsf{Broadcast CONGEST} algorithm for maximal matching, which, when\nsimulated using our method, immediately implies a near-optimal $O(\\Delta \\log^2\nn)$-round maximal matching algorithm in the noisy beeping model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 15:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

To be specific,\nEPSL parallelizes client-side model training and reduces the dimension of local\ngradients for back propagation (BP) via last-layer gradient aggregation,\nleading to a significant reduction in server-side training and communication\nlatency. Moreover, by considering the heterogeneous channel conditions and\ncomputing capabilities at client devices, we jointly optimize subchannel\nallocation, power control, and cut layer selection to minimize the per-round\nlatency. Simulation results show that the proposed EPSL framework significantly\ndecreases the training latency needed to achieve a target accuracy compared\nwith the state-of-the-art benchmarks, and the tailored resource management and\nlayer split strategy can considerably reduce latency than the counterpart\nwithout optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2023 16:09:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 07:04:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 09:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

In order to promote\nfairer, juster, and more transparent uses of such decision-making power,\nexplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to provide insights into the\nlogic of algorithmic decision-making. Despite much research on the topic,\nconsumer-facing applications of XAI remain rare. A central reason may be that a\nviable platform-based monetization strategy for this new technology has yet to\nbe found. We introduce and describe a novel monetization strategy for fusing\nalgorithmic explanations with programmatic advertising via an explanation\nplatform. We claim the explanation platform represents a new,\nsocially-impactful, and profitable form of human-algorithm interaction and\nestimate its potential for revenue generation in the high-risk domains of\nfinance, hiring, and education. We then consider possible undesirable and\nunintended effects of monetizing XAI and simulate these scenarios using\nreal-world credit lending data. Ultimately, we argue that monetizing XAI may be\na double-edged sword: while monetization may incentivize industry adoption of\nXAI in a variety of consumer applications, it may also conflict with the\noriginal legal and ethical justifications for developing XAI. We conclude by\ndiscussing whether there may be ways to responsibly and democratically harness\nthe potential of monetized XAI to provide greater consumer access to\nalgorithmic explanations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 15:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

However, the label scarcity problem is a main\nchallenge in this field, which limits the wide application of EEG-based emotion\nrecognition. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning\nframework (EEGMatch) to leverage both labeled and unlabeled EEG data. First, an\nEEG-Mixup based data augmentation method is developed to generate more valid\nsamples for model learning. Second, a semi-supervised two-step pairwise\nlearning method is proposed to bridge prototype-wise and instance-wise pairwise\nlearning, where the prototype-wise pairwise learning measures the global\nrelationship between EEG data and the prototypical representation of each\nemotion class and the instance-wise pairwise learning captures the local\nintrinsic relationship among EEG data. Third, a semi-supervised multi-domain\nadaptation is introduced to align the data representation among multiple\ndomains (labeled source domain, unlabeled source domain, and target domain),\nwhere the distribution mismatch is alleviated. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on two benchmark databases (SEED and SEED-IV) under a cross-subject\nleave-one-subject-out cross-validation evaluation protocol. The results show\nthe proposed EEGmatch performs better than the state-of-the-art methods under\ndifferent incomplete label conditions (with 6.89% improvement on SEED and 1.44%\nimprovement on SEED-IV), which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed\nEEGMatch in dealing with the label scarcity problem in emotion recognition\nusing EEG signals.

Therefore, a\nrecently developed full-field single fiber hygro-expansion measurement\nmethodology based on global digital height correlation is extended to\northogonally bonded inter-fiber bonds, to investigate their full-field quasi-3D\nhygroscopic behavior. A sample holder has been developed which enables the\nquasi-3D characterization of the initial geometry of individual inter-fiber\nbonds, including the fiber thickness and width along the length of the fibers\nas well as the degree of wrap around and contact area of the bond, which are\nvital for understanding the inter-fiber bond hygro-mechanics. Full-field\nhygroscopic testing revealed novel insights on the inter-fiber interactions:\n(i) the transverse hygro-expansion of each fiber strongly reduces when\napproaching the bonded area, due to the significantly lower longitudinal\nhygro-expansion of the other bonded fiber. (ii) The relatively large transverse\nstrain of one fiber stretches the other crossing fiber in its longitudinal\ndirection, thereby significantly contributing to the sheet scale\nhygro-expansion. (iii) Out-of-plane bending is observed in the bonded region\nwhich is driven by the significant difference in transverse and longitudinal\nhygro-expansion of, respectively, the top and bottom fiber constituting the\nbond. A bi-layer laminate model is derived to rationalize the bending\ndeformation and an adequate match is found with the experimental data. Under\nthe assumption of zero bending, which represents constrained inter-fiber bonds\ninside a paper sheet, the model is able to predict the contribution of the\ntransverse strain in the bonded regions to the sheet-scale hygro-expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2023 22:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Astronomers typically classify galaxies based on\ntheir morphologies, a practice that dates back to Hubble (1936). With small\ndatasets, classification could be performed by individuals or small teams, but\nthe exponential growth of data from modern telescopes necessitates automated\nclassification methods.\n  In December 2013, Winton Capital, Galaxy Zoo, and the Kaggle team created the\nGalaxy Challenge, which tasked participants with developing models to classify\ngalaxies.

A\nminimal hyperparameter search ensures optimal results. Our findings indicate\nthat using transformed colour spaces in individual networks yields higher\nvalidation accuracy, and ensembles of networks and colour spaces further\nimprove accuracy.\n  This research aims to validate the utility of colour space transformation for\nastronomical image classification and serve as a benchmark for future studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2023 17:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}
