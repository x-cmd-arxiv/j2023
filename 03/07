The algorithm can be used to fit noiseless data, which can be\nuseful for instance when attempting to derive an analytical property of a\nphysical model, and it can also be used to obtain analytical approximations to\nnoisy data.

Unfortunately, recent\nstudies have indeed shown significant biases in DL models across demographic\nsubgroups (e.g., race, sex, age) in the context of medical image analysis,\nindicating a lack of fairness in the models. Although several methods have been\nproposed in the ML literature to mitigate a lack of fairness in DL models, they\nfocus entirely on the absolute performance between groups without considering\ntheir effect on uncertainty estimation. In this work, we present the first\nexploration of the effect of popular fairness models on overcoming biases\nacross subgroups in medical image analysis in terms of bottom-line performance,\nand their effects on uncertainty quantification. We perform extensive\nexperiments on three different clinically relevant tasks: (i) skin lesion\nclassification, (ii) brain tumour segmentation, and (iii) Alzheimer's disease\nclinical score regression. Our results indicate that popular ML methods, such\nas data-balancing and distributionally robust optimization, succeed in\nmitigating fairness issues in terms of the model performances for some of the\ntasks. However, this can come at the cost of poor uncertainty estimates\nassociated with the model predictions. This tradeoff must be mitigated if\nfairness models are to be adopted in medical image analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 16:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

We aim to identify the optimal locations of the enhanced X-ray emission\nand absorption arising from cluster-filament interactions, as well as improve\nour understanding of the various physical processes affecting the WHIM as it\napproaches the cluster. We applied the DisPerSE filament finder to the galaxy\ndistribution in the surroundings of a Coma-like ($M_{200} \\sim 10^{15.4}~{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$) simulated C-EAGLE galaxy cluster. We characterised the\nthermodynamic properties of the gas in such filaments as well as their\ndependence on distance from the cluster, and provided a physical interpretation\nfor the results.

The filament gas is in\napproximate free-fall all the way down to $\\sim 2 \\ r_{200}$ from the cluster,\nat which stage it begins to slow down due to the increasing pressure of the\nambient gas.

It unifies the terminology of VPR and complements prior research\nin two important directions: 1) It provides a systematic introduction for\nnewcomers to the field, covering topics such as the formulation of the VPR\nproblem, a general-purpose algorithmic pipeline, an evaluation methodology for\nVPR approaches, and the major challenges for VPR and how they may be addressed.\n2) As a contribution for researchers acquainted with the VPR problem, it\nexamines the intricacies of different VPR problem types regarding input, data\nprocessing, and output. The tutorial also discusses the subtleties behind the\nevaluation of VPR algorithms, e.g., the evaluation of a VPR system that has to\nfind all matching database images per query, as opposed to just a single match.\nPractical code examples in Python illustrate to prospective practitioners and\nresearchers how VPR is implemented and evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 16:52:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Thomassen showed that\none can check in polynomial time whether a given graph has a 2-strong\norientation. This implies that for a given digraph $D$ we can determine in\npolynomial time whether we can reorient (=reverse) some arcs of $D=(V,A)$ to\nobtain a 2-strong digraph $D'=(V,A')$. This naturally leads to the question of\ndetermining the minimum number of such arcs to reverse before the resulting\ngraph is 2-strong. In this paper we show that finding this number is NP-hard.\n  If a 2-connected graph $G$ has no 2-strong orientation, we may ask how many\nof its edges we may orient so that the resulting mixed graph is still 2-strong.\nSimilarly, we may ask for a 2-edge-connected graph $G$ how many of its edges we\ncan orient such that the resulting mixed graph remains 2-arc-strong. We prove\nthat when restricted to graphs satisfying suitable connectivity conditions,\nboth of these problems are equivalent to finding the minimum number of edges we\nmust double in a 2-edge-connected graph in order to obtain a 4-edge-connected\ngraph. Using this, we show that all these three problems are NP-hard.\n  Finally, we consider the operation of deorienting an arc $uv$ of a digraph\n$D$ meaning replacing it by an undirected edge between the same vertices. In\nterms of connectivity properties, this is equivalent to adding the opposite arc\n$vu$ to $D$.

Many such\nmethods aim to map distinct views of the same scene or object to nearby points\nin the representation space, while employing some constraint to prevent\nrepresentational collapse. Here we recast the problem in terms of efficient\ncoding by adopting manifold capacity, a measure that quantifies the quality of\na representation based on the number of linearly separable object manifolds it\ncan support, as the efficiency metric to optimize. Specifically, we adapt the\nmanifold capacity for use as an objective function in a contrastive learning\nframework, yielding a Maximum Manifold Capacity Representation (MMCR). We apply\nthis method to unlabeled images, each augmented by a set of basic\ntransformations, and find that it learns meaningful features using the standard\nlinear evaluation protocol. Specifically, we find that MMCRs support\nperformance on object recognition comparable to or surpassing that of recently\ndeveloped SSL frameworks, while providing more robustness to adversarial\nattacks. Empirical analyses reveal differences between MMCRs and\nrepresentations learned by other SSL frameworks, and suggest a mechanism by\nwhich manifold compression gives rise to class separability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 17:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

In the modern quantum era, with Noisy Intermediate Scale\nQuantum~(NISQ) simulators widely available and larger-scale quantum machines on\nthe horizon, it is natural to ask: what non-perturbative QFT problems can be\nsolved with the existing quantum hardware? We show that existing noisy quantum\nmachines can be used to analyze the energy spectrum of a large family of\nstrongly-interacting 1+1D QFTs. The latter exhibit a wide-range of\nnon-perturbative effects like `quark confinement' and `false vacuum decay'\nwhich are typically associated with higher-dimensional QFTs of elementary\nparticles. We perform quench experiments on IBM's ibmq_mumbai quantum simulator\nto compute the energy spectrum of 1+1D quantum Ising model with a longitudinal\nfield. The latter model is particularly interesting due to the formation of\nmesonic bound states arising from a confining potential for the Ising\ndomain-walls, reminiscent of t'Hooft's model of two-dimensional quantum\nchromodynamics.

No significant spatial\nor temporal correlation of neutrinos with the cataloged supernovae was found.\nThe overall deviation of all tested scenarios from the background expectation\nyields a p-value of 93% which is fully compatible with background. The derived\nupper limits on the total energy emitted in neutrinos are $1.7\\times 10^{48}$\nerg for stripped-envelope supernovae, $2.8\\times 10^{48}$ erg for type IIP, and\n$1.3\\times 10^{49}$ erg for type IIn SNe, the latter disfavouring models with\noptimistic assumptions for neutrino production in interacting supernovae. We\nconclude that strippe-envelope supernovae and supernovae of type IIn do not\ncontribute more than $14.6\\%$ and $33.9\\%$ respectively to the diffuse neutrino\nflux in the energy range of about $10^3-10^5$ GeV, assuming that the neutrino\nenergy spectrum follows a power-law with an index of $-2.5$. Under the same\nassumption, we can only constrain the contribution of type IIP SNe to no more\nthan $59.9\\%$. Thus core-collapse supernovae of types IIn and stripped-envelope\nsupernovae can both be ruled out as the dominant source of the diffuse neutrino\nflux under the given assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 17:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

PSD is essential in\nmixed radiation fields, where different types of radiation need to be detected\nand discriminated.

Every set of CVRs that produces the\nsame aggregate results overstates contest margins by the same amount: they are\noverstatement-net-equivalent (ONE). CLCAs can therefore use CVRs from the\nvoting system for any number of cards and ONE CVRs for the rest. Ballot-polling\nRLAs are equivalent to CLCAs using ONE CVRs. CLCAs can be based on batch-level\nresults (e.g., precinct subtotals) by constructing ONE CVRs for each batch. In\ncontrast to batch-level comparison audits (BLCAs), this avoids tabulating\nbatches manually and works even when reporting batches do not correspond to\nphysically identifiable batches of cards. If the voting system can export\nlinked CVRs for only some ballot cards, auditors can still use CLCA by\nconstructing ONE CVRs for the rest of the cards from contest results or batch\nsubtotals.

The presence\nof slap images in a real-world dataset where one or more fingerprints are\nrotated makes it challenging for a biometric recognition system to localize and\nlabel the fingerprints automatically. Improper fingerprint localization and\nfinger labeling errors lead to poor matching performance. In this paper, we\nintroduce a method to generate arbitrary angled bounding boxes using a deep\nlearning-based algorithm that precisely localizes and labels fingerprints from\nboth axis-aligned and over-rotated slap images.

To operate in such environments,\nrobots must have robust obstacle avoidance and versatile goal conditioning\nacquired from only a few simple demonstrations. Existing approaches, however,\nfall short of these requirements. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) enables a\nrobot to learn complex manipulation tasks but is often limited to small task\nspaces in the real world due to sample inefficiency and safety concerns. Motion\nplanning (MP) can generate collision-free paths in obstructed environments, but\ncannot solve complex manipulation tasks and requires goal states often\nspecified by a user or object-specific pose estimator.

Specifically, OCGM enables one-shot target object identification\nand re-identification in new scenes, allowing MP to guide the robot to the\ntarget object while avoiding obstacles. This is combined with a skill\ntransition network, which bridges the gap between terminal states of MP and\nfeasible start states of a sample-efficient RL policy.

Most previous SGRL models face\ncomputational issues associated with the high cost of extracting subgraphs for\neach training or testing query. Recently, SUREL has been proposed as a new\nframework to accelerate SGRL, which samples random walks offline and joins\nthese walks as subgraphs online for prediction. Due to the reusability of\nsampled walks across different queries, SUREL achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both scalability and prediction accuracy. However, SUREL still\nsuffers from high computational overhead caused by node redundancy in sampled\nwalks. In this work, we propose a novel framework SUREL+ that upgrades SUREL by\nusing node sets instead of walks to represent subgraphs. This set-based\nrepresentation avoids node duplication by definition, but the sizes of node\nsets can be irregular. To address this issue, we design a dedicated sparse data\nstructure to efficiently store and fast index node sets, and provide a\nspecialized operator to join them in parallel batches. SUREL+ is modularized to\nsupport multiple types of set samplers, structural features, and neural\nencoders to complement the loss of structural information due to the reduction\nfrom walks to sets. Extensive experiments have been performed to validate\nSUREL+ in the prediction tasks of links, relation types, and higher-order\npatterns.

In this work, we assess the rates of standard total TDEs,\ndestroying the entire star, and partial TDEs, in which a stellar remnant\nsurvives the interaction, by solving 1-D Fokker-Planck equations. Our rate\nestimates are based on a novel definition of the loss cone whose size is\ncommensurate to the largest radius at which partial disruptions can occur, as\nmotivated by relativistic hydrodynamical simulations. Our novel approach\nunveils two important results. First, partial TDEs can be more abundant than\ntotal disruptions by a factor of a few to a few tens. Second, the rates of\ncomplete stellar disruptions can be overestimated by a factor of a few to a few\ntens if one neglects partial TDEs, as we find that many of the events\nclassified at total disruptions in the standard framework are in fact partial\nTDEs. Accounting for partial TDEs is particularly relevant for galaxies\nharbouring a nuclear stellar cluster featuring many events coming from the\nempty loss cone. Based on these findings, we stress that partial disruptions\nshould be considered when constraining the luminosity function of TDE flares;\naccounting for this may reconcile the theoretically estimated TDE rates with\nthe observed ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

By combining them with archival data, we analyze high-cadence\nultra-violet, optical, and near-infrared light curves spanning from early\npre-peak ($\\sim -20\\,d$) to late phases ($\\sim +300\\,d$). We obtain its most\ncomplete bolometric light curve, in which multiple bumps are identified. None\nof the previously proposed models can satisfactorily explain all main\nlight-curve features, while multiple interactions between the ejecta and\ncircumstellar material (CSM) may explain the undulating features. The prominent\ninfrared excess with a blackbody luminosity of $10^7$--$10^8\\,L_{sun}$ detected\nin SN~2017egm could originate from the emission of either an echo of a\npre-existing dust shell, or newly-formed dust, offering an additional piece of\nevidence supporting the ejecta-CSM interaction model. Moreover, our analysis of\ndeep $Chandra$ observations yields the tightest-ever constraint on the X-ray\nemission of an SLSN-I, amounting to an X-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio\n$\\lesssim 10^{-3}$ at late phases ($\\sim100-200\\,d$), which could help explore\nits close environment and central engine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 19:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Each of two memories, connected by an optical channel, emits\na photonic qubit entangled with itself, and the photonic qubits undergo an\nentanglement swap on a beamsplitter in the middle of the channel. We compare\ntwo choices of encoding of the photonic qubit: the single rail and dual rail.\nIn the regime of low channel loss, i.e., when the loss of the half-channel\nconnecting one memory site to the swap site is less than $\\approx 6$ dB, the\ndual-rail scheme is seen to outperform the single rail scheme. The high-loss\nrate asymptote for the dual rail scheme is worse: it scales as $O(\\eta)$ ebits\nper transmitted photonic mode, as opposed to $O(\\sqrt{\\eta})$ for the\nsingle-rail scheme, where $\\sqrt{\\eta}$ is the transmissivity of the half\nchannel. Considering the following non-idealities: imperfect mode matching at\nthe swap, carrier-phase mismatch across the interfered photonic qubits from the\ntwo sides, and detector excess noise, we evaluate the explicit density operator\nof the heralded two-qubit entangled state. We calculate a lower bound on its\ndistillable entanglement per copy, and its Fidelity (with the ideal Bell\nstate). Imperfect swap-visibility results in a constant-factor decrease in the\nrate, while excess noise results in a sharp dropoff of distillable entanglement\nbeyond a certain total channel loss threshold to zero. Despite the single-rail\nscheme's better rate-loss scaling, it is more severely affected by excess\nnoise, and is adversely affected by stochastic carrier-phase mismatch.

Independent\nof origin, such dust traps should be stable for many orbits to collect\nsignificant dust. However, ring-like perturbations in gas disks are also known\nto trigger the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI). We investigate whether\naxisymmetric pressure bumps can simultaneously trap dust and remain stable to\nthe RWI. The answer depends on the thermodynamic properties of pressure bumps.\nFor isothermal bumps, dust traps are RWI-stable for widths from ${\\sim}1$ to\nseveral gas scale-heights.

The well-known Closure\nLemma proved by Bondy and Chv\\'atal states that a graph $G$ is Hamiltonian if\nand only if its closure $G^*$ is. This lemma can be used to prove several\nclassical results in Hamiltonian graph theory. We prove a version of the\nClosure Lemma for tough graphs. A graph $G$ is $t$-tough if for any set $S$ of\nvertices of $G$, the number of components of $G-S$ is at most $t |S|$. A\nHamiltonian graph must necessarily be 1-tough. Conversely, Chv\\'atal\nconjectured that there exists a constant $t$ such that every $t$-tough graph is\nHamiltonian. The {\\it $t$-closure} of a graph $G$ is the graph $G^{t*}$\nobtained from $G$ by repeatedly adding edges between pairs of non-adjacent\nvertices whose degree sum is at least $n-t$. We prove that, for $t\\geq 2$, a\n$\\frac{3t-1}{2}$-tough graph $G$ is Hamiltonian if and only if its $t$-closure\n$G^{t*}$ is.

Specifically, the paper makes the key observation that for serverless\nfunctions, the overhead of accessing dissaggregated persistent storage\novershadows the gains from accelerators.

While our method has a\nconvergence rate that is slightly sub-optimal compared to the idealized method,\nit is directly compatible with real-world applications. Moreover, we prove\nanalytically that these new algorithms are globally well-posed, and converge to\nthe true solution exponentially fast in time. In addition, we provide the first\n3D computational validation of HOT algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 21:06:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

We present three\ndistinct examples of the evolution of the norm $|R_{nl}(t,r_{*})|$ in terms of\n$t$, and four different results are shown for the parameter $l=1,2,5,10$; here\n$r_{*}$ is the fixed radius of an observer outside the compact object. In all\ncases, the decay behaviour is actually present at $t\\gg 1$ and becomes more\nevident for larger $l$. In addition, for the results that have smaller $l$'s\ntheir amplitudes are larger when the asymptotic character of\n$|R_{nl}(t,r_{*})|$ clearly appears.

High Mass\nRatio Contact Binaries, especially those in the weak-contact configuration are\nvital while probing into the evolutionary models of CBs using stellar\nparameters. The photometric solutions reveal the weak-contact nature of V2840\nCygni with a high mass ratio ($\\sim1.36$), motivating us to investigate the\nnature of such binaries. The period variation study of V2840 Cygni spanning for\n15 years shows a secular period decrease at a rate of\n$\\sim5.5\\times10^{-7}$d/yr indicating mass transfer between the components. The\nsuperimposed cyclic variation provides a basic understanding of the possible\nthird body (P$_3$ $\\sim8$ yr, m$_3$ $\\sim0.51$M$_\\odot$). Following the derived\nparameters, the evolution of the system is discussed based on Thermal\nRelaxation Oscillation (TRO) model. It is found that V2840 Cygni falls in a\nspecial category of HMRCBs, that validates TRO. To characterise the nature of\nHMRCBs, a catalog of 59 CBs with high mass ratios has been compiled along with\ntheir derived parameters from the literature. For all the HMRCBs in the study,\na possible correlation between their contact configuration and observed period\nvariations for relative log\\emph{J$_{rel}$} is discussed. The spectroscopic\nstudy of V2840 Cygni provides evidence of the presence of magnetic activity in\nthe system and the existence of ongoing mass transfer which is additionally\ndeduced from the period variation study. The LAMOST spectra of 17 HMRCBs are\ncollected to interpret the stellar magnetic activity in such systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 21:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

The associated momentum\nmap is the electromagnetic memory in the abelian theory, or a nonlinear,\ngauge-equivariant, generalization thereof in the nonabelian case.\n  This result follows from an application of Hamiltonian reduction by stages,\nenabled by the existence of a natural normal subgroup of the gauge group on a\nnull codimension-1 submanifold with boundaries. The first stage is coisotropic\nreduction of the Gauss constraint, and it yields a symplectic extension of the\nAshtekar-Streubel phase space (up to a covering). Hamiltonian reduction of the\nresidual gauge action leads to the fully-reduced phase space of the theory.\nThis is a Poisson manifold, whose symplectic leaves, called superselection\nsectors, are labelled by the (gauge classes of the generalized) electric flux\nacross the boundary.\n  In this framework, the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space arises as an\nintermediate reduction stage that enforces the superselection of the electric\nflux at only one of the two boundary components. These results provide a\nnatural, purely Hamiltonian, explanation of the existence of soft symmetries as\na byproduct of partial symplectic reduction, as well as a motivation for the\nexpected decomposition of the quantum Hilbert space of states into irreducible\nrepresentations labelled by the Casimirs of the Poisson structure on the\nreduced phase space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 22:37:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 08:15:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 14:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

While some of these devices perform\nmission-critical tasks, they are usually implemented using Micro-Controller\nUnits (MCUs) that lack security mechanisms on par with those available to\ngeneral-purpose computers, making them more susceptible to remote exploits that\ncould corrupt their software integrity. Motivated by this problem, prior work\nhas proposed techniques to remotely assess the trustworthiness of embedded MCU\nsoftware. Among them, Control Flow Attestation (CFA) enables remote detection\nof runtime abuses that illegally modify the program's control flow during\nexecution.\n  Despite these advances, current CFA methods share a fundamental limitation:\nthey preclude interrupts during the execution of the software operation being\nattested.

In addition, TIMS integrates haptic guidance to `guide'\nthe trainees to follow a desired trajectory provided by expert surgeons.\nLearning from demonstration based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) was used\nto generate the desired trajectory. User studies were also conducted to verify\nthe effectiveness of our proposed TIMS, comparing users' performance with and\nwithout tactile feedback and/or haptic guidance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 00:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

This paper\nstudies sparse (less than full-dimensional) Borel sets in $\\mathbb R^d$, $d\n\\geq 2$ with a focus on properties of their distance sets. Our results are of\nfour types. First, we generalize a classical result of Steinhaus (1920) to\nBorel sets $E \\subseteq [0,1]^d$ with $s$-dimensional Hausdorff content larger\nthan $(1 - \\rho)$, for small $\\rho > 0$ and $s$ close to $d$. For such sets, we\nshow that $\\Delta(E) \\supseteq [a, b]$, where $0<a<b$ depend only on $d$ and\n$\\rho$. This leads to our second result, a quantitative formulation of a\ntheorem of Mattila and Sj$\\ddot{\\text{o}}$lin (1999). For an arbitrary Borel\nset $E \\subseteq [0,1]^d$ of large Hausdorff dimension, we show that\n$\\Delta(E)$ contains a union of intervals whose lengths are dictated by cubes\nwhere $E$ holds high density. This structure theorem in turn yields a tool for\nidentifying abundance of distances; this is the third contribution of this\narticle. It allows us to formulate a size property of a set that guarantees all\nsufficiently large distances, generalizing earlier work of Bourgain (1986). It\ncan also be used to construct examples of totally disconnected sparse sets with\nthis property. Finally, we explore special features of $\\Delta(E)$ if $E$ is\nassumed to have certain structural regularity in addition to large Hausdorff\ndimension. The additional regularity is harnessed via $L^2$-Fourier asymptotics\nof measures supported on $E$. Applications of this phenomenon give new\ninformation on $\\Delta(E)$ when $E$ is locally uniformly $s$-dimensional and\nquasi-regular, in the terminology of Strichartz (1990). A number of new\nexamples, counterexamples and open problems are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 00:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

However, a comprehensive understanding of how this order\narises remains largely unknown. This knowledge gap may be attributed, in part,\nto a scarcity of mechanistic models that can capture the temporal progression\nof the complex nonequilibrium dynamics during the cellular alignment process.\nTo fill in this gap, we develop a hybrid procedure that utilizes statistical\nlearning approaches to select individual-level features for extending the\nstate-of-art physics models.

Recent advanced multi-modal methods mainly perform global fusion,\nwhere image features and point cloud features are fused across the whole scene.\nSuch practice lacks fine-grained region-level information, yielding suboptimal\nfusion performance. In this paper, we present the novel Local-to-Global fusion\nnetwork (LoGoNet), which performs LiDAR-camera fusion at both local and global\nlevels.

As the net charge is integer discrete, the\nmethod provides nearly completely accurate measurements of nanoparticles with\nfew charges. The result can be applied to improve the measurement accuracy for\nmass and density through iteration and this method provides a way toward\nnon-contact characterization of aerology, space dust, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 02:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

With the prevalent deployment of the Industrial\nInternet of Things (IIoT), an enormous amount of time series data is collected\nto facilitate machine learning models for anomaly detection, and it is of the\nutmost importance to directly deploy the trained models on the IIoT devices.\nHowever, it is most challenging to deploy complex deep learning models such as\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on these memory-constrained IIoT devices\nembedded with microcontrollers (MCUs). To alleviate the memory constraints of\nMCUs, we propose a novel framework named Tiny Anomaly Detection (TinyAD) to\nefficiently facilitate onboard inference of CNNs for real-time anomaly\ndetection. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of depthwise separable\nCNNs and regular CNNs for anomaly detection and find that the depthwise\nseparable convolution operation can reduce the model size by 50-90% compared\nwith the traditional CNNs. Then, to reduce the peak memory consumption of CNNs,\nwe explore two complementary strategies, in-place, and patch-by-patch memory\nrescheduling, and integrate them into a unified framework. The in-place method\ndecreases the peak memory of the depthwise convolution by sparing a temporary\nbuffer to transfer the activation results, while the patch-by-patch method\nfurther reduces the peak memory of layer-wise execution by slicing the input\ndata into corresponding receptive fields and executing in order. Furthermore,\nby adjusting the dimension of convolution filters, these strategies apply to\nboth univariate time series and multidomain time series features. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world industrial datasets show that our framework can\nreduce peak memory consumption by 2-5x with negligible computation overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 02:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

As an essential operator, \"insertion operator\" has been\nextensively studied over static road networks. When a new request appears, the\ninsertion operator is used to find the optimal positions of a worker's current\nroute to insert the origin and destination of this request and minimize the\ntravel time of this worker. Previous works study how to conduct the insertion\noperation efficiently in static road networks, however, in reality, the route\nplanning should be addressed by considering the dynamic traffic scenario (i.e.,\na time-dependent road network). Unfortunately, existing solutions to the\ninsertion operator become in efficient under this setting. Thus, this paper\nstudies the insertion operator over time-dependent road networks. Specially, to\nreduce the high time complexity $O(n^3)$ of existing solution, we calculate the\ncompound travel time functions along the route to speed up the calculation of\nthe travel time between vertex pairs belonging to the route, as a result time\ncomplexity of an insertion can be reduced to $O(n^2)$.

In the fast emergence phase of the AR, the shearing gradually\noccurred due to the proper motions of the polarities, but no significant\ncollision occurred due to the parallel arrangement of the bipoles. Nor did the\nlarge eruption occur. After the fast emergence, one large positive polarity\nstarted decay. Its dispersion led to the collision to a negative polarity which\nbelonged to another bipole. A huge hot channel was formed through precursor\nflarings around the collision region. The hot channel erupted later,\naccompanied by an M7.3-class flare. The results suggest that in the spot-spot\ntype AR, along with the shearing induced by the proper motions of the\npolarities, a decay process may lead to the collision of the polarities,\ndriving the subsequent eruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 03:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

However, most existing methods are still\nchallenged by heavy compute cost and biased filter selection. Moreover, most\ndesigns for filter evaluation miss interpretability due to the lack of\nappropriate theoretical guidance. In this paper, we propose a novel filter\npruning method which evaluates filters in a interpretable, multi-persepective\nand data-free manner. We introduce information capacity, a metric that\nrepresents the amount of information contained in a filter. Based on the\ninterpretability and validity of information entropy, we propose to use that as\na quantitative index of information quantity. Besides, we experimently show\nthat the obvious correlation between the entropy of the feature map and the\ncorresponding filter, so as to propose an interpretable, data-driven scheme to\nmeasure the information capacity of the filter. Further, we introduce\ninformation independence, another metric that represents the correlation among\ndifferrent filters. Consequently, the least impotant filters, which have less\ninformation capacity and less information independence, will be pruned.

For the discretized, algebraic eigenproblems we use\nboth the Rayleigh quotient (RQ) iteration and implicitly restarted Arnoldi\n(IRA), providing an analysis of the cost in each case.

Recent studies reveal that the traditional\nCross-Entropy (CE) loss function is insufficient to learn transferable targeted\nadversarial examples due to the issue of vanishing gradient. In this work, we\nprovide a comprehensive investigation of the CE loss function and find that the\nlogit margin between the targeted and untargeted classes will quickly obtain\nsaturation in CE, which largely limits the transferability. Therefore, in this\npaper, we devote to the goal of continually increasing the logit margin along\nthe optimization to deal with the saturation issue and propose two simple and\neffective logit calibration methods, which are achieved by downscaling the\nlogits with a temperature factor and an adaptive margin, respectively.

However, in reality, the travel costs of road segments evolve over\ntime, and hence the road network can be modeled as a time-dependent graph. In\nthis paper, we study the shortest path query over large-scale time-dependent\nroad networks. Existing work focuses on a hierarchical partition structure,\nwhich makes the index construction and travel cost query inefficient. To\nimprove the efficiency of such queries, we propose a novel index by decomposing\na road network into a tree structure and selecting a set of shortcuts on the\ntree to speed up the query processing. Specifically, we first formally define a\nshortcut selection problem over the tree decomposition of the time-dependent\nroad network. This problem, which is proven to be NP-hard, aims to select and\nbuild the most effective shortcut set. We first devise a dynamic programming\nmethod with exact results to solve the selection problem. To obtain the optimal\nshortcut set quickly, we design an approximation algorithm that guarantees a\n0.5-approximation ratio. Based on the novel tree structure, we devise a\nshortcut-based algorithm to answer the shortest path query over time-dependent\nroad networks. Finally, we conduct extensive performance studies using\nlarge-scale real-world road networks.

Thus, source-free DAOD is proposed to\nadapt the source-trained detectors to target domains with only unlabeled target\ndata. Existing source-free DAOD methods typically utilize pseudo labeling,\nwhere the performance heavily relies on the selection of confidence threshold.\nHowever, most prior works adopt a single fixed threshold for all classes to\ngenerate pseudo labels, which ignore the imbalanced class distribution,\nresulting in biased pseudo labels. In this work, we propose a refined pseudo\nlabeling framework for source-free DAOD. First, to generate unbiased pseudo\nlabels, we present a category-aware adaptive threshold estimation module, which\nadaptively provides the appropriate threshold for each category. Second, to\nalleviate incorrect box regression, a localization-aware pseudo label\nassignment strategy is introduced to divide labels into certain and uncertain\nones and optimize them separately.

The nonreciprocal transport\nreported to date occurs along the longitudinal direction with the nonreciprocal\nresistance limited to a few percent of the ohmic resistance. Here we report a\ntransverse nonreciprocal transport phenomenon with divergent nonreciprocity -\ncolossal nonreciprocal Hall effect. This is revealed in direct current (DC)\ntransport measurements on microscale crystals of the Weyl semimetal NbP at zero\nmagnetic field. When a DC ($I_a$) is applied along its a-axis, it generates a\nvoltage along the c-axis ($V_c$) near room temperature, with $V_c$\nquadratically scaling with $I_a$. The transverse resistance, which shows a sign\nreversal upon switching the current direction, results from a colossal\nintrinsic nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) rooted in the band topology and quantum\nsymmetry. Such a NLHE yields an exceptionally large Hall angle ${\\Theta_H}$,\ne.g. ${\\Theta_H}$ = 39{\\deg} at $I_a$ =1 mA at 330K, far exceeding the record\nvalue (~ 12{\\deg}) of the anomalous Hall angle at room temperature in magnetic\nconductors. Furthermore, we find the large Hall field also results in an\nunprecedented bulk electrical field effect, which increases the longitudinal\nconductivity, thus causing the breakdown of Ohm's law. These results not only\ndemonstrate the concept of nonreciprocal Hall effect for the first time but\nalso pave the way for developing NLHE-based quantum sensors for transformative\nadvancement in communication technology and energy harvesting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 08:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

However, existing approaches that use\ntransformers to attend to all tokens naively can overlook the dependencies\nbetween different tokens and limit long-term dependency learning.

This problem is common in real-world applications, particularly in\ncases where the function is assessed by human judges. Reinforcement Learning\nwith Human Feedback (RLHF) is a prominent example of such an application, which\nis adopted by the recent works\n\\cite{ouyang2022training,liu2023languages,chatgpt,bai2022training} to improve\nthe quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human guidance. We propose\nZO-RankSGD, a first-of-its-kind zeroth-order optimization algorithm, to solve\nthis optimization problem with a theoretical guarantee. Specifically, our\nalgorithm employs a new rank-based random estimator for the descent direction\nand is proven to converge to a stationary point. ZO-RankSGD can also be\ndirectly applied to the policy search problem in reinforcement learning when\nonly a ranking oracle of the episode reward is available. This makes ZO-RankSGD\na promising alternative to existing RLHF methods, as it optimizes in an online\nfashion and thus can work without any pre-collected data. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of ZO-RankSGD in a novel application: improving\nthe quality of images generated by a diffusion generative model with human\nranking feedback. Throughout experiments, we found that ZO-RankSGD can\nsignificantly enhance the detail of generated images with only a few rounds of\nhuman feedback. Overall, our work advances the field of zeroth-order\noptimization by addressing the problem of optimizing functions with only\nranking feedback, and offers an effective approach for aligning human and\nmachine intentions in a wide range of domains.

Our answer is to focus on two types of patterns, i.e.,\n''regimes'' and ''components'', for which we present CubeScope, an efficient\nand effective method over high-order tensor streams.

We demonstrate that thermalisation starting from a general\nstate is accompanied by a persistent non-zero mean rate of change of the\nenvironmental component of stochastic entropy production. This thermodynamic\nsignature can be associated with the purification of the reduced density matrix\n$\\rho$ of the randomly evolving state, to be contrasted with the impurity of\nthe more often considered ensemble average of $\\rho$. The system adopts\nstationary statistics, with zero stochastic entropy production, once purity has\nbeen achieved. However, we show that apparent pathological mathematical\ndifficulties in the computation of stochastic entropy production emerge if\n$\\rho$ is represented using a certain set of coordinates, though these can be\nremoved by choosing a different set.

Scalar-tensor gravity (STG) theories are well-motivated alternatives\nto general relativity (GR). One class of STG theories, the\nDamour-Esposito-Farese (DEF) gravity, has a massless scalar field with two\narbitrary coupling parameters. We are interested in this theory because,\ndespite its simplicity, it predicts a wealth of different phenomena, such as\ndipolar gravitational wave emission and spontaneous scalarization of neutron\nstars (NSs). These phenomena of DEF gravity can be tested by timing binary\nradio pulsars. Aims. We aim to develop a new binary pulsar timing model DDSTG\nto enable more precise tests of STG theories based on a minimal set of binary\nparameters. The expressions for post-Keplerian (PK) parameters in DEF gravity\nare self-consistently incorporated into the model. The new technique takes into\naccount all possible correlations between PK parameters naturally. Methods.\nGrids of physical parameters of NSs are calculated in the framework of DEF\ngravity for a set of 11 equations of state. The automatic Differentiation\n(AutoDiff) technique is employed, which aids in the calculation of\ngravitational form factors of NSs with higher precision than in previous works.\nThe pulsar timing program TEMPO is selected as a framework for the realization\nof the DDSTG model. The implemented model is applicable to any type of pulsar\ncompanions. Results. We apply the DDSTG model to the most recently published\nobservational data for PSR J2222-0137. The obtained limits on DEF gravity\nparameters for this system confirm and improve previous results. New limits are\nalso the most reliable because DEF gravity is directly fitted to the data. We\nargue that future observations of PSR J2222-0137 can significantly improve the\nlimits and that PSR-BH systems have the potential to place the tightest limits\nin certain areas of the DEF gravity parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 11:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

Most state-of-the-art event-based\nmethods project events into dense frames and process them with conventional\nlearning models. However, these approaches sacrifice the sparsity and high\ntemporal resolution of event data, resulting in a large model size and high\ncomputational complexity. To fit the sparse nature of events and sufficiently\nexplore the relationship between them, we develop a novel attention-aware model\nnamed Event Voxel Set Transformer (EVSTr) for spatiotemporal representation\nlearning on event streams. It first converts the event stream into voxel sets\nand then hierarchically aggregates voxel features to obtain robust\nrepresentations. The core of EVSTr is an event voxel transformer encoder to\nextract discriminative spatiotemporal features, which consists of two\nwell-designed components, including a Multi-Scale Neighbor Embedding Layer\n(MNEL) for local information aggregation and a Voxel Self-Attention Layer\n(VSAL) for global feature interactions.

We evaluate the\nproposed model on two event-based recognition tasks: object classification and\naction recognition.

For\nsuch studies, the fundamental issue is to determine whether a given system\nthermalizes or not. However, most studies tested only a small number of\nobservables, and it was unclear whether other observables thermalize. Here, we\nstudy whether `linear thermalization' occurs for all additive observables: We\nconsider a quantum many-body system prepared in an equilibrium state and its\nunitary time evolution induced by a small change $\\Delta f$ of a physical\nparameter $f$ of the Hamiltonian, and examine whether all additive observables\nrelax to the equilibrium values in a manner fully consistent with\nthermodynamics up to the linear order in $\\Delta f$. We find that there exists\na single key observable whose linear thermalization guarantees, under\nphysically reasonable conditions, linear thermalization of all additive\nobservables. Such a linear thermalization occurs in the timescale of\n$\\mathcal{O}(|\\Delta f|^0)$, and lasts at least for a period of\n$o(1/\\sqrt{|\\Delta f|})$. We identify the key observable as the additive\nobservable conjugate to $f$. We also consider linear thermalization against the\nchange of other parameters, and find that linear thermalization of the key\nobservable against $\\Delta f$ guarantees its linear thermalization against\nsmall changes of any other parameters. Furthermore, we discuss the generalized\nsusceptibilities for cross responses and their consistency between quantum\nmechanics and thermodynamics.

Although only the model parameters or\nother model updates are exchanged during the federated training instead of the\nparticipant's data, many attacks have shown that it is still possible to infer\nsensitive information such as membership, property, or outright reconstruction\nof participant data. Although differential privacy is considered an effective\nsolution to protect against privacy attacks, it is also criticized for its\nnegative effect on utility. Another possible defense is to use secure\naggregation which allows the server to only access the aggregated update\ninstead of each individual one, and it is often more appealing because it does\nnot degrade model quality. However, combining only the aggregated updates,\nwhich are generated by a different composition of clients in every round, may\nstill allow the inference of some client-specific information.\n  In this paper, we show that simple linear models can effectively capture\nclient-specific properties only from the aggregated model updates due to the\nlinearity of aggregation. We formulate an optimization problem across different\nrounds in order to infer a tested property of every client from the output of\nthe linear models, for example, whether they have a specific sample in their\ntraining data (membership inference) or whether they misbehave and attempt to\ndegrade the performance of the common model by poisoning attacks. Our\nreconstruction technique is completely passive and undetectable. We demonstrate\nthe efficacy of our approach on several scenarios which shows that secure\naggregation provides very limited privacy guarantees in practice.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel network that addresses the challenge of segmenting\nmoving objects in 3D LiDAR scans. Our approach not only predicts point-wise\nmoving labels but also detects instance information of main traffic\nparticipants. Such a design helps determine which instances are actually moving\nand which ones are temporarily static in the current scene. Our method exploits\na sequence of point clouds as input and quantifies them into 4D voxels. We use\n4D sparse convolutions to extract motion features from the 4D voxels and inject\nthem into the current scan. Then, we extract spatio-temporal features from the\ncurrent scan for instance detection and feature fusion. Finally, we design an\nupsample fusion module to output point-wise labels by fusing the\nspatio-temporal features and predicted instance information.

We first\nobserve that the medium anisotropy introduces a difference between the rates\nfor transverse momentum broadening along the two directions perpendicular to\nthe jet axis. In turn, this difference leads to a polarisation-dependent bias\nin the BDMPS-Z rates for medium-induced gluon branching. Accordingly, the\ndaughter gluons in a branching process can carry net polarisation even if their\nparent gluon was unpolarised. Using these splitting rates, we construct kinetic\nequations which describe the production and transmission of polarisation via\nmultiple branching in an anisotropic medium. The solutions to these equations\nshow that polarisation is efficiently produced via quasi-democratic branchings,\nbut then it is rapidly washed out by the subsequent branchings, due to the\ninability of soft gluons to keep trace of the polarisation of their parents.\nBased on that, we conclude that a net polarisation for the jet should survive\nin the final state if and only if the medium anisotropy is sizeable as the jet\nescapes the medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 14:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

Among them, dynorphin coexpressed in kisspeptin (KP) neurons of\nthe arcuate nucleus (ARC) has been thoroughly studied for its autocrine effect\non KP release through $\\kappa$ opioid receptors. Other studies have suggested a\nrole for $\\beta$-endorphin (BEND), a peptide cleaved from the\nproopiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor, on food intake and central control of\nreproduction. Similarly to KP, BEND content in the ARC of sheep is modulated by\nday length and BEND modulates food intake in a dose-dependent manner. As KP\nlevels in the ARC vary with photoperiodic and metabolic status, a\nphotoperiod-driven influence of BEND neurons on neighboring KP neurons is\nplausible. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate a possible\nmodulatory action of BEND on KP neurons located in the ovine ARC. Using\nconfocal microscopy, numerous KP appositions on BEND neurons were found but\nthere was no photoperiodic variation in the number of these interactions in\novariectomized, estradiol-replaced ewes. In contrast, BEND terminals on KP\nneurons were twice as numerous under short days (SD), in ewes having an\nactivated gonadotropic axis, as compared to anestrus ewes under long days (LD).\nInjection of 5$\\mu$g BEND into the third ventricle of SD ewes induced a\nsignificant and specific increase of activated KP neurons (16% versus 9% in\ncontrols) while the percentage of overall activated (c-Fos positive) neurons,\nwas similar between both groups. These data suggest a photoperiod-dependent\ninfluence of BEND on KP neurons of the ARC, which may influence GnRH pulsatile\nsecretion and inform KP neurons on the metabolic status.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 14:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

Using this\nconstrained neural network to represent the variational wave function, we solve\nSchrodinger equations using auto-differentiation and stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD), by minimizing the violation of the trial wave function $\\psi(x)$\nto the Schrodinger equation. For several classical problems in quantum\nmechanics, we obtain their ground state wave function and energy with very low\nerrors. The method developed in the present paper may pave a new way in solving\nnuclear many body problems in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 14:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

A natural question to ask is: How much more sample efficiency can\nbe gained by improving the learned dynamics models? Our paper empirically\nanswers this question for the class of model-based value expansion methods in\ncontinuous control problems. Value expansion methods should benefit from\nincreased model accuracy by enabling longer rollout horizons and better value\nfunction approximations. Our empirical study, which leverages oracle dynamics\nmodels to avoid compounding model errors, shows that (1) longer horizons\nincrease sample efficiency, but the gain in improvement decreases with each\nadditional expansion step, and (2) the increased model accuracy only marginally\nincreases the sample efficiency compared to learned models with identical\nhorizons. Therefore, longer horizons and increased model accuracy yield\ndiminishing returns in terms of sample efficiency. These improvements in sample\nefficiency are particularly disappointing when compared to model-free value\nexpansion methods. Even though they introduce no computational overhead, we\nfind their performance to be on-par with model-based value expansion methods.\nTherefore, we conclude that the limitation of model-based value expansion\nmethods is not the model accuracy of the learned models.

We specifically address the useless and needless, but ubiquitous use\nof determinants, characteristic polynomials and polynomial root finding methods\nthat are propagated in our elementary text books and are used in the majority\nof our elementary Linear Algebra classes for the matrix eigenvalue problem but\nthat have no practical use whatsoever and offer no solution for finding matrix\neigenvalues. This paper challenges all mathematicians as we have misinformed\nand miseducated our students badly for decades in elementary Linear Algebra now\nand urges a switch to a new, fully matrix theoretical approach that covers all\nclassical subjects in a practical and computable way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 15:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

In this work, we systematize the study of\ncontent moderation in E2EE settings. We set out a process pipeline for content\nmoderation, drawing on a broad interdisciplinary literature that is not\nspecific to E2EE. We examine cryptography and policy design choices at all\nstages of this pipeline, and we suggest areas of future research to fill gaps\nin literature and better understand possible paths forward.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 15:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

The choreography can then be automatically compiled (projected) to a\ncorrect implementation for each participant.\n  Choreographic programming relieves the programmer from manually writing the\nseparate send and receive actions performed by participants and avoids the\nproblem of communication mismatches. However, the applicability of this\nparadigm in the real world remains largely unexplored for two reasons. First,\nwhile there have been several proposals of choreographic programming languages,\nnone of them have been used to implement a realistic, widely-used protocol.\nThus there is a lack of experience on how realistic choreographic programs are\nstructured and on the relevance of the features explored in theoretical models.\nSecond, applications of choreographic programming shown so far are intrusive\nsince each participant must use exactly the code projected from the\nchoreography. This prevents using the projected code with existing third-party\nimplementations of some participants.\n  We carry out the first development in choreographic programming of a\nwidespread real-world protocol: the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol. Our\ndevelopment is based on Choral, an object-oriented choreographic programming\nlanguage. Two of Choral's features are key to our implementation: higher-order\nchoreographies for modelling the complex interaction patterns due to IRC's\nasynchronous nature; and user-definable communication semantics for achieving\ninteroperability with third-party implementations.

Standard, single-star evolutionary models predict that WR\nstars should stem from very massive O-type star progenitors, but these are very\nrare. On the other hand, binary evolutionary models predict that WR stars could\noriginate from primary stars in close binaries. We conduct an analysis of the\nmassive O star, AzV 14, to spectroscopically determine its fundamental and\nstellar wind parameters, which are then used to investigate evolutionary paths\nfrom the O-type to the WR stage with stellar evolutionary models. Multi-epoch\nUV and optical spectra of AzV 14 are analyzed using the non-LTE stellar\natmosphere code PoWR. An optical TESS light curve was extracted and analyzed\nusing the PHOEBE code. The obtained parameters are put into an evolutionary\ncontext, using the MESA code. AzV 14 is a close binary system consisting of two\nsimilar main sequence stars with masses of 32 Msol. Both stars have weak\nstellar winds with mass-loss rates of log $\\dot{M}$ = -7.7. Binary evolutionary\nmodels can explain the empirically derived stellar and orbital parameters. The\nmodel predicts that the primary will evolve into a WR star with T = 100 kK,\nwhile the secondary, which will accrete significant amounts of mass during the\nfirst mass transfer phase, will become a cooler WR star with T = 50 kK and are\npredicted to have compared to other WR stars increased oxygen abundances. This\nmodel prediction is supported by a spectroscopic analysis of a WR star in the\nSMC. We hypothesize that the populations of WR stars in low-Z galaxies may have\nbimodal temperature distributions. Hotter WR stars might originate from primary\nstars, while cooler WR stars are the evolutionary descendants of the secondary\nstars if they accreted a significant amount of mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 15:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

In addition, we analysed\ncomplementary photometric time series for the most variable stars to be able to\nprovide a broader view of the long-term variability in M dwarfs. We find that\nmost stars are significantly variable, even the quietest stars. Most stars in\nour sample (75%) exhibit a long-term variability, which manifests itself mostly\nthrough linear or quadratic variability, although the true behaviour may be\nmore complex. We found significant variability with estimated timescales for 24\nstars, and estimated the lower limit for a possible cycle period for an\nadditional 9 stars that were not previously published. We found evidence of\ncomplex variability because more than one long-term timescale may be present\nfor at least 12 stars, together with significant differences between the\nbehaviour of the three activity indices. This complexity may also be the source\nof the discrepancies observed between previous publications. We conclude that\nlong-term variability is present for all spectral types and activity level in M\ndwarfs, without a significant trend with spectral type or mean activity level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 15:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

It is difficult to diagnose and\ncontinues to be underdiagnosed. Because depressed patients constantly share\ntheir symptoms, major life events, and treatments on social media, researchers\nare turning to user-generated digital traces on social media for depression\ndetection. Such methods have distinct advantages in combating depression\nbecause they can facilitate innovative approaches to fight depression and\nalleviate its social and economic burden. However, most existing studies lack\neffective means to incorporate established medical domain knowledge in\ndepression detection or suffer from feature extraction difficulties that impede\ngreater performance. Following the design science research paradigm, we propose\na Deep Knowledge-aware Depression Detection (DKDD) framework to accurately\ndetect social media users at risk of depression and explain the critical\nfactors that contribute to such detection. Extensive empirical studies with\nreal-world data demonstrate that, by incorporating domain knowledge, our method\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work has significant\nimplications for IS research in knowledge-aware machine learning, digital\ntraces utilization, and NLP research in IS. Practically, by providing early\ndetection and explaining the critical factors, DKDD can supplement clinical\ndepression screening and enable large-scale evaluations of a population's\nmental health status.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 20:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

However, it is noticed that there are many features that are not\nhighly associated with semantics, and EditGAN may fail on them. Based on the\northogonality of latent space observed by EditGAN, we propose a method to\nestimate editing vectors that do not rely on semantic segmentation nor\ndifferentiable feature estimation network. Our method assumes that there is a\ncorrelation between the intensity distribution of features and the distribution\nof hidden vectors, and estimates the relationship between the above\ndistributions by sampling the feature intensity of the image corresponding to\nseveral hidden vectors.

We then found\nthat this method has a good effect in processing features such as clothing type\nand texture, skin color and hair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 08:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}
