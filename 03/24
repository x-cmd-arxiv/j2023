Under the coupling effects of\nbending and torsion, the traditional damage detection method based on the Euler\nbeam theory cannot be applied. In this research, the box girder section is\ndivided into different components based on the plate element analysis method.\nThe strain responses were preprocessed based on Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) method to remove the influence of train operation variation. The residual\nerror of autoregressive (AR) model was used as a potential index of damage\nfeatures. The optimal order of the model was determined based on Bayesian\ninformation criterion (BIC) criterion. Finally, the confidence boundary (CB) of\ndamage features (DF) constituting outliers can be estimated by Gaussian inverse\ncumulative distribution function (ICDF). The numerical simulation results show\nthat the proposed method in this paper can effectively identify, locate and\nquantify the damage, which verifies the accuracy of the proposed method. The\nproposed method effectively identifies the early damage of all components on\nthe key section by using four strain sensors, and it is helpful for developing\neffective maintenance strategies for high-speed railway box girder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 16:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

Specifically, we propose a\ndeep contextual multi-armed bandit-based approach, which combines the\nrepresentational power of neural networks with the action exploration behavior\nof Thompson modeling algorithms. We compare our approach to several baselines,\nand show that our deep bandit models also succeed in reducing early cutoff\nerrors while maintaining low latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 16:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

How robust are these detection algorithms to\nparaphrases of AI-generated text? To stress test these detectors, we first\ntrain an 11B parameter paraphrase generation model (DIPPER) that can paraphrase\nparagraphs, optionally leveraging surrounding text (e.g., user-written prompts)\nas context. DIPPER also uses scalar knobs to control the amount of lexical\ndiversity and reordering in the paraphrases. Paraphrasing text generated by\nthree large language models (including GPT3.5-davinci-003) with DIPPER\nsuccessfully evades several detectors, including watermarking, GPTZero,\nDetectGPT, and OpenAI's text classifier. For example, DIPPER drops the\ndetection accuracy of DetectGPT from 70.3% to 4.6% (at a constant false\npositive rate of 1%), without appreciably modifying the input semantics. To\nincrease the robustness of AI-generated text detection to paraphrase attacks,\nwe introduce a simple defense that relies on retrieving semantically-similar\ngenerations and must be maintained by a language model API provider. Given a\ncandidate text, our algorithm searches a database of sequences previously\ngenerated by the API, looking for sequences that match the candidate text\nwithin a certain threshold. We empirically verify our defense using a database\nof 15M generations from a fine-tuned T5-XXL model and find that it can detect\n80% to 97% of paraphrased generations across different settings, while only\nclassifying 1% of human-written sequences as AI-generated.

They typically\nadopt the cross-attention in ViT for direct domain alignment. However, as the\nperformance of cross-attention highly relies on the quality of pseudo labels\nfor targeted samples, it becomes less effective when the domain gap becomes\nlarge. We solve this problem from a game theory's perspective with the proposed\nmodel dubbed as PMTrans, which bridges source and target domains with an\nintermediate domain. Specifically, we propose a novel ViT-based module called\nPatchMix that effectively builds up the intermediate domain, i.e., probability\ndistribution, by learning to sample patches from both domains based on the\ngame-theoretical models. This way, it learns to mix the patches from the source\nand target domains to maximize the cross entropy (CE), while exploiting two\nsemi-supervised mixup losses in the feature and label spaces to minimize it. As\nsuch, we interpret the process of UDA as a min-max CE game with three players,\nincluding the feature extractor, classifier, and PatchMix, to find the Nash\nEquilibria. Moreover, we leverage attention maps from ViT to re-weight the\nlabel of each patch by its importance, making it possible to obtain more\ndomain-discriminative feature representations. We conduct extensive experiments\non four benchmark datasets, and the results show that PMTrans significantly\nsurpasses the ViT-based and CNN-based SoTA methods by +3.6% on Office-Home,\n+1.4% on Office-31, and +17.7% on DomainNet, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 16:56:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 04:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

We put forward novel designs on\nhow best to achieve this synergy, for both the category setting and the\nfine-grained setting (\"all\"). At the very core of our solution is a prompt\nlearning setup. First we show just via factoring in sketch-specific prompts, we\nalready have a category-level ZS-SBIR system that overshoots all prior arts, by\na large margin (24.8%) - a great testimony on studying the CLIP and ZS-SBIR\nsynergy. Moving onto the fine-grained setup is however trickier, and requires a\ndeeper dive into this synergy. For that, we come up with two specific designs\nto tackle the fine-grained matching nature of the problem: (i) an additional\nregularisation loss to ensure the relative separation between sketches and\nphotos is uniform across categories, which is not the case for the gold\nstandard standalone triplet loss, and (ii) a clever patch shuffling technique\nto help establishing instance-level structural correspondences between\nsketch-photo pairs.

This is likely due to practical\nlimitations, such as significant computational burden, inscrutable policy\narchitectures, sensitivity to parameter initializations, and the considerable\ntechnical expertise required for implementation. In this work, we investigate\nthe utility of Koopman operator theory in alleviating these limitations.\nKoopman operators are simple yet powerful control-theoretic structures that\nhelp represent complex nonlinear dynamics as linear systems in\nhigher-dimensional spaces. Motivated by the fact that complex nonlinear\ndynamics underlie dexterous manipulation, we develop an imitation learning\nframework that leverages Koopman operators to simultaneously learn the desired\nbehavior of both robot and object states. We demonstrate that a Koopman\noperator-based framework is surprisingly effective for dexterous manipulation\nand offers a number of unique benefits. First, the learning process is\nanalytical, eliminating the sensitivity to parameter initializations and\npainstaking hyperparameter optimization. Second, the learned reference dynamics\ncan be combined with a task-agnostic tracking controller such that task changes\nand variations can be handled with ease. Third, a Koopman operator-based\napproach can perform comparably to state-of-the-art imitation learning\nalgorithms in terms of task success rate and imitation error, while being an\norder of magnitude more computationally efficient.

This\nis a question raised by El-Zahar and Erd\\H{o}s in 1986, and remains open. If\nso, then at least there should be two anticomplete subgraphs both with large\nminimum degree, and that is one of our results.\n  We prove two variants of this.

We show\nthat using proxies allows a wide variety of editing options, such as adjusting\nthe placement of each independent object, removing objects from a scene, or\nrefining an object.

However, most research has focused on systems that can support a\n\\emph{single} searcher. In this paper, we explore how systems can support\n\\emph{multiple} searchers collaborating over an instant messaging platform\n(i.e., Slack). We present a ``Wizard of Oz'' study in which 27 participant\npairs collaborated on three information-seeking tasks over Slack. Participants\nwere unable to search on their own and had to gather information by interacting\nwith a \\emph{searchbot} directly from the Slack channel. The role of the\nsearchbot was played by a reference librarian. Conversational search systems\nmust be capable of engaging in \\emph{mixed-initiative} interaction by taking\nand relinquishing control of the conversation to fulfill different objectives.\nDiscourse analysis research suggests that conversational agents can take\n\\emph{two} levels of initiative: dialog- and task-level initiative. Agents take\ndialog-level initiative to establish mutual belief between agents and\ntask-level initiative to influence the goals of the other agents. During the\nstudy, participants were exposed to three experimental conditions in which the\nsearchbot could take different levels of initiative: (1) no initiative, (2)\nonly dialog-level initiative, and (3) both dialog- and task-level initiative.\nIn this paper, we focus on understanding the Wizard's actions. Specifically, we\nfocus on understanding the Wizard's motivations for taking initiative and their\nrationale for the timing of each intervention. To gain insights about the\nWizard's actions, we conducted a stimulated recall interview with the Wizard.\nWe present findings from a qualitative analysis of this interview data and\ndiscuss implications for designing conversational search systems to support\ncollaborative search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 17:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

Previous work by Bolander et al. (2016) proposes a\nmodel of attention based on dynamic epistemic logic (DEL) where agents are\neither fully attentive or not attentive at all. While introducing the realistic\nfeature that inattentive agents believe nothing happens, the model does not\nrepresent the most essential aspect of attention: its selectivity. Here, we\npropose a generalization that allows for paying attention to subsets of atomic\nformulas. We introduce the corresponding logic for propositional attention, and\nshow its axiomatization to be sound and complete. We then extend the framework\nto account for inattentive agents that, instead of assuming nothing happens,\nmay default to a specific truth-value of what they failed to attend to (a sort\nof prior concerning the unattended atoms). This feature allows for a more\ncognitively plausible representation of the inattentional blindness phenomenon,\nwhere agents end up with false beliefs due to their failure to attend to\nconspicuous but unexpected events. Both versions of the model define\nattention-based learning through appropriate DEL event models based on a few\nand clear edge principles. While the size of such event models grow\nexponentially both with the number of agents and the number of atoms, we\nintroduce a new logical language for describing event models syntactically and\nshow that using this language our event models can be represented linearly in\nthe number of agents and atoms.

Recently, there have been surging needs to generate customized\nimages by inverting diffusion models from exemplar images.

In this work, we propose ReVersion for the Relation Inversion task,\nwhich aims to learn a specific relation (represented as \"relation prompt\") from\nexemplar images. Specifically, we learn a relation prompt from a frozen\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. The learned relation prompt can then\nbe applied to generate relation-specific images with new objects, backgrounds,\nand styles. Our key insight is the \"preposition prior\" - real-world relation\nprompts can be sparsely activated upon a set of basis prepositional words.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel relation-steering contrastive learning scheme\nto impose two critical properties of the relation prompt: 1) The relation\nprompt should capture the interaction between objects, enforced by the\npreposition prior. 2) The relation prompt should be disentangled away from\nobject appearances. We further devise relation-focal importance sampling to\nemphasize high-level interactions over low-level appearances (e.g., texture,\ncolor).

The Stiefel manifold is a space of orthogonal frames, and\nleveraging the numerical stability and efficiency of Stiefel-manifold\noptimization enables us to compute the flag-mean effectively. Through a series\nof experiments, we show the competence of our method in Grassmann and rotation\naveraging, as well as principal component analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 17:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

We\nintroduce a new pre-trained video model, VideoTaskformer, focused on\nrepresenting the semantics and structure of instructional videos. We pre-train\nVideoTaskformer using a simple and effective objective: predicting weakly\nsupervised textual labels for steps that are randomly masked out from an\ninstructional video (masked step modeling). Compared to prior work which learns\nstep representations locally, our approach involves learning them globally,\nleveraging video of the entire surrounding task as context. From these learned\nrepresentations, we can verify if an unseen video correctly executes a given\ntask, as well as forecast which steps are likely to be taken after a given\nstep. We introduce two new benchmarks for detecting mistakes in instructional\nvideos, to verify if there is an anomalous step and if steps are executed in\nthe right order. We also introduce a long-term forecasting benchmark, where the\ngoal is to predict long-range future steps from a given step. Our method\noutperforms previous baselines on these tasks, and we believe the tasks will be\na valuable way for the community to measure the quality of step\nrepresentations. Additionally, we evaluate VideoTaskformer on 3 existing\nbenchmarks -- procedural activity recognition, step classification, and step\nforecasting -- and demonstrate on each that our method outperforms existing\nbaselines and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 17:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

To address this issue, we\nintroduce SCADE, a novel technique that improves NeRF reconstruction quality on\nsparse, unconstrained input views for in-the-wild indoor scenes. To constrain\nNeRF reconstruction, we leverage geometric priors in the form of per-view depth\nestimates produced with state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models,\nwhich can generalize across scenes. A key challenge is that monocular depth\nestimation is an ill-posed problem, with inherent ambiguities.

From this, we\nare able to constrain the size, Lorentz factor, and internal energy of the\noutflow while providing accurate predictions for the location of the peak\nfrequency of the reverse shock in the first few hours after the burst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 18:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

The standard nonparametric\nbootstrap is unable to consistently approximate the large sample distribution\nof the generalized Grenander-type estimators even if the monomial order of the\nmean is known, making statistical inference a challenging endeavour in\napplications.

It has been long known that Mg has high hardening and low\nductility, and this was conventionally attributed to the scarce of active\npyramidal slip. Recently immobilization of pyramidal dislocations was proposed\nto be the origins. Here we present a different scenario that has hitherto never\nbeen reported for Mg: mobile screw pyramidal dislocations double cross-slip and\ncontinue to double cross-slip as they glide, generating abundant vacancy\nclusters on the slipped planes. These vacancy clusters hinder subsequent\ndislocation motion and thus directly result in hardening; their accumulation as\nplastic deformation proceeds eventually causes premature fracture, i.e.\nbrittleness. The massive damage accompanying pyramidal slip discovered here\nprovides a different explanation for the long known hardening and brittleness\nof Mg, and suggests that sufficient amount of pyramidal dislocations could\nstill be insufficient to effectively accommodate plasticity. Stabilizing\npyramidal dislocation motion to avoid cross-slip and subsequent damage\ngeneration is also essential for property-improvement. The instability of\npyramidal slip, manifested as continuous cross-slip here (could be different\nelsewhere), originates from its huge Burgers vector and could be a common\nfeature of its kind. The detailed cross-slip mechanism also provides insights\ninto the poorly known instabilities and complicated behavior of dislocations in\na broader range of crystals with low symmetry and/or large Burgers vectors,\nincluding other hcp metals and ceramics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 18:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

It is now well understood that\nthe shape of a surface is determined by measuring how curved it is at each\npoint. From these measurements, one can identify the directions of largest and\nsmallest curvature, i.e. the principal curvatures, and construct two surface\ninvariants by taking the average and the product of the principal curvatures.\nThe product of the principal curvatures describes the intrinsic curvature of a\nsurface, and has profound importance in differential geometry - evidenced by\nthe Gauss's Theorema Egregium and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. This curvature is\ncommonly referred to as the Gaussian Curvature after Carl Friedrich Gauss,\nfollowing his significant contributions to the emerging field of differential\ngeometry in his 1828 work. The average, or mean curvature, is an extrinsic\nmeasure of the shape of a surface - that is, the shape must be embedded in a\nhigher dimensional space to be measured. Beginning in 1811, and culminating in\nefforts in 1821 and 1826, the mathematician Sophie Germain identified the mean\ncurvature as the appropriate measure for describing the shape of vibrating\nplates. Her hypothesis leads directly to the equations describing the behavior\nof thin, elastic plates. In letters to Gauss, she described her notion of a\n\"sphere of mean curvature\" that can be identified at each point on the surface.\nThis contribution stimulated a period of rapid development in elasticity and\ngeometry, and yet Germain has not yet received due credit for deducing the\nmathematical and physical significance of mean curvature.

We demonstrate the\nperformance of this estimator in low dimensional simulations, on a synthetic\nimage classification on MNIST data, and apply the methods to an application\nusing satellite measurements of the earth's magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 19:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

The\ndetection of such Botnets is complicated by the fact that multiple network IP\naddresses will be simultaneously compromised, so that Collective Classification\nof compromised nodes, in addition to the already available traditional methods\nthat focus on individual nodes, can be useful. Thus this work introduces a\ncollective Botnet attack classification technique that operates on traffic from\nan n-node IP network with a novel Associated Random Neural Network (ARNN) that\nidentifies the nodes which are compromised. The ARNN is a recurrent\narchitecture that incorporates two mutually associated, interconnected and\narchitecturally identical n-neuron random neural networks, that act\nsimultneously as mutual critics to reach the decision regarding which of n\nnodes have been compromised.

We address this gap by first developing tools to\nfind hate communities within Reddit, and then augment 11 subreddits extracted\nwith 14 known hateful subreddits (25 in total). Using causal inference methods,\nwe evaluate the effect of replies on engagement in hateful subreddits by\ncomparing users who receive replies to their first comment (the treatment) to\nequivalent control users who do not. We find users who receive replies are less\nlikely to become engaged in hateful subreddits than users who do not, while the\nopposite effect is observed for a matched sample of similar-sized non-hateful\nsubreddits.

In this\npaper, we present random-effects substitution models that extend common\ncontinuous-time Markov chain models into a richer class of processes capable of\ncapturing a wider variety of substitution dynamics. As these random-effects\nsubstitution models often require many more parameters than their usual\ncounterparts, inference can be both statistically and computationally\nchallenging. Thus, we also propose an efficient approach to compute an\napproximation to the gradient of the data likelihood with respect to all\nunknown substitution model parameters. We demonstrate that this approximate\ngradient enables scaling of both sampling-based (Bayesian inference via HMC)\nand maximization-based inference (MAP estimation) under random-effects\nsubstitution models across large trees and state-spaces.

This is because collecting 3D interacting hands data in\nthe wild is extremely challenging, even for the 2D data. We present InterWild,\nwhich brings MoCap and ITW samples to shared domains for robust 3D interacting\nhands recovery in the wild with a limited amount of ITW 2D/3D interacting hands\ndata. 3D interacting hands recovery consists of two sub-problems: 1) 3D\nrecovery of each hand and 2) 3D relative translation recovery between two\nhands. For the first sub-problem, we bring MoCap and ITW samples to a shared 2D\nscale space. Although ITW datasets provide a limited amount of 2D/3D\ninteracting hands, they contain large-scale 2D single hand data. Motivated by\nthis, we use a single hand image as an input for the first sub-problem\nregardless of whether two hands are interacting. Hence, interacting hands of\nMoCap datasets are brought to the 2D scale space of single hands of ITW\ndatasets. For the second sub-problem, we bring MoCap and ITW samples to a\nshared appearance-invariant space. Unlike the first sub-problem, 2D labels of\nITW datasets are not helpful for the second sub-problem due to the 3D\ntranslation's ambiguity. Hence, instead of relying on ITW samples, we amplify\nthe generalizability of MoCap samples by taking only a geometric feature\nwithout an image as an input for the second sub-problem. As the geometric\nfeature is invariant to appearances, MoCap and ITW samples do not suffer from a\nhuge appearance gap between the two datasets.

However, in real-time and on-the-fly scene capture applications,\nthis prior knowledge cannot be assumed as fixed or static, since it dynamically\nchanges and it is subject to significant updates based on run-time\nobservations. Particularly in the context of large-scale mapping, significant\ncamera pose drift is inevitable, necessitating the correction via loop closure.\nTo overcome this limitation, we propose NEWTON, a view-centric mapping method\nthat dynamically constructs neural fields based on run-time observation. In\ncontrast to prior works, our method enables camera pose updates using loop\nclosures and scene boundary updates by representing the scene with multiple\nneural fields, where each is defined in a local coordinate system of a selected\nkeyframe. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our\nmethod over existing world-centric neural field-based SLAM systems, in\nparticular for large-scale scenes subject to camera pose updates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 20:22:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 15:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

At the same time, a main challenge in DRL is that policy evaluation in DRL\ntypically relies on the representation of the return distribution, which needs\nto be carefully designed. In this paper, we address this challenge for a\nspecial class of DRL problems that rely on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for\ncontrol, advocating for a new distributional approach to LQR, which we call\n\\emph{distributional LQR}. Specifically, we provide a closed-form expression of\nthe distribution of the random return which, remarkably, is applicable to all\nexogenous disturbances on the dynamics, as long as they are independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.). While the proposed exact return distribution\nconsists of infinitely many random variables, we show that this distribution\ncan be approximated by a finite number of random variables, and the associated\napproximation error can be analytically bounded under mild assumptions. Using\nthe approximate return distribution, we propose a zeroth-order policy gradient\nalgorithm for risk-averse LQR using the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as a\nmeasure of risk.

Traditional MCMC algorithms often face slow convergence due to\nthe difficulty in finding proposals that suit the problem at hand. To address\nthis issue, the paper introduces the Approximate Posterior Ensemble Sampler\n(APES) algorithm, which employs kernel density estimation and radial basis\ninterpolation to create an adaptive proposal, leading to fast convergence of\nthe chains. The APES algorithm's scalability to higher dimensions makes it a\npractical solution for complex problems. The proposed method generates an\napproximate posterior probability that closely approximates the desired\ndistribution and is easy to sample from, resulting in smaller autocorrelation\ntimes and a higher probability of acceptance by the chain. In this work, we\ncompare the performance of the APES algorithm with the affine invariance\nensemble sampler with the stretch move in various contexts, demonstrating the\nefficiency of the proposed method. For instance, on the Rosenbrock function,\nthe APES presented an autocorrelation time 140 times smaller than the affine\ninvariance ensemble sampler. The comparison showcases the effectiveness of the\nAPES algorithm in generating samples from challenging distributions.

To date, no comprehensive framework exists to track food\nsystems transformation and their contributions to global goals. In 2021, the\nFood Systems Countdown to 2030 Initiative (FSCI) articulated an architecture to\nmonitor food systems across five themes: 1 diets, nutrition, and health; 2\nenvironment, natural resources, and production; 3 livelihoods, poverty, and\nequity; 4 governance; and 5 resilience and sustainability. Each theme comprises\nthree-to-five indicator domains. This paper builds on that architecture,\npresenting the inclusive, consultative process used to select indicators and an\napplication of the indicator framework using the latest available data,\nconstructing the first global food systems baseline to track transformation.\nWhile data are available to cover most themes and domains, critical indicator\ngaps exist such as off-farm livelihoods, food loss and waste, and governance.\nBaseline results demonstrate every region or country can claim positive\noutcomes in some parts of food systems, but none are optimal across all\ndomains, and some indicators are independent of national income. These results\nunderscore the need for dedicated monitoring and transformation agendas\nspecific to food systems. Tracking these indicators to 2030 and beyond will\nallow for data-driven food systems governance at all scales and increase\naccountability for urgently needed progress toward achieving global goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 20:56:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 23:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

Previous work at ~1 kpc resolution has already revealed common\nfeatures in the mass buildup (e.g., inside-out growth of galaxies). However,\neven at approximate kpc scales, the stellar populations are blurred between the\ndifferent galactic morphological structures such as spiral arms, bars and\nbulges. Here we present a detailed analysis of the spatially resolved star\nformation histories (SFHs) of 19 PHANGS-MUSE galaxies, at a spatial resolution\nof ~100 pc. We show that our sample of local galaxies exhibits predominantly\nnegative radial gradients of stellar age and [Z/H], consistent with previous\nfindings, and a radial structure that is primarily consistent with local star\nformation, and indicative of inside-out formation. In barred galaxies, we find\nflatter [Z/H] gradients along the semi-major axis of the bar than along the\nsemi-minor axis, as is expected from the radial mixing of material along the\nbar. In general, the derived assembly histories of the galaxies in our sample\ntell a consistent story of inside-out growth, where low-mass galaxies assembled\nthe majority of their stellar mass later in cosmic history than high-mass\ngalaxies. We also show how stellar populations of different ages exhibit\ndifferent kinematics, with younger stellar populations having lower velocity\ndispersions than older stellar populations at similar galactocentric distances,\nwhich we interpret as an imprint of the progressive dynamical heating of\nstellar populations as they age. Finally, we explore how the time-averaged star\nformation rate evolves with time, and how it varies across galactic disks. This\nanalysis reveals a wide variation of the SFHs of galaxy centers and\nadditionally shows that structural features become less pronounced with age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 21:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Due to\nenergetic considerations, outgassing of hyper-volatile molecules is favored\nover heavier volatiles like H2O and CO2. However, there are are theoretical\nand/or observational inconsistencies with existing models invoking the\nsublimation of pure H2 , N2, and CO.

In this model, `Oumuamua began as an icy planetesimal that\nwas irradiated at low temperatures by cosmic rays during its interstellar\njourney, and experienced warming during its passage through the Solar System.\nThis explanation is supported by a large body of experimental work showing that\nH2 is efficiently and generically produced from H2O ice processing, and that\nthe entrapped H2 is released over a broad range of temperatures during\nannealing of the amorphous water matrix.

In the single site limit, at\nhalf-filling, the electron-phonon coupling results in a double well structure\nfor the lattice displacement, favoring empty or doubly occupied sites. In two\ndimensions, and on a bipartite lattice in $d \\geq 2$, an intersite hopping\ncauses these doubly occupied and empty sites to alternate in a charge density\nwave (CDW) pattern when the temperature is lowered. Because a discrete symmetry\nis broken, this occurs in a conventional second-order transition at finite\n$T_{\\rm cdw}$. In this paper, we investigate the effect of changing the phonon\npotential energy to one with an intrinsic double well structure even in the\nabsence of an electron-phonon coupling. While this aids in the initial process\nof pair formation, the implications for subsequent CDW order are non-trivial.\nOne expects that, when the electron-phonon coupling is too strong, the double\nwells become deep and the polaron mass large, an effect which reduces $T_{\\rm\ncdw}$. We show here the existence of regions of parameter space where the\ndouble well potential, while aiding local pair formation, does so in a way\nwhich also substantially enhances long range CDW order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 22:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

LIDS extracts a feature map from the secret image and\nadds it to the cover image to yield the container image. The container image is\nnot directly output by the CNNs, and thus, it does not contain high-frequency\nartifacts.

COGS poses generalization splits that appear impossible for\npresent-day models, which could be taken as an indictment of those models.\nHowever, we show that the negative results trace to incidental features of COGS\nLFs.

A recent variable-free translation of COGS LFs suggests\nsimilar conclusions, but we observe this format is not semantically equivalent;\nit is incapable of accurately representing some COGS meanings.

While this paradigm partly mitigates the\nprivacy issues of users' sensitive data, the performance of the FL process can\nbe threatened and reached a bottleneck due to the growing cyber threats and\nprivacy violation techniques. To expedite the proliferation of FL process, the\nintegration of blockchain for FL environments has drawn prolific attention from\nthe people of academia and industry.

However, if the blockchain\nmechanism requires costly computational resources, then the\nresource-constrained FL clients cannot be involved in the training.

Despite many\nsuccessful interpretations of transformers on sequential data, little effort\nhas been devoted to the interpretation of ViTs, and many questions remain\nunanswered. For example, among the numerous attention heads, which one is more\nimportant? How strong are individual patches attending to their spatial\nneighbors in different heads? What attention patterns have individual heads\nlearned? In this work, we answer these questions through a visual analytics\napproach.

This paper introduces a novel software\nwatermarking scheme, dubbed SmartMark, aiming to protect the piracy of smart\ncontracts. SmartMark builds the control flow graph of a target contract runtime\nbytecode and locates a series of bytes randomly selected from a collection of\nopcodes to represent a watermark.

We explore two D-Wave features\nallowing one to encode such an initial state: the reverse annealing and the\nh-gain features. Reverse annealing (RA) aims to refine a known solution\nfollowing an anneal path starting with a classical state representing a good\nsolution, going backwards to a point where a transverse field is present, and\nthen finishing the annealing process with a forward anneal. The h-gain (HG)\nfeature allows one to put a time-dependent weighting scheme on linear ($h$)\nbiases of the Hamiltonian, and we demonstrate that this feature likewise can be\nused to bias the annealing to start from an initial state.

Two multiple access\nschemes are proposed in this paper to facilitate the massive IoT connections\nusing the cellular network based on the SR technique, namely, the simultaneous\naccess (SA) scheme and the selection diversity access (SDA) scheme. In the SA\nscheme, the base station (BS) transmits information to the receiver while\nmultiple IoT devices transmit their information simultaneously by passively\nbackscattering the BS signal to the receiver, while in the SDA scheme, only the\nIoT device with the strongest backscatter link transmits information to the\nreceiver. In both of the schemes, the receiver jointly decodes the information\nfrom the BS and the IoT devices. To evaluate the above two schemes, in this\npaper, we have derived the closed-form expressions of the ergodic rates and the\noutage probabilities for the cellular and IoT transmissions. Finally, numerical\nresults are provided to verify the theoretical analysis and compare the two\nproposed multiple access schemes. When the number of IoT devices is small, the\nSDA scheme is more appealing since it can significantly reduce the\ncomputational complexity while achieving equivalent performance to the SA\nscheme. When the number of IoT devices is large, the SA scheme is preferable\nsince it guarantees a significantly better rate performance and a lower outage\nprobability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 02:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

Although semi/full-supervised methods have\nmade good attempts, the domain shift between the synthetic and real adverse\nweather images would deteriorate their performance. To alleviate this issue,\nour start point is to unsupervisedly transfer the knowledge from source clean\ndomain to target degraded domain. Our key insight is that adverse weather does\nnot change the intrinsic optical flow of the scene, but causes a significant\ndifference for the warp error between clean and degraded images. In this work,\nwe propose the first unsupervised framework for adverse weather optical flow\nvia hierarchical motion-boundary adaptation. Specifically, we first employ\nimage translation to construct the transformation relationship between clean\nand degraded domains. In motion adaptation, we utilize the flow consistency\nknowledge to align the cross-domain optical flows into a motion-invariance\ncommon space, where the optical flow from clean weather is used as the\nguidance-knowledge to obtain a preliminary optical flow for adverse weather.\nFurthermore, we leverage the warp error inconsistency which measures the motion\nmisalignment of the boundary between the clean and degraded domains, and\npropose a joint intra- and inter-scene boundary contrastive adaptation to\nrefine the motion boundary. The hierarchical motion and boundary adaptation\njointly promotes optical flow in a unified framework.

This has inspired research\nendeavors utilizing events to guide the challenging video superresolution (VSR)\ntask. In this paper, we make the first attempt to address a novel problem of\nachieving VSR at random scales by taking advantages of the high temporal\nresolution property of events. This is hampered by the difficulties of\nrepresenting the spatial-temporal information of events when guiding VSR. To\nthis end, we propose a novel framework that incorporates the spatial-temporal\ninterpolation of events to VSR in a unified framework. Our key idea is to learn\nimplicit neural representations from queried spatial-temporal coordinates and\nfeatures from both RGB frames and events. Our method contains three parts.\nSpecifically, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) module first learns the 3D\nfeatures from events and RGB frames.

Lastly, the SpatialTemporal Implicit\nRepresentation (STIR) module recovers the SR frame in arbitrary resolutions\nfrom the outputs of these two modules.

The first instrument is allowed to violate the\nexclusion restriction and the second instrument does not need to satisfy\nmonotonicity. Therefore, the first instrument can affect the outcome via both\ndirect effects and a shift in the treatment status. The direct effects can be\nidentified via exogenous variation in the second instrument and therefore the\nlocal average treatment effect is identified.

The\nnaive focal length assumptions can harm this task with the incorrectly\nformulated projection matrices. To solve this, we propose Zolly, the first\n3DHMR method focusing on perspective-distorted images. Our approach begins with\nanalysing the reason for perspective distortion, which we find is mainly caused\nby the relative location of the human body to the camera center. We propose a\nnew camera model and a novel 2D representation, termed distortion image, which\ndescribes the 2D dense distortion scale of the human body. We then estimate the\ndistance from distortion scale features rather than environment context\nfeatures. Afterwards, we integrate the distortion feature with image features\nto reconstruct the body mesh. To formulate the correct projection matrix and\nlocate the human body position, we simultaneously use perspective and\nweak-perspective projection loss. Since existing datasets could not handle this\ntask, we propose the first synthetic dataset PDHuman and extend two real-world\ndatasets tailored for this task, all containing perspective-distorted human\nimages. Extensive experiments show that Zolly outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods on both perspective-distorted datasets and the\nstandard benchmark (3DPW).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 04:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

We\nshow that PQE can be used for property generation that can be viewed as a\ngeneralization of testing. The objective here is to produce an\n$\\mathit{unwanted}$ property of a design implementation thus exposing a bug. We\nintroduce two PQE solvers called $\\mathit{EG}$-$\\mathit{PQE}$ and\n$\\mathit{EG}$-$\\mathit{PQE}^+$. $\\mathit{EG}$-$\\mathit{PQE}$ is a very simple\nSAT-based algorithm. $\\mathit{EG}$-$\\mathit{PQE}^+$ is more sophisticated and\nrobust than $\\mathit{EG}$-$\\mathit{PQE}$. We use these PQE solvers to find an\nunwanted property (namely, an unwanted invariant) of a buggy FIFO buffer. We\nalso apply them to invariant generation for sequential circuits from a HWMCC\nbenchmark set. Finally, we use these solvers to generate properties of a\ncombinational circuit that mimic symbolic simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 05:07:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 03:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

We discuss these observations in light of a minimal\nmodel of random walk accounting for particle inertia and show that large\nparticles have a stronger probability to remain in the upper part of the flow\nbecause they are too large to reach descending flow regions. As a consequence\nparticles exhibit random horizontal motions near the top until they reach the\ncentral region where the mean flow vanishes, or until a turbulent fluctuation\ngets them down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 06:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

Meanwhile, the\npre-trained modality encoders, such as BERT and ViT, have become increasingly\npowerful in modeling the raw modality features of an item, such as text and\nimages. Given this, a natural question arises: can a purely modality-based\nrecommendation model (MoRec) outperforms or matches a pure ID-based model\n(IDRec) by replacing the itemID embedding with a SOTA modality encoder? In\nfact, this question was answered ten years ago when IDRec beats MoRec by a\nstrong margin in both recommendation accuracy and efficiency. We aim to revisit\nthis `old' question and systematically study MoRec from several aspects.\nSpecifically, we study several sub-questions: (i) which recommendation\nparadigm, MoRec or IDRec, performs better in practical scenarios, especially in\nthe general setting and warm item scenarios where IDRec has a strong advantage?\ndoes this hold for items with different modality features? (ii) can the latest\ntechnical advances from other communities (i.e., natural language processing\nand computer vision) translate into accuracy improvement for MoRec? (iii) how\nto effectively utilize item modality representation, can we use it directly or\ndo we have to adjust it with new data? (iv) are there some key challenges for\nMoRec to be solved in practical applications? To answer them, we conduct\nrigorous experiments for item recommendations with two popular modalities,\ni.e., text and vision. We provide the first empirical evidence that MoRec is\nalready comparable to its IDRec counterpart with an expensive end-to-end\ntraining method, even for warm item recommendation.

With inspiration from the high strength-to-volume ratio of triply\nperiodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures, a new model of porous plates, which\nis called a functionally graded TPMS (FG-TPMS) plate, is investigated in this\npaper. Three TPMS architectures including Primitive (P), Gyroid (G), and\nwrapped package-graph (IWP) with different graded functions are presented. To\npredict the mechanical responses, a new fitting technique based on a two-phase\npiece-wise function is employed to evaluate the effective moduli of TPMS\nstructures, including elastic modulus, shear modulus, and bulk modulus. In\naddition, this function corresponds to the cellular structure formulation in\nthe context of relative density. The separated phases of the function are\ndivided by the different deformation behaviors. Furthermore, another crucial\nmechanical property of porous structure, i.e, Poisson's ratio, is also achieved\nby a similar fitting technique. To verify the mechanical characteristics of the\nFG-TPMS plate, the generalized displacement field is modeled by a seventh-order\nshear deformation theory (SeSDT) and isogeometric analysis (IGA). Numerical\nexamples regarding static, buckling, and free vibration analyses of FG-TPMS\nplates are illustrated to confirm the reliability and accuracy of the proposed\napproach. Consequently, these FG-TPMS structures can provide much higher\nstiffness than the same-weight isotropic plate. The greater stiffness-to-weight\nratio of these porous plates compared to the full-weight isotropic ones should\nbe considered the most remarkable feature. Thus, these complex porous\nstructures have numerous practical applications because of these high ratios\nand their fabrication ability through additive manufacturing (AM) technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 07:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

False-positive error propagation is\nstill observed in methods using the well-established student-teacher framework,\nparticularly for small-scale and low-light objects. This paper proposes a\ntwo-phase consistency unsupervised domain adaptation network, 2PCNet, to\naddress these issues.

Our result marks\nan important milestone towards quantum networks and opens the door to exploring\nquantum entanglement based informatic applications for the future quantum\ninternet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 09:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

However, current few physical infrared\nattacks are complicated to implement in practical application because of their\ncomplex transformation from digital world to physical world. To address this\nissue, in this paper, we propose a physically feasible infrared attack method\ncalled \"adversarial infrared patches\". Considering the imaging mechanism of\ninfrared cameras by capturing objects' thermal radiation, adversarial infrared\npatches conduct attacks by attaching a patch of thermal insulation materials on\nthe target object to manipulate its thermal distribution. To enhance\nadversarial attacks, we present a novel aggregation regularization to guide the\nsimultaneous learning for the patch' shape and location on the target object.\nThus, a simple gradient-based optimization can be adapted to solve for them. We\nverify adversarial infrared patches in different object detection tasks with\nvarious object detectors. Experimental results show that our method achieves\nmore than 90\\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) versus the pedestrian detector and\nvehicle detector in the physical environment, where the objects are captured in\ndifferent angles, distances, postures, and scenes. More importantly,\nadversarial infrared patch is easy to implement, and it only needs 0.5 hours to\nbe constructed in the physical world, which verifies its effectiveness and\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 09:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

The\nkey objective of MR/HD is to localize the moment and estimate clip-wise\naccordance level, i.e., saliency score, to the given text query. Although the\nrecent transformer-based models brought some advances, we found that these\nmethods do not fully exploit the information of a given query. For example, the\nrelevance between text query and video contents is sometimes neglected when\npredicting the moment and its saliency. To tackle this issue, we introduce\nQuery-Dependent DETR (QD-DETR), a detection transformer tailored for MR/HD. As\nwe observe the insignificant role of a given query in transformer\narchitectures, our encoding module starts with cross-attention layers to\nexplicitly inject the context of text query into video representation. Then, to\nenhance the model's capability of exploiting the query information, we\nmanipulate the video-query pairs to produce irrelevant pairs. Such negative\n(irrelevant) video-query pairs are trained to yield low saliency scores, which\nin turn, encourages the model to estimate precise accordance between\nquery-video pairs. Lastly, we present an input-adaptive saliency predictor\nwhich adaptively defines the criterion of saliency scores for the given\nvideo-query pairs. Our extensive studies verify the importance of building the\nquery-dependent representation for MR/HD.

The experiments using the CaII 8542\nA line show that the resulting wavelength scheme naturally places more points\nin the core than in the wings, consistent with the sensitivity of the spectral\nline at each wavelength interval. The method can also be used as an accurate\ninterpolator, to improve the inference of the magnetic field when using the\nweak-field approximation.

When guiding them to make\nthe rubber band vibrate faster, they tend to tug harder at the rubber band, but\nthis actually changes the amplitude rather than the frequency (changing the\nfrequency should be to control its vibrating chord length, similar to the\ntuning method of a stringed instrument). Therefore, demonstration experiments\nusing objects such as rubber bands as frequencies do not seem suitable and\ncannot effectively assist students in establishing the concept of frequency.

An ensemble of discriminators is commonly used\nin recent neural vocoders (e.g., HiFi-GAN) and end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS)\nsystems (e.g., VITS) to scrutinize waveforms from multiple perspectives. Such\ndiscriminators allow synthesized speech to adequately approach real speech;\nhowever, they require an increase in the model size and computation time\naccording to the increase in the number of discriminators. Alternatively, this\nstudy proposes a Wave-U-Net discriminator, which is a single but expressive\ndiscriminator with Wave-U-Net architecture. This discriminator is unique; it\ncan assess a waveform in a sample-wise manner with the same resolution as the\ninput signal, while extracting multilevel features via an encoder and decoder\nwith skip connections. This architecture provides a generator with sufficiently\nrich information for the synthesized speech to be closely matched to the real\nspeech. During the experiments, the proposed ideas were applied to a\nrepresentative neural vocoder (HiFi-GAN) and an end-to-end TTS system (VITS).\nThe results demonstrate that the proposed models can achieve comparable speech\nquality with a 2.31 times faster and 14.5 times more lightweight discriminator\nwhen used in HiFi-GAN and a 1.90 times faster and 9.62 times more lightweight\ndiscriminator when used in VITS.

Among such areas is\nneuroscience, where is hypothesized that synchronization plays a role in many\nfunctions and dysfunctions of the brain. We study the linear stability of\nsynchronized states in networks of Izhikevich neurons using Master Stability\nFunctions, and to accomplish that, we exploit the formalism of saltation\nmatrices. Such a tool allows us to calculate the Lyapunov exponents of the\nMaster Stability Function (MSF) properly since the Izhikevich model displays a\ndiscontinuity within its spikes. We consider both electrical and chemical\ncouplings, as well as total and partially synchronized states. The MSFs\ncalculations are compared with a measure of the synchronization error for\nsimulated networks. We give special attention to the case of electric and\nchemical coupling, where a riddled basin of attraction makes the synchronized\nsolution more sensitive to perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 11:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

Here we report on the generation of triplet\nsupercurrents in mesoscopic lateral Josephson junctions, fabricated with the\nconventional superconductor NbTi and the HMF La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$\n(LSMO), having a typical junction length of 20~nm. We use the electrode\ngeometry as a tool to examine the triplet generator in the HMF and study\njunctions shaped as bar, square, and disk. In all junctions, we find strong\nsupercurrents and high current densities, that are independent of the junction\ngeometry and are insensitive to the application of in-plane fields, ruling out\nthe magnetic vorticity in the disk geometry as the generator. Analysis of the\ncritical current interference pattern upon application of a perpendicular\nmagnetic field shows that the triplet supercurrent is highly constricted to the\nrims of the disk devices, yet uniformly distributed in the bar-shaped devices.\nThe appearance of these rim supercurrents is tied to the combination of triplet\ntransport and the disk geometry but is not central to the generator mechanism.\nNext, we analyze the temperature dependence of the critical current and find in\nits quadratic dependence a strong indication for the triplet nature of the\nsupercurrents. Finally, we find the supercurrent to persist in junctions\nfabricated from a NbTi/Ag/LSMO trilayer. The results strongly indicate that the\nmagnetic inhomogeneity needed for triplet generation resides in the LSMO layer\nadjacent to the NbTi/LSMO interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 11:19:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

Hence, multi-contrast super-resolution\nmethods have been developed to improve the quality of low-resolution contrasts\nby leveraging complementary information from multi-contrast MRI. Current deep\nlearning-based super-resolution methods have limitations in estimating\nrestoration uncertainty and avoiding mode collapse. Although the diffusion\nmodel has emerged as a promising approach for image enhancement, capturing\ncomplex interactions between multiple conditions introduced by multi-contrast\nMRI super-resolution remains a challenge for clinical applications.

However, this view often leads\nprogrammers to write code that causes fine-grained remote communication, which\ncan result in poor performance.

This paper presents\na real-time imaging radar inertial odometry and mapping method, iRIOM, based on\nthe submap concept. To deal with moving objects and multipath reflections, we\nuse the graduated non-convexity method to robustly and efficiently estimate\nego-velocity from a single scan. To measure the agreement between sparse\nnon-repetitive radar scan points and submap points, the\ndistribution-to-multi-distribution distance for matches is adopted. The\nego-velocity, scan-to-submap matches are fused with the 6D inertial data by an\niterative extended Kalman filter to get the platform's 3D position and\norientation. A loop closure module is also developed to curb the odometry\nmodule's drift. To our knowledge, iRIOM based on the two modules is the first\n4D radar inertial SLAM system.

This paper describes a\nproposal for an agent-based model to examine the impact that aporophobia at the\ninstitutional level has on poverty levels. This aporophobia agent-based model\n(AABM) will first be applied to a case study in the city of Barcelona. The\nregulatory environment is central to the model, since aporophobia has been\nidentified in the legal framework. The AABM presented in this paper constitutes\na cornerstone to obtain empirical evidence, in a non-invasive way, on the\ncausal relationship between aporophobia and poverty levels. The simulations\nthat will be generated based on the AABM have the potential to inform a new\ngeneration of poverty reduction policies, which act not only on the\nredistribution of wealth but also on the discrimination of the poor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 13:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

Recent approaches propose to geographically divide the scene\nand adopt multiple sub-NeRFs to model each region individually, leading to\nlinear scale-up in training costs and the number of sub-NeRFs as the scene\nexpands. An alternative solution is to use a feature grid representation, which\nis computationally efficient and can naturally scale to a large scene with\nincreased grid resolutions. However, the feature grid tends to be less\nconstrained and often reaches suboptimal solutions, producing noisy artifacts\nin renderings, especially in regions with complex geometry and texture.

We studied how the cloudlet\nsize and the magnetic field strength affect the rotational velocity profile in\nthe disk after the cloudlet encounter. The results show that a magnetic field\ncan either decelerate or accelerate the rotational motion of the cloudlet\nmaterial, primarily depending on the relative size of the cloudlet to the disk\nthickness. When the cloudlet size is comparable to or smaller than the disk\nthickness, magnetic fields only decelerate the rotation of the colliding\ncloudlet material. However, if the cloudlet size is larger than the disk\nthickness, the colliding cloudlet material can be super-Keplerian as a result\nof magnetic acceleration.

However, the considerable cost of annotating\ndata motivates the need for learning strategies under low-resource settings. In\nthis paper, we investigate the problems of learning summarizers with only few\nexamples and propose corresponding methods for improvements. First, typical\ntransfer learning methods are prone to be affected by data properties and\nlearning objectives in the pretext tasks. Therefore, based on pretrained\nlanguage models, we further present a meta learning framework to transfer\nfew-shot learning processes from source corpora to the target corpus. Second,\nprevious methods learn from training examples without decomposing the content\nand preference. The generated summaries could therefore be constrained by the\npreference bias in the training set, especially under low-resource settings. As\nsuch, we propose decomposing the contents and preferences during learning\nthrough the parameter modulation, which enables control over preferences during\ninference. Third, given a target application, specifying required preferences\ncould be non-trivial because the preferences may be difficult to derive through\nobservations.

The contact\nprediction model is trained on synthetic data generated by a developed\nsimulation environment to learn the mapping from point-cloud observation of a\nrigid target object and the pose of a deformable tool, to 3D representation of\nthe contact points between the two bodies. We experimentally evaluated the\nproposed approach for a dish cleaning task both in simulation and on a real\n\\panda with real-world objects. The experimental results demonstrate that in\nboth scenarios the proposed planning pipeline is capable of generating\nhigh-quality trajectories that can accomplish the task by achieving more than\n90\\% area coverage on different objects of varying sizes and curvatures while\nminimizing travel distance.

We present an innovative fabrication concept for highly\nporous (>99.9%) photothermal hybrid aeromaterials, that enable an ultra-rapid\nand volumetric photothermal response with an enhancement by a factor of around\n2.5 compared to the pristine variant. The hybrid aeromaterial is based on\nstrongly light-scattering framework structures composed of interconnected\nhollow silicon dioxide (SiO${_2}$) microtubes, which are functionalized with\nextremely low amounts (in order of a few ${\\mu}$g cm${^-}$${^3}$) of reduced\ngraphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets, acting as photothermal agents. Tailoring the\ndensity of rGO within the framework structure enables us to control both, light\nscattering and light absorption, and thus the volumetric photothermal response.\nWe further show that by rapid and repeatable gas activation these transducer\nmaterials expand the field of photothermal applications, like untethered\nlight-powered and -controlled microfluidic pumps and soft pneumatic actuators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 14:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

The sharp variations in sound speed located in these\ntransition regions give rise to a signature in specific seismic indicators,\nopening the possibility to constrain the physics of convection to radiation\ntransition. Among those seismic indicators, the ratios of the small to large\nfrequency separation for $l=0$ and $1$ modes ($r_{010}$) were shown to be\nparticularly efficient to probe these transition regions. Interestingly, in the\nKepler Legacy F-type stars, the oscillatory signatures left in the $r_{010}$\nratios by the sharp sound-speed variation have unexpected large amplitudes that\nstill need to be explained. We show that the signature of the bottom of the\nconvective envelope is amplified in the ratios $r_{010}$ by the frequency\ndependence of the amplitude compared to the signal seen in the frequencies\nthemselves or the second differences.

This deep extension of the convective envelope causes doubt that\nthe origin of the large amplitudes is due to penetrative convection as it is\nmodelled here or implies that current stellar modelling (without penetrative\nconvection) leads to an underestimation of the size of convective envelopes. In\nany case, studying the glitch signatures of a large number of oscillating\nF-type stars opens the possibility to constrain the physics of the stellar\ninterior in these regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 14:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

We have investigated the dynamics of this\natomic system for two different initial conditions of the environment. In the\nfirst case, we have assumed the environment's state to be in ground state and\nin the other case, we have assumed the state to be in first excited state. The\nsecond initial condition is significant as it shows the role played by both the\nStark shift parameters in contrast to only one of the Stark shift parameters\nfor the first initial condition. Our results demonstrate that quantum\ncorrelations can be sustained for an extended period in the presence of Stark\nshift effect in the case of both Markovian and non-Markovian reservoirs. The\neffect in the non-Markovian reservoir is more prominent than the Markovian\nreservoir, even for a very small value of the Stark shift parameter. We observe\nthat among the correlation measures considered, only local quantum uncertainty\nis accompanied by a sudden change phenomenon, i.e., an abrupt change in the\ndecay rate of a correlation measure.

The P-MoPA scheme\noffers a potential route to high-repetition-rate, GeV-scale plasma accelerators\ndriven by picosecond-duration laser pulses from, for example, kilohertz\nthin-disk lasers. The first stage of the P-MoPA scheme is a plasma modulator in\nwhich a long, high-energy 'drive' pulse is spectrally modulated by\nco-propagating in a plasma channel with the low-amplitude plasma wave driven by\na short, low-energy 'seed' pulse. The spectrally modulated drive pulse is\nconverted to a train of short pulses, by introducing dispersion, which can\nresonantly drive a large wakefield in a subsequent accelerator stage with the\nsame on-axis plasma density as the modulator. In this paper we derive the 3D\nanalytic theory for the evolution of the drive pulse in the plasma modulator\nand show that the spectral modulation is independent of transverse coordinate,\nwhich is ideal for compression into a pulse train.

Parallel systems arise\nin relevant cases, such as in multi-band mobile networks, multi-technology\nwireless access, or multi-path protocols, just to name a few. Typically,\ncontrol over each communication channel is limited and random service outages\nand congestion cause buffering that impairs the age-of-information. The\nparallel use of independent channels promises a remedy, since outages on one\nchannel may be compensated for by another. Surprisingly, for the well-known\ncase of M$\\mid$M$\\mid$1 queues we find the opposite: pooling capacity in one\nchannel performs better than a parallel system with the same total capacity. A\ngeneralization is not possible since there are no solutions for other types of\nparallel queues at hand. In this work, we prove a dual representation of\nage-of-information in min-plus algebra that connects to queueing models known\nfrom the theory of effective bandwidth/capacity and the stochastic network\ncalculus.

Without needing any\nmanual annotation, we achieve this compression by generating 0-1 masks on\ndiscriminative pixels from class activation maps (CAM). We propose an adaptive\nmask generation model called class-incremental masking (CIM) to explicitly\nresolve two difficulties of using CAM: 1) transforming the heatmaps of CAM to\n0-1 masks with an arbitrary threshold leads to a trade-off between the coverage\non discriminative pixels and the quantity of exemplars, as the total memory is\nfixed; and 2) optimal thresholds vary for different object classes, which is\nparticularly obvious in the dynamic environment of CIL.

We\nestimate the energy converted from the magnetic slingshot above the current\nsheet and the large-scale Lorentz force exerting on the flux rope during the\nrapid acceleration phase, and find that (1) the work done by the large-scale\nLorentz force is about 4.6 times higher than the former, and (2) decreased\nstrapping force generated by the overlying field facilitates the eruption.\nThese results indicate that the large-scale Lorentz force plays a dominant role\nin the rapid acceleration phase for this eruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 15:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Once detected, it is important to monitor and track these vessels until\na necessary intervention occurs. To achieve this, track association algorithms\nare used, which take sequential observations comprising geological and motion\nparameters of the vessels and associate them with respective vessels. The\nspatial and temporal variations inherent in these sequential observations make\nthe association task challenging for traditional multi-object tracking\nalgorithms. Additionally, the presence of overlapping tracks and missing data\ncan further complicate the trajectory tracking process. To address these\nchallenges, in this study, we approach this tracking task as a multivariate\ntime series problem and introduce a 1D CNN-LSTM architecture-based framework\nfor track association. This special neural network architecture can capture the\nspatial patterns as well as the long-term temporal relations that exist among\nthe sequential observations.

Gate errors, coherence\nerrors and a lack of connectivity all contribute to low fidelity results. In\nparticular, connectivity restrictions enforce a gate set that requires\nthree-qubit gates to be decomposed into one- or two-qubit gates. This\nsubstantially increases the number of two-qubit gates that need to be executed.\nHowever, many quantum devices have access to higher energy levels. We can\nexpand the qubit abstraction of $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ to a ququart which\nhas access to the $|2\\rangle$ and $|3\\rangle$ state, but with shorter coherence\ntimes. This allows for two qubits to be encoded in one ququart, enabling\nincreased virtual connectivity between physical units from two adjacent qubits\nto four fully connected qubits. This connectivity scheme allows us to more\nefficiently execute three-qubit gates natively between two physical devices.\n  We present direct-to-pulse implementations of several three-qubit gates,\nsynthesized via optimal control, for compilation of three-qubit gates onto a\nsuperconducting-based architecture with access to four-level devices with the\nfirst experimental demonstration of four-level ququart gates designed through\noptimal control. We demonstrate strategies that temporarily use higher level\nstates to perform Toffoli gates and always use higher level states to improve\nfidelities for quantum circuits. We find that these methods improve expected\nfidelities with increases of 2x across circuit sizes using intermediate\nencoding, and increases of 3x for fully-encoded ququart compilation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 15:28:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 16:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

So far adversarial training has been the\nmost successful defense against such adversarial attacks. This work focuses on\nimproving adversarial training to boost adversarial robustness. We first\nanalyze, from an instance-wise perspective, how adversarial vulnerability\nevolves during adversarial training. We find that during training an overall\nreduction of adversarial loss is achieved by sacrificing a considerable\nproportion of training samples to be more vulnerable to adversarial attack,\nwhich results in an uneven distribution of adversarial vulnerability among\ndata. Such \"uneven vulnerability\", is prevalent across several popular robust\ntraining methods and, more importantly, relates to overfitting in adversarial\ntraining. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new adversarial training\nmethod: Instance-adaptive Smoothness Enhanced Adversarial Training (ISEAT). It\njointly smooths both input and weight loss landscapes in an adaptive,\ninstance-specific, way to enhance robustness more for those samples with higher\nadversarial vulnerability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nour method over existing defense methods.

We refer to\nsuch pairs as distracted pairs. Our intuition is that using semantically\nmeaningful distractors enables the model to learn related variations and attain\nrobustness against challenging deviations, compared to conventional\naugmentation schemes focusing only on low-level aspects and modifications. More\nspecifically, in addition to the supervised loss computed between the estimated\nflow for the original pair and its ground-truth flow, we include a second\nsupervised loss defined between the distracted pair's flow and the original\npair's ground-truth flow, weighted with the same mixing ratio. Furthermore,\nwhen unlabeled data is available, we extend our augmentation approach to\nself-supervised settings through pseudo-labeling and cross-consistency\nregularization.

These MA techniques are carried out in complex-field\ndomain by signal processing which consumes physical resources to separate the\noutputs of the users. It becomes problematic to find new resources from the\nphysical world. In this paper, an algebraic resource is proposed to support\nmultiuser transmission. This algebraic resource is based on assigning each user\nan element pair (EP) from a finite field GF($p^m$). The output bit from each\nuser is mapped into an element in its assigned EP, called the output symbol.\nThen, the output symbols from the users are jointly mapped into a unique symbol\nin the same field GF($p^m$) for modulation and transmission. The EPs assigned\nto the users are said to form a set of uniquely decodable EPs (UDEPs), called a\nmultiuser UD code. Using UDEPs over a finite field, a downlink and an uplink MA\nsystems are proposed, which are called finite-field MA (FFMA) systems. Methods\nfor constructing finite-field UD codes for FFMA systems are provided. An FFMA\nsystem can be designed in conjunction with the classical complex-field MA\ntechniques to provide more flexibility and varieties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 15:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

In the cosmological setup,\nwe have considered three different models for the apparent dark matter density.\nIn the first model, we have found that Friedmann equations get modified due to\nthe presence of the apparent dark matter (DM) in such a way that Newton's\nconstant of gravity shifts as $G\\rightarrow G_N=G\\left(1+\\zeta\\right)$, where\n$\\zeta$ is a dimensionless small parameter.

Second, PINNs don't generalize for a new SIDR trajectory, and\nlearning its corresponding SIR parameters requires retraining the PINN from\nscratch.

Nonetheless, there still remains a\ndispleasing problem if one wants to improve perceptual quality and quantitative\nscores of recovered image at the same time. In this study, drawing inspiration\nfrom the research of transformer properties, we introduce the pretrained\ntransformers to address this problem. In particular, we leverage deep features\nextracted from a pretrained vision transformer (ViT) to encourage recovered\nimages to be sharp without sacrificing the performance measured by the\nquantitative metrics. The pretrained transformer can capture the global\ntopological relations (i.e., self-similarity) of image, and we observe that the\ncaptured topological relations about the sharp image will change when blur\noccurs. By comparing the transformer features between recovered image and\ntarget one, the pretrained transformer provides high-resolution blur-sensitive\nsemantic information, which is critical in measuring the sharpness of the\ndeblurred image. On the basis of the advantages, we present two types of novel\nperceptual losses to guide image deblurring. One regards the features as\nvectors and computes the discrepancy between representations extracted from\nrecovered image and target one in Euclidean space. The other type considers the\nfeatures extracted from an image as a distribution and compares the\ndistribution discrepancy between recovered image and target one. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of transformer properties in improving the perceptual quality\nwhile not sacrificing the quantitative scores (PSNR) over the most competitive\nmodels, such as Uformer, Restormer, and NAFNet, on defocus deblurring and\nmotion deblurring tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 14:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Real bodies,\nhowever, cannot satisfy this property, as a consequence of thermal\nfluctuations. We generalize Euler's equations for a free body in order to\ndescribe dissipative and thermal fluctuation effects in a thermodynamically\nconsistent way. The origin of these effects is internal, i.e. not due to an\nexternal thermal bath. The stochastic differential equations governing the\norientation and central moments of the body are derived from first principles\nthrough the theory of coarse-graining. Within this theory, Euler's equations\nemerge as the reversible part of the dynamics. For the irreversible part, we\nidentify two distinct dissipative mechanisms; one associated with diffusion of\nthe orientation, whose origin lies in the difference between the spin velocity\nand the angular velocity, and one associated with the damping of dilations,\ni.e. inelasticity. We show that a deformable body with zero angular momentum\nwill explore uniformly, through thermal fluctuations, all possible\norientations. When the body spins, the equations describe the evolution towards\nthe alignment of the body's major principal axis with the angular momentum\nvector. In this alignment process, the body increases its temperature. We\ndemonstrate that the origin of the alignment process is not inelasticity but\nrather orientational diffusion. The theory also predicts the equilibrium shape\nof a spinning body.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 07:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

However, these algorithms have not been subjected to a\nprincipled comparison, making it difficult for stakeholders to choose the\nalgorithm in an evidence-based manner. The key challenge in comparing existing\nalgorithms and developing better algorithms is the lack of the publicly\navailable gold-standard data that would be needed to perform reproducible\nresearch. We address this challenge by collecting a novel dataset of similarity\nscores that we release to the research community. Our dataset consists of 477\nself-reported expertise scores provided by 58 researchers who evaluated their\nexpertise in reviewing papers they have read previously.\n  We use this data to compare several popular algorithms employed in computer\nscience conferences and come up with recommendations for stakeholders. Our main\nfindings are as follows. First, all algorithms make a non-trivial amount of\nerror. For the task of ordering two papers in terms of their relevance for a\nreviewer, the error rates range from 12%-30% in easy cases to 36%-43% in hard\ncases, highlighting the vital need for more research on the\nsimilarity-computation problem.

This\nsetting is particularly relevant for domain specific RE where no annotated\ndataset is available and for open-domain RE where the types of relations are a\npriori unknown. Although recent approaches achieve promising results, they\nheavily depend on hyperparameters whose tuning would most often require labeled\ndata. To mitigate the reliance on hyperparameters, we propose PromptORE, a\n''Prompt-based Open Relation Extraction'' model. We adapt the novel\nprompt-tuning paradigm to work in an unsupervised setting, and use it to embed\nsentences expressing a relation. We then cluster these embeddings to discover\ncandidate relations, and we experiment different strategies to automatically\nestimate an adequate number of clusters. To the best of our knowledge,\nPromptORE is the first unsupervised RE model that does not need hyperparameter\ntuning. Results on three general and specific domain datasets show that\nPromptORE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models with a relative gain\nof more than 40% in B 3 , V-measure and ARI.

Several trust management models have been\nproposed in the IoT environment; however, these schemes have not fully\naddressed the IoT devices features, such as devices role, device type and its\ndynamic behavior in a smart environment. As a result, traditional trust and\nreputation models are insufficient to tackle these characteristics and\nuncertainty risks while connecting nodes to the network. Whilst continuous\nstudy has been carried out and various articles suggest promising solutions in\nconstrained environments, research on trust and reputation is still at its\ninfancy. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive literature review on\nstate-of-the-art research on the trust and reputation of IoT devices and\nsystems. Specifically, we first propose a new structure, namely a new taxonomy,\nto organize the trust and reputation models based on the ways trust is managed.\nThe proposed taxonomy comprises of traditional trust management-based systems\nand artificial intelligence-based systems, and combine both the classes which\nencourage the existing schemes to adapt these emerging concepts. This\ncollaboration between the conventional mathematical and the advanced ML models\nresult in design schemes that are more robust and efficient.

However, current methods for fault diagnosis based on\nI-V characteristic curves only utilize partial feature information and often\nrely on calibrating the field characteristic curves to standard test conditions\n(STC). It is difficult to apply it in practice and to accurately identify\nmultiple complex faults with similarities in different blocking diodes\nconfigurations of PV arrays under the influence of dust. Therefore, a novel\nfault diagnosis method for PV arrays considering dust impact is proposed. In\nthe preprocessing stage, the Isc-Voc normalized Gramian angular difference\nfield (GADF) method is presented, which normalizes and transforms the resampled\nPV array characteristic curves from the field including I-V and P-V to obtain\nthe transformed graphical feature matrices. Then, in the fault diagnosis stage,\nthe model of convolutional neural network (CNN) with convolutional block\nattention modules (CBAM) is designed to extract fault differentiation\ninformation from the transformed graphical matrices containing full feature\ninformation and to classify faults. And different graphical feature\ntransformation methods are compared through simulation cases, and different\nCNN-based classification methods are also analyzed. The results indicate that\nthe developed method for PV arrays with different blocking diodes\nconfigurations under various operating conditions has high fault diagnosis\naccuracy and reliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 09:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

In a range that\nincludes low and high switching frequencies of potentials, the periodic\nsolutions dominate in the bifurcation diagrams. With regard to the large\nswitching frequency, the effective values of the voltage at the piezoelectric\nelectrodes are significantly reduced. The highest effective values of the\nvoltage that are induced at the piezoelectric electrodes are observed when the\nchaotic solutions appear due to their specific ability to pass the potential\nbarrier for relatively small excitation.
