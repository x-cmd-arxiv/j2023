However, the mechanisms for\nLAOs excitation are not well understood. We aim to study these mechanisms,\nperforming time-dependent numerical simulations in 2.5D and 2D setups using\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code MANCHA3D. Two types of disturbances are applied\nto excite prominence oscillations, such as a perturbation associated with an\neruption and the waves caused by an artificial energy release. In the\nsimulation with the eruption, we obtain that it does not produce LAOs in the\nprominence located in its vicinity. While the erupting flux rope rises, an\nelongated current sheet forms behind it, which becomes unstable and breaks into\nplasmoids. The downward-moving plasmoids cause perturbations in the velocity\nfield by merging with the post-reconnection loops. This velocity perturbation\npropagates in the surroundings and perturbs the nearby prominence. The analysis\nof the oscillatory motions of the prominence plasma reveals the excitation of\nsmall-amplitude oscillations (SAOs), which are a mixture of longitudinal and\nvertical oscillations. In the simulation with a distant artificial\nperturbation, a fast-mode shock wave is produced, and it gradually reaches two\nflux rope prominences at different distances. This shock wave excites vertical\nLAOs and longitudinal SAOs with similar amplitudes, periods, and damping times\nin both prominences. Finally, in the experiment with the external triggering of\nLAOs in a dipped arcade prominence model, we find that, although the vector\nnormal to the front of a fast-mode shock wave is parallel to the spine of the\ndipped arcade well before the contact, this wave does not excite longitudinal\nLAOs. When the wave front approaches the prominence, it pushes the dense plasma\ndown, establishing vertical LAOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 16:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

However, despite their\npotential, these models are challenging to train and often tend to produce poor\nperformance, explaining their limited popularity. Our hypothesis is that this\nunder-performance is a result of the commonly utilized maximum likelihood (ML)\noptimization, which leads to mode averaging and a higher likelihood of getting\nstuck in local maxima. We propose a novel curriculum-based approach to learning\nmixture models in which each component of the MoE is able to select its own\nsubset of the training data for learning. This approach allows for independent\noptimization of each component, resulting in a more modular architecture that\nenables the addition and deletion of components on the fly, leading to an\noptimization less susceptible to local optima. The curricula can ignore\ndata-points from modes not represented by the MoE, reducing the mode-averaging\nproblem. To achieve a good data coverage, we couple the optimization of the\ncurricula with a joint entropy objective and optimize a lower bound of this\nobjective. We evaluate our curriculum-based approach on a variety of multimodal\nbehavior learning tasks and demonstrate its superiority over competing methods\nfor learning MoE models and conditional generative models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 16:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

The EDE field coupled to photons in a parity-violating manner\nwould rotate the plane of linear polarization of the CMB and produce a\ncross-correlation power spectrum of $E$- and $B$-mode polarization fields with\nopposite parities. In this paper, we fit the $EB$ power spectrum predicted by\nthe photon-axion coupling of the EDE model with a potential $V(\\phi)\\propto\n[1-\\cos(\\phi/f)]^3$ to polarization data from Planck. We find that the unique\nshape of the predicted $EB$ power spectrum is not favored by the data and\nobtain a first constraint on the photon-axion coupling constant, $g=(0.04\\pm\n0.16)M_{\\text{Pl}}^{-1}$ (68% CL), for the EDE model that best fits the CMB and\ngalaxy clustering data. This constraint is independent of the miscalibration of\npolarization angles of the instrument or the polarized Galactic foreground\nemission. Our limit on $g$ may have important implications for embedding EDE in\nfundamental physics, such as string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 16:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown great power in novel view\nsynthesis and have been applied to human body rendering. However, most current\nNeRF-based methods bear huge costs for both training and rendering, which\nimpedes the wide applications in real-life scenarios. In this paper, we propose\na rendering framework that can learn moving human body structures extremely\nquickly from a monocular video. The framework is built by integrating both\nneural fields and neural voxels. Especially, a set of generalizable neural\nvoxels are constructed. With pretrained on various human bodies, these general\nvoxels represent a basic skeleton and can provide strong geometric priors. For\nthe fine-tuning process, individual voxels are constructed for learning\ndifferential textures, complementary to general voxels. Thus learning a novel\nbody can be further accelerated, taking only a few minutes. Our method shows\nsignificantly higher training efficiency compared with previous methods, while\nmaintaining similar rendering quality.

A wide class of non-vacuum initial state conditions is generated\nby different solutions of this equation. An interesting subclass of solutions\ncorresponds to initial states that give rise to an arbitrarily large\nsemi-classical stress tensor on the future horizon of the black hole formed in\nclassical collapse.

Stellar contamination is one of such challenges that can overpower\nthe planetary signal by up to an order of magnitude, and thus not accounting\nfor stellar contamination can lead to significant biases in the derived\natmospheric properties. Yet, accounting for stellar contamination may not be\nstraightforward, as important discrepancies exist between state-of-the-art\nstellar models and measured spectra and between models themselves. Here we\nexplore the extent to which stellar models can be used to reliably correct for\nstellar contamination and yield a planet's uncontaminated transmission\nspectrum.

These early galaxies\nilluminated the transition from the cosmic \"dark ages\" to the reionization of\nthe intergalactic medium. This transitional period has been largely\ninaccessible to direct observation until the recent commissioning of JWST,\nwhich has extended our observational reach into that epoch. Excitingly, the\nfirst JWST science observations uncovered a surprisingly high abundance of\nearly star-forming galaxies. However, the distances (redshifts) of these\ngalaxies were, by necessity, estimated from multi-band photometry. Photometric\nredshifts, while generally robust, can suffer from uncertainties and/or\ndegeneracies. Spectroscopic measurements of the precise redshifts are required\nto validate these sources and to reliably quantify their space densities,\nstellar masses, and star formation rates, which provide powerful constraints on\ngalaxy formation models and cosmology.

We therefore developed a scattering model for UCN in which\nscattering from random surface waviness with a size larger than the UCN\nwavelength is described by a microfacet Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution\nFunction model (mf-BRDF model), and scattering from smaller structures by the\nLambert's cosine law (Lambert model). For the surface waviness, we used the\nstatistical distribution of surface slope measured by an atomic force\nmicroscope on a sample piece of guide tube as input of the model.

Motivated by the results of our systematic search for\nintense centimeter radio flares in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) and by rare\nfindings of strong millimeter-wavelength variability, we have conducted a\nsystematic search for such variability in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) using\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Rapid variability on\ntimescales of minutes to hours in the (centimeter)millimeter-wavelength range\nindicates (gyro)synchrotron radiation. Additionally, mass accretion will also\naffect the millimeter-wavelength luminosity but typically on longer timescales.\nBeyond studies of individual YSOs, our characterization of strong\nmillimeter-wavelength variability with ALMA in the ONC sets first systematic\nconstraints on the occurrence of such variability in a large number of YSOs\n($\\sim$130). We report the discovery of an order of magnitude millimeter-flare\nwithin just a few minutes from a known YSO previously reported as a radio\nflaring source at cm-wavelengths (the \"ORBS'' source). We also present an\nassessment of the systematic variability effects caused by the use of\ntime-sliced imaging of a complex region. These are mostly due to the impact of\na changing synthesized beam throughout the observations. We use simulated ALMA\nobservations to reproduce and quantify these effects and set a lower limit for\nthe variability that can be studied using our method in a complex region such\nas the ONC. Our results demonstrate that the utility of time domain analysis of\nYSOs extends into the millimeter-wavelength range, potentially interfering with\nthe conversion of observed fluxes into dust masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 18:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

In this work, we use TNG100 of the\nIllustrisTNG simulations to understand the role of environment on gas inflow\nrates in massive galaxies at z >= 2. We divide our galaxies (log(M*/Msolar )>=\n10.5) into cluster (log Mhalo/Msolar >= 13) and field (log Mhalo/Msolar < 13)\ngalaxies at z = 2 and further divide into centrals and satellites. We track\ntheir gas inflow rates from z = 6 to 2 and find that the total gas inflow rates\nof satellite galaxies rapidly decline after their infall into cluster halos and\nas they reach the cluster center. At z = 2, the gas inflow rate of cluster\nsatellite galaxies is correlated with the cluster-centric radii and not the\nhost halo mass. In contrast, the gas inflow rate in centrals is strongly\ncorrelated with the host halo mass at z >= 2. Our study indicates that between\nredshifts 6 to 2, the gas that normally is accreted by the satellite galaxies\nis redirected to the center of the cluster halo as inflows to the cluster\ncentrals and forming the intra-cluster medium. Our analysis suggest that the\ninequality of gas accretion between massive satellite and central galaxies is\nresponsible for the starvation of cluster satellite galaxies that evolve into\nthe massive quenched cluster galaxies observed at z<0.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 18:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

The wavelength calibration must be accurate within $5$\\AA to\navoid systematics in the redshifts and downstream cosmological parameters. The\nNISP pre-flight dispersion laws for the grisms were obtained on the ground\nusing a Fabry-Perot etalon. Launch vibrations, zero gravity conditions, and\nthermal stabilisation may alter these dispersion laws, requiring an in-flight\nrecalibration. To this end, we use the emission lines in the spectra of compact\nplanetary nebulae (PNe), which were selected from a PN data base. To ensure\ncompleteness of the PN sample, we developed a novel technique to identify\ncompact and strong line emitters in Gaia spectroscopic data using the Gaia\nspectra shape coefficients.

For a cubical graph\n$H$ and a hypercube $Q_n$, $ex(Q_n, H)$ is the largest number of edges in an\n$H$-free subgraph of $Q_n$. If $ex(Q_n, H)$ is equal to a positive proportion\nof the number of edges in $Q_n$, $H$ is said to have positive Tur\\'an density\nin a hypercube; otherwise it has zero Tur\\'an density. Determining $ex(Q_n, H)$\nand even identifying whether $H$ has positive or zero Tur\\'an density remains a\nwidely open question for general $H$.\n  In this paper we focus on layered graphs, i.e., graphs that are contained in\nan edge-layer of some hypercube.

This DF\nevolves under the combined influence of (i) tidal torques from the Galactic\ndisk and (ii) scattering by passing stars, molecular clouds, and substructure.\nRecently, Hamilton (2022) (H22) demonstrated that Galactic tides alone cannot\nproduce a superthermal eccentricity DF from an initially isotropic,\nnon-superthermal one, under the restrictive assumptions that the eccentricity\nDF was initially of power law form and then was rapidly phase-mixed toward a\nsteady state by the tidal perturbation. In this paper we first prove\nanalytically that H22's conclusions are in fact valid at all times, regardless\nof these assumptions. We then adopt H22's Galactic disk model and numerically\nintegrate the equations of motion for several ensembles of isotropically\noriented wide binaries to study the time evolution in detail. We find that even\nnon-power law DFs can be described by an effective power law index\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{eff}$ which accurately characterizes both their initial and\nfinal states. Any DF with initial (effective or exact) power law index\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{i}$ is transformed by Galactic tides into another power law\nwith index $\\alpha_\\mathrm{f} \\approx (1+\\alpha_\\mathrm{i})/2$ on a timescale\n$\\sim 2$ Gyr $(a/10^4\\mathrm{AU})^{-3/2}$.

We find that, due to symmetry and the\ntwo-center approximation, only one optical K-phonon (~ 160meV) of graphene is\nresponsible for inter-valley electron-phonon interaction. This phonon has\nrecently been found in angular-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy to be\nresponsible for replicas of the TBG flat bands. By projecting the interaction\nto the TBG flat bands, we perform the full symmetry analysis of phonon-mediated\nattractive interaction and pairing channels in the Chern basis, and show that\nseveral channels are guaranteed to have gapless order parameters. From the\nlinearized gap equations, we find that the highest Tc pairing induced by this\nphonon is a singlet gapped s-wave inter-Chern-band order parameter, followed\nclosely by a gapless nematic d-wave intra-Chern-band order parameter. We\njustify these results analytically, using the topological heavy fermion mapping\nof TBG which has allowed us to obtain an analytic form of phonon-mediated\nattractive interaction and to analytically solve the linearized and T=0 gap\nequations. For the intra-Chern-band channel, the nematic state with nodes is\nshown to be stabilized in the chiral flat band limit. While the flat band\nCoulomb interaction can be screened sufficiently enough - around Van-Hove\nsingularities - to allow for electron-phonon based superconductivity, it is\nunlikely that this effect can be maintained in the lower density of states\nexcitation bands around the correlated insulator states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 19:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

The need for\nincreasingly large datasets continues to be problematic, particularly in the\ncontext of medical imaging, where both annotation efforts and data protection\nresult in limited data availability. In this work, inspired by the human\ndecision-making process of correlating new ``evidence'' with previously\nmemorized ``experience'', we propose a Memorizing Vision Transformer (MoViT) to\nalleviate the need for large-scale datasets to successfully train and deploy\ntransformer-based architectures.

To prevent\noverfitting, we incorporate an innovative memory update scheme, attention\ntemporal moving average, to update the stored external memories with the\nhistorical moving average. For inference speedup, we design a prototypical\nattention learning method to distill the external memory into smaller\nrepresentative subsets. We evaluate our method on a public histology image\ndataset and an in-house MRI dataset, demonstrating that MoViT applied to varied\nmedical image analysis tasks, can outperform vanilla transformer models across\nvaried data regimes, especially in cases where only a small amount of annotated\ndata is available.

Existing backdoor defense methods often require accessing a\nfew validation data and model parameters, which are impractical in many\nreal-world applications, e.g., when the model is provided as a cloud service.\nIn this paper, we address the practical task of blind backdoor defense at test\ntime, in particular for black-box models. The true label of every test image\nneeds to be recovered on the fly from the hard label predictions of a\nsuspicious model. The heuristic trigger search in image space, however, is not\nscalable to complex triggers or high image resolution. We circumvent such\nbarrier by leveraging generic image generation models, and propose a framework\nof Blind Defense with Masked AutoEncoder (BDMAE).

The detection result is refined by considering the\ntopology of triggers. We obtain a purified test image from restorations for\nmaking prediction.

In general, our work advances the state of the art in\nthree aspects: 1) This work provides novel insights for brain-inspired AI: we\ncan utilize the principles found in BNNs to guide and improve our ANN\narchitecture design; 2) We show that there exist sweet spots of CP graphs that\nlead to CP-ViTs with significantly improved performance; and 3) The core nodes\nin CP-ViT correspond to task-related meaningful and important image patches,\nwhich can significantly enhance the interpretability of the trained deep model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 19:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Adversarial attacks have disastrous consequences for deep\nlearning-empowered critical applications. Existing defense and detection\ntechniques both require extensive knowledge of the model, testing inputs, and\neven execution details. They are not viable for general deep learning\nimplementations where the model internal is unknown, a common 'black-box'\nscenario for model users. Inspired by the fact that electromagnetic (EM)\nemanations of a model inference are dependent on both operations and data and\nmay contain footprints of different input classes, we propose a framework,\nEMShepherd, to capture EM traces of model execution, perform processing on\ntraces and exploit them for adversarial detection. Only benign samples and\ntheir EM traces are used to train the adversarial detector: a set of EM\nclassifiers and class-specific unsupervised anomaly detectors. When the victim\nmodel system is under attack by an adversarial example, the model execution\nwill be different from executions for the known classes, and the EM trace will\nbe different. We demonstrate that our air-gapped EMShepherd can effectively\ndetect different adversarial attacks on a commonly used FPGA deep learning\naccelerator for both Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. It achieves a 100%\ndetection rate on most types of adversarial samples, which is comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art 'white-box' software-based detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 19:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

However, in weakly turbulent disks where secular GI can operate, a dust\ndisk can be orders of magnitude thinner than a gas disk, and analyses treating\nthe vertical structures are necessary to clarify the interplay of the midplane\ndust motion and the upper gas motion.

Feasible solutions are agent trajectories in which all agents\nreach the target sooner or later. A special feature of our problem is that the\nagents are $p$-faulty, meaning that every attempt to change direction is an\nindependent Bernoulli trial with known probability $p$, where $p$ is the\nprobability that a turn fails. We are looking for agent trajectories that\nminimize the worst-case expected termination time, relative to competitive\nanalysis.\n  First, we study linear search with one deterministic $p$-faulty agent, i.e.,\nwith no access to random oracles, $p\\in (0,1/2)$. For this problem, we provide\ntrajectories that leverage the probabilistic faults into an algorithmic\nadvantage. Our strongest result pertains to a search algorithm (deterministic,\naside from the adversarial probabilistic faults) which, as $p\\to 0$, has\noptimal performance $4.59112+\\epsilon$, up to the additive term $\\epsilon$ that\ncan be arbitrarily small. Additionally, it has performance less than $9$ for\n$p\\leq 0.390388$. When $p\\to 1/2$, our algorithm has performance\n$\\Theta(1/(1-2p))$, which we also show is optimal up to a constant factor.\n  Second, we consider linear search with two $p$-faulty agents, $p\\in (0,1/2)$,\nfor which we provide three algorithms of different advantages, all with a\nbounded competitive ratio even as $p\\rightarrow 1/2$. Indeed, for this problem,\nwe show how the agents can simulate the trajectory of any $0$-faulty agent\n(deterministic or randomized), independently of the underlying communication\nmodel. As a result, searching with two agents allows for a solution with a\ncompetitive ratio of $9+\\epsilon$, or a competitive ratio of\n$4.59112+\\epsilon$.

We let the\nmodels race on a well-defined and application-relevant competition setting,\nwhere we illustrate and demonstrate our framework on 20 variables (qubits)\ngenerative modeling task. Our results suggest that QCBMs are more efficient in\nthe data-limited regime than the other state-of-the-art classical generative\nmodels. Such a feature is highly desirable in a wide range of real-world\napplications where the available data is scarce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 22:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

However, these jets are\noften highly variable and can travel across the resolution element of an image\nwithin a single observation, violating a fundamental assumption of aperture\nsynthesis. We present a novel approach in which we directly fit a single\ntime-dependent model to the full set of interferometer visibilities, where we\nexplicitly parameterise the motion and flux density variability of the emission\ncomponents, to minimise the number of free parameters in the fit, while\nleveraging information from the full observation. This technique allows us to\ndetect and characterize faint, fast-moving sources, for which the standard time\nbinning technique is inadequate. We validate our technique with synthetic\nobservations, before applying it to three Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)\nobservations of the black hole candidate LMXB MAXI J1803-298 during its 2021\noutburst.

This mapping takes the\ngeometry of the physical domain along with the boundary conditions as inputs to\noutput the steady state solution of the groundwater flow equation. To implement\nthe DeepONet, the authors approximate the top and bottom boundaries using\ntruncated Fourier series or piecewise linear representations. They present two\ndifferent implementations of the DeepONet: one where the Toth basin is embedded\nin a rectangular computational domain, and another where the Toth basin with\narbitrary top and bottom boundaries is mapped into a rectangular computational\ndomain via a nonlinear transformation.

Recent findings show\nthat the majority of classical Cepheids should be in binary or multiple\nsystems, which might undermine their accuracy, as the extra -- and unaccounted\nfor -- light from the companions of Cepheids causes a shift in the PLR. We\nquantify this shift using synthetic populations of binary Cepheids that we\ndeveloped for this purpose, as described in Paper I of this series. We find\nthat while all PLRs are shifted toward brighter values due to the excess light\nfrom the companions, the bias in the relative distance modulus between two\ngalaxies hosting binary Cepheids can be either positive or negative, depending\non the percentage of binary Cepheids in them. If the binarity percentage in the\ntwo galaxies is similar, the effect of binarity is canceled. Otherwise, it\nintroduces a shift in the distance modulus of the order of millimags in the\nnear-infrared passbands and Wesenheit indices, and tens of millimags in the\nvisual domain; its exact value depends on the variant of the synthetic\npopulation (a unique combination of metallicity, star formation history, shape\nand location of the instability strip, and initial parameter distributions).\nSuch shifts in distance moduli to type Ia supernova host galaxies introduce an\nadditional statistical error on $H_0$, which however does not prevent measuring\n$H_0$ with a precision of 1%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 01:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

We provide an important step toward a better understanding\nof the magnetorotational instability (MRI)-dust coevolution in protoplanetary\ndisks by presenting a proof of concept that dust evolution ultimately plays a\ncrucial role in the MRI activity. Methods. First, we study how a fixed\npower-law dust size distribution with varying parameters impacts the MRI\nactivity, especially the steady-state MRI-driven accretion, by employing and\nimproving our previous 1+1D MRI-driven turbulence model. Second, we relax the\nsteady-state accretion assumption in this disk accretion model, and partially\ncouple it to a dust evolution model in order to investigate how the evolution\nof dust (dynamics and grain growth processes combined) and MRI-driven accretion\nare intertwined on million-year timescales. Results. Dust coagulation and\nsettling lead to a higher gas ionization degree in the protoplanetary disk,\nresulting in stronger MRI-driven turbulence as well as a more compact dead\nzone. On the other hand, fragmentation has an opposite effect because it\nreplenishes the disk in small dust particles. Since the dust content of the\ndisk decreases over million years of evolution due to radial drift, the\nMRI-driven turbulence overall becomes stronger and the dead zone more compact\nuntil the disk dust-gas mixture eventually behaves as a grain-free plasma.\nFurthermore, our results show that dust evolution alone does not lead to a\ncomplete reactivation of the dead zone. Conclusions. The MRI activity evolution\n(hence the temporal evolution of the MRI-induced $\\alpha$-parameter) is\ncontrolled by dust evolution and occurs on a timescale of local dust growth, as\nlong as there is enough dust particles in the disk to dominate the\nrecombination process for the ionization chemistry. Once it is no longer the\ncase, it is expected to be controlled by gas evolution and occurs on a viscous\nevolution timescale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 01:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

In this paper, we\nfocus on the task of multilingual text classification and propose a debiasing\nframework for multilingual text classification based on contrastive learning.\nOur proposed method does not rely on any external language resources and can be\nextended to any other languages. The model contains four modules: multilingual\ntext representation module, language fusion module, text debiasing module, and\ntext classification module. The multilingual text representation module uses a\nmultilingual pre-trained language model to represent the text, the language\nfusion module makes the semantic spaces of different languages tend to be\nconsistent through contrastive learning, and the text debiasing module uses\ncontrastive learning to make the model unable to identify sensitive attributes'\ninformation.

This problem is mainly due to the common but often wrong assumption\nof such models that the source and target data come from the same i.i.d.\ndistribution. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown outstanding\nperformance for a broad range of computer vision tasks. However, very few\nstudies have investigated their ability to generalize to new domains. This\npaper presents a first Token-level Feature Stylization (TFS-ViT) approach for\ndomain generalization, which improves the performance of ViTs to unseen data by\nsynthesizing new domains. Our approach transforms token features by mixing the\nnormalization statistics of images from different domains. We further improve\nthis approach with a novel strategy for attention-aware stylization, which uses\nthe attention maps of class (CLS) tokens to compute and mix normalization\nstatistics of tokens corresponding to different image regions.

In this work, we propose a scene text\ndetector named Deformable Kernel Expansion (DKE), which incorporates the merits\nof both segmentation and contour-based detectors. DKE employs a segmentation\nmodule to segment the shrunken text region as the text kernel, then expands the\ntext kernel contour to obtain text boundary by regressing the vertex-wise\noffsets. Generating the text kernel by segmentation enables DKE to inherit the\narbitrary-shaped text region modeling capability of segmentation-based\ndetectors. Regressing the kernel contour with some sampled vertices enables DKE\nto avoid the complicated pixel-level post-processing and better learn contour\ndeformation as the contour-based detectors. Moreover, we propose an Optimal\nBipartite Graph Matching Loss (OBGML) that measures the matching error between\nthe predicted contour and the ground truth, which efficiently minimizes the\nglobal contour matching distance.

However, the\nvariance of the back-propagated gradients in intermediate blocks of ViTs may\nstill be large, which may make the generated adversarial samples focus on some\nmodel-specific features and get stuck in poor local optima. To overcome the\nshortcomings of existing approaches, we propose the Token Gradient\nRegularization (TGR) method. According to the structural characteristics of\nViTs, TGR reduces the variance of the back-propagated gradient in each internal\nblock of ViTs in a token-wise manner and utilizes the regularized gradient to\ngenerate adversarial samples. Extensive experiments on attacking both ViTs and\nCNNs confirm the superiority of our approach. Notably, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art transfer-based attacks, our TGR offers a performance\nimprovement of 8.8% on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 06:23:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 07:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

A well-known characteristic of natural images is that most patches\nare smooth, while high-content patches like textures or repetitive patterns are\nmuch rarer, which results in a long-tailed distribution. This distribution can\ncreate an inductive bias when training machine learning algorithms for image\nrestoration tasks and for image demosaicing in particular. There have been many\ndifferent approaches to address this challenge, such as utilizing specific\nlosses or designing special network architectures. What makes our work is\nunique in that it tackles the problem from a training protocol perspective. Our\nproposed training regime consists of two key steps. The first step is a\ndata-mining stage where sub-categories are created and then refined through an\nelimination process to only retain the most helpful sub-categories. The second\nstep is a cyclic training process where the neural network is trained on both\nthe mined sub-categories and the original dataset. We have conducted various\nexperiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our training method for the\nimage demosaicing task. Our results show that this method outperforms standard\ntraining across a range of architecture sizes and types, including CNNs and\nTransformers. Moreover, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art results with a\nsignificantly smaller neural network, compared to previous state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 07:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Most of the previous approaches utilize the entire features or\nobject-centric features to represent navigable candidates. However, these\nrepresentations are not efficient enough for an agent to perform actions to\narrive the target location. As knowledge provides crucial information which is\ncomplementary to visible content, in this paper, we propose a Knowledge\nEnhanced Reasoning Model (KERM) to leverage knowledge to improve agent\nnavigation ability. Specifically, we first retrieve facts (i.e., knowledge\ndescribed by language descriptions) for the navigation views based on local\nregions from the constructed knowledge base. The retrieved facts range from\nproperties of a single object (e.g., color, shape) to relationships between\nobjects (e.g., action, spatial position), providing crucial information for\nVLN. We further present the KERM which contains the purification, fact-aware\ninteraction, and instruction-guided aggregation modules to integrate visual,\nhistory, instruction, and fact features. The proposed KERM can automatically\nselect and gather crucial and relevant cues, obtaining more accurate action\nprediction.

Most existing works of 3D generative models\ndirectly take the Gaussian prior as input for the decoder to generate 3D point\nclouds, which fail to learn disentangled latent codes, leading noisy\ninterpolated results. Most of the GAN-based models fail to discriminate the\nlocal geometries, resulting in the point clouds generated not evenly\ndistributed at the object surface, hence degrading the point cloud generation\nquality. Moreover, prevailing methods adopt computation-intensive frameworks,\nsuch as flow-based models and Markov chains, which take plenty of time and\nresources in the training phase. To resolve these limitations, this paper\nproposes a unified style-aware network architecture combining both point-wise\ndistance loss and adversarial loss, StarNet which is able to reconstruct and\ngenerate high-fidelity and even 3D point clouds using a mapping network that\ncan effectively disentangle the Gaussian prior from input's high-level\nattributes in the mapped latent space to generate realistic interpolated\nobjects.

To investigate technical levels\nof front-crawl swimmers, a new model-based approach is introduced to obtain two\ncomplementary partitions reflecting, for each swimmer, its swimming pattern and\nits ability to reproduce it. Contrary to the usual approaches for functional\ndata clustering, the proposed approach also considers the information of the\nresiduals resulting from the functional basis decomposition. Indeed, after\ndecomposing into functional basis both the original signal (measuring the\nswimming pattern) and the signal of squared residuals (measuring the ability to\nreproduce the swimming pattern), the method fits the joint distribution of the\ncoefficients related to both decompositions by considering dependency between\nboth partitions.

MOSGs aim to simultaneously maximize all the heterogeneous payoffs,\ne.g., life, money, and crime rate, without merging heterogeneous attackers. In\nreal-world scenarios, the number of heterogeneous attackers and targets to be\nprotected may exceed the capability of most existing state-of-the-art methods,\ni.e., MOSGs are limited by the issue of scalability. To this end, this paper\nproposes a general framework called SDES based on many-objective evolutionary\nsearch to scale up MOSGs to large-scale targets and heterogeneous attackers.\nSDES consists of four consecutive key components, i.e., discretization,\noptimization, evaluation, and refinement. Specifically, SDES first discretizes\nthe originally high-dimensional continuous solution space to the\nlow-dimensional discrete one by the maximal indifference property in game\ntheory. This property helps evolutionary algorithms (EAs) bypass the\nhigh-dimensional step function and ensure a well-convergent Pareto front. Then,\na many-objective EA is used for optimization in the low-dimensional discrete\nsolution space to obtain a well-spaced Pareto front. To evaluate solutions,\nSDES restores solutions back to the original space via greedily optimizing a\nnovel divergence measurement. Finally, the refinement in SDES boosts the\noptimization performance with acceptable cost. Theoretically, we prove the\noptimization consistency and convergence of SDES. Experiment results show that\nSDES is the first linear-time MOSG algorithm for both large-scale attackers and\ntargets. SDES is able to solve up to 20 attackers and 100 targets MOSG\nproblems, while the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods can only solve up to 8\nattackers and 25 targets ones.

We supply a software package that enables\nresearchers to use these methods directly and thereby ensure the broad\napplicability of the proposed framework in ecological practice.\n  We show that our tuning strategy improves predictive performance. We\ndemonstrate how the AL pipeline reduces the amount of pre-labeled data needed\nto achieve a specific predictive performance and that it is especially valuable\nfor improving out-of-sample predictive performance.\n  We conclude that the combination of tuning and AL increases predictive\nperformance substantially. Furthermore, we argue that our work can broadly\nimpact the community through the ready-to-use software package provided.\nFinally, the publication of our models tailored to European wildlife data\nenriches existing model bases mostly trained on data from Africa and North\nAmerica.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 08:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

However, characterizing and\ncalibrating the effect of noise is not always feasible in practice. Especially\nfor quantum parameter estimation, an estimator constructed without precise\nknowledge of noise entails an inevitable bias. Recently, virtual\npurification-based error mitigation (VPEM) has been proposed to apply for\nquantum metrology to reduce such a bias occurring from unknown noise. While it\nwas demonstrated to work for particular cases, whether VPEM always reduces a\nbias for general estimation schemes is unclear yet. For more general\napplications of VPEM to quantum metrology, we study factors determining whether\nVPEM can reduce the bias. We find that the closeness between the dominant\neigenvector of a noisy state and the ideal quantum probe (without noise) with\nrespect to an observable determines the reducible amount of bias by VPEM. Next,\nwe show that one should carefully choose the reference point of the target\nparameter, which gives the smallest bias because the bias depends on the\nreference point. Otherwise, even if the dominant eigenvector and the ideal\nquantum probe are close, the bias of the mitigated case could be larger than\nthe non-mitigated one. %We emphasize that the optimal reference point is a\nunique feature that comes from the characteristic of quantum metrology.\nFinally, we analyze the error mitigation for a phase estimation scheme under\nvarious noises.

In this paper, we\nformulate a joint optimization model with three metrics, namely latency,\nsecurity, and computational cost, that are particularly important for\nIoT-enabled healthcare.

These techniques often use machine\nlearning models or deep learning models (such as LSTM) to make such\npredictions. However, these deep models are complex and difficult for users to\nunderstand. Counterfactuals answer ``what-if'' questions, which are used to\nunderstand the reasoning behind the predictions. For example, what if instead\nof emailing customers, customers are being called?

To address these problems, we develop a novel\nsynthetic method to simulate 4K hazy images (including nighttime and daytime\nscenes) from clear images, which first estimates the scene depth, simulates the\nlight rays and object reflectance, then migrates the synthetic images to real\ndomains by using a GAN, and finally yields the hazy effects on 4K resolution\nimages.

To first\norder, these measurements are characterised by the slope of the radial\nmetallicity profile, known as the metallicity gradient. In this work, we model\nthe relative role of star formation feedback, gas transport, cosmic gas\naccretion, and galactic winds in driving radial metallicity profiles and\nsetting the mass-metallicity gradient relation (MZGR). We include a\ncomprehensive treatment of these processes by including them as sources that\nsupply mass, metals, and energy to marginally unstable galactic discs in\npressure and energy balance. We show that both feedback and accretion that can\ndrive turbulence and enhance metal-mixing via diffusion are crucial to\nreproduce the observed MZGR in local galaxies. Metal transport also contributes\nto setting metallicity profiles, but it is sensitive to the strength of radial\ngas flows in galaxies. While the mass loading of galactic winds is important to\nreproduce the mass metallicity relation (MZR), we find that metal mass loading\nis more important to reproducing the MZGR. Specifically, our model predicts\npreferential metal enrichment of galactic winds in low-mass galaxies. This\nconclusion is robust against our adopted scaling of the wind mass-loading\nfactor, uncertainties in measured wind metallicities, and systematics due to\nmetallicity calibrations. Overall, we find that at $z \\sim 0$, galactic winds\nand metal transport are more important in setting metallicity gradients in\nlow-mass galaxies whereas star formation feedback and gas accretion dominate\nsetting metallicity gradients in massive galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 09:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

However, previous\nmethods have either produced unsatisfactory results or relied on complex\nsystems and paradigms. We wonder if there is a simple way to obtain\nstate-of-the-art results. Fortunately, we have identified two observations that\nhelp us achieve the best of both worlds: 1) query-based methods demonstrate\nsuperiority over dense proposal-based methods in open-world instance\nsegmentation, and 2) learning localization cues is sufficient for open world\ninstance segmentation. Based on these observations, we propose a simple\nquery-based method named OpenInst for open world instance segmentation.\nOpenInst leverages advanced query-based methods like QueryInst and focuses on\nlearning localization cues.

The highest average\nmagnetic moments are observed for the thinnest films considered, and with\nincreasing film thickness, the values converge towards the magnetic moment for\nbulk. The observed increase comes mainly from enhanced moments in the two\natomic monolayers closest to the surface of the films. The easy axis of\nmagnetization of (111) films prefers an alignment close to the tetragonal axis,\nan example of tilted magnetic anisotropy. The 6-monolayer (111) film (about\n1.3~nm thick) inclines the easy axis of magnetization of about 45{\\deg} to the\nfilm plane, which can find use in applications. The (010) films show an\nin-plane easy magnetization axis in a unique L1$_0$ tetragonal direction. This\nis an unusual type of in-plane anisotropy, as the particular direction\npreference is very strong.

To cater to these diverse applications, network slicing has become a\npopular tool for creating specialized virtual networks. However, resource\nfragmentation caused by uneven utilization of multidimensional resources can\nlead to reduced utilization of limited edge resources. To tackle this issue,\nthis paper focuses on addressing the multidimensional resource fragmentation\nproblem in virtual network embedding (VNE) in MEC systems with the aim of\nmaximizing the profit of an infrastructure provider (InP). The VNE problem in\nMEC systems is transformed into a bilevel optimization problem, taking into\naccount the interdependence between virtual node embedding (VNoE) and virtual\nlink embedding (VLiE). To solve this problem, we propose a nested bilevel\noptimization approach named BiVNE. The VNoE is solved using the ant colony\nsystem (ACS) in the upper level, while the VLiE is solved using a combination\nof a shortest path algorithm and an exact-fit spectrum slot allocation method\nin the lower level. Evaluation results show that the BiVNE algorithm can\neffectively enhance the profit of the InP by increasing the acceptance ratio\nand avoiding resource fragmentation simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 10:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Recently, a few\nquery-based action detectors are proposed to predict action instances in an\nend-to-end manner. However, they still lack adaptability in feature sampling\nand decoding, thus suffering from the issues of inferior performance or slower\nconvergence. In this paper, we propose a new one-stage sparse action detector,\ntermed STMixer. STMixer is based on two core designs. First, we present a\nquery-based adaptive feature sampling module, which endows our STMixer with the\nflexibility of mining a set of discriminative features from the entire\nspatiotemporal domain. Second, we devise a dual-branch feature mixing module,\nwhich allows our STMixer to dynamically attend to and mix video features along\nthe spatial and the temporal dimension respectively for better feature\ndecoding.

This allows covering wide spectral\nregimes with high sensitivity, as it is desired e.g. for cryogenic microwave\nspectroscopy.

Identifying the nature of\nindividual resonances ('designed' vs. 'spurious') can become challenging for\nhigher frequencies or if elements with unknown material properties are\nincluded, as is common for microwave spectroscopy. Here we discuss various\nexperimental strategies to distinguish designed and spurious modes in coplanar\nsuperconducting resonators that are operated in a broad frequency range up to\n20 GHz. These strategies include tracking resonance evolution as a function of\ntemperature, magnetic field, and microwave power.

Recently, it was revealed that\nthrough designing magnetic frustration in configurationally complex entropy\nstabilized oxides, exchange bias can occur in structurally single crystal\nfilms. This eliminates the need for complex heterostructures and nanocomposites\nin the design and control of magnetic response phenomena. In this work, we\ndemonstrate through hole doping of a high entropy perovskite oxide that tuning\nof magnetic responses can be achieved. With detailed magnetometry, we show\nmagnetic coupling exhibiting a variety of magnetic responses including exchange\nbias and antiferromagnetic spin reversal in the entropy stabilized ABO3\nperovskite oxide La1-xSrx(Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)O3 family.

This allows for the creation of highly\ntunable exchange bias responses. In the low Sr doping regime, a spin frustrated\nregion arising at the antiferromagnetic phase boundary is shown to directly\ncouple to the antiferromagnetic moments of the film and emerges as the dominant\nmechanism, leading to a vertical shift of magnetization loops in response to\nfield biasing. At higher concentrations, direct coupling of antiferromagnetic\nand ferromagnetic regions is observed. This tunability of magnetic coupling is\ndiscussed within the context of these three competing magnetic phases,\nrevealing critical features in designing exchange bias through exploiting spin\nfrustration and disorder in high entropy oxides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 12:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

This advancement has led to an increase\nin the data collection of electrophysiological signals. Due to this\nadvancement, electrocardiogram (ECG) signal monitoring has become a leading\ntask in the medical field. ECG plays an important role in the medical field by\nanalysing cardiac physiology and abnormalities. However, these signals are\naffected due to numerous varieties of noises, such as electrode motion,\nbaseline wander and white noise etc., which affects the diagnosis accuracy.\nTherefore, filtering ECG signals became an important task. Currently, deep\nlearning schemes are widely employed in signal-filtering tasks due to their\nefficient architecture of feature learning. This work presents a deep\nlearning-based scheme for ECG signal filtering, which is based on the deep\nautoencoder module. According to this scheme, the data is processed through the\nencoder and decoder layer to reconstruct by eliminating noises. The proposed\ndeep learning architecture uses a modified ReLU function to improve the\nlearning of attributes because standard ReLU cannot adapt to huge variations.\nFurther, a skip connection is also incorporated in the proposed architecture,\nwhich retains the key feature of the encoder layer while mapping these features\nto the decoder layer. Similarly, an attention model is also included, which\nperforms channel and spatial attention, which generates the robust map by using\nchannel and average pooling operations, resulting in improving the learning\nperformance.

MoS2/MoOy, a type II semiconductor\nheterostructure, has been shown to function as photocathode where during\ndischarge the lithium ion (Li-ion) intercalation happens mostly in MoS2 layers.\nPhotoexposure leads to exciton formation and the type II set-up is supposed to\ngenerate spatially separated and longer-lived charge carriers. The Li\nintercalated MoS2 is known to undergo a phase transition from the\nsemiconducting (2H) to a metallic (1T') phase. Hence, the proposal of exciton\nformation and its separation in LixMoS2 during photocharging needs closer\ninspection. In this study, with the help of density functional theory (DFT)\nbased studies that is aptly supported by experimental data, it is shown that\nLixMoS2/MoO3 forms a type II heterostructure where the underlying band gap of\nLixMoS2 is exposed due to dispersion of electron density onto MoO3 upto a\ncertain value of x. Further studies show that the type II arrangement is lost\nprior to the phase transition. In order to investigate the electronic structure\nand the phase transition upon lithiation in the explicit heterostructure, we\nintroduced two unconventional computational schemes. The presence of the band\ngap and the ensuing type II arrangement in LixMoS2/MoO3 upto a certain\nconcentration of the intercalated Li-ion justifies the possibility of the\nphotocharging process.

However, especially when the\nmean free path of the material under study is small, obtaining ballistic\ncontacts can be a major challenge. One of the signatures of a Maxwell\ncontribution to the contact resistance is the presence of \"dips\" in the\ndifferential conductance, associated to the sudden appearance of a Maxwell\nterm, in turn due to the attainment of the critical current of the material in\nthe contact region. Here we show that, using a proper model for the $R(I)$ of\nthe material under study, it is possible to fit the experimental curves\n(without the need of normalization) obtaining the correct values of the gap\namplitudes even in the presence of such dips, as well as the temperature\ndependence of the critical current in the contact.

Here, we introduce a new\nmachine learning approach based on the range corrected deep potential (DPRc)\nmodel to improve computing efficiency. The approach was applied to computing\n\\ch{C=O} stretching vibrational frequency shifts of formic acid-water solution.\nDPRc is adapted for frequency shift calculation. The system was divided into\n``probe region'' and ``solvent region'' by atom. Three kinds of ``probe\nregion'' were tested: single atom with atomic contribution correction, a single\natom, and a single molecule. All data sets were prepared using by Quantum\nVibration Perturbation (QVP) approach. The deep potential (DP) model was also\nadapted for frequency shift calculation for comparison, and different\ninteraction cut-off radii were tested. The single molecule ``probe region''\nresults show the best accuracy, running roughly ten times faster than regular\nDP, while reducing the training time by a factor of about four, making it fully\napplicable in practice. The results show that dropping information of\ninteraction distances between solvent atoms can significantly increase\ncomputing and training efficiency while ensuring little loss of accuracy.

Existing work primarily focuses on one human sharing autonomy\nwith a single robot. By contrast, in this paper we present an approach for\nmulti-robot shared autonomy that enables one operator to provide real-time\ncorrections across two coordinated robots completing the same task in parallel.\nSharing autonomy with multiple robots presents fundamental challenges. The\nhuman can only correct one robot at a time, and without coordination, the human\nmay be left idle for long periods of time. Accordingly, we develop an approach\nthat aligns the robot's learned motions to best utilize the human's expertise.\nOur key idea is to leverage Learning from Demonstration (LfD) and time warping\nto schedule the motions of the robots based on when they may require\nassistance. Our method uses variability in operator demonstrations to identify\nthe types of corrections an operator might apply during shared autonomy,\nleverages flexibility in how quickly the task was performed in demonstrations\nto aid in scheduling, and iteratively estimates the likelihood of when\ncorrections may be needed to ensure that only one robot is completing an action\nrequiring assistance. Through a preliminary simulated study, we show that our\nmethod can decrease the overall time spent sanding by iteratively estimating\nthe times when each robot could need assistance and generating an optimized\nschedule that allows the operator to provide corrections to each robot during\nthese times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 13:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

HRIEUV has a broad bandpass centered at 17.4 nm that is\ndominated by Fe ix and Fe x emission at about 1 MK. We study the thermal\nproperties of EUI brightening events by simultaneously observing their\nresponses at different wavelengths using spectral data from the Spectral\nImaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) also on board Solar Orbiter and\nimaging data from EUI.

We propose an intuitive partitioning of the space\nthat increases quality gains during training by distributing information evenly\namong the networks and avoids artifacts through a top-down adaptive refinement.\nOur framework is agnostic to the underlying NeRF method and easy to implement,\nwhich allows it to be applied to various NeRF variants for improved learning\nand rendering speeds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 14:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 11:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) and notably Deep\nLearning (DL) achieved impressive results in malware detection by learning\nuseful representations from data and have become a solution preferred over\ntraditional methods.

To quantitatively measure ion orbit loss, an\norbit-flux formulation has been developed and numerically applied to the\ngyrokinetic particle-in-cell code XGC. We study collisional ion orbit loss in\nan axisymmetric DIII-D L-mode plasma using gyrokinetic ions and drift-kinetic\nelectrons. Numerical simulations, where the plasma density and temperature\nprofiles are maintained through neutral ionization and heating, show the\nformation of a quasisteady negative $E_r$ in the edge. We have measured a\nradially outgoing ion gyrocenter flux due to collisional scattering of ions\ninto the loss orbits, which is balanced by the radially incoming ion gyrocenter\nflux from confined orbits on the collisional time scale. This suggests that\ncollisional ion orbit loss can shift $E_r$ in the negative direction compared\nto that in plasmas without orbit loss. It is also found that collisional ion\norbit loss can contribute to a radially outgoing (counter-current)\ntoroidal-angular-momentum flux, which is not balanced by the\ntoroidal-angular-momentum flux carried by ions on the confined orbits.\nTherefore, the edge toroidal rotation shifts in the co-current direction on the\ncollisional time scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 14:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

Our study is motivated by the fact that most\nof the existing source seeking methods follow the gradient direction of the\nsignal function and thus only lead to local convergence into a neighborhood of\nthe nearest local extremum. So far, only a few studies present ideas on how to\novercome local extrema in order to reach a global extremum. None of them apply\nto second-order (force- and torque-actuated) nonholonomic vehicles. We consider\nwhat is possibly the simplest conceivable algorithm for such vehicles, which\nemploys a constant torque and a translational/surge force in proportion to an\napproximately differentiated measured signal. We show that the algorithm steers\nthe unicycle through local extrema towards a global extremum. In contrast to\nthe previous extremum-seeking studies, in our analysis we do not approximate\nthe gradient of the objective function but of the objective function's local\nspatial average. Such a spatially averaged objective function is expected to\nhave fewer critical points than the original objective function. Under suitable\nassumptions on the averaged objective function and on sufficiently strong\ntranslational damping, we show that the control law achieves practical uniform\nasymptotic stability and robustness to sufficiently weak measurement noise and\ndisturbances to the force and torque inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 14:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

This study investigates\nthe suitability of the sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) algorithm\nfor parameterizing a multi-compartmental neuron model emulated on the BSS-2\nanalog neuromorphic hardware system. In contrast to other optimization methods\nsuch as genetic algorithms or stochastic searches, the SNPE algorithms belongs\nto the class of approximate Bayesian computing (ABC) methods and estimates the\nposterior distribution of the model parameters; access to the posterior allows\nclassifying the confidence in parameter estimations and unveiling correlation\nbetween model parameters.

For our\nmulti-compartmental model, we show that the approximated posterior is in\nagreement with experimental observations and that the identified correlation\nbetween parameters is in agreement with theoretical expectations. Furthermore,\nwe show that the algorithm can deal with high-dimensional observations and\nparameter spaces. These results suggest that the SNPE algorithm is a promising\napproach for automating the parameterization of complex models, especially when\ndealing with characteristic properties of analog neuromorphic substrates, such\nas trial-to-trial variations or limited parameter ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 15:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

User\nrepresentations will become out-of-date and lead to inappropriate\nrecommendations if user preference has shifted over time. To solve the issue,\nexisting work focuses on learning robust representations or predicting the\nshifting pattern. There lacks a comprehensive view to discover the underlying\nreasons for user preference shifts. To understand the preference shift, we\nabstract a causal graph to describe the generation procedure of user\ninteraction sequences. Assuming user preference is stable within a short\nperiod, we abstract the interaction sequence as a set of chronological\nenvironments. From the causal graph, we find that the changes of some\nunobserved factors (e.g., becoming pregnant) cause preference shifts between\nenvironments. Besides, the fine-grained user preference over categories\nsparsely affects the interactions with different items. Inspired by the causal\ngraph, our key considerations to handle preference shifts lie in modeling the\ninteraction generation procedure by: 1) capturing the preference shifts across\nenvironments for accurate preference prediction, and 2) disentangling the\nsparse influence from user preference to interactions for accurate effect\nestimation of preference. To this end, we propose a Causal Disentangled\nRecommendation (CDR) framework, which captures preference shifts via a temporal\nvariational autoencoder and learns the sparse influence from multiple\nenvironments. Specifically, an encoder is adopted to infer the unobserved\nfactors from user interactions while a decoder is to model the interaction\ngeneration process. Besides, we introduce two learnable matrices to disentangle\nthe sparse influence from user preference to interactions. Lastly, we devise a\nmulti-objective loss to optimize CDR.

The practical uncertainty of the target samples affects\nthe generalization performance of the learned model. Failing to choose a proper\nmodel or hypothesis class can lead to serious issues such as underfitting or\noverfitting.

These approaches can introduce new\nhyperparameters with their own new challenges and uncertainties or increase the\ncomputational complexity of the learning algorithm.

However, its\npopulation-based nature often suffers from the complex pruning optimization\nspace and the highly resource-consuming pruning structure verification process,\nwhich limits its application. To this end, this paper proposes an EMO joint\npruning with multiple sub-networks (EMO-PMS) to reduce space complexity and\nresource consumption. First, a divide-and-conquer EMO network pruning framework\nis proposed, which decomposes the complex EMO pruning task on the whole network\ninto easier sub-tasks on multiple sub-networks. On the one hand, this\ndecomposition reduces the pruning optimization space and decreases the\noptimization difficulty; on the other hand, the smaller network structure\nconverges faster, so the computational resource consumption of the proposed\nalgorithm is lower. Secondly, a sub-network training method based on\ncross-network constraints is designed so that the sub-network can process the\nfeatures generated by the previous one through feature constraints. This method\nallows sub-networks optimized independently to collaborate better and improves\nthe overall performance of the pruned network. Finally, a multiple sub-networks\njoint pruning method based on EMO is proposed. For one thing, it can accurately\nmeasure the feature processing capability of the sub-networks with the\npre-trained feature selector. For another, it can combine multi-objective\npruning results on multiple sub-networks through global performance impairment\nranking to design a joint pruning scheme. The proposed algorithm is validated\non three datasets with different challenging. Compared with fifteen advanced\npruning algorithms, the experiment results exhibit the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 12:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

On the other hand when a dust component\nis included, the question arises as whether the smoothing length approach can\nstill be used to quantify not only the dust self-gravity but also its\ngravitational interaction with gas.\n  We identified grey areas in the standard smoothing length formalism for\ncomputing self-gravity in PPDs uniquely made of gas. We revisit the smoothing\nlength approach which is then generalised to two phases when the dust component\ncan be considered as a pressureless fluid.\n  Analytical developments are used to approximate the vertically averaged\nself-gravity when the smoothing length is not assumed to be constant but rather\na spatial function.\n  We obtained an analytical expression for the space varying smoothing length,\nwhich strongly improves the accuracy of the self-gravity computation. For the\nfirst time, this method is generalised to address bi-fluid interactions in a\nPPD: two additional smoothing lengths are proposed for featuring an isolated\ndusty disc and gas-dust self-gravity interactions. We checked that our method\nremains compatible with standard fast Fourier transform algorithms and\nevaluated computational costs.\n  Our space varying smoothing length permits (i) to solve the contradictions\ninherent to a constant smoothing length hypothesis, (ii) to fit accurately the\n3D vertically averaged self-gravity and (iii) is applicable to a bi-fluid\ndescription of PPDs with the use of two additional smoothing lengths.

We introduce a novel approach to\nprobe media diet models -- language models adapted to online news, TV\nbroadcast, or radio show content -- that can emulate the opinions of\nsubpopulations that have consumed a set of media. To validate this method, we\nuse as ground truth the opinions expressed in U.S. nationally representative\nsurveys on COVID-19 and consumer confidence. Our studies indicate that this\napproach is (1) predictive of human judgements found in survey response\ndistributions and robust to phrasing and channels of media exposure, (2) more\naccurate at modeling people who follow media more closely, and (3) aligned with\nliterature on which types of opinions are affected by media consumption.\nProbing language models provides a powerful new method for investigating media\neffects, has practical applications in supplementing polls and forecasting\npublic opinion, and suggests a need for further study of the surprising\nfidelity with which neural language models can predict human responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 06:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

For\ngraphene devices to be used in real-world systems, it is necessary to\ndemonstrate competitive device performance, repeatability of results,\nreliability, and a path to large-scale manufacturing with high yield at low\ncost. Here, we select single-layer graphene electro-absorption modulators as\ntest vehicle and establish their wafer-scale integration in a 300mm pilot CMOS\nfoundry environment. A hardmask is used to shape graphene, while tungsten-based\ncontacts are fabricated using the damascene approach to enable CMOS-compatible\nfabrication. By analyzing data from hundreds of devices per wafer, the impact\nof specific processing steps on the performance could be identified and\noptimized. After optimization, modulation depth of 50 $\\pm$ 4 dB/mm is\ndemonstrated on 400 devices measured using 6 V peak-to-peak voltage.

Reinforcement learning approaches for dexterous\nrigid object manipulation would struggle in this setting due to the complexity\nof physics interaction with deformable objects. At the same time, previous\ntrajectory optimization approaches with differentiable physics for deformable\nmanipulation would suffer from local optima caused by the explosion of contact\nmodes from hand-object interactions. To address these challenges, we propose\nDexDeform, a principled framework that abstracts dexterous manipulation skills\nfrom human demonstration and refines the learned skills with differentiable\nphysics. Concretely, we first collect a small set of human demonstrations using\nteleoperation. And we then train a skill model using demonstrations for\nplanning over action abstractions in imagination. To explore the goal space, we\nfurther apply augmentations to the existing deformable shapes in demonstrations\nand use a gradient optimizer to refine the actions planned by the skill model.\nFinally, we adopt the refined trajectories as new demonstrations for finetuning\nthe skill model. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce a\nsuite of six challenging dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks.\nCompared with baselines, DexDeform is able to better explore and generalize\nacross novel goals unseen in the initial human demonstrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 17:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

However,\napplying these models to new datasets, particularly from wearable devices,\nraises two questions. First, when annotations on a target dataset are\nunavailable, which different data characteristics affect the sleep stage\nscoring performance the most and by how much? Second, when annotations are\navailable, which dataset should be used as the source of transfer learning to\noptimize performance? In this paper, we propose a novel method for\ncomputationally quantifying the impact of different data characteristics on the\ntransferability of deep learning models. Quantification is accomplished by\ntraining and evaluating two models with significant architectural differences,\nTinySleepNet and U-Time, under various transfer configurations in which the\nsource and target datasets have different recording channels, recording\nenvironments, and subject conditions. For the first question, the environment\nhad the highest impact on sleep stage scoring performance, with performance\ndegrading by over 14% when sleep annotations were unavailable. For the second\nquestion, the most useful transfer sources for TinySleepNet and the U-Time\nmodels were MASS-SS1 and ISRUC-SG1, containing a high percentage of N1 (the\nrarest sleep stage) relative to the others. The frontal and central EEGs were\npreferred for TinySleepNet. The proposed approach enables full utilization of\nexisting sleep datasets for training and planning model transfer to maximize\nthe sleep stage scoring performance on a target problem when sleep annotations\nare limited or unavailable, supporting the realization of remote sleep\nmonitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 07:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

A poverty\nstricken South Asian country like Bangladesh has been bearing the brunt of the\nCOVID19 pandemic since its beginning.

Since on-time treatment is essential, this system will allow doctors\nand medical staff to receive patient information in real time and deliver their\nservices immediately to the patient regardless of their location.
