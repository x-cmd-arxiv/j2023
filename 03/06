This ignites a few recent striking-back research in the CNN world\nshowing that pure CNN models can achieve as good performance as ViT models when\ncarefully tuned. While encouraging, designing such high-performance CNN models\nis challenging, requiring non-trivial prior knowledge of network design. To\nthis end, a novel framework termed Mathematical Architecture Design for Deep\nCNN (DeepMAD) is proposed to design high-performance CNN models in a principled\nway. In DeepMAD, a CNN network is modeled as an information processing system\nwhose expressiveness and effectiveness can be analytically formulated by their\nstructural parameters. Then a constrained mathematical programming (MP) problem\nis proposed to optimize these structural parameters. The MP problem can be\neasily solved by off-the-shelf MP solvers on CPUs with a small memory\nfootprint. In addition, DeepMAD is a pure mathematical framework: no GPU or\ntraining data is required during network design. The superiority of DeepMAD is\nvalidated on multiple large-scale computer vision benchmark datasets.

To some extent, this is due to the fact that\nthese techniques do not pay sufficient attention to structural properties of\nthe query. In stark contrast, the Database Theory community has intensively\nstudied structural properties of queries (such as acyclicity and various\nnotions of width) and proposed efficient query evaluation techniques through\nvariants of Yannakakis' algorithm. However, although most queries in practice\nactually are acyclic or have low width, structure-guided query evaluation\ntechniques based on Yannakakis' algorithm have not found their way into\nmainstream database technology yet. The goal of this work is to address this\ngap between theory and practice and to demonstrate that the consideration of\nquery structure can improve query evaluation performance on modern DBMSs\nsignificantly in cases that have been traditionally challenging. In particular,\nwe study the performance of structure-guided query evaluation in three\narchitecturally distinct DBMSs by rewriting SQL queries into a sequence of SQL\nstatements that express an execution of Yannakakis' algorithm. Moreover, we\nidentify a class of queries that is particularly well suited for our approach\nand allows query answering in a variety of common scenarios without\nmaterializing any join. Through empirical evaluation we show that\nstructure-guided query evaluation can make the evaluation of many difficult\njoin queries feasible whereas their evaluation requires a prohibitive amount of\ntime and memory on current DBMSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 17:43:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 11:00:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 15:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Existing self-training methods\nusually adopt the popular region-based mixup techniques with a random sampling\nstrategy, which unfortunately ignores the dynamic evolution of different\nsemantics across various domains as training proceeds. To improve the UDA-SS\nperformance, we propose an Informed Domain Adaptation (IDA) model, a\nself-training framework that mixes the data based on class-level segmentation\nperformance, which aims to emphasize small-region semantics during mixup. In\nour IDA model, the class-level performance is tracked by an expected confidence\nscore (ECS). We then use a dynamic schedule to determine the mixing ratio for\ndata in different domains.

Following the central limit theorem, SGN was\ninitially modeled as Gaussian, and lately, it has been suggested that\nstochastic gradient noise is better characterized using $S\\alpha S$ L\\'evy\ndistribution. This claim was allegedly refuted and rebounded to the previously\nsuggested Gaussian noise model. This paper presents solid, detailed empirical\nevidence that SGN is heavy-tailed and better depicted by the $S\\alpha S$\ndistribution. Furthermore, we argue that different parameters in a deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) hold distinct SGN characteristics throughout training. To more\naccurately approximate the dynamics of SGD near a local minimum, we construct a\nnovel framework in $\\mathbb{R}^N$, based on L\\'evy-driven stochastic\ndifferential equation (SDE), where one-dimensional L\\'evy processes model each\nparameter in the DNN. Next, we show that SGN jump intensity (frequency and\namplitude) depends on the learning rate decay mechanism (LRdecay); furthermore,\nwe demonstrate empirically that the LRdecay effect may stem from the reduction\nof the SGN and not the decrease in the step size. Based on our analysis, we\nexamine the mean escape time, trapping probability, and more properties of DNNs\nnear local minima. Finally, we prove that the training process will likely exit\nfrom the basin in the direction of parameters with heavier tail SGN.

We propose a simple criterion that if the holographic\ncomplexity of a geometry with naked timelike singularities is less than that of\nempty AdS, then that singularity cannot arise in the semiclassical limit of a\nUV-complete theory of quantum gravity. Our study strongly suggests that action\ncomplexity (CA) is a sensitive tool to investigate timelike singularities,\nbeing in sync with Gubser criterion in all cases.

At low ratios, blurriness is observed and as compression increases\nblocking artifacts occur. Generally, in order to reduce blockiness, images are\nlow-pass filtered which leads to more blurriness. Also, in bokeh mode images\nthey are commonly seen: blurriness as a result of intentional blurred\nbackground while blocking artifact and global blurriness arising due to\ncompression. Therefore, such visual media suffer from both blockiness and\nblurriness distortions. Along with this, noise is also commonly encountered\ndistortion. Most of the existing works on quality assessment quantify these\ndistortions individually. This paper proposes a methodology to blindly measure\noverall quality of an image suffering from these distortions, individually as\nwell as jointly. This is achieved by considering the sum of absolute values of\nlow and high-frequency Discrete Frequency Transform (DFT) coefficients defined\nas sum magnitudes. The number of blocks lying in specific ranges of sum\nmagnitudes including zero-valued AC coefficients and mean of 100 maximum and\n100 minimum values of these sum magnitudes are used as feature vectors. These\nfeatures are then fed to the Machine Learning (ML) based Gaussian Process\nRegression (GPR) model, which quantifies the image quality. The simulation\nresults show that the proposed method can estimate the quality of images\ndistorted with the blockiness, blurriness, noise and their combinations. It is\nrelatively fast compared to many state-of-art methods, and therefore is\nsuitable for real-time quality monitoring applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 19:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Causal constraints reduce the number\nof independent degrees of freedom, impose new angular symmetries, and eliminate\ncosmic variance for purely angular 2-point correlations. Distortions of causal\nstructure from vacuum fluctuations are modeled as gravitational memory from\nrandomly oriented outgoing and incoming gravitational null shocks, with\nnonlocally coherent directional displacements on curved surfaces of causal\ndiamonds formed by standard inflationary horizons. The angular distribution is\ndetermined by axially symmetric shock displacements on circular intersections\nof the comoving sphere that represents the CMB photosphere with other\ninflationary horizons.

ML models perform exceedingly well when test examples are similar\nto train examples. However, real-world applications are required to perform on\nany distribution of test examples. Current ML systems can fail silently on test\nexamples with distribution shifts. In order to improve reliability of ML models\ndue to covariate or domain shift, we propose algorithms that enable models to:\n(a) generalize to a larger family of test distributions, (b) evaluate accuracy\nunder distribution shifts, (c) adapt to a target distribution. We study causes\nof impaired robustness to domain shifts and present algorithms for training\ndomain robust models. A key source of model brittleness is due to domain\noverfitting, which our new training algorithms suppress and instead encourage\ndomain-general hypotheses. While we improve robustness over standard training\nmethods for certain problem settings, performance of ML systems can still vary\ndrastically with domain shifts. It is crucial for developers and stakeholders\nto understand model vulnerabilities and operational ranges of input, which\ncould be assessed on the fly during the deployment, albeit at a great cost.\nInstead, we advocate for proactively estimating accuracy surfaces over any\ncombination of prespecified and interpretable domain shifts for performance\nforecasting. We present a label-efficient estimation to address estimation over\na combinatorial space of domain shifts. Further, when a model's performance on\na target domain is found to be poor, traditional approaches adapt the model\nusing the target domain's resources. Standard adaptation methods assume access\nto sufficient labeled resources, which may be impractical for deployed models.\nWe initiate a study of lightweight adaptation techniques with only unlabeled\ndata resources with a focus on language applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 21:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

How Mg$^{2+}$ ions direct the folding kinetics is a\nlong-standing unsolved problem because experiments cannot detect the positions\nand dynamics of ions as the ribozyme assembles. To solve this problem, we used\nmolecular simulations to dissect the folding kinetics of the Azoarcus ribozyme\nby monitoring the path each molecule takes to reach the folded state. We\nestablish quantitatively that Mg$^{2+}$ binding to specific sites, coupled with\ncounter-ion release of monovalent cations, stimulate the formation of secondary\nand tertiary structures, leading to diverse pathways that include direct rapid\nfolding and trapping in a manifold of misfolded structures. Assembly of the\nAzoarcus ribozyme begins only after Mg$^{2+}$ ions condense onto RNA,\ndisplacing the monovalent cations in the process. In some molecules, key\ntertiary structural elements form when Mg$^{2+}$ ions bind to specific RNA\nsites, at the earliest stages of the folding, leading to specific collapse and\nrapid formation of the folded structure. In others, the formation of non-native\nbase pairs, whose rearrangement is needed to reach the folded state, is the\nrate-limiting step. Escape from energetic traps, driven by thermal\nfluctuations, occurs readily. In contrast, the transition to the native state\nfrom long-lived topologically trapped native-like metastable states is\nextremely slow. Specific collapse and formation of energetically or\ntopologically frustrated states occur early in the assembly process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 22:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

However, some challenges with the\nimplementation of these models in plane-wave simulation packages still\npersists, especially when the goal is to simulate complex and heterogeneous\nenvironments. Among these challenges is the computational cost associated with\nlarge heterogeneous environments, which in plane-wave simulations has a direct\neffect on the basis-set size and, as a result, on the cost of the electronic\nstructure calculation. Moreover, the use of periodic simulation cells are not\nwell-suited for modeling systems embedded in semi-infinite media, which is\noften the case in continuum solvation models. To address these challenges, we\npresent the implementation of a double-cell formalism, in which the simulation\ncell used for the continuum environment is uncoupled from the one used for the\nelectronic-structure simulation of the quantum-mechanical system. This allows\nfor a larger simulation cell to be used for the environment, without\nsignificantly increasing computational time.

The development of optical frequency combs has enabled the\npowerful technique of optical frequency division (OFD) to produce microwave\noscillations of the highest quality. The approaches for OFD demonstrated to\ndate demand multiple lasers with space- and energy-consuming optical\nstabilization and electronic feedback components, resulting in device\nfootprints incompatible with integration into a compact and robust photonic\nplatform. Here, we demonstrate all-optical OFD on a single photonic chip driven\nwith a single continuous-wave laser. We generate a dual-point frequency\nreference using the beat frequency of the signal and idler fields from a\nmicroresonator-based optical parametric oscillator (OPO), which achieves high\nphase stability due to the inherently strong signal-idler frequency\ncorrelations. We implement OFD by optically injecting the signal and idler\nfields from the OPO to a Kerr-comb microresonator on the same chip. We show\nthat the two distinct dynamical states of Kerr cavities can be passively\nsynchronized, allowing broadband frequency locking of the comb state, which\ntransfers the stability of the OPO frequencies to the repetition rate of the\nKerr comb. A 630-fold phase-noise reduction is observed when the Kerr comb is\nsynchronized to the OPO, which represents the lowest noise generated on the\nsilicon-nitride platform. Our work demonstrates a simple, effective approach\nfor performing OFD and provides a pathway toward chip-scale devices that can\ngenerate microwave frequencies comparable to the purest tones produced in\nmetrological laboratories.

Our work introduces a visual analytics\napproach to understanding adversarial attacks by answering two questions: (1)\nwhich neurons are more vulnerable to attacks and (2) which image features do\nthese vulnerable neurons capture during the prediction? For the first question,\nwe introduce multiple perturbation-based measures to break down the attacking\nmagnitude into individual CNN neurons and rank the neurons by their\nvulnerability levels. For the second, we identify image features (e.g., cat\nears) that highly stimulate a user-selected neuron to augment and validate the\nneuron's responsibility. Furthermore, we support an interactive exploration of\na large number of neurons by aiding with hierarchical clustering based on the\nneurons' roles in the prediction. To this end, a visual analytics system is\ndesigned to incorporate visual reasoning for interpreting adversarial attacks.\nWe validate the effectiveness of our system through multiple case studies as\nwell as feedback from domain experts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 01:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

Supervised deep\nlearning-based techniques are currently considered state-of-the-art for this\ntask. However, these methods require pixel-wise ground-truth labels, which can\nbe time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised\nframework that can perform background subtraction without requiring per-pixel\nground-truth labels. Our framework is trained on a moving object-free sequence\nof images and comprises two networks. The first network is an autoencoder that\ngenerates background images and prepares dynamic background images for training\nthe second network. The dynamic background images are obtained by thresholding\nthe background-subtracted images. The second network is a U-Net that uses the\nsame object-free video for training and the dynamic background images as\npixel-wise ground-truth labels. During the test phase, the input images are\nprocessed by the autoencoder and U-Net, which generate background and dynamic\nbackground images, respectively. The dynamic background image helps remove\ndynamic motion from the background-subtracted image, enabling us to obtain a\nforeground image that is free of dynamic artifacts.

To\nenable an improved understanding of SiC-SiC composite performance, the\ndevelopment of non-destructive evaluation techniques to assess critical defects\nis needed. Three-dimensional (3D) X-ray imaging, also referred to as X-ray\ncomputed tomography (CT), is a non-destructive, data-rich characterization\ntechnique that can provide surface and subsurface spatial information. This\npaper discusses the design and implementation of a fully automatic workflow to\ndetect and analyze SiC-SiC defects using image processing techniques on 3D\nX-ray images. The workflow consists of four processing blocks, including data\npreparation, void/crack detection, visualization, and analysis. In this work,\nthree SiC samples (two irradiated and one unirradiated) provided by General\nAtomics are investigated. The irradiated samples were exposed in a way that was\nexpected to induce cracking, and indeed, the automated workflow developed in\nthis work was able to successfully identify and characterize the crack\nformation in the irradiated samples while detecting no observed cracking in the\nunirradiated sample. These results demonstrate the value of automated XCT tools\nto better understand the damage and damage propagation in SiC-SiC structures\nfor nuclear applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 04:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Reinforcement learning\nwith human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a strong candidate toward allowing\nagents to learn from human feedback in a naturalistic manner. RLHF is distinct\nfrom traditional reinforcement learning as it provides feedback from a human\nteacher in addition to a reward signal.

The\nwide applicability and burgeoning success of RLHF strongly motivate the need to\nevaluate its social impacts. In light of recent developments, this paper\nconsiders an important question: can RLHF be developed and used without\nnegatively affecting human societies? Our objectives are threefold: to provide\na systematic study of the social effects of RLHF; to identify key social and\nethical issues of RLHF; and to discuss social impacts for stakeholders.\nAlthough text-based applications of RLHF have received much attention, it is\ncrucial to consider when evaluating its social implications the diverse range\nof areas to which it may be deployed.

Social cues are a form of communication\n(i.e., information flow) between people. In this paper, a framework is\nintroduced to detect and analyse social cues and information transfer\ndirectionality using an information-theoretic measure, namely, transfer\nentropy. We demonstrate the framework in three settings involving social\ninteractions between humans: object-handover, group-joining and\nperson-following. Results show that transfer entropy can identify information\nflows between agents, when and where they occur, and their relative strength.\nFor instance, in a person-following scenario, we find that head orientation of\na predictor is particularly informative, and the different times and locations\nthat this is used to convey information to a leader influences their behaviour.\nPotential applications of the framework include information flow or social cue\nanalysis for interactive robot design, or socially-aware robot planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 05:43:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 04:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

For point cloud grasp network\nalgorithms, the network input is essentially the internal point cloud of the\ngrasp area that intersects with the object in the gripper coordinate system.\nDue to the existence of a large number of completely consistent gripper area\npoint clouds based on the gripper coordinate system in the grasp dataset\ngenerated for hundreds of objects, it is possible to remove the consistent\ngripper area point clouds from many objects and assemble them into a single\nobject to generate the grasp dataset, thus replacing the enormous workload of\ngenerating grasp datasets for hundreds of objects. We propose a new approach to\nmap the repetitive features of a large number of objects onto a finite set.To\nthis end, we propose a method for extracting the gripper area point cloud that\nintersects with the object from the simulator and design a gripper feature\nfilter to remove the shape-repeated gripper space area point clouds, and then\nassemble them into a single object.

To gain insights into the correlated behavior, we investigate the\neffect of high magnetic fields on the samples of $x = 0.4$ and $0.5$ using\nmagnetostriction and magnetization measurements up to 60 T. The samples are in\nthe Eu valence fluctuating regime, where the possible structural transition\nfrom cT to ucT may be induced by the Eu valence change under the magnetic\nfields. For both samples, magnetostriction smoothly increases with increasing\nmagnetic fields. The behavior is in good agreement with the calculated results\nusing the interconfigurational fluctuation (ICF) model that describes the\nvalence change. This indicates that $\\Delta L$ represents the change of the Eu\nvalence state in these compounds.

Different from existing deep learning-based cortical surface\nreconstruction methods that either reconstruct the cortical surfaces separately\nor neglect the interdependence between the inner and outer surfaces, SurfNN\nreconstructs both the inner and outer cortical surfaces jointly by training a\nsingle network to predict a midthickness surface that lies at the center of the\ninner and outer cortical surfaces. The input of SurfNN consists of a 3D MRI and\nan initialization of the midthickness surface that is represented both\nimplicitly as a 3D distance map and explicitly as a triangular mesh with\nspherical topology, and its output includes both the inner and outer cortical\nsurfaces, as well as the midthickness surface.

We create a transformation between\ntwo N-dimensional objects by casting this as a scattered data interpolation\nproblem in N + 1 dimensions. For the case of 2D shapes, we place all of our\ndata constraints within two planes, one for each shape. These planes are placed\nparallel to one another in 3D. Zero-valued constraints specify the locations of\nshape boundaries and positive-valued constraints are placed along the normal\ndirection in towards the center of the shape. We then invoke a variational\ninterpolation technique (the 3D generalization of thin-plate interpolation),\nand this yields a single implicit function in 3D. Intermediate shapes are\nsimply the zero-valued contours of 2D slices through this 3D function. Shape\ntransformation between 3D shapes can be performed similarly by solving a 4D\ninterpolation problem. To our knowledge, ours is the first shape transformation\nmethod to unify the tasks of implicit function creation and interpolation. The\ntransformations produced by this method appear smooth and natural, even between\nobjects of differing topologies.

Segmentation of dilated pancreatic ducts on computed tomography (CT)\nimages shows the potential to assist the early diagnosis, surgical planning and\nprognosis. Because of the ducts' tiny sizes, slender tubular structures and the\nsurrounding distractions, most current researches on pancreatic duct\nsegmentation achieve low accuracy and always have segmentation errors on the\nterminal parts of the ducts. To address these problems, we propose a terminal\nguidance mechanism called cascaded terminal guidance network (CTG-Net).\nFirstly, a terminal attention mechanism is established on the skeletons\nextracted from the coarse predictions. Then, to get fine terminal segmentation,\na subnetwork is designed for jointly learning the local intensity from the\noriginal images, feature cues from coarse predictions and global anatomy\ninformation from the pancreas distance transform maps. Finally, a terminal\ndistraction attention module which explicitly learns the distribution of the\nterminal distraction is proposed to reduce the false positive and false\nnegative predictions. We also propose a new metric called tDice to measure the\nterminal segmentation accuracy for targets with tubular structures and two\nsegmentation metrics for distractions. We collect our dilated pancreatic duct\nsegmentation dataset with 150 CT scans from patients with 5 types of pancreatic\ntumors. Experimental results on our dataset show that our proposed approach\nboosts dilated pancreatic duct segmentation accuracy by nearly 20% compared\nwith the existing results, and achieves more than 9% improvement for the\nterminal segmentation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 07:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

The DwinFormer consists of dual window\nself-attention and cross-attention transformers, Dwin-SAT and Dwin-CAT,\nrespectively.

It harnesses the power of\nlocal and global window attention to adeptly capture both short-range and\nlong-range dependencies, obviating the need for complex and computationally\nexpensive operations, such as attention masking or window shifting.

Using a linear reduced space is\ninefficient for time-dependent nonlinear problems, especially for\ntransport-dominated problems. The non-linearity usually needs to be addressed\nby hyper-reduction techniques, such as DEIM, but it is intrusive and relies on\nthe assumption of affine dependence of parameters. This paper proposes and\nstudies a non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approach for time-dependent\nparametrized problems.

We study the angular\nmomentum density of the domain wall arising because of the presence of the\nspinor field creating the wall. The properties of test fermions located on an\narbitrary domain wall are considered. The concepts of the ``second spin''\n(arising due to the properties of the Lorentz group generators in a\nfive-dimensional spacetime) and of the ``second magnetic field'' (representing\nthe components $F_{i 5}$ of the electromagnetic field five-tensor) are\nintroduced. We find eigenspinors of the ``second spin'' and show that some of\nthem represent the Bell states. In the nonrelativistic limit we derive the\nPauli equation for the test fermions on the domain wall which contains an extra\nterm describing the interaction of a spin-$1/2$ particle with the ``second\nmagnetic field''; this allows the possibility of an experimental verification\nof the existence of extra dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 09:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

In the building sector, particularly, strategic urban energy\nplanning engenders large optimization problems across multiple spatiotemporal\nscales leading to necessary system scope simplifications. This has resulted in\ndisconnected system scales, namely, building occupants and smart-city energy\nnetworks. This paper intends on bridging these disjointed scales to secure both\nresilient and more energy-efficient urban planning thanks to a holistic\napproach. The intent is to assess the aggregated impact of user behavior\nstochasticities on optimal urban energy planning. To this end, a stochastic\nenergy community sizing and operation problem is designed, encompassing\nmulti-level utilities founded on energy hub concepts for improved energy and\ncarbon emission efficiencies. To secure the scalability of our approach, an\norganic spatial problem distribution suitable for field deployment is put\nforth, validated by a proof of concept. Uncertainty factors affecting urban\nenergy planning are particularly examined through a local sensitivity analysis,\nnamely, economic, climate, and occupant-behavior uncertainties.

Prior arts approach to zero-shot captioning by either utilizing the\nexisting large language models (e.g., GPT-2) or pre-training the\nencoder-decoder network in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we propose a\nsimple framework, named DeCap, for zero-shot captioning. We introduce a\nlightweight visual-aware language decoder. This decoder is both data-efficient\nand computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the text data for training,\neasing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require\nend-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the\ntext embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix\nembedding. The challenge is that the decoder is trained on the text corpus but\nat the inference stage, it needs to generate captions based on visual inputs.\nThe modality gap issue is widely observed in multi-modal contrastive models\nthat prevents us from directly taking the visual embedding as the prefix\nembedding. We propose a training-free mechanism to reduce the modality gap. We\nproject the visual embedding into the CLIP text embedding space, while the\nprojected embedding retains the information of the visual input. Taking the\nprojected embedding as the prefix embedding, the decoder generates high-quality\ndescriptions that match the visual input.

Towards this, in the current paper we propose a technique to compute\nan effective distance measure between two multi-fields by computing a novel\nmulti-dimensional persistence diagram (MDPD) corresponding to each of the\n(quantized) Reeb spaces. First, we construct a multi-dimensional Reeb graph\n(MDRG), which is a hierarchical decomposition of the Reeb space into a\ncollection of Reeb graphs.

Measurements of total solar\nirradiance exist since 1978, but this is too short compared to climate-relevant\ntime scales. Coming from a number of different instruments, these measurements\nrequire a cross-calibration, which is not straightforward, and thus several\ncomposite records have been created. All of them suggest a marginally\ndecreasing trend since 1996. Most composites also feature a weak decrease over\nthe entire period of observations, which is also seen in observations of the\nsolar surface magnetic field and is further supported by Ca II K data. Some\ninconsistencies, however, remain and overall the magnitude and even the\npresence of the long-term trend remain uncertain. Different models have been\ndeveloped, which are used to understand the irradiance variability over the\nsatellite period and to extend the records of solar irradiance back in time.\nDiffering in their methodologies, all models require proxies of solar magnetic\nactivity as input. The most widely used proxies are sunspot records and\ncosmogenic isotope data on centennial and millennial time scale, respectively.\nNone of this, however, offers a sufficiently good, independent description of\nthe long-term evolution of faculae and network responsible for solar\nbrightening. This leads to uncertainty in the amplitude of the long-term\nchanges in solar irradiance. Here we review recent efforts to improve\nirradiance reconstructions on time scales longer than the solar cycle and to\nreduce the existing uncertainty in the magnitude of the long-term variability.\nIn particular, we highlight the potential of using 3D magnetohydrodynamical\nsimulations of the solar atmosphere as input to more physical irradiance models\nand of historical full-disc Ca II K observations encrypting direct facular\ninformation back to 1892.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 11:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

In these experiments, mild dynamical heating via focused\ninfrared light from a laser leads to long-range, thermoviscous flows of the\ncytoplasm inside a cell, a method popularised in cell biology as FLUCS\n(focused-light-induced cytoplasmic streaming). Here, we present a fully\nanalytical, theoretical model describing the fluid flow and transport of\ntracers induced by the laser at all length scales in two-dimensional\nconfinement. The focused light causes a small, local temperature change, which\nin turn results in a small change in the density and viscosity of the fluid\nlocally. We analytically solve for the instantaneous flow field due to the\ntranslation of a heat spot of arbitrary time-dependent amplitude along a scan\npath. We show that the leading-order instantaneous flow results purely from\nthermal expansion. It is proportional to the magnitude of the temperature\nperturbation, with far-field behaviour typically dominated by a source or sink\nflow and proportional to the rate of change of the heat-spot amplitude. In\ncontrast, and in agreement with experimental measurements, the net displacement\nof a tracer due to a full scan of the heat spot is quadratic in the heat-spot\namplitude, as it results from the interplay of thermal expansion and thermal\nviscosity changes. The corresponding average velocity of tracers over a scan is\na hydrodynamic source dipole in the far field, with direction dependent on the\nrelative importance of thermal expansion and thermal viscosity changes. Our\nquantitative findings show excellent agreement with recent experimental results\nand will enable the design of new controlled experiments to establish the\nphysiological role of physical transport processes inside cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 12:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

The effect of non-extensivity is encoded in the\nnon-extensive Tsallis distribution function, where the deviation of the\nparameter $q$ from 1 signifies the degree of non-extensivity in the concerned\nsystem. The thermal and electrical conductivities are found to increase with\nthe introduction of non-extensivity, which means that the deviation of the\nmedium from thermal equilibrium enhances both charge and heat transports.

We examine the shortcomings of this\napproach and propose an alternative framework for generating SICR-definitions,\nbased on three parameters: delinquency, stickiness, and the outcome period.\nHaving varied these parameters, we obtain 27 unique SICR-definitions and fit\nlogistic regression models accordingly using rich South African mortgage data;\nitself containing various macroeconomic and obligor-specific input variables.\nThis new SICR-modelling approach is demonstrated by analysing the resulting\nportfolio-level SICR-rates (of each SICR-definition) on their stability over\ntime and their responsiveness to economic downturns. At the account-level, we\ncompare both the accuracy and flexibility of the SICR-predictions across all\nSICR-definitions, and discover several interesting trends during this process.\nThese trends form a rudimentary expert system for selecting the three\nparameters optimally, as demonstrated in our recommendations for defining\nSICR-events. In summary, our work can guide the formulation, testing, and\nmodelling of any SICR-definition, thereby promoting the timeous recognition of\ncredit losses; the main imperative of IFRS 9.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 12:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

However, comparing all records\nacross datasets can be computationally intensive, leading to long runtimes. To\nreduce these runtimes, entity resolution pipelines are constructed of two\nparts: a blocker that applies a computationally cheap method to select\ncandidate record pairs, and a matcher that afterwards identifies matching pairs\nfrom this set using more expensive methods. This paper presents SC-Block, a\nblocking method that utilizes supervised contrastive learning for positioning\nrecords in the embedding space, and nearest neighbour search for candidate set\nbuilding. We benchmark SC-Block against eight state-of-the-art blocking\nmethods. In order to relate the training time of SC-Block to the reduction of\nthe overall runtime of the entity resolution pipeline, we combine SC-Block with\nfour matching methods into complete pipelines. For measuring the overall\nruntime, we determine candidate sets with 98% pair completeness and pass them\nto the matcher. The results show that SC-Block is able to create smaller\ncandidate sets and pipelines with SC-Block execute 1.5 to 2 times faster\ncompared to pipelines with other blockers, without sacrificing F1 score.\nBlockers are often evaluated using relatively small datasets which might lead\nto runtime effects resulting from a large vocabulary size being overlooked. In\norder to measure runtimes in a more challenging setting, we introduce a new\nbenchmark dataset that requires large numbers of product offers to be blocked.\nOn this large-scale benchmark dataset, pipelines utilizing SC-Block and the\nbest-performing matcher execute 8 times faster than pipelines utilizing another\nblocker with the same matcher reducing the runtime from 2.5 hours to 18\nminutes, clearly compensating for the 5 minutes required for training SC-Block.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 13:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

For either oil and gas applications or CO2\nstorage, seismic data are a valuable source of information for tracking changes\nin elastic properties which can be related to fluids saturation and pressure\nchanges within the reservoir. Changes in elastic properties can be estimated\nwith time-lapse full-waveform inversion. Monitoring rock-physics properties,\nsuch as saturation, with time-lapse full-waveform inversion is usually a\ntwo-step process: first, elastic properties are estimated with full-waveform\ninversion, then, the rock-physics properties are estimated with rock-physics\ninversion. However, multiparameter time-lapse full-waveform inversion is prone\nto crosstalk between parameter classes across different vintages. This leads to\nleakage from one parameter class to another, which, in turn, can introduce\nlarge errors in the estimated rock-physics parameters. To avoid inaccuracies\ncaused by crosstalk and the two-step inversion strategy, we reformulate\ntime-lapse full-waveform inversion to estimate directly the changes in the\nrock-physics properties. Using Gassmann's model, we adopt a new\nparameterization containing porosity, clay content, and water saturation. In\nthe context of reservoir monitoring, changes are assumed to be induced by fluid\nsubstitution only. The porosity and clay content can thus be kept constant\nduring time-lapse inversion. We compare this parameterization with the usual\ndensity-velocity parameterization for different benchmark models. Results\nindicate that the proposed parameterization eliminates crosstalk between\nparameters of different vintages, leading to more accurate estimation of\nsaturation changes. We also show that using the parameterization based on\nporosity, clay content, and water saturation, the elastic changes can be\nmonitored more accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 13:54:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 13:29:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 21:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

While it has shown remarkable\nperformance even in unseen situations, it often performs in ways not intuitive\nto humans. Particularly, they usually do not consider the pronunciation of the\ninput, which humans would utilize to understand language, especially when it\ncomes to unknown words. Thus, this paper inserts phonetic prior into\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), one of the V\\&L pretrained\nmodels, to make it consider the pronunciation similarity among its\npronunciation inputs. To achieve this, we first propose a phoneme embedding\nthat utilizes the phoneme relationships provided by the International Phonetic\nAlphabet (IPA) chart as a phonetic prior. Next, by distilling the frozen CLIP\ntext encoder, we train a pronunciation encoder employing the IPA-based\nembedding. The proposed model named IPA-CLIP comprises this pronunciation\nencoder and the original CLIP encoders (image and text). Quantitative\nevaluation reveals that the phoneme distribution on the embedding space\nrepresents phonetic relationships more accurately when using the proposed\nphoneme embedding. Furthermore, in some multimodal retrieval tasks, we confirm\nthat the proposed pronunciation encoder enhances the performance of the text\nencoder and that the pronunciation encoder handles nonsense words in a more\nphonetic manner than the text encoder. Finally, qualitative evaluation verifies\nthe correlation between the pronunciation encoder and human perception\nregarding pronunciation similarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 13:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

A key operational\nchallenge in ESMS is related to parking, particularly how to ensure a shared\nvehicle has a parking space when the user is approaching the destination. For\ninstance, our recent study illustrated that up to 12.9% of shared E-bike users\nin Dublin, Ireland cannot park their E-bikes properly due to a lack of planning\nand user-centric guidance.

We study the propagation of SEPs in a new model of heliospheric\nturbulence which takes the spiral geometry of the average magnetic field into\naccount, to evaluate how this improved description affects the SEP path lengths\nand the overall evolution of SEP intensities at 1~au.

This paper introduces a novel algebraic perspective\nunifying various types of 1-Lipschitz neural networks, including the ones\npreviously mentioned, along with methods based on orthogonality and spectral\nmethods.

The effect of the\ncausality constraint on the control performance is tested by placing the sensor\nat different positions. We demonstrate that when the sensor is not positioned\nsufficiently upstream of the trailing edge, which can be the case for the\nactual control problem due to geometric restrictions, causality reduces the\ncontrol performance. We also show that this limitation can be moderated using\nthe optimal causal control together with modelling of the forcing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 14:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

We consider a recently\nproposed decentralized modified coded caching scheme (D-MCCS) and formulate the\ncache placement optimization problem to minimize the average rate for the\nD-MCCS. To solve this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we first\npropose a successive Geometric Programming (GP) approximation algorithm, which\nguarantees convergence to a stationary point but has high computational\ncomplexity. Next, we develop a low-complexity file-group-based approach, where\nwe propose a popularity-first and size-aware (PF-SA) cache placement strategy\nto partition files into two groups, taking into account the nonuniformity in\nfile popularity and size. Both algorithms do not require the knowledge of\nactive users beforehand for cache placement. Numerical results show that they\nperform very closely to each other.

Here, we present a novel StyO model, ie. Stylize\nthe face in only One-shot, to solve the above problem. In particular, StyO\nexploits a disentanglement and recombination strategy. It first disentangles\nthe content and style of source and target images into identifiers, which are\nthen recombined in a cross manner to derive the stylized face image. In this\nway, StyO decomposes complex images into independent and specific attributes,\nand simplifies one-shot face stylization as the combination of different\nattributes from input images, thus producing results better matching face\ngeometry of target image and content of source one. StyO is implemented with\nlatent diffusion models (LDM) and composed of two key modules: 1) Identifier\nDisentanglement Learner (IDL) for disentanglement phase. It represents\nidentifiers as contrastive text prompts, ie. positive and negative\ndescriptions. And it introduces a novel triple reconstruction loss to fine-tune\nthe pre-trained LDM for encoding style and content into corresponding\nidentifiers; 2) Fine-grained Content Controller (FCC) for the recombination\nphase. It recombines disentangled identifiers from IDL to form an augmented\ntext prompt for generating stylized faces.

There have been\nincreased efforts to facilitate or automate this task through data-driven\ntechniques, impelled in particular by the recent revival of neural networks\n(NNs) in computational mechanics. However, it seems questionable to simply not\nconsider fundamental findings of constitutive modeling originating from the\nlast decades research within NN-based approaches. Herein, we propose a\ncomparative study on different feedforward and recurrent neural network\narchitectures to model inelasticity. Within this study, we divide the models\ninto three basic classes: black box NNs, NNs enforcing physics in a weak form,\nand NNs enforcing physics in a strong form. Thereby, the first class of\nnetworks can learn constitutive relations from data while the underlying\nphysics are completely ignored, whereas the latter two are constructed such\nthat they can account for fundamental physics, where special attention is paid\nto the second law of thermodynamics in this work. Conventional linear and\nnonlinear viscoelastic as well as elastoplastic models are used for training\ndata generation and, later on, as reference. After training with random walk\ntime sequences containing information on stress, strain, and, for some models,\ninternal variables, the NN-based models are compared to the reference solution,\nwhereby interpolation and extrapolation are considered. Besides the quality of\nthe stress prediction, the related free energy and dissipation rate are\nanalyzed to evaluate the models. Overall, the presented study enables a clear\nrecording of the advantages and disadvantages of different NN architectures to\nmodel inelasticity and gives guidance on how to train and apply these models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 12:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

To tackle this problem, we propose a Directed Graph ATtention network\ncalled DGAT, which explicitly takes out-degree into attention calculation. In\naddition to having directional requirements, the same node might have different\nrepresentations of its input and output, and thus we further propose a dual\nembedding of DGAT, referred to as DEDGAT.

Therefore, effectively identifying and managing video traffic has\nbecome an urgent problem to be solved. However, the existing video traffic\nfeature extraction methods mainly target at the traditional packet and flow\nlevel features, and the video traffic identification accuracy is low.\nAdditionally, the issue of high data dimension often exists in video traffic\nidentification, requiring an effective approach to select the most relevant\nfeatures to complete the identification task. Although numerous studies have\nused feature selection to achieve improved identification performance, no\nfeature selection research has focused on measuring feature distributions that\ndo not overlap or have a small overlap. First, this study proposes to extract\nvideo-related features to construct a large-scale feature set to identify video\ntraffic. Second, to reduce the cost of video traffic identification and select\nan effective feature subset, the current research proposes an adaptive\ndistribution distance-based feature selection (ADDFS) method, which uses\nWasserstein distance to measure the distance between feature distributions. To\ntest the effectiveness of the proposal, we collected a set of video traffic\nfrom different platforms in a campus network environment and conducted a set of\nexperiments using these data sets. Experimental results suggest that the\nproposed method can achieve high identification performance for video scene\ntraffic and cloud game video traffic identification. Lastly, a comparison of\nADDFS with other feature selection methods shows that ADDFS is a practical\nfeature selection technique not only for video traffic identification, but also\nfor general classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 14:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

In this work, a simulation pipeline allowing\nthe computation of patient-specific geometry and the prediction of personalized\nbreast material properties was put forward. Through image segmentation, a\nfinite element model including the subject-specific geometry is established. By\nfirst computing an undeformed state of the breast, the geometrico-material\nmodel is calibrated by surface acquisition in the intra-operative stance. Using\nan elastic corotational formulation, the patient-specific mechanical properties\nof the breast and skin were identified to obtain the best estimates of the\nsupine configuration.

This paper develops some powerful\nmathematical tools (which I will call the ISE Methodology) for discovering and\nnegotiating between a wide range of alternate spacetime settings for nearly any\nspacetime theory. The mathematics involved is relatively simple (i.e., no\nalgebraic geometry and no category theory). Moreover, the scope of\napplicability is incredibly wide; These simple spacetime re-description\ntechniques are, in principle, applicable to every spacetime theory since\nNewton. Unlike the algebraic approach to spacetime, the ISE Methodology does\nnot use a theory's algebraic structure in order to reconstruct its original\nspacetime manifold. Instead, a wide range of new spacetime settings are offered\nto us, based on nothing but our ability to smoothly vary the theory's states.\nTo build a new spacetime setting for a theory one first picks out a certain\nkind of Lie group action on its states (which I will call pre-spacetime\ntranslation operations). This kind of Lie group action is indistinguishable\nfrom spacetime translations, structurally speaking. Using the techniques\nintroduced in this paper, one can then construct a new spacetime setting for\nthe theory in question such that these pre-spacetime translation operations\nbecome honest-to-goodness spacetime translations in the new theory.

It was thought that phonons were disqualified as a prime agent, in\nspite of their predominance in many other resistivity contexts. The problem\nseems to have been not with phonons, but how they were treated. Here we show\nthat Planckian resistivity can in fact emerge from the \\textit{nonperturbative}\nscattering dynamics of thermal lattice vibrations and \\textit{coherent} charge\ncarriers by a wave-on-wave approach. This becomes apparent when describing the\nlattice vibrations in the coherent state representation, and treating charge\ncarriers as quantum wave packets negotiating the resulting dynamic disorder\nfield formed by lattice vibrations, the deformation potential. Under this\ncoherent and nonperturbative scattering dynamics, we find that carrier\nvelocities are suppressed, the quasiparticle picture breaks down and a new\nphase called the vibronic fluid emerges. A competition between the static and\ndynamic aspects of the random acoustic deformation potential is set up, leading\nto a previously conjectured quantum bound of diffusion $\\hbar/m^{*}$ with\nuniversal properties. We successfully obtain the $T$-linear resistivity of\nthree different strange metals using their experimental parameters in our\nnumerical simulations.

Flow features responsible for imperfect mixing,\nincluding short-circuiting or channeling between the patient and exhaust air\nvent (which leads to rapid expulsion of aerosols from the room), dead zones or\nre-circulation flow regions in the room, and the turbulent diffusion or\nspreading of aerosol across the room, are shown to play important factors\ndetermining the HCW exposure to the aerosol. The importance of each of these\nfactors varies depending on the ventilation rate (ACH) and the placement of the\nexhaust air vent relative to the patient. For example, reducing ACH from 12 to\n6 diminishes the importance of these flow features and the aerosol transport\nmay be approximately modeled through the classical perfectly mixed assumption.\nAt ACH = 12, especially when the ceiling exhaust is placed above the patient\nand the HCW, short-circuiting is the dominant feature in determining HCW\nexposure. But when the ceiling exhaust is placed away from the patient and HCW,\nthe short-circuiting is weakened and the influence of dead zones, which trap\naerosol, and turbulent diffusion, which allow the aerosol to escape, becomes\nmore important. It is shown that the importance of these flow features and the\nresulting impact on HCW exposure can be quantified in terms of residence time\ndistribution (RTD) metrics such as mean residence time and cumulative RTD. The\nresults suggest that residence time analysis is a useful technique to be\nemployed when designing a hospital isolation room and assessing HCW exposure to\naerosols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 19:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}
