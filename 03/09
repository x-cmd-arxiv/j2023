The proposed framework transfers\ninformative features from an HR-trained network to an LR-trained network by\nreducing the distance between them. A cosine similarity measure was employed as\na distance metric to effectively align the HR and LR features. This approach\ndiffers from conventional knowledge distillation frameworks, which use the L_p\ndistance metrics and offer the advantage of converging well when reducing the\ndistance between features of different resolutions. Our framework achieved a 3%\nimprovement over the previous state-of-the-art method on the AgeDB-30 benchmark\nwithout bells and whistles, while maintaining a strong performance on HR\nimages. The effectiveness of cosine similarity as a distance metric was\nvalidated through statistical analysis, making our approach a promising\nsolution for real-world applications in which LR images are frequently\nencountered.

Wireless communications for mobile Metaverse\nusers should be tailored to meet the following user characteristics: 1)\nemphasizing application-specific perceptual utility instead of simply the\ntransmission rate, 2) concerned with energy efficiency due to the limited\ndevice battery and energy intensiveness of some applications, and 3) caring\nabout security as the applications may involve sensitive personal data. To this\nend, this paper incorporates application-specific utility, energy efficiency,\nand physical-layer security (PLS) into the studied optimization in a wireless\nnetwork for the Metaverse. Specifically, after introducing utility-energy\nefficiency (UEE) to represent each Metaverse user's application-specific\nobjective under PLS, we formulate an optimization to maximize the network's\nweighted sum-UEE by deciding users' transmission powers and communication\nbandwidths. The formulated problem belongs to the sum-of-ratios optimization,\nfor which prior studies have demonstrated its difficulty. Nevertheless, our\nproposed algorithm 1) obtains the global optimum for the weighted sum-UEE\noptimization, via a transform to parametric convex optimization problems, 2)\napplies to any utility function which is concave, increasing, and twice\ndifferentiable, and 3) achieves a linear time complexity in the number of users\n(the optimal complexity in the order sense). Simulations confirm the\nsuperiority of our algorithm over other approaches. We explain that our\ntechnique for solving the sum-of-ratios optimization is applicable to other\noptimization problems in wireless networks and mobile computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 16:18:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2023 22:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

No-hair\nconjecture asserts that all black holes in General Relativity coupled to any\nmatter must be Kerr-Newman type. However, the conjecture fails in some cases\nwith non-linear matter sources. Here, we address this by explicitly\nconstructing multiple slow-rotating black hole solutions, up to second order in\nrotational parameter, for a class of $f(R)$ models. We analytically show that\ntwo vacuum solutions satisfy the field equations up to the second order in the\nrotational parameter. The uniqueness of our result stems from the fact that\nthese are obtained directly from metric formalism without conformal\ntransformation. We discuss the kinematical properties of these black hole\nsolutions and compare them with slow-rotating Kerr. Specifically, we show that\nthe circular orbits for the black holes in $f(R)$ are smaller than that of\nKerr. This implies that the inner-most stable circular orbit for black holes in\n$f(R)$ is smaller than Kerr's; hence the shadow radius might also be smaller.\nFinally, we discuss the implications of our results for future observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 16:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

Here we evidence\nthe operating conditions to achieve unambiguous amplification using clocked\nnanoseconds -long spin-orbit torque pulses in sub-micrometer wide magnonic\nwaveguides, where the effective magnetization has been engineered to be close\nto zero to suppress the detrimental magnon-magnon scattering. As a result, we\nachieve an exponential increase in the intensity of propagating spin waves up\nto 500 % at a propagation distance of several micrometers. These results pave\nthe way towards the implementation of energy efficient, cascadable magnonic\narchitectures for wave-based information processing and complex on-chip\ncomputation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 16:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

In particular, we implement a\nclosest point decoding strategy for correcting random Gaussian shift errors.\nFor decoding a generic multimode GKP code, we first identify its corresponding\nlattice followed by finding the closest lattice point in its symplectic dual\nlattice to a candidate shift error compatible with the error syndrome. We use\nthis method to characterize the error correction capabilities of several known\nmultimode GKP codes, including their code distances and fidelities.

Unfortunately,\nwithout a local quantum description of the EM field it becomes difficult to\ndescribe the specific dynamics of light in the presence of local interactions\nor local boundary conditions.\n  In this thesis we take an alternative approach and quantise the free EM field\nin both one and three dimensions in terms of quanta that are perfectly\nlocalised and propagate at the speed of light without dispersion. Our approach\nhas two characteristics that allow it to overcome earlier no-go theorems.\nFirstly, we make a clear distinction between particles, which can always be\nlocalised, and the electric and magnetic fields, which cannot; and secondly, we\nremove the lower bound on the Hamiltonian, thereby introducing\nnegative-frequency photons from basic principles.\n  Afterwards we test our quantisation scheme by studying the propagation of\nlight in a linear optics experiment analogous to that studied in Fermi's\ntwo-atom problem.

The strong flux decrease in the soft X-ray\nband between observations has been caused by clouds with large column densities\ntransiting our line-of-sight (LOS) and covering the central AGN. Another event\nhas been captured in NGC 3227 at the end of 2019. We aim to determine the\nnature of the observed spectral variability in 2019 obscuration event. We split\nthe two XMM-Newton observations from 2019 into timing bins of length $\\sim$ 10\nks. We used the SPEX code to analyse the 0.35-10 keV EPIC-PN spectra of each\ntiming bin. In the first observation (Obs 1), there is a strong\nanti-correlation between the column density ($N_H$) of the obscurer and the\ncontinuum normalisations of the X-ray power-law and soft Comptonisation\ncomponents ($N_{pow}$ and $N_{comt}$, respectively). The powerlaw continuum\nmodels the hard X-rays produced by the corona, and the Comptonisation component\nmodels the soft X-ray excess and emission from the accretion disk. Through\nfurther testing we conclude that the continuum is likely to drive the observed\nvariability, but we cannot rule out a possible contribution from NH of the\nobscurer if it fully transverses across the ionising source within our LOS\nduring the observation. The ionisation parameter ($\\xi$) of the obscurer is not\neasily constrained, and therefore it is not clear whether it varies in response\nto changes in ionising continuum. The second observation (Obs 2) displays a\nsignificantly lower count rate due to the combination of a high NH and covering\nfraction of the obscurer, and a lower continuum flux. The observed variability\nseen during the obscuration event of NGC 3227 in 2019 is likely driven by the\ncontinuum, but the obscurer varies at the same time, making it difficult to\ndistinguish between the two possibilities with full certainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 17:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2023 12:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

These sensorized insoles need to be comfortable\nand lightweight to be accepted. Previous work has already demonstrated that\nsensorized insoles are possible and can estimate both ground reaction force and\ngait cycle. However, these are often assemblies of commercial components\nrestricting design freedom and flexibility. Within this work, we investigate\nthe feasibility of using four 3D-printed porous (foam-like) piezoresistive\nsensors embedded in a commercial insole. These sensors were evaluated using an\ninstrumented treadmill as the golden standard. It was observed that the four\nsensors behaved in line with the expected change in pressure distribution\nduring the gait cycle. In addition, Hammerstein-Wiener models were identified\nthat were capable of estimating the vertical and mediolateral ground reaction\nforces (GRFs). Their NRMSE fits were on average 82% and 73%, respectively.\nSimilarly, for the averaged gait cycle the R^2 values were 0.98 and 0.99 with\nnormalized RMS errors overall below 6%. These values were comparable with other\ninsoles based on commercial force sensing resistors but at a significantly\nlower cost (over four times cheaper). Thereby indicating that our 3D-printed\nsensors can be an interesting option for sensorized insoles. The advantage of\n3D printing these sensors is that it allows for significantly more design\nfreedom, reduces assembly, and is cheaper. However, further research is needed\nto exploit this design freedom for complex sensors, estimate the\nanteroposterior GRF, and fully 3D print the entire insole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 17:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

Video-P2P addresses\nthis limitation by adapting an image generation diffusion model to complete\nvarious video editing tasks. Specifically, we propose to first tune a\nText-to-Set (T2S) model to complete an approximate inversion and then optimize\na shared unconditional embedding to achieve accurate video inversion with a\nsmall memory cost. For attention control, we introduce a novel\ndecoupled-guidance strategy, which uses different guidance strategies for the\nsource and target prompts. The optimized unconditional embedding for the source\nprompt improves reconstruction ability, while an initialized unconditional\nembedding for the target prompt enhances editability. Incorporating the\nattention maps of these two branches enables detailed editing. These technical\ndesigns enable various text-driven editing applications, including word swap,\nprompt refinement, and attention re-weighting.

Commonly, this mapping may use optimizing compilers to generate code\nat compile time or high-performance vendor libraries that have been specialized\nto the target platform. Both approaches rely on expert knowledge to produce the\nmapping, which may be time-consuming and difficult to extend to new\narchitectures.\n  In this work, we present a DNN library framework, SMaLL, that is easily\nextensible to new architectures.

To show the benefits of our approach, we\nhave developed software that supports a range of layer types and computing\nplatforms, which is easily extensible for rapidly instantiating high\nperformance DNN libraries.\n  We evaluate our software by instantiating networks from the TinyMLPerf\nbenchmark suite on 5 ARM platforms and 1 x86 platform ( an AMD Zen 2). Our\nframework shows end-to-end performance that is comparable to or better than ML\nFrameworks such as TensorFlow, TVM and LibTorch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 18:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

We perform a detailed\nparameter space study using three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations\nto understand the effect of changing stellar wind magnetic field and planetary\nmagnetic field strengths on planetary magnetospheric topology and atmospheric\nlosses. It is observed that the relative strengths of stellar and planetary\nmagnetic fields play a significant role in determining the steady state\nmagnetospheric configuration and atmospheric erosion. When the stellar field is\nstrengthened or the planetary field is weakened, stellar magnetic field\naccumulation occurs at the day-side of the planet which forces the magnetopause\nto shift closer to its surface. The magnetotail opens up leading to the\nformation of Alfv\\'{e}n wings in the night-side wake region. We demonstrate how\nreconnection processes and wind conditions lead to the bifurcation of the\nmagnetotail current sheet. With increasing stellar wind magnetic field\nstrength, the day-side reconnection point approaches the planet thereby\nenhancing mass loss. We establish an analytic equation which successfully\ncaptures the modeled mass-loss rate variations of planets with changing\nmagnetic field strengths.

Multiphase flow in porous media\nis essential to understand CO2 migration and pressure fields in the subsurface\nassociated with GCS. However, numerical simulation for such problems in 4D is\ncomputationally challenging and expensive, due to the multiphysics and\nmultiscale nature of the highly nonlinear governing partial differential\nequations (PDEs).

Fourier-MIONet utilizes the\nrecently developed framework of the multiple-input deep neural operators\n(MIONet) and incorporates the Fourier neural operator (FNO) in the network\narchitecture. Once Fourier-MIONet is trained, it can predict the evolution of\nsaturation and pressure of the multiphase flow under various reservoir\nconditions, such as permeability and porosity heterogeneity, anisotropy,\ninjection configurations, and multiphase flow properties.

Nonetheless, none of the experimental tests so far\nwas able to extract information on the full inequality from each entangled\npair, since the wave function collapse forbids performing, on the same quantum\nstate, all the measurements needed for evaluating the entire Bell parameter. We\npresent here the first single-pair Bell inequality test, able to obtain a Bell\nparameter value for every entangled pair detected. This is made possible by\nexploiting sequential weak measurements, allowing to measure non-commuting\nobservables in sequence on the same state, on each entangled particle. Such an\napproach not only grants unprecedented measurement capability, but also removes\nthe need to choose between different measurement bases, intrinsically\neliminating the freedom-of-choice loophole and stretching the concept of\ncounterfactual-definiteness (since it allows measuring in the otherwise\nnot-chosen bases). We also demonstrate how, after the Bell parameter\nmeasurement, the pair under test still presents a noteworthy amount of\nentanglement, providing evidence of the absence of (complete) wave function\ncollapse and allowing to exploit this quantum resource for further protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 18:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

However, the accuracy of the H0\nmeasurement based on classical Cepheids has been challenged by a measurement\nbased on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method. A resolution of the\nCepheids vs. TRGB dispute is needed to demonstrate well understood systematics\nand to corroborate the need for new physics.

When integrated in\nmany-body dynamics, measurements can lead to emergent patterns of quantum\ninformation in space-time that go beyond established paradigms for\ncharacterizing phases, either in or out of equilibrium. On present-day NISQ\nprocessors, the experimental realization of this physics is challenging due to\nnoise, hardware limitations, and the stochastic nature of quantum measurement.\nHere we address each of these experimental challenges and investigate\nmeasurement-induced quantum information phases on up to 70 superconducting\nqubits. By leveraging the interchangeability of space and time, we use a\nduality mapping, to avoid mid-circuit measurement and access different\nmanifestations of the underlying phases -- from entanglement scaling to\nmeasurement-induced teleportation -- in a unified way. We obtain finite-size\nsignatures of a phase transition with a decoding protocol that correlates the\nexperimental measurement record with classical simulation data.

Further thickening carries these orbits towards the vertical ILR (vILR)\nat $\\Omega_z/\\Omega_R=1$, where they convert in-plane motion to vertical\nmotion, become chaotic, kinematically hotter and less shoulder-supporting.\nBecause of this heating by the vILR, persistent shoulders require bars to trap\nnew orbits, consistent with the need for a growing bar. Since buckling speeds\nup the trapping of stars on warm ILR orbits, it can be followed by the\nformation of shoulders, as seen in simulations.

To understand\nhow a specific footfall pattern will change the energetics of a legged system,\nwe first developed a full body model of a quadrupedal robot called A1. And for\neach gait we created a hybrid system with desired footfall sequence and rigid\nimpacts. In order to find the most energy efficient gait, we used optimal\ncontrol methods to formulate the problem as a trajectory optimization problem\nwith proper constraints and objective function. This problem was implemented\nand solved in a nonlinear programming framework called FROST. Based on the\noptimized trajectories for each gait, we investigated the values of cost of\ntransport and the work done by all joints. Moreover, we analyzed the exchange\nof angular momentum in different components of the system during the whole\nstride cycle.

Heart rate dynamics are of\nparticular interest as they provide a way to track the sympathetic and\nparasympathetic outflow from the autonomic nervous system, which is known to\nplay a key role in modulating attention, memory, decision-making, and emotional\nprocessing. However, extracting useful information from heartbeats about the\nautonomic outflow is still challenging due to the noisy estimates that result\nfrom standard signal-processing methods. To advance this state of affairs, we\npropose a paradigm shift in how we conceptualise and model heart rate: instead\nof being a mere summary of the observed inter-beat intervals, we introduce a\nmodelling framework that views heart rate as a hidden stochastic process that\ndrives the observed heartbeats.

This phenomenon, i.e. spontaneous topological Hall effect, can\npotentially be used for the efficient electrical readout of the\nantiferromagnetic states, but its experimental verification has long been\nelusive due to the lack of appropriate materials hosting such exotic magnetism.\nHere, we report the discovery of all-in-all-out type non-coplanar\nantiferromagnetic order in triangular lattice compounds CoTa3S6 and CoNb3S6, by\nperforming the detailed magnetic structure analysis based on polarized neutron\nscattering experiments as well as systematic first-principles calculations.\nThese compounds are reported to host unconventionally large spontaneous Hall\neffect despite their vanishingly small net magnetization, and our analysis\nrevealed that it can be well explained in terms of topological Hall effect,\nwhich originates from the fictitious magnetic field associated with scalar spin\nchirality in non-coplanar antiferromagnetic orders. The present results\nindicate that the scalar spin chirality mechanism can offer a promising route\nto realize giant spontaneous Hall response even in compensated\nantiferromagnets, and highlight intercalated van der Waals magnets as an unique\nquasi-two-dimensional material platform to enable various nontrivial manner of\nelectrical reading and possible writing of non-coplanar antiferromagnetic\ndomains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 20:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

Furthermore,\nclustered apples are common in the orchard, which brings additional challenges\nas the clustered apples may be identified as one apple. This will cause issues\nin localization for subsequent robotic operations. In this paper, we present\nthe development of a novel deep learning-based apple detection framework,\nOccluder-Occludee Relational Network (O2RNet), for robust detection of apples\nin such clustered environments.

However, the\npresence of heterogeneous devices in federated learning, such as mobile phones\nand IoT devices with varying memory capabilities, would limit the scale and\nhence the performance of the model could be trained. The mainstream approaches\nto address memory limitations focus on width-slimming techniques, where\ndifferent clients train subnetworks with reduced widths locally and then the\nserver aggregates the subnetworks. The global model produced from these methods\nsuffers from performance degradation due to the negative impact of the actions\ntaken to handle the varying subnetwork widths in the aggregation phase.

Driving a network's feedback vertex set (FVS)\nby node-state override into a state consistent with a target attractor is\nproven to force every system trajectory to the target attractor, but in\nbiological networks, the FVS is typically larger than can be realistically\nmanipulated. External control of a subset of a biological network's FVS was\nproposed as a strategy to drive the network to its attractors utilizing fewer\ninterventions; however, the effectiveness of this strategy was only\ndemonstrated on a small set of Boolean models of biological networks. Here, we\nextend this analysis to ensembles of biologically-inspired Boolean networks. On\nthese models, we use three structural metrics -- PRINCE propagation, modified\nPRINCE propagation, and CheiRank -- to rank FVS subsets by their predicted\nattractor control strength. We validate the accuracy of these rankings using\nthree dynamical measures: To Control, Away Control, and logical domain of\ninfluence. We also calculate the propagation metrics on effective graphs, which\nincorporate each Boolean model's functional information into edge weights.\nWhile this additional information increases the predicting power of structural\nmetrics, we find that the increase with respect to the unweighted network is\nlimited. The propagation metrics in conjunction with the FVS can be used to\nidentify realizable driver node sets by emulating the dynamics that are\nprevalent in biological networks. This approach only uses the network's\nstructure, and the driver sets are shown to be robust to the specific dynamical\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 21:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

In\nthis view, a phenotype actively infers the state of its econiche under a\ngenerative model, whose parameters are learned via natural (bayesian model\nselection). The ensuing variational synthesis features some unexpected aspects.\nPerhaps the most notable is that it is not possible to describe or model a\npopulation of conspecifics per se. Rather, it is necessary to consider\npopulations - and nested meta-populations - of different natural kinds that\ninfluence each other. This paper is limited to a description of the\nmathematical apparatus and accompanying ideas. Subsequent work will use these\nmethods for simulations and numerical analyses - and identify points of contact\nwith related mathematical formulations of evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 21:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

This paper introduces a new method\nto automate formal verification: We use large language models, trained on\nnatural language text and code and fine-tuned on proofs, to generate whole\nproofs for theorems at once, rather than one step at a time.

In object-oriented environments, predicates are a particularly useful\nform of state abstraction because of their compatibility with symbolic planners\nand their capacity for relational generalization. However, to plan with\npredicates, the agent must be able to interpret them in continuous environment\nstates (i.e., ground the symbols). Manually programming predicate\ninterpretations can be difficult, so we would instead like to learn them from\ndata. We propose an embodied active learning paradigm where the agent learns\npredicate interpretations through online interaction with an expert. For\nexample, after taking actions in a block stacking environment, the agent may\nask the expert: \"Is On(block1, block2) true?\" From this experience, the agent\nlearns to plan: it learns neural predicate interpretations, symbolic planning\noperators, and neural samplers that can be used for bilevel planning. During\nexploration, the agent plans to learn: it uses its current models to select\nactions towards generating informative expert queries. We learn predicate\ninterpretations as ensembles of neural networks and use their entropy to\nmeasure the informativeness of potential queries. We evaluate this approach in\nthree robotic environments and find that it consistently outperforms six\nbaselines while exhibiting sample efficiency in two key metrics: number of\nenvironment interactions, and number of queries to the expert.

However, in\nsome areas of application, a discrete frailty distribution may be more\nappropriate. We investigate and compare various existing families of discrete\nunivariate and shared frailty models by taking as our focus the variance of the\nrelative frailty distribution in survivors. The relative frailty variance (RFV)\namong survivors provides a readily interpretable measure of how the\nheterogeneity of a population, as represented by a frailty model, evolves over\ntime. We explore the shape of the RFV for the purpose of model selection and\nreview available discrete random effect distributions in this context. We find\nnon-monotone trajectories of the RFV for discrete univariate and shared frailty\nmodels, which is a rare property. Furthermore, we proof that for discrete\ntime-invariant univariate and shared frailty models with (without) an atom at\nzero, the limit of the RFV approaches infinity (zero), if the support of the\ndiscrete distribution can be arranged in ascending order. Through the\none-to-one relationship of the RFV with the cross-ratio function in shared\nfrailty models, which we generalize to the higher-variate case, our results\nalso apply to patterns of association within a cluster.

The\nsize of the necessary correction depends upon detailed strong-interaction\ndynamics.

The stability of the equilibria is discussed analytically\nusing the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations. It is found\nthat the Allee effect and the fear effect change the extinction dynamics of the\nsystem and the number of positive equilibrium points, but they do not affect\nthe stability of the positive equilibria. We also observe some special dynamics\nthat induce bifurcations in the system by varying the Allee or fear parameter.\nInterestingly we find that the Allee effect working in conjunction with the\nfear effect, can bring about several qualitative changes to the dynamical\nbehavior of the system with only the fear effect in place, in regimes of small\nfear. That is, for small amounts of the fear parameter, it can change a\ncompetitive exclusion type situation to a strong competition type situation. It\ncan also change a weak competition type situation to a bi-stability type\nsituation. However for large fear regimes the Allee effect reinforces the\ndynamics driven by the fear effect.

At\npresent, the majority of statistical shape models (SSMs) are restricted to a\nsmall number of organs or bones or do not adequately represent the general\npopulation. Method: To address this, we propose a deformable human shape and\npose model that combines skin, internal organs, and bones, learned from CT\nimages. By modeling the statistical variations in a pose-normalized space using\nprobabilistic PCA while also preserving joint kinematics, our approach offers a\nholistic representation of the body that can benefit various medical\napplications.

Our solution is based on a novel\nidea referred to as vertical granularity control (VGC). It breaks the\nsynchronization barriers to increase parallelism and hide scheduling overhead.\nTo use VGC in our SCC algorithm, we also design an efficient data structure\ncalled the \\emph{parallel hash bag}. It uses parallel dynamic resizing to avoid\nredundant work in maintaining frontiers (vertices processed in a round).\n  We implement the parallel SCC algorithm by Blelloch et al.\\ (J.\\ ACM, 2020)\nusing our new parallel reachability algorithm. We compare our implementation to\nthe state-of-the-art systems, including GBBS, iSpan, Multi-step, and our highly\noptimized Tarjan's (sequential) algorithm, on 18 graphs, including social, web,\n$k$-NN, and lattice graphs. On a machine with 96 cores, our implementation is\nthe fastest on 16 out of 18 graphs. On average (geometric means) over all\ngraphs, our SCC is 6.0$\\times$ faster than the best previous parallel code\n(GBBS), 12.8$\\times$ faster than Tarjan's sequential algorithms, and\n2.7$\\times$ faster than the \\emph{best existing implementation on each graph}.\n  We believe that our techniques are of independent interest. We also apply our\nparallel hash bag and VGC scheme to other graph problems, including\nconnectivity and least-element lists (LE-lists).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 23:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 17:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

These models, however, usually suffer from intensive computational\ncosts and heavy memory requirements, making them impractical for deployment on\nedge platforms. Recent studies have proposed to prune transformers in an\nunexplainable manner, which overlook the relationship between internal units of\nthe model and the target class, thereby leading to inferior performance. To\nalleviate this problem, we propose a novel explainable pruning framework dubbed\nX-Pruner, which is designed by considering the explainability of the pruning\ncriterion. Specifically, to measure each prunable unit's contribution to\npredicting each target class, a novel explainability-aware mask is proposed and\nlearned in an end-to-end manner. Then, to preserve the most informative units\nand learn the layer-wise pruning rate, we adaptively search the layer-wise\nthreshold that differentiates between unpruned and pruned units based on their\nexplainability-aware mask values. To verify and evaluate our method, we apply\nthe X-Pruner on representative transformer models including the DeiT and Swin\nTransformer. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nX-Pruner outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box methods with significantly\nreduced computational costs and slight performance degradation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 23:10:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 04:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Measurement of the cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) plays a pivotal role in\nthe detection of glaucoma in its early stage, preventing visual disparities.\nTherefore, accurate and automatic segmentation of optic disc (OD) and optic cup\n(OC) from retinal fundus images is a fundamental requirement. Existing\nCNN-based segmentation frameworks resort to building deep encoders with\naggressive downsampling layers, which suffer from a general limitation on\nmodeling explicit long-range dependency. To this end, in this paper, we propose\na new segmentation pipeline, called UT-Net, availing the advantages of U-Net\nand transformer both in its encoding layer, followed by an attention-gated\nbilinear fusion scheme. In addition to this, we incorporate Multi-Head\nContextual attention to enhance the regular self-attention used in traditional\nvision transformers. Thus low-level features along with global dependencies are\ncaptured in a shallow manner. Besides, we extract context information at\nmultiple encoding layers for better exploration of receptive fields, and to aid\nthe model to learn deep hierarchical representations. Finally, an enhanced\nmixing loss is proposed to tightly supervise the overall learning process. The\nproposed model has been implemented for joint OD and OC segmentation on three\npublicly available datasets: DRISHTI-GS, RIM-ONE R3, and REFUGE.

The NTE is typically associated with thermal phonons and\nanomalous spin-lattice coupling at low temperatures. However, the underlying\nmechanisms in the presence of strong electron correlations in multi-orbital\nsystems are not yet fully established. Here, we investigate the role of Coulomb\ninteraction in the presence of lattice distortions in setting out the NTE\neffect, by focusing on the physical case of layered Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ with $d^4$\nconfiguration at each Ru ion site. We employ the Slater-Koster parametrization\nto describe the electron-lattice coupling through the dependence of the $d-p$\nhybridization on the Ru-O-Ru bond angle. The evaluation of the minimum of the\nfree energy at finite temperature by fully solving the multi-orbital many-body\nproblem on finite size cluster allows us to identify the regime for which the\nsystem is prone to exhibit NTE effects. The analysis shows that the nature of\nthe spin-orbital correlations is relevant to drive the reduction of the bond\nangle by cooling, and in turn the tendency toward a NTE. This is confirmed by\nthe fact that a changeover of the electronic and orbital configuration from\n$d^4$ to $d^3$ by transition metal substitution is shown to favor the\noccurrence of NTE in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. This finding is in agreement with the\nexperimental observations of a NTE effect which is significantly dependent on\nthe transition metal substitution in the Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ compound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 23:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

These concerns arise from the need for huge amounts of\ndata to train deep neural networks. A promise of Generalized Few-shot Object\nDetection (G-FSOD), a learning paradigm in AI, is to alleviate the need for\ncollecting abundant training samples of novel classes we wish to detect by\nleveraging prior knowledge from old classes (i.e., base classes). G-FSOD\nstrives to learn these novel classes while alleviating catastrophic forgetting\nof the base classes. However, existing approaches assume that the base images\nare accessible, an assumption that does not hold when sharing and storing data\nis problematic. In this work, we propose the first data-free knowledge\ndistillation (DFKD) approach for G-FSOD that leverages the statistics of the\nregion of interest (RoI) features from the base model to forge instance-level\nfeatures without accessing the base images. Our contribution is three-fold: (1)\nwe design a standalone lightweight generator with (2) class-wise heads (3) to\ngenerate and replay diverse instance-level base features to the RoI head while\nfinetuning on the novel data. This stands in contrast to standard DFKD\napproaches in image classification, which invert the entire network to generate\nbase images. Moreover, we make careful design choices in the novel finetuning\npipeline to regularize the model. We show that our approach can dramatically\nreduce the base memory requirements, all while setting a new standard for\nG-FSOD on the challenging MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 00:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

Intuitively, the more references, the\nbetter performance. However, previous RefSR methods have all focused on\nsingle-reference image training, while multiple reference images are often\navailable in testing or practical applications. The root cause of such\ntraining-testing mismatch is the absence of publicly available multi-reference\nSR training datasets, which greatly hinders research efforts on multi-reference\nsuper-resolution. To this end, we construct a large-scale, multi-reference\nsuper-resolution dataset, named LMR. It contains 112,142 groups of 300x300\ntraining images, which is 10x of the existing largest RefSR dataset. The image\nsize is also much larger. More importantly, each group is equipped with 5\nreference images with different similarity levels. Furthermore, we propose a\nnew baseline method for multi-reference super-resolution: MRefSR, including a\nMulti-Reference Attention Module (MAM) for feature fusion of an arbitrary\nnumber of reference images, and a Spatial Aware Filtering Module (SAFM) for the\nfused feature selection.

In\npart, this has been due to the poor performance of models trained with PC when\nevaluated by both sample quality and marginal likelihood. By adopting the\nperspective of PC as a variational Bayes algorithm under the Laplace\napproximation, we identify the source of these deficits to lie in the exclusion\nof an associated Hessian term in the PC objective function, which would\notherwise regularise the sharpness of the probability landscape and prevent\nover-certainty in the approximate posterior.

By implementing the analytical\nsolution in the control loop, the flow rates that are required to steer the\ndrops toward their respective target points can be determined using a single\ncontrol parameter. This parameter, $ \\chi^{*} $, is a dimensionless time scale\nthat can manipulate the drops in one of the two manners: 1) by engaging all six\nports to create a flow field with two stagnation points ($ \\chi^{*}\\ll1 $), or\n2) by deactivating some of the ports and creating a linear extensional flow\nthrough the remaining active ports ($ \\chi^{*}\\gg1 $).

Despite remarkable progress, existing methods often\nstruggle to generate plausible hand poses when the hand is heavily occluded or\nblurred. In videos, the movements of the hand allow us to observe various parts\nof the hand that may be occluded or blurred in a single frame. To adaptively\nleverage the visual clue before and after the occlusion or blurring for robust\nhand pose estimation, we propose the Deformer: a framework that implicitly\nreasons about the relationship between hand parts within the same image\n(spatial dimension) and different timesteps (temporal dimension). We show that\na naive application of the transformer self-attention mechanism is not\nsufficient because motion blur or occlusions in certain frames can lead to\nheavily distorted hand features and generate imprecise keys and queries. To\naddress this challenge, we incorporate a Dynamic Fusion Module into Deformer,\nwhich predicts the deformation of the hand and warps the hand mesh predictions\nfrom nearby frames to explicitly support the current frame estimation.\nFurthermore, we have observed that errors are unevenly distributed across\ndifferent hand parts, with vertices around fingertips having disproportionately\nhigher errors than those around the palm. We mitigate this issue by introducing\na new loss function called maxMSE that automatically adjusts the weight of\nevery vertex to focus the model on critical hand parts. Extensive experiments\nshow that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10%,\nand is more robust to occlusions (over 14%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 02:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

In recent years, convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) have shown top performance for this task when a large\namount of labeled data is available. However, the accuracy of CNNs suffers when\ndealing with few and/or sparsely labeled datasets. A potential solution is to\nleverage the information available in large public datasets in conjunction with\na target dataset which only has limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose\na training framework, SSL2 (self-supervised-semi-supervised), for\nmulti-modality MS lesion segmentation with limited supervision. We adopt\nself-supervised learning to leverage the knowledge from large public 3T\ndatasets to tackle the limitations of a small 7T target dataset. To leverage\nthe information from unlabeled 7T data, we also evaluate state-of-the-art\nsemi-supervised methods for other limited annotation settings, such as small\nlabeled training size and sparse annotations. We use the shifted-window (Swin)\ntransformer1 as our backbone network. The effectiveness of self-supervised and\nsemi-supervised training strategies is evaluated in our in-house 7T MRI\ndataset. The results indicate that each strategy improves lesion segmentation\nfor both limited training data size and for sparse labeling scenarios. The\ncombined overall framework further improves the performance substantially\ncompared to either of its components alone. Our proposed framework thus\nprovides a promising solution for future data/label-hungry 7T MS studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 04:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

However, previous attacks on image\nencryption focus only on traditional cryptanalytic attacks or reverse\ntranslation models, so these attacks cannot recover any visual information if a\nblock-scrambling encryption step, which effectively destroys global\ninformation, is applied. Accordingly, in this paper, generative models are\nexplored to evaluate whether such models can restore sensitive visual\ninformation from encrypted images for the first time. We first point out that\nencrypted images have some similarity with plain images in the embedding space.\nBy taking advantage of leaked information from encrypted images, we propose a\nguided generative model as an attack on learnable image encryption to recover\npersonally identifiable visual information.

However, WER fails to provide a fair\nevaluation of human perceived quality in presence of spelling variations,\nabbreviations, or compound words arising out of agglutination. Multiple\nspelling variations might be acceptable based on locale/geography, alternative\nabbreviations, borrowed words, and transliteration of code-mixed words from a\nforeign language to the target language script. Similarly, in case of\nagglutination, often times the agglutinated, as well as the split forms, are\nacceptable.

Recently,\nPositive-pair-Only Contrastive Learning (POCL) has achieved reliable\nperformance without the need to construct positive-negative training sets. It\nreduces memory requirements by lessening the dependency on the batch size. The\nPOCL method typically uses a single loss function to extract the distortion\ninvariant representation (DIR) which describes the proximity of positive-pair\nrepresentations affected by different distortions. This loss function\nimplicitly enables the model to filter out or ignore the distortion variant\nrepresentation (DVR) affected by different distortions. However, existing POCL\nmethods do not explicitly enforce the disentanglement and exploitation of the\nactually valuable DVR. In addition, these POCL methods have been observed to be\nsensitive to augmentation strategies.

Recently, the language-conditioned policy is\nproposed to facilitate policy transfer through learning the joint\nrepresentation of observation and text that catches the compact and invariant\ninformation across environments. Existing studies of language-conditioned RL\nmethods often learn the joint representation as a simple latent layer for the\ngiven instances (episode-specific observation and text), which inevitably\nincludes noisy or irrelevant information and cause spurious correlations that\nare dependent on instances, thus hurting generalization performance and\ntraining efficiency.

The training of PSD\nsimultaneously contains multiple self-distillations, in which a teacher network\nand a student network share the same embedding network. Since the student\nnetwork receives a modified image from its teacher network by masking some\ninformative regions, the teacher network outputs stronger semantic\nrepresentations than the student network. Guided by such teacher network with\nstronger semantics, the student network is encouraged to mine more useful\nregions from the modified image by enhancing its own ability. The ability of\nthe teacher network is also enhanced with the shared embedding network.

Our answer implies that Lasserre's hierarchy, which is known\nas a bridge between convex and non-convex programs with algebraic structures,\nhas finite convergence not only in the generic case but also in the general\ncase. As a result, we constructively prove that each hyperbolic program is\nequivalent to a semidefinite program.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 07:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

Our simulation results indicate that the merger remnants\ncan evolve to hydrogen- and helium-deficient giants with maximum radius of\nabout 300Rsun. Our models show evidence that merger remnants more massive than\n1.95Msun can ignite Ne before significant mass-loss ensues, and they thus would\nbecome electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe). However, remnants with initial\nmasses less than 1.90Msun will experience further core contraction and longer\nevolutionary time before reaching at the conditions for Ne-burning. Therefore\ntheir fates are more dependent on mass-loss rates due to stellar winds, and\nthus more uncertain. Relatively high mass-loss rates would cause such remnants\nto end their lives as ONe WDs.

To learn prompts in open-set scenarios, we propose the Regularized prompt\nTuning (R-Tuning) to mitigate the label bias.

However, existing methods primarily utilize information acquired\nfrom a single dimensionality (2D/3D), resulting in sub-optimal performance on\nchallenging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with multiple\nobjects and highly anisotropic resolution. To address this issue, we present a\nHybrid Dual Mean-Teacher (HD-Teacher) model with hybrid, semi-supervised, and\nmulti-task learning to achieve highly effective semi-supervised segmentation.\nHD-Teacher employs a 2D and a 3D mean-teacher network to produce segmentation\nlabels and signed distance fields from the hybrid information captured in both\ndimensionalities. This hybrid learning mechanism allows HD-Teacher to combine\nthe `best of both worlds', utilizing features extracted from either 2D, 3D, or\nboth dimensions to produce outputs as it sees fit. Outputs from 2D and 3D\nteacher models are also dynamically combined, based on their individual\nuncertainty scores, into a single hybrid prediction, where the hybrid\nuncertainty is estimated. We then propose a hybrid regularization module to\nencourage both student models to produce results close to the\nuncertainty-weighted hybrid prediction. The hybrid uncertainty suppresses\nunreliable knowledge in the hybrid prediction, leaving only useful information\nto improve network performance further.

The\neffectiveness of the Multivariate Analysis (MVA) method with the Boosted\nDecision Tree (BDT) algorithm is explored in order to obtain a better\nsignificance for different models. Promising results are obtained for the\n3-lepton channels, indicating that the use of MVA methods can improve the\nsensitivity of the search for gluinos at LHC RUN-III. The study probes the\nmulti-lepton signatures arising from gluinos via intermediate eweakinos and\nsleptons at an early stage of the LHC RUN-III. The heavier eweakinos can give\nrise to three or four lepton signals in which the squark hierarchy between L\nand R types plays a crucial role. The study considers two sets of benchmark\npoints that satisfy all the collider constraints obtained from the LHC RUN-II\ndata. Moreover, these sets of benchmark points are mostly consistent with\nWMAP/PLANCK data and the muon (g-2) constraint.

Built upon a pre-learned StyleGAN2 generator, RiDDLE\nmanages to encrypt and decrypt the facial identity within the latent space. The\ndesign of RiDDLE has three appealing properties. First, the encryption process\nis cipher-guided and hence allows diverse anonymization using different\npasswords. Second, the true identity can only be decrypted with the correct\npassword, otherwise the system will produce another de-identified face to\nmaintain the privacy. Third, both encryption and decryption share an efficient\nimplementation, benefiting from a carefully tailored lightweight encryptor.\nComparisons with existing alternatives confirm that our approach accomplishes\nthe de-identification task with better quality, higher diversity, and stronger\nreversibility.

However, such\ntechniques require large amounts of data to train high-performing models which\ncan be intrinsically difficult to acquire, especially when it comes to scarce\nbiomarkers. To address this challenge, we use a single, pre-trained, deep\nembeddings extractor to convert images into deep features and train small,\ndedicated classification head on these embeddings for each classification task.\nThis approach offers several benefits such as the ability to reuse a single\npre-trained deep network for various tasks; reducing the amount of labeled data\nneeded as classification heads have fewer parameters; and accelerating training\ntime by up to 1000 times, which allows for much more tuning of the\nclassification head. In this work, we perform an extensive comparison of\nvarious open-source backbones and assess their fit to the target histological\nimage domain. This is achieved using a novel method based on a proxy\nclassification task. We demonstrate that thanks to this selection method, an\noptimal feature extractor can be selected for different tasks on the target\ndomain. We also introduce a feature space augmentation strategy which proves to\nsubstantially improve the final metrics computed for the different tasks\nconsidered. To demonstrate the benefit of such backbone selection and\nfeature-space augmentation, our experiments are carried out on three separate\nclassification tasks and show a clear improvement on each of them:\nmicrocalcifications (29.1% F1-score increase), lymph nodes metastasis (12.5%\nF1-score increase), mitosis (15.0% F1-score increase).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 11:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

However, semantic communication is still in its infancy\nand it faces many challenges, such as semantic information definition and\nsemantic communication measurement. To address these challenges, we investigate\nunified semantic information measures and semantic channel coding theorem.\nSpecifically, to address the shortcoming of existing semantic entropy\ndefinitions can only be applied to specific tasks, we propose a universal\nsemantic entropy definition as the uncertainty in the semantic interpretation\nof random variable symbols in the context of knowledge bases. The proposed\nuniversal semantic entropy not only depends on the probability distribution,\nbut also depends on the specific value of the symbol and the background\nknowledge base. Under the given conditions, the proposed universal semantic\nentropy definition can degenerate into the existing semantic entropy and\nShannon entropy definitions. Moreover, since the accurate transmission of\nsemantic symbols in the semantic communication system can allow a non-zero bit\nerror rate, we conjecture that the bit rate of the semantic communication may\nexceed the Shannon channel capacity. Furthermore, we propose a semantic channel\ncoding theorem, and prove its achievability and converse. Since the well-known\nFano's inequality cannot be directly applied to semantic communications, we\nderive and prove the semantic Fano's inequality, and use it to prove the\nconverse. To our best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof that the\ntransmission rate of semantic communication can exceed the Shannon channel\ncapacity, which provides a theoretical basis for semantic communication\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 11:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

Rate coefficients of gas-phase oxidation\nand clustering reactions of SiO, Si$_2$O$_2$ and Si$_2$O$_3$ have been\ncalculated using master equation calculations based on density functional\ntheory calculations. The calculations show that the reactions involving OH are\nfast. Reactions involving H$_2$O are not efficient routes to oxidation but may\nunder the right conditions lead to hydroxylated species. The reaction of\nSi$_2$O$_2$ with H$_2$O, which has been suggested as efficient producing\nSi$_2$O$_3$, is therefore not as efficient as previously thought. If H$_2$O\nmolecules dissociate to form OH radicals, oxidation of SiO and dust formation\ncould be accelerated.

Most of previous works\nstudy the non-Hermitian skin effect in periodic systems. However,\nelectromagnetic waves often propagate within uniform materials without periodic\nmodulation, and it has not been clear whether the optical NHSE occurs in\nuniform media such as bulk materials and electromagnetic metamaterials.

The localization of non-Hermitian skin modes are completely\ndetermined by an effective gauge potential caused by the anisotropy of a\ndielectric tensor.

However, defining a\ngood choice of hyperparameters is a challenging problem.\n  Hyperparameter tuning often requires manual or automated searches to find\noptimal values. Nonetheless, a noticeable limitation is the high cost of\nalgorithm evaluation for complex models, making the tuning process\ncomputationally expensive and time-consuming.\n  In this paper, we propose a framework based on integrating complex event\nprocessing and temporal models, to alleviate these trade-offs. Through this\ncombination, it is possible to gain insights about a running RL system\nefficiently and unobtrusively based on data stream monitoring and to create\nabstract representations that allow reasoning about the historical behaviour of\nthe RL system. The obtained knowledge is exploited to provide feedback to the\nRL system for optimising its hyperparameters while making effective use of\nparallel resources.\n  We introduce a novel history-aware epsilon-greedy logic for hyperparameter\noptimisation that instead of using static hyperparameters that are kept fixed\nfor the whole training, adjusts the hyperparameters at runtime based on the\nanalysis of the agent's performance over time windows in a single agent's\nlifetime. We tested the proposed approach in a 5G mobile communications case\nstudy that uses DQN, a variant of RL, for its decision-making. Our experiments\ndemonstrated the effects of hyperparameter tuning using history on training\nstability and reward values. The encouraging results show that the proposed\nhistory-aware framework significantly improved performance compared to\ntraditional hyperparameter tuning approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 11:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

We investigate normal-to-adverse condition model adaptation for\nsemantic segmentation, whereby image-level correspondences are available in the\ntarget domain. The target set consists of unlabeled pairs of adverse- and\nnormal-condition street images taken at GPS-matched locations.

Furthermore, Ti2CN2\nexhibits a unique double-layer adsorption mode for Sr ions, endowing it with an\nultra-high adsorption capacity (1.864 g g-1), much higher than that of other\nTi2CTx MXenes. Our results are expected to provide a new perspective for the\ndesign of MXene materials as adsorbent for radionuclide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 11:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

A mean magnetic field of strength B0 is introduced and\nthe MHD linear stability problem studied for modes with wave-number k in the\ny-direction, and Bloch wavenumber l in the x-direction. The parameters\ngoverning the problem are Reynolds number 1/nu, magnetic Prandtl number P, and\ndimensionless magnetic field strength B0. The mean magnetic field can be taken\nto have an arbitrary direction in the (x,y)-plane and a mean x-directed flow U0\ncan be incorporated.\n  First the paper considers Kolmogorov flow with y-directed mean magnetic\nfield, referred to as vertical. Taking l=0, the suppression of the pure\nhydrodynamic instability is observed with increasing field strength B0. A\nbranch of strong-field instabilities occurs for magnetic Prandtl number P less\nthan unity, as found by A.E. Fraser, I.G. Cresser and P. Garaud (J. Fluid Mech.\n949, A43, 2022).

These latter issues, called goal divergences, are the\nsubject of goal conflict analysis, which consists of identifying, assessing,\nand resolving divergences, as part of a more general activity known as goal\nrefinement. While there exist techniques that, when requirements are expressed\nformally, can automatically identify and assess goal conflicts, there is\ncurrently no automated approach to support engineers in resolving identified\ndivergences.

The main characteristic\nthat brings together these works is that they employ a single CA rule to define\nthe vectorial Boolean function of the S-box. In this work, we explore a\ndifferent direction for the design of S-boxes that leverages on Orthogonal CA\n(OCA), i.e. pairs of CA rules giving rise to orthogonal Latin squares. The\nmotivation stands on the facts that an OCA pair already defines a bijective\ntransformation, and moreover the orthogonality property of the resulting Latin\nsquares ensures a minimum amount of diffusion. We exhaustively enumerate all\nS-boxes generated by OCA pairs of diameter $4 \\le d \\le 6$, and measure their\nnonlinearity. Interestingly, we observe that for $d=4$ and $d=5$ all S-boxes\nare linear, despite the underlying CA local rules being nonlinear. The smallest\nnonlinear S-boxes emerges for $d=6$, but their nonlinearity is still too low to\nbe used in practice. Nonetheless, we unearth an interesting structure of linear\nOCA S-boxes, proving that their Linear Components Space (LCS) is itself the\nimage of a linear CA, or equivalently a polynomial code.

However, when applying GANs in the remote sensing (RS)\nimage generation task, an extraordinary phenomenon is observed: the GAN model\nis more sensitive to the size of training data for RS image generation than for\nnatural image generation. In other words, the generation quality of RS images\nwill change significantly with the number of training categories or samples per\ncategory. In this paper, we first analyze this phenomenon from two kinds of toy\nexperiments and conclude that the amount of feature information contained in\nthe GAN model decreases with reduced training data. Then we establish a\nstructural causal model (SCM) of the data generation process and interpret the\ngenerated data as the counterfactuals. Based on this SCM, we theoretically\nprove that the quality of generated images is positively correlated with the\namount of feature information. This provides insights for enriching the feature\ninformation learned by the GAN model during training. Consequently, we propose\ntwo innovative adjustment schemes, namely Uniformity Regularization (UR) and\nEntropy Regularization (ER), to increase the information learned by the GAN\nmodel at the distributional and sample levels, respectively. We theoretically\nand empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our methods.\nExtensive experiments on three RS datasets and two natural datasets show that\nour methods outperform the well-established models on RS image generation\ntasks.

In the\nlater case the core material forms an accretion disk around the NS that might\nexperience a thermonuclear outburst, leading to an energetic event powered by\nboth jets and thermonuclear burning. We term this scenario thermonuclear CEJSN.\nWe find that the maximum core mass that leads to this scenario with a NS is $2\nM_{\\rm \\odot} \\lesssim M_{\\rm core} \\lesssim 3.5M_{\\rm \\odot}$. We estimate the\nevent rates of CEJSN that go through tidal disruption of the core by a NS to be\n5 per 1000 core collapse supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 13:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

Tracer particles allow us to\naccurately follow the trajectory of accreting material for all protostars and\nthereby constrain the accretion reservoir of the stars. The diversity of the\naccretion process implies that stars in the solar mass regime can have vastly\ndifferent accretion histories. Some stars accrete most of their mass during the\ninitial collapse phase, while others gain >50 % of their final mass from late\ninfall. The angular momentum budget of stars that experience substantial\ninfall, so-called late accretors, is significantly higher than for stars\nwithout or with only little late accretion. As the probability of late infall\nincreases with increasing final stellar mass, the specific angular momentum\nbudget of higher mass stars is on average higher. The hypothetical centrifugal\nradius computed from the accreting particles at the time of formation is orders\nof magnitude higher than observed disk sizes, which emphasizes the importance\nof angular momentum transport during disk formation. Nevertheless, we find a\ncorrelation that the centrifugal radius is highest for stars with substantial\ninfall, which suggests that very large disks are the result of recent infall\nevents. There are also indications for a subtle trend of increasing centrifugal\nradius with increasing final stellar mass, which is in agreement with an\nobserved marginal correlation of disk size and stellar mass. Finally, we show\nthat late accretors become embedded again during infall. As a consequence, late\naccretors are (apparently) rejuvenated and would be classified as Class 0\nobjects according to their bolometric temperature despite being 1 Myr old.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 13:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

By analyzing a\nmodel experiment using thin sheets suspended in a shear cell, we found that a\npair of sheets can bend for a shear rate ten times lower than the buckling\nthreshold defined for a single sheet. This effect is caused by a lateral\nhydrodynamic force that arises from the disturbance flow field induced by the\nneighboring sheet. The lateral hydrodynamic force removes the buckling\ninstability but massively enhances the bending deformation. For small\nseparations between sheets, lubrication forces prevail and prevent deformation.\nThose two opposing effects result in a non-monotonic relation between distances\nand shear rate for bending.

Classical\nshape descriptors (such as axis ratios, circularity of projection) were not\ninherently three-dimensional, because no such technology existed. Recently a\nnew class of three-dimensional descriptors, collectively referred to as\nmechanical descriptors has been introduced and applied for a broad range of\nsedimentary particles. First order mechanical descriptors (registered for each\npebble as a pair $\\{S,U\\}$ of integers), refer to the respective numbers of\nstable and unstable static equilibria and can be reliably detected by hand\nexperiments. However, they have limited ability of distinction as the majority\nof coastal pebbles fall into primary class $\\{S,U\\}=\\{2,2\\}$. Higher order\nmechanical descriptors offer a more refined distinction. However for the\nextraction of these descriptors (registered as graphs for each pebble) hand\nmeasurements are not an option and even computer-based extraction from 3D scans\noffers a formidable challenge. Here we not only describe and implement an\nalgorithm to perform this task, but also apply it to a collection of 271\npebbles with various lithologies, illustrating that the application of higher\norder descriptors is a viable option for geomorphologists. We also show that\nthe so-far uncharted connection between the two known secondary descriptors,\nthe so-called Morse-Smale graph and the Reeb-graph can be established via a\nthird order descriptor which we call the master graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 14:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

TAR directly exploits the transparency-dependence of\ntunneling current to disentangle contributions of single-particle current and\nAndreev reflection. These measurements provided new direct evidence in favor of\nthe sign-changing nature of the superconducting order in FeSe, in a distinctly\ncomplementary approach to nanoscale imaging of quasiparticle interference.\nCrucially TAR can also probe higher-order contributions to Andreev reflection.\nQuantitative comparison of the experimental signatures of higher-order Andreev\nreflections with those in concomitant tight-binding simulations revealed new\nevidence in support of the nodal gap structure of superconductivity in FeSe.\nFinally, the effect of structural topological defects can be directly probed\nwith TAR owing to its atomic spatial resolution.

Plenty of methods have\nbeen proposed for automatic brain tumor segmentation using four common MRI\nmodalities and achieved remarkable performance. In practice, however, it is\ncommon to have one or more modalities missing due to image corruption,\nartifacts, acquisition protocols, allergy to contrast agents, or simply cost.\nIn this work, we propose a novel two-stage framework for brain tumor\nsegmentation with missing modalities. In the first stage, a multimodal masked\nautoencoder (M3AE) is proposed, where both random modalities (i.e., modality\ndropout) and random patches of the remaining modalities are masked for a\nreconstruction task, for self-supervised learning of robust multimodal\nrepresentations against missing modalities. To this end, we name our framework\nM3AE. Meanwhile, we employ model inversion to optimize a representative\nfull-modal image at marginal extra cost, which will be used to substitute for\nthe missing modalities and boost performance during inference. Then in the\nsecond stage, a memory-efficient self distillation is proposed to distill\nknowledge between heterogenous missing-modal situations while fine-tuning the\nmodel for supervised segmentation. Our M3AE belongs to the 'catch-all' genre\nwhere a single model can be applied to all possible subsets of modalities, thus\nis economic for both training and deployment. Extensive experiments on BraTS\n2018 and 2020 datasets demonstrate its superior performance to existing\nstate-of-the-art methods with missing modalities, as well as the efficacy of\nits components.

By exploiting a boundary formulation based on\nGreen's function approach, the unknown contact domain is calculated by\nenforcing a proper local energy balance that takes into account for the\ncontribution of the non-conservative work of internal stresses. The latter is\ndirectly related to the odd part of the Green function. The theory predicts\nthat, within a certain a range of velocities, the interaction between adhesion\nand viscoelasticity leads to enhanced adhesive performance, i.e. larger contact\narea and pull-o? force, compared to the equivalent adhesive elastic case. At\nlow velocity friction is also strongly enhanced compared to the adhesiveless\nviscoelastic case, mainly as a consequence of adhesion hysteresis induced by\nthe small-scale viscoelasticity. However, at intermediate and high velocity\nvalues, the effect of viscoelastic hysteresis occurring at larger scales, i.e.\ninto the bulk, causes friction to increase further. Under these conditions, due\nto the presence of adhesion, small-scale and bulk contribution to friction\ncannot be linearly separated. As consequence of the finiteness of the contact\nlength, the energy release rates follow a non-monotonic trend, which is not\nobserved during crack propagation or healing in infinite systems. All the\npresented results are strongly supported by existing experimental evidences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 15:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

Previous\nstudies have succeeded in re-creating different aspects of the visuals, such as\nlow-level properties (shape, texture, layout) or high-level features (category\nof objects, descriptive semantics of scenes) but have typically failed to\nreconstruct these properties together for complex scene images. Generative AI\nhas recently made a leap forward with latent diffusion models capable of\ngenerating high-complexity images. Here, we investigate how to take advantage\nof this innovative technology for brain decoding. We present a two-stage scene\nreconstruction framework called ``Brain-Diffuser''. In the first stage,\nstarting from fMRI signals, we reconstruct images that capture low-level\nproperties and overall layout using a VDVAE (Very Deep Variational Autoencoder)\nmodel. In the second stage, we use the image-to-image framework of a latent\ndiffusion model (Versatile Diffusion) conditioned on predicted multimodal (text\nand visual) features, to generate final reconstructed images. On the publicly\navailable Natural Scenes Dataset benchmark, our method outperforms previous\nmodels both qualitatively and quantitatively. When applied to synthetic fMRI\npatterns generated from individual ROI (region-of-interest) masks, our trained\nmodel creates compelling ``ROI-optimal'' scenes consistent with neuroscientific\nknowledge. Thus, the proposed methodology can have an impact on both applied\n(e.g. brain-computer interface) and fundamental neuroscience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 15:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

However,\nas the agent's belief is updated continuously, these predicted future actions\nmay not end up being the ones executed by agents, introducing a form of\nnoise/inaccuracy in the system and often decreasing performance. In this work,\nwe propose a decentralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to MAIPP,\nwhich relies on an attention-based neural network, where agents optimize\nlong-term individual and cooperative objectives by explicitly sharing their\nintent (i.e., medium-/long-term future positions distribution, obtained from\ntheir individual policy) in a reactive, asynchronous manner. That is, in our\nwork, intent sharing allows agents to learn to claim/avoid broader areas of the\nworld. Moreover, since our approach relies on learned attention over these\nshared intents, agents are able to learn to recognize the useful portion(s) of\nthese (imperfect) predictions to maximize cooperation even in the presence of\nimperfect information. Our comparison experiments demonstrate the performance\nof our approach compared to its variants and high-quality baselines over a\nlarge set of MAIPP simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 15:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

However, many such\nhigh-income countries were reluctant or slow to distribute extra doses of the\nvaccine to lower-income countries via the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access\n(COVAX) collaboration [Clinton and Yoo 2022]. In addition to moral objections\nto such vaccine nationalism, vaccine inequity during a pandemic could\ncontribute to the evolution of new variants of the virus and possibly increase\ntotal deaths, including in the high-income countries. This paper uses the\nCOVID-19 pandemic as a case study to identify scenarios under which it might be\nin a high-income nation's own interest to donate vaccine doses to another\ncountry before its own population has been fully vaccinated.

In this work, we propose a method for major\ndepressive disorder (MDD) diagnosis as well as a method for predicting the drug\nresponse in patient with MDD using EEG signals. Method: We employ transformers,\nwhich are modified recursive neural networks with novel architecture to\nevaluate the time dependency of time series effectively.

In many applications, network connections are collected\nvia egocentric sampling: a subset of nodes is sampled first, after which all\nlinks involving this subset are recorded; all other information is missing.\nCompared with the assumption of ``uniformly missing at random\", egocentrically\nsampled partial networks require specially designed modeling strategies.\nCurrent statistical methods are either computationally infeasible or based on\nintuitive designs without theoretical justification. Here, we propose an\napproach to fit general low-rank models for egocentrically sampled networks,\nwhich include several popular network models. This method is based on graph\nspectral properties and is computationally efficient for large-scale networks.\nIt results in consistent recovery of missing subnetworks due to egocentric\nsampling for sparse networks. To our knowledge, this method offers the first\ntheoretical guarantee for egocentric partial network estimation in the scope of\nlow-rank models. We evaluate the technique on several synthetic and real-world\nnetworks and show that it delivers competitive performance in link prediction\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 03:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

However, the simulated data often differs\nfrom real-world data, creating a distribution gap that can decrease the\nefficacy of models trained on simulation data in real-world applications. To\nmitigate this gap, sim-to-real domain transfer modifies simulated images to\nbetter match real-world data, enabling the effective use of simulation data in\nmodel training.\n  Sim-to-real transfer utilizes image translation methods, which are divided\ninto two main categories: paired and unpaired image-to-image translation.\nPaired image translation requires a perfect pixel match, making it difficult to\napply in practice due to the lack of pixel-wise correspondence between\nsimulation and real-world data. Unpaired image translation, while more suitable\nfor sim-to-real transfer, is still challenging to learn for complex natural\nscenes. To address these challenges, we propose a third category:\napproximately-paired sim-to-real translation, where the source and target\nimages do not need to be exactly paired. Our approximately-paired method,\nAptSim2Real, exploits the fact that simulators can generate scenes loosely\nresembling real-world scenes in terms of lighting, environment, and\ncomposition. Our novel training strategy results in significant qualitative and\nquantitative improvements, with up to a 24% improvement in FID score compared\nto the state-of-the-art unpaired image-translation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 06:18:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 04:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}
