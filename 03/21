Therefore, to overcome this issue, different types\nof small gold nanorods were synthesized and converted into stable aggregates to\nred-shift the plasmonic resonance wavelength to longer near-infrared\nwavelengths. The gold nanorod aggregates were embedded into the agarose gel\nphantoms mimicking the tumor-tissue-like structure.

However, synthesis of iron oxides with desired\nphase and size are still a time-consuming and trial-and-error process. This\nstudy presents solutions for two fundamental challenges in materials synthesis:\npredicting the outcome of a synthesis from specified reaction parameters and\ncorrelating sets of parameters to obtain products with desired outcomes. Four\nmachine learning algorithms, including random forest, logistic regression,\nsupport vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor, were trained to predict the\nphase and particle size of iron oxide based on experimental conditions. Among\nthe models, random forest exhibited the best performance, achieving 96% and 81%\naccuracy when predicting the phase and size of iron oxides in the test dataset.\nPremutation feature importance analysis shows that most models (except logistic\nregression) rely on known features such as precursor concentration, pH, and\ntemperature to predict the phases from synthesis conditions. The robustness of\nthe random forest models was further verified by comparing prediction and\nexperimental results based on 24 randomly generated methods in additive and\nnon-additive systems not included in the datasets. The predictions of product\nphase and particle size from the models are in good agreement with the\nexperimental results. Additionally, a searching and ranking algorithm was\ndeveloped to recommend potential synthesis parameters for obtaining iron oxide\nproducts with desired phase and particle size from previous studies in the\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 16:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

The wave number of these states\nin units of the equilibrium state wave number is denoted here by p, and\naccordingly the corresponding states are called the p-states. In this work we\nstudy in detail the metastability of the p-states. The application of an\nexternal magnetic field in the direction of the chiral axis has a double\neffect: on one hand, it introduces a conical deformation of the p-states, and\non the other hand it destabilizes some of them, shrinking the range of p in\nwhich the p-states are metastable. If a polarized current is applied along the\nchiral axis, the p-states reach a steady moving state with a constant velocity\nproportional to the current intensity. Besides this dynamical effect, the\npolarized current also induces a conical deformation and reduces the range of\nstability of the p-states. The stability diagram in the plane applied field -\napplied current intensity has interesting features that, among other things,\npermit the manipulation of p-states by a combination of applied fields and\ncurrents. These features can be exploited to devise processes to switch between\np-states. In particular there are p-states with negative p, opening the\npossibility to helicity switching. The theoretical feasibility of such\nprocesses, crucial from the point of view of applications, is shown by\nmicromagnetic simulations. Analogous $p$-states exists in cubic chiral\nhelimagnets and therefore similar effects are expected in those systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 16:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

In general, off-diagonal components of\nquark Yukawa interactions with additional Higgs bosons are strongly constrained\nby the data for flavor changing neutral currents. However, top-charm quark\nmixing is not the case, so that a large off-diagonal element can be taken,\nwhich can contribute to generating baryon asymmetry of the universe. It turns\nout that CP violating phases of the off-diagonal element in the source term in\nthe Boltzmann equation are eliminated by the rephasing. This result is somewhat\ndifferent from previous works on electroweak baryogenesis by flavor\noff-diagonal Yukawa couplings. Instead, we find that the absolute value of the\ntop-charm off-diagonal element enhances CP violating phases in the Higgs\npotential, by which sufficient amount of the baryon number can be generated to\nexplain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe.

The\ncompanion is located along the helium-core white dwarf cooling sequence and the\ncomparison with binary evolution models provides a mass of $0.17 \\pm\n0.02~M_\\odot$, a surface temperature of $11500\\pm1900$ K and a very young\ncooling age of only $200\\pm100$ Myr.

In the case of the latter, cybersecurity\npractitioners use port scanning catalog exposed systems, identify potential\nmisconfigurations, or test controls that may be running on a system. Existing\nliterature has thoroughly established a taxonomy for port scanning. The\ntaxonomy maps the types of scans as well as techniques. In fact, there are\nseveral tools mentioned repeatedly in the literature. Those are Nmap, Zmap, and\nmasscan. Further, the presence of multiple tools signals that how a port\nscanner interacts with target systems impacts the output of the tool. In other\nwords, the various tools may not behave identically or produce identical\noutput. Yet, no work has been done to quantify the efficacy for these popular\ntools in a uniform, rigorous manner.

We, however, show that this\ntraditional picture is superseded with a novel picture arising from basic\ncharacteristics of the nuclear forces. In the traditional view, as stressed by\nAage Bohr in his Nobel lecture, most of heavy nuclei are like axially-symmetric\nprolate ellipsoids (i.e., with two shorter axes of equal length), rotating\nabout one of the short axes, like a rod. In the present picture, however, in\nmany cases, the lengths of these three axes are all different, called triaxial.\nThe triaxial shape yields more complex rotations, which actually reproduce\nexperimental data as shown by state-of-the-art Configuration Interaction\ncalculations, on supercomputers. The key to differentiate the two pictures is\nthe nuclear tensor force, which is known to produce the shell evolution in\nexotic nuclei, a major agenda of Rare-Isotope physics. We now demonstrate that\nthe same tensor force generates, in many nuclei, the triaxiality, fading the\nprolate-ellipsoid dominance away. The tensor force is a direct consequence of\none $\\pi$ meson exchange between nucleons, and the present finding is regarded\nas the first explicit or visible case that elementary particles directly affect\nnuclear shapes.

This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates\nsimultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air\naggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been\nrecently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and\nmajority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution\none-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to\nperformance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by\nfading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved.

To this end, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the\nconvergence of FL with EFOBDA.

To investigate the outcome of EGFR mutation in healthy lung stem\ncells, we grew murine alveolar type-II organoids monoclonally in a 3D Matrigel.\nOur experiments showed that the EGFR-L858R mutation induced a change in\norganoid structure: mutated organoids displayed more `budding', in comparison\nto non-mutant controls, which were nearly spherical.

Models indicate that in massive\nearly-type galaxies (ETGs) dark matter should account for $\\sim60\\%$ of the\ndynamical mass within five effective radii ($5 R_{\\rm e}$). Most massive ETGs\nhave been shaped through a two-phase process: the rapid growth of a compact\ncore was followed by the accretion of an extended envelope through mergers. The\nexceedingly rare galaxies that have avoided the second phase, the so-called\nrelic galaxies, are thought to be the frozen remains of the massive ETG\npopulation at $z\\gtrsim2$. The best relic galaxy candidate discovered to date\nis NGC 1277, in the Perseus cluster. We used deep integral field GCMS data to\nrevisit NGC 1277 out to an unprecedented radius of 6 kpc (corresponding to $5\nR_{\\rm e}$). By using Jeans anisotropic modelling we find a negligible dark\nmatter fraction within $5 R_{\\rm e}$ ($f_{\\rm DM}(5 R_{\\rm e})<0.05$; two-sigma\nconfidence level), which is in tension with the expectation. Since the lack of\nan extended envelope would reduce dynamical friction and prevent the accretion\nof an envelope, we propose that NGC 1277 lost its dark matter very early or\nthat it was dark matter deficient ab initio. We discuss our discovery in the\nframework of recent proposals suggesting that some relic galaxies may result\nfrom dark matter stripping as they fell in and interacted within galaxy\nclusters. Alternatively, NGC 1277 might have been born in a high-velocity\ncollision of gas-rich proto-galactic fragments, where dark matter left behind a\ndisc of dissipative baryons. We speculate that the relative velocities of\n$\\approx2000 {\\rm km/s}$ required for the latter process to happen were\npossible in the progenitors of the present-day rich galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 18:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 18:08:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 17:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Using statistically significant blind tests, we show that CSO 2s\nthemselves consist of two morphologically distinct classes: CSO 2.0, having\nprominent hot-spots at the leading edges of narrow jets and/or narrow lobes;\nand CSO 2.2, without prominent hot-spots, and with broad jets and/or lobes. An\nintermediate class, CSO 2.1, exhibits mixed properties. The four classes occupy\ndifferent, overlapping, portions of the luminosity-size plane, with the sizes\nof largest CSOs being $\\sim 500$pc. We advance the hypothesis that CSO 2.0s are\nyoung and evolve through CSO 2.1s into CSO 2.2s, which are old (up to $\\sim\n5000$ yr).

We observe a variety of interesting impurity clustering-induced\neffects in the self-energy such as the suppression of quasi-particle lifetimes\nat certain momenta and an increase in localization, as indicated by the inverse\nparticipation ratio. The KWANT results are reproduced in our modified T-matrix\napproach. In addition, our method allows for a full analytical treatment of\nclustering effects which can aid in physical insight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 18:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Both hypotheses suffer from significant\ndrawbacks: the former does not account for the dynamical evolution of\nstar-forming regions, while in the latter the time for massive stars to explode\nas supernovae can be similar to, or even longer than, the lifetime of\nprotoplanetary discs.

We use N-body simulations and a post-processing analysis\nto calculate the amount of enrichment in each disc, and we vary the stellar\ndensity of the star-forming regions.

On the\nother hand, the data indicate a highly significant correlation between U and\nstar-formation-rate surface density (Sigma_SFR) which appears to be redshift\ninvariant at z~1.6-6.3, and possibly up to z~9.5. We consider several avenues\nthrough which metallicity and Sigma_SFR (or gas density) may influence U,\nincluding variations in n_e and Q that are tied to metallicity and gas density,\ninternal dust extinction of ionizing photons, and the effects of gas density on\nthe volume filling fraction of dense clumps in HII regions and the escape\nfraction of ionizing photons.

In this work, we propose to rather direct\neffort to efficient adaptations of existing models, and propose to augment\nLanguage Models with perception. Existing approaches for adapting pretrained\nmodels for vision-language tasks still rely on several key components that\nhinder their efficiency.

Higher\nrepresentational power is needed to go from representing a single given image\nto representing large and diverse datasets. Our approach addresses this gap by\nrepresenting an image with a polynomial function and eliminates the need for\npositional encodings.

Many years of research made it clear that the driving\nforce for spontaneous emulsification arises from the differences of the\nchemical potentials of various components in the organic and aqueous phases,\nwhich triggers diffusion coupled hydrodynamic fluctuation. While extraordinary\ntheoretical developments have taken place that attempted to describe these\nprocesses within the scopes of equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics,\nthe local processes underlying the spontaneous emulsification, however, still\nremain elusive. In this research, we investigate the local processes that\ninvolve the transfer of surfactant as well as water from one phase to another\n(i.e. water to oil), which results in the formation of water-in-oil emulsion in\nthe organic phase and, subsequently. Thes emulsions invert into oil-in-water\nemulsion, rather abruptly, as they cross the phase boundary. Studies based on\nUV spectroscopy and molecular dynamics indicate that these processes may\ninvolve explosive events and subsequent assembly of the fragments to other\norganized structures which are reminiscent of cusp catastrophe proposed earlier\nby Dickinson. These processes lead to either to a strong or a weak fluctuation\nof the component concentrations below the interface that also becomes evident\nin the fast (athermal) diffusion of the emulsion droplets from the interfacial\nregion farther into the bulk water. These events can be arrested suitably with\npolymeric additives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 20:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

In fact, several practical\nstudies have shown that if a pruned model is fine-tuned with some\ngradient-based updates it generalizes well to new samples. Although the above\npipeline, which we refer to as pruning + fine-tuning, has been extremely\nsuccessful in lowering the complexity of trained models, there is very little\nknown about the theory behind this success. In this paper, we address this\nissue by investigating the pruning + fine-tuning framework on the\noverparameterized matrix sensing problem with the ground truth $U_\\star \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^{d \\times r}$ and the overparameterized model $U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d\n\\times k}$ with $k \\gg r$. We study the approximate local minima of the mean\nsquare error, augmented with a smooth version of a group Lasso regularizer,\n$\\sum_{i=1}^k \\| U e_i \\|_2$. In particular, we provably show that pruning all\nthe columns below a certain explicit $\\ell_2$-norm threshold results in a\nsolution $U_{\\text{prune}}$ which has the minimum number of columns $r$, yet\nclose to the ground truth in training loss. Moreover, in the subsequent\nfine-tuning phase, gradient descent initialized at $U_{\\text{prune}}$ converges\nat a linear rate to its limit. While our analysis provides insights into the\nrole of regularization in pruning, we also show that running gradient descent\nin the absence of regularization results in models which {are not suitable for\ngreedy pruning}, i.e., many columns could have their $\\ell_2$ norm comparable\nto that of the maximum. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide the\nfirst rigorous insights on why greedy pruning + fine-tuning leads to smaller\nmodels which also generalize well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 21:05:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 09:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

In\nthis paper, we propose a backdoor-based watermarking approach that serves as a\ngeneral framework for safeguarding public-available data. By inserting a small\nnumber of watermarking samples into the dataset, our approach enables the\nlearning model to implicitly learn a secret function set by defenders. This\nhidden function can then be used as a watermark to track down third-party\nmodels that use the dataset illegally. Unfortunately, existing backdoor\ninsertion methods often entail adding arbitrary and mislabeled data to the\ntraining set, leading to a significant drop in performance and easy detection\nby anomaly detection algorithms. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a\nclean-label backdoor watermarking framework that uses imperceptible\nperturbations to replace mislabeled samples. As a result, the watermarking\nsamples remain consistent with the original labels, making them difficult to\ndetect. Our experiments on text, image, and audio datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed framework effectively safeguards datasets with minimal impact on\noriginal task performance. We also show that adding just 1% of watermarking\nsamples can inject a traceable watermarking function and that our watermarking\nsamples are stealthy and look benign upon visual inspection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 21:54:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 06:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

ICT (Information and Communication\nTechnology) is a powerful tool to reduce emissions as it offers alternatives to\nactivities that are costly in energy: video streaming saves energy vs driving\nto a movie theater, for instance. Still, the carbon footprint of ICT in general\nand networking in particular have been growing, despite better energy\nefficiency per transmitted bit, due to the sheer growth in Internet usage and\ntraffic.\n  The information and communication technology (ICT) sector is currently\nestimated to create 2.7% of all global CO2 emissions and expected to continue\nto increase. Hence, monitoring and reducing the CO2 emissions from ICT is\nincreasingly important.

However, the computation of\nequilibrium prices at which the supply of goods matches their demand typically\nrelies on having access to complete information on private attributes of\nagents, e.g., suppliers' cost functions, which are often unavailable in\npractice. Motivated by this practical consideration, we consider the problem of\nsetting equilibrium prices in the incomplete information setting wherein a\nmarket operator seeks to satisfy the customer demand for a commodity by\npurchasing the required amount from competing suppliers with privately known\ncost functions unknown to the market operator. In this incomplete information\nsetting, we consider the online learning problem of learning equilibrium prices\nover time while jointly optimizing three performance metrics -- unmet demand,\ncost regret, and payment regret -- pertinent in the context of equilibrium\npricing over a horizon of $T$ periods. We first consider the setting when\nsuppliers' cost functions are fixed and develop algorithms that achieve a\nregret of $O(\\log \\log T)$ when the customer demand is constant over time, or\n$O(\\sqrt{T} \\log \\log T)$ when the demand is variable over time. Next, we\nconsider the setting when the suppliers' cost functions can vary over time and\nillustrate that no online algorithm can achieve sublinear regret on all three\nmetrics when the market operator has no information about how the cost\nfunctions change over time. Thus, we consider an augmented setting wherein the\noperator has access to hints/contexts that, without revealing the complete\nspecification of the cost functions, reflect the variation in the cost\nfunctions over time and propose an algorithm with sublinear regret in this\naugmented setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 00:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 03:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Intuitively, the vessel's motions are following the\nlaws of dynamics, e.g., the speed of a vessel decreases when turning a corner.\nYet, it is challenging to combine dynamic knowledge and neural networks due to\ntheir inherent heterogeneity. Against this background, we propose MSTFormer, a\nmotion inspired vessel trajectory prediction method based on Transformer. The\ncontribution of this work is threefold.

For a typical dust-to-gas mass ratio of debris\ndisks, CO formation proceeds without the involvement of H$_2$ because a small\namount of dust grains makes H$_2$ formation inefficient. We find that the CO to\nC number density ratio depends on a combination of\n$n_\\mathrm{H}Z^{0.4}\\chi^{-1.1}$, where $n_\\mathrm{H}$ is the hydrogen nucleus\nnumber density, $Z$ is the metallicity, and $\\chi$ is the FUV flux normalized\nby the Habing flux.

Here, we report on\n144-MHz LOFAR radio observations of three GW merger events containing at least\none neutron star that were detected during the third GW observing run.\nSpecifically, we probe 9 and 16 per cent of the location probability density\nmaps of S190426c and S200213t, respectively, and place limits at the location\nof an interesting optical transient (PS19hgw/AT2019wxt) found within the\nlocalisation map of S191213g. While these GW events are not particularly\nsignificant, we use multi-epoch LOFAR data to devise a sensitive wide-field GW\nfollow-up strategy to be used in future GW observing runs. In particular, we\nimprove on our previously published strategy by implementing direction\ndependent calibration and mosaicing, resulting in nearly an order of magnitude\nincrease in sensitivity and more uniform coverage.

In this\npaper, we propose a new lightweight hybrid video codec consisting of a\nconventional video codec(HEVC / VVC), a lossless image codec, and our new\nrestoration network. Precisely, our encoder consists of the conventional video\nencoder and a lossless image encoder, transmitting a lossy-compressed video\nbitstream along with a losslessly-compressed reference frame. The decoder is\nconstructed with corresponding video/image decoders and a new restoration\nnetwork, which enhances the compressed video in two-step processes. In the\nfirst step, a network trained with a large video dataset restores the details\nlost by the conventional encoder. Then, we further boost the video quality with\nthe guidance of a reference image, which is a losslessly compressed video\nframe. The reference image provides video-specific information, which can be\nutilized to better restore the details of a compressed video. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to\ntop-tier methods, even when applied to HEVC. Nevertheless, our method has lower\ncomplexity, a faster run time, and can be easily integrated into existing\nconventional codecs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 04:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

In the\npresent study, we successfully reproduced the B1g phonon anomaly in\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) using an ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)\nsimulation and temperature-dependent effective potential (TDEP) method.

The positivity-preserving property and the unique solvability of the\nproposed numerical scheme are theoretically justified, utilizing the singular\nnature of the logarithmic term as the phase variable approaches the singular\nlimit values. An unconditional energy stability analysis is standard, as an\noutcome of the convex-concave decomposition technique. A convergence analysis\nwith accompanying error estimate is provided for the proposed numerical scheme.\nIn particular, a higher order consistency analysis, accomplished by\nsupplementary functions, is performed to ensure the separation properties of\nnumerical solution. In turn, using the approach of rough and refined error\n(RRE) estimates, we are able to derive an optimal rate convergence. To\nconclude, several numerical experiments are presented to validate the\ntheoretical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 06:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

The initial value problem\nassociated with the RSV infection fractional model is numerically solved using\nGarrapa's fde12 solver and two simple methods coded here in Octave/MATLAB: the\nfractional forward {Euler's} method and the predict-evaluate-correct-evaluate\n(PECE) method of Adams--Bashforth--Moulton. A fractional optimal control\nproblem is then formulated having treatment as the control. The fractional\nPontryagin maximum principle is used to characterize the fractional optimal\ncontrol and the extremals of the problem are determined numerically through the\nimplementation of the forward-backward PECE method. The implemented algorithms\nare available on GitHub and, at the end of the paper, in appendixes, both for\nthe uncontrolled initial value problem as well as for the fractional optimal\ncontrol problem, using the free GNU Octave computing software and assuring\ncompatibility with~MATLAB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 06:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Technically, TMA comprises three components: an event splitting\nstrategy to incorporate intermediate motion information underlying the temporal\ncontext, a linear lookup strategy to align temporally continuous motion\nfeatures and a novel motion pattern aggregation module to emphasize consistent\npatterns for motion feature enhancement. By incorporating temporally continuous\nmotion information, TMA can derive better flow estimates than existing methods\nat early stages, which not only enables TMA to obtain more accurate final\npredictions, but also greatly reduces the demand for a number of refinements.\nExtensive experiments on DESC-Flow and MVSEC datasets verify the effectiveness\nand superiority of our TMA.

We extend this idea to the entire time series\nby utilizing a sliding window to create a batch of time intervals and then run\na single $\\texttt{uGLAD}$ model in multitask learning mode to recover all the\nCI graphs simultaneously. As a result, we obtain a corresponding temporal CI\ngraphs representation. We then designed a first-order and second-order based\ntrajectory tracking algorithms to study the evolution of these graphs across\ndistinct intervals. Finally, an `Allocation' algorithm is used to determine a\nsuitable segmentation of the temporal graph sequence. $\\texttt{tGLAD}$ provides\na competitive time complexity of $O(N)$ for settings where number of variables\n$D<<N$. We demonstrate successful empirical results on a Physical Activity\nMonitoring data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 07:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

A\npre-requisite to discover an entity, e.g. a book, with a search engine is that\nthe entity is retrievable, i.e. there are queries for which the system will\nsurface such entity in the top results. However, machine-learned search engines\nhave a high retrievability bias, where the majority of the queries return the\nsame entities. This happens partly due to the predominance of narrow intent\nqueries, where users create queries using the title of an already known entity,\ne.g. in book search 'harry potter'. The amount of broad queries where users\nwant to discover new entities, e.g. in music search 'chill lyrical electronica\nwith an atmospheric feeling to it', and have a higher tolerance to what they\nmight find, is small in comparison. We focus here on two factors that have a\nnegative impact on the retrievability of the entities (I) the training data\nused for dense retrieval models and (II) the distribution of narrow and broad\nintent queries issued in the system. We propose CtrlQGen, a method that\ngenerates queries for a chosen underlying intent-narrow or broad. We can use\nCtrlQGen to improve factor (I) by generating training data for dense retrieval\nmodels comprised of diverse synthetic queries. CtrlQGen can also be used to\ndeal with factor (II) by suggesting queries with broader intents to users. Our\nresults on datasets from the domains of music, podcasts, and books reveal that\nwe can significantly decrease the retrievability bias of a dense retrieval\nmodel when using CtrlQGen. First, by using the generated queries as training\ndata for dense models we make 9% of the entities retrievable (go from zero to\nnon-zero retrievability). Second, by suggesting broader queries to users, we\ncan make 12% of the entities retrievable in the best case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 07:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

This paper\nproposes the CoopInit, a simple yet effective cooperative learning-based\ninitialization strategy that can quickly learn a good starting point for GANs,\nwith a very small computation overhead during training. The proposed algorithm\nconsists of two learning stages: (i) Cooperative initialization stage: The\ndiscriminator of GAN is treated as an energy-based model (EBM) and is optimized\nvia maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), with the help of the GAN's generator\nto provide synthetic data to approximate the learning gradients. The EBM also\nguides the MLE learning of the generator via MCMC teaching; (ii) Adversarial\nfinalization stage: After a few iterations of initialization, the algorithm\nseamlessly transits to the regular mini-max adversarial training until\nconvergence. The motivation is that the MLE-based initialization stage drives\nthe model towards mode coverage, which is helpful in alleviating the issue of\nmode dropping during the adversarial learning stage.

In the spike camera, each pixel position directly accumulates the light\nintensity and asynchronously fires spikes. The output binary spikes can reach a\nfrequency of 40,000 Hz. As a new type of visual expression, spike sequence has\nhigh spatiotemporal completeness and preserves the continuous visual\ninformation of the external world. Taking advantage of the low latency and high\ndynamic range of the spike camera, many spike-based algorithms have made\nsignificant progress, such as high-quality imaging and ultra-high-speed target\ndetection.\n  To build up a community ecology for the spike vision to facilitate more users\nto take advantage of the spike camera, SpikeCV provides a variety of\nultra-high-speed scene datasets, hardware interfaces, and an easy-to-use\nmodules library. SpikeCV focuses on encapsulation for spike data,\nstandardization for dataset interfaces, modularization for vision tasks, and\nreal-time applications for challenging scenes. With the advent of the\nopen-source Python ecosystem, modules of SpikeCV can be used as a Python\nlibrary to fulfilled most of the numerical analysis needs of researchers.

For these reasons, the\npresent work aimed to simulate four different models of the most superficial\ntissues with different degree of detail exposed to two wearable patch antennas\nat different frequencies i.e., 28 GHz and 39 GHz.

The HFFB effectively allocates more computational\nresources to the more challenging reconstruction of high-frequency information.\nMoreover, we propose a Local Feature Fusion Block (LFFB) effectively fuses\nfeatures from multiple HFFBs in a local region, utilizing complementary\ninformation across layers to enhance feature representativeness and reduce\nartifacts in reconstructed images. We assess the efficacy of our proposed HFFN\non five benchmark datasets and show that it significantly enhances the\nsuper-resolution performance of the network. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing high-frequency\ninformation while using a low number of parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 09:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

We investigate the formation and evolution of a\npreflare flux rope in a stratified, 3D MHD simulation. One puzzle is that this\nmodelled flux rope does not form by the usual mechanisms at work in larger\nflares such as flux emergence, flux cancellation, or tether-cutting. Using\nLagrangian markers to trace representative field lines, we follow the\nspatiotemporal evolution of the flux rope. We isolate flux bundles associated\nwith reconnecting field line pairs by focusing on thin current sheets within\nthe flux system. We also analyze the time-varying distribution of the\nforce-free parameter as the rope relaxes. Lastly, we compare different seeding\nmethods for magnetic fields and discuss their relevance. We show that the\nmodeled flux rope is gradually built from coalescing, current-carrying flux\ntubes. This occurs through a series of component reconnections that are driven\nby flows in the underlying convection zone. These reconnections lead to an\ninverse cascade of helicity from small to larger scales. We also find that the\nsystem attempts to relax toward a linear force-free field, but that the\nconvective drivers and eventual nanoflare prevent full relaxation. Using a\nself-consistently driven simulation of a nanoflare event, we show for the first\ntime an inverse helicity cascade tending toward a Taylor relaxation in the\nSun's corona, resulting in a well-ordered flux rope that later reconnects with\nsurrounding fields. This provides clues toward understanding the buildup of\nnanoflare events in the quiet Sun through incomplete Taylor relaxations when no\nflux emergence or cancellation is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 10:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Stereographically projected model spaces\nachieve comparable performance to their non-projected counterparts, while\nproviding theoretical guarantees that avoid divergence of the spaces when the\ncurvature tends to zero. We perform experiments on both homophilic and\nheterophilic graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 11:20:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 16:19:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 17:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

This can require maneuvering on\nvarying surfaces which is still a difficult problem, especially for slippery\nterrains. To address this issue we propose a new approach that learns a\nsurface-aware dynamics model by conditioning it on a latent variable vector\nstoring surface information about the current location. A latent mapper is\ntrained to update these latent variables during inference from multiple\nmodalities on every traversal of the corresponding locations and stores them in\na map. By training everything end-to-end with the loss of the dynamics model,\nwe enforce the latent mapper to learn an update rule for the latent map that is\nuseful for the subsequent dynamics model. We implement and evaluate our\napproach on a real miniature electric car. The results show that the latent map\nis updated to allow more accurate predictions of the dynamics model compared to\na model without this information. We further show that by using this model, the\ndriving performance can be improved on varying and challenging surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 11:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Each sensor makes successive observations of an unknown\n$d$-dimensional parameter, which might be subject to Gaussian random noises.\nThey aim to infer true value of the unknown parameter by cooperating with each\nother. To this end, we first generalize the so-called dynamic regressor\nextension and mixing (DREM) algorithm to stochastic systems, with which the\nproblem of estimating a $d$-dimensional vector parameter is transformed to that\nof $d$ scalar ones: one for each of the unknown parameters. For each of the\nscalar problem, an estimation scheme is given, where each sensor fuses the\nregressors and measurements in its in-neighborhood and updates its local\nestimate by using least-mean squares. Particularly, a counter is also\nintroduced for each sensor, which prevents any (noisy) measurement from being\nrepeatedly used such that the estimation performance will not be greatly\naffected by certain extreme values. A novel excitation condition termed as\n\\textit{local persistent excitation} (Local-PE) condition is also proposed,\nwhich relaxes the traditional persistent excitation (PE) condition and only\nrequires that the collective signals in each sensor's in-neighborhood are\nsufficiently excited.

To overcome this challenge, developing a robust classifier is\ncrucial. So far, two well-known defenses have been adopted to improve the\nlearning of robust classifiers, namely adversarial training (AT) and Jacobian\nregularization. However, each approach behaves differently against adversarial\nperturbations. First, our work carefully analyzes and characterizes these two\nschools of approaches, both theoretically and empirically, to demonstrate how\neach approach impacts the robust learning of a classifier. Next, we propose our\nnovel Optimal Transport with Jacobian regularization method, dubbed OTJR,\njointly incorporating the input-output Jacobian regularization into the AT by\nleveraging the optimal transport theory. In particular, we employ the Sliced\nWasserstein (SW) distance that can efficiently push the adversarial samples'\nrepresentations closer to those of clean samples, regardless of the number of\nclasses within the dataset.

The magnetization behavior\nresembles Ising antiferromagnets with magnetic moments kept in the out-of-plane\ndirection by strong uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The out-of-plane\nmagnetic field induces a spin-flip metamagnetic transition, which is of\nfirst-order type at low temperatures while at higher temperatures the\ntransition becomes continuous. The first-order and continuous transition\nsegments in the field-temperature phase diagram meet at a tricritical point at\n= 12 K. The magnetization response to the in-plane field manifests a continuous\nspin-flop transition, which at 2 K terminates at a field mu0Hc = 27 T that can\nserve as an estimate of the anisotropy field in VBr3. The magnetization curves\nabove the metamagnetic transition saturate at the same value of magnetic moment\nmusat = 1.2 muB/f.u., which is much smaller than the spin-only (S = 1) moment\nof the V3+ ion. The reduced moment can be explained by the existence of a\nsignificant orbital magnetic moment antiparallel to the spin. The orbital\nmoment is a key ingredient of a mechanism responsible for the observed large\nanisotropy. The exact energy evaluation of possible magnetic orders\nunambiguously shows that the magnetic ground state of VBr3 is the intralayer\nzigzag antiferromagnetic order that renders the antiferromagnetic ground state\nsignificantly more stable against the spin-flip transition than the other\noptions. The calculations also predict that a minimal distortion of the Br ion\nsublattice causes a radical change of the orbital occupation in the ground\nstate, connected with the formation of the orbital moment and the stability of\nmagnetic order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 12:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Currently,\npiezoelectric transducers are the most widely used ultrasound sensors, but\ntheir sensitivities drop quickly when the size becomes smaller, leading to a\ntypical sensor size at the millimeter to centimeter scale. In order to realize\nboth high sensitivity and spatial resolution, various optical ultrasound\nsensors have been developed. Among them, ultrasound sensors using high-$Q$\noptical microcavities have realized unprecedented sensitivities and broad\nbandwidth and can be mass-produced on a silicon chip. In this review, we\nintroduce ultrasound sensors using three types of optical microcavities,\nincluding Fabry-Perot cavities, $\\pi$-phase-shifted Bragg gratings, and\nwhispering gallery mode microcavities. We introduce the sensing mechanisms\nusing optical microcavities and discuss several key parameters for ultrasound\nsensors.

Further, decision-based attacks, where attackers only access\nthe predicted hard labels by querying threat models, have not been well\nexplored on video models either, even if they are practical in real-world video\nrecognition scenes. The absence of such studies leads to a huge gap in the\nrobustness assessment for video models. To bridge this gap, this work first\nexplores decision-based patch attacks on video models. We analyze that the huge\nparameter space brought by videos and the minimal information returned by\ndecision-based models both greatly increase the attack difficulty and query\nburden. To achieve a query-efficient attack, we propose a spatial-temporal\ndifferential evolution (STDE) framework.

Fixational\neye movements are composed of slow components (physiological drift and tremor)\nand fast microsaccades. The complex dynamics of physiological drift can be\nmodeled qualitatively as a statistically self-avoiding random walk (SAW model,\nsee Engbert et al., 2011). In this study, we implement a data assimilation\napproach for the SAW model to explain quantitative differences in experimental\ndata obtained from high-resolution, video-based eye tracking. We present a\nlikelihood function for the SAW model which allows us apply Bayesian parameter\nestimation at the level of individual human participants. Based on the model\nfits we find a relationship between the activation predicted by the SAW model\nand the occurrence of microsaccades. The latent model activation relative to\nmicrosaccade onsets and offsets using experimental data reveals evidence for a\ntriggering mechanism for microsaccades. These findings suggest that the SAW\nmodel is capable of capturing individual differences and can serve as a tool\nfor exploring the relationship between physiological drift and microsaccades as\nthe two most important components of fixational eye movements.

It is unclear whether these iron-rich planets can form\nin the disc, or if giant impacts are necessary. Here we investigate the\nformation of super-Mercuries in their natal protoplanetary discs by taking into\naccount their host stars' abundances (Fe, Mg, Si, S). We employ a disc\nevolution model which includes the growth, drift, evaporation and\nrecondensation of pebbles to compute the pebble iron mass fraction. The\nrecondensation of outward-drifting iron vapour near the iron evaporation front\nis the key mechanism that facilitates an increase in the pebble iron mass\nfraction. We also simulate the growth of planetary seeds around the iron\nevaporation front using a planet formation model which includes pebble\naccretion and planet migration, and compute the final composition of the\nplanets. Our simulations are able to reproduce the observed iron compositions\nof the super-Mercuries provided that all the iron in the disc are locked in\npure Fe grains and that the disc viscosity is low. The combined effects of slow\norbital migration of planets and long retention time of iron vapour in\nlow-viscosity discs makes it easier to form iron-rich planets. Furthermore, we\nfind that decreasing the stellar Mg/Si ratio results in an increase in the iron\nmass fraction of the planet due to a reduction in the abundance of Mg2SiO4,\nwhich has a very similar condensation temperature as iron, in the disc. Our\nresults thus imply that super-Mercuries are more likely to form around stars\nwith low Mg/Si, in agreement with observational data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 15:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

We construct this graph using the critical features of the planning\nproblem and the relationships between robots; we then leverage mixed-integer\nprogramming to minimize a shared cost that depends on the paths of all robots\nthrough the graph. To improve computational tractability, we formulated an\nobjective function with a fully convex relaxation and designed our decision\nspace around eliminating the exponential dependence on the number of robots.

The functionality of\nPINNs for real-world physical problems can significantly improve if they become\nmore flexible and adaptable. To address this, our work explores the idea of\ntraining a PINN for general boundary conditions and source terms expressed\nthrough a limited number of coefficients, introduced as additional inputs in\nthe network. Although this process increases the dimensionality and is\ncomputationally costly, using the trained network to evaluate new general\nsolutions is much faster.

To plan successful bike-sharing systems (BSSs), many\ncities start from a small-scale pilot and gradually expand the system to cover\nmore areas. For station-based BSSs, this means planning new stations based on\nexisting ones over time, which requires prediction of the number of trips\ngenerated by these new stations across the whole system. Previous studies\ntypically rely on relatively simple regression or machine learning models,\nwhich are limited in capturing complex spatial relationships. Despite the\ngrowing literature in deep learning methods for travel demand prediction, they\nare mostly developed for short-term prediction based on time series data,\nassuming no structural changes to the system. In this study, we focus on the\ntrip generation problem for BSS expansion, and propose a graph neural network\n(GNN) approach to predicting the station-level demand based on multi-source\nurban built environment data. Specifically, it constructs multiple localized\ngraphs centered on each target station and uses attention mechanisms to learn\nthe correlation weights between stations.

The model is\nevaluated based on realistic experiments using multi-year BSS data from New\nYork City, and the results validate the superior performance of our approach\ncompared to existing methods.

In\nthis paper we focus on effects due to precession-induced (eviction-like)\nresonances, where nodal and apsidal precession rates of the binary is\ncommensurable with the mean motion of the binary around the SMBH. We focus on\nintermediate mass black hole (IMBH)-stellar mass black hole (SBH) binaries, and\nconsider binary orbit inclined from the circum-IMBH disk which leads to the\norbital $J_2$ precession. We show that if a binary is captured in these\nresonances and is migrating towards the companion, it can undergo large\neccentricity and inclination variations. We derive analytical expressions for\nthe location of fixed points, libration timescale and width for these\nresonances, and identified two resonances in the near coplanar regime (the\nevection and eviction resonances) as well as two resonances in the near polar\nregime that can lead to mergers. We also derive analytical expressions for the\nmaximum eccentricity that a migrating binary can achieve for given initial\nconditions. Specifically, the maximum eccentricity can reach 0.9 when captured\nin these resonances before orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission\ndominates, and the capture is only possible for slow migration ($\\sim 10$ Myr)\n2-3 order of magnitude longer than the resonance libration timescale. We also\nshow that capture into multiple resonances is possible, and can further excite\neccentricities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 18:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

By means of a\nmachine learning model based on an LSTM recursive neural network, we\nextrapolate two important pieces of information: 1) if congestion is appearing\nunder the sensor, and 2) the total amount of vehicles which is going to pass\nunder the sensor in the next future (30 min). These pieces of information are\nthen used to improve the accuracy of an LWR-based first-order multi-class model\ndescribing the dynamics of traffic flow between sensors. The first piece of\ninformation is used to invert the (concave) fundamental diagram, thus\nrecovering the density of vehicles from the flux data, and then inject directly\nthe density datum in the model. This allows one to better approximate the\ndynamics between sensors, especially if an accident happens in a not monitored\nstretch of the road.

Solutions that utilize machine learning\n(ML) gain traction as the scale of this arms race increases. This trend,\nhowever, makes performing attacks directly on ML an attractive prospect for\nadversaries. We study this arms race from both perspectives in the context of\nMalConv, a popular convolutional neural network-based malware classifier that\noperates on raw bytes of files. First, we show that MalConv is vulnerable to\nadversarial patch attacks: appending a byte-level patch to malware files\nbypasses detection 94.3% of the time. Moreover, we develop a universal\nadversarial patch (UAP) attack where a single patch can drop the detection rate\nin constant time of any malware file that contains it by 80%. These patches are\neffective even being relatively small with respect to the original file size --\nbetween 2%-8%. As a countermeasure, we then perform window ablation that allows\nus to apply de-randomized smoothing, a modern certified defense to patch\nattacks in vision tasks, to raw files. The resulting `smoothed-MalConv' can\ndetect over 80% of malware that contains the universal patch and provides\ncertified robustness up to 66%, outlining a promising step towards robust\nmalware detection.

Therefore, this study proposes an efficiency analysis framework\nbased on queuing models to analyze the efficiency difference of breaking down\ntraditional large services into n microservices. For generalization, this study\nconsiders different service time distributions (e.g. exponential distribution\nof service time and fixed service time) and explores the system efficiency in\nthe worst-case and best-case scenarios through queuing models (i.e. M/M/1\nqueuing model and M/D/1 queuing model). In each experiment, it was shown that\nthe total time required for the original large service was higher than that\nrequired for breaking it down into multiple microservices, so breaking it down\ninto multiple microservices can improve system efficiency.

A class of rough random functions termed large-minded reasoners\nhave a central role in these.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 12:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

We obtained the normalized wave\nfunction in terms of Jacobi polynomial. The energy eigen equation was\ndetermined and presented in a compact form. The study also includes the\ncomputations of partition function and other thermodynamics properties such as\nvibrational mean energy ({\\mu}), vibrational heat capacity (c), vibrational\nentropy (s) and vibrational free energy (F). Using a well design maple\nprogramme, we obtained numerical bound state energies for different quantum\nstates with various screening parameters: {\\alpha}=0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4 and 0.5. The\nnumerical results showed that the bound state energies increase with an\nincrease in quantum state while the thermodynamic plots were in excellent\nagreement to work of existing literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 11:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}
