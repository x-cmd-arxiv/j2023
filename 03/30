To reduce the annotation cost, we propose a\nsuperpixel-based active learning (AL) framework, which collects a dominant\nlabel per superpixel instead. To be specific, it consists of adaptive\nsuperpixel and sieving mechanisms, fully dedicated to AL. At each round of AL,\nwe adaptively merge neighboring pixels of similar learned features into\nsuperpixels. We then query a selected subset of these superpixels using an\nacquisition function assuming no uniform superpixel size. This approach is more\nefficient than existing methods, which rely only on innate features such as RGB\ncolor and assume uniform superpixel sizes. Obtaining a dominant label per\nsuperpixel drastically reduces annotators' burden as it requires fewer clicks.\nHowever, it inevitably introduces noisy annotations due to mismatches between\nsuperpixel and ground truth segmentation. To address this issue, we further\ndevise a sieving mechanism that identifies and excludes potentially noisy\nannotations from learning. Our experiments on both Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC\ndatasets demonstrate the efficacy of adaptive superpixel and sieving\nmechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 16:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

One promising approach to address\nthis issue is to distill precise 3D geometry knowledge from LiDAR data.\nHowever, transferring knowledge between different sensor modalities is hindered\nby the significant modality gap. In this paper, we approach this challenge from\nthe perspective of both architecture design and knowledge distillation and\npresent a new simulated multi-modal 3D object detection method named BEVSimDet.\nWe first introduce a novel framework that includes a LiDAR and camera\nfusion-based teacher and a simulated multi-modal student, where the student\nsimulates multi-modal features with image-only input.

A rapid density\nincrease in a neutron star core could also trigger the phase transition from\nhadrons to deconfined quarks and form a hybrid star. This formation process\ncould release a considerable amount of energy in the form of gravitational\nwaves and neutrinos. Hence, the formation of a magnetized hybrid star is an\ninteresting scenario for detecting all these signals. These detections may\nprovide essential probes for the magnetic field and composition of such stars.\nThus far, a dynamical study of the formation of a magnetized hybrid star has\nyet to be realized. Here, we investigate the formation dynamics and the\nproperties of a magnetized hybrid star through dynamical simulations. We find\nthat the maximum values of rest-mass density and magnetic field strength\nincrease slightly and these two quantities are coupled in phase during the\nformation. We then demonstrate that all microscopic and macroscopic quantities\nof the resulting hybrid star vary dramatically when the maximum magnetic field\nstrength goes beyond a threshold of $\\sim 5 \\times 10^{17}$ G but they are\ninsensitive to the magnetic field below this threshold. Specifically, the\nmagnetic deformation makes the rest-mass density drop significantly,\nsuppressing the matter fraction in the mixed phase.

This paper presents a decision making approach for autonomous driving,\nfocusing on the complex task of merging into moving traffic where uncertainty\nemanates from the behavior of other drivers and imperfect sensor measurements.\nWe frame the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)\nand solve it online with Monte Carlo tree search. The solution to the POMDP is\na policy that performs high-level driving maneuvers, such as giving way to an\napproaching car, keeping a safe distance from the vehicle in front or merging\ninto traffic. Our method leverages a model learned from data to predict the\nfuture states of traffic while explicitly accounting for interactions among the\nsurrounding agents. From these predictions, the autonomous vehicle can\nanticipate the future consequences of its actions on the environment and\noptimize its trajectory accordingly. We thoroughly test our approach in\nsimulation, showing that the autonomous vehicle can adapt its behavior to\ndifferent situations.

This trend\nreverses beyond a pair separation of $\\sim 50$ kpc. The interacting pairs with\nlarger separations ($>50$ kpc) in filaments are on average redder and low-star\nforming when compared to those embedded in sheets.

We propose a novel\nparadigm of training with a decoder-only model for multimodal tasks, which is\nsurprisingly effective in jointly learning of these disparate vision-language\ntasks.

Recently,\nGPT-3.5 series models have demonstrated remarkable few-shot and zero-shot\nability across various NLP tasks. In this paper, we first claim that large\nlanguage models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, can serve as an excellent crowdsourced\nannotator by providing them with sufficient guidance and demonstrated examples.\nTo make LLMs to be better annotators, we propose a two-step approach,\n'explain-then-annotate'. To be more precise, we begin by creating prompts for\nevery demonstrated example, which we subsequently utilize to prompt a LLM to\nprovide an explanation for why the specific ground truth answer/label was\nchosen for that particular example. Following this, we construct the few-shot\nchain-of-thought prompt with the self-generated explanation and employ it to\nannotate the unlabeled data. We conduct experiments on three tasks, including\nuser input and keyword relevance assessment, BoolQ and WiC.

Recent studies have shown the great potential of\ndense correspondence-based solutions, yet improvements are still needed to\nreach practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel pose estimation\nalgorithm named CheckerPose, which improves on three main aspects. Firstly,\nCheckerPose densely samples 3D keypoints from the surface of the 3D object and\nfinds their 2D correspondences progressively in the 2D image. Compared to\nprevious solutions that conduct dense sampling in the image space, our strategy\nenables the correspondence searching in a 2D grid (i.e., pixel coordinate).\nSecondly, for our 3D-to-2D correspondence, we design a compact binary code\nrepresentation for 2D image locations. This representation not only allows for\nprogressive correspondence refinement but also converts the correspondence\nregression to a more efficient classification problem. Thirdly, we adopt a\ngraph neural network to explicitly model the interactions among the sampled 3D\nkeypoints, further boosting the reliability and accuracy of the\ncorrespondences. Together, these novel components make our CheckerPose a strong\npose estimation algorithm. When evaluated on the popular Linemod, Linemod-O,\nand YCB-V object pose estimation benchmarks, CheckerPose clearly boosts the\naccuracy of correspondence-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 17:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

These mask annotations\nrequire tremendous human effort, limiting the scalability to annotate novel\n(new) categories. To alleviate this problem, Open-Vocabulary (OV) methods\nleverage large-scale image-caption pairs and vision-language models to learn\nnovel categories. In summary, an OV method learns task-specific information\nusing strong supervision from base annotations and novel category information\nusing weak supervision from image-captions pairs. This difference between\nstrong and weak supervision leads to overfitting on base categories, resulting\nin poor generalization towards novel categories. In this work, we overcome this\nissue by learning both base and novel categories from pseudo-mask annotations\ngenerated by the vision-language model in a weakly supervised manner using our\nproposed Mask-free OVIS pipeline.

Although such depthwise operator only\nconsumes a few FLOPs, it largely harms the model efficiency on powerful\ncomputing devices due to the high memory access costs. For example, ConvNeXt-T\nhas similar FLOPs with ResNet-50 but only achieves 60% throughputs when trained\non A100 GPUs with full precision. Although reducing the kernel size of ConvNeXt\ncan improve speed, it results in significant performance degradation. It is\nstill unclear how to speed up large-kernel-based CNN models while preserving\ntheir performance. To tackle this issue, inspired by Inceptions, we propose to\ndecompose large-kernel depthwise convolution into four parallel branches along\nchannel dimension, i.e. small square kernel, two orthogonal band kernels, and\nan identity mapping.

We argue that the evidence in support of\nexoplanet observation is not necessarily definitive and that alternative\ninterpretations are not only possible, but necessary. Our conclusion is\ntherefore concise: exoplanets do not exist. Here, we present the framework for\na novel type of cuboid star, or squar, which can precisely reproduce the full\nrange of observed phenomena in stellar light curves, including the trapezoidal\nflux deviations (TFDs) often attributed to \"exoplanets.\" In this discovery\npaper, we illustrate the power of the squellar model, showing that the light\ncurve of the well-studied \"exoplanet\" WASP-12b can be reconstructed simply from\na rotating squar with proportions $1:1/8:1$, without invoking ad-hoc planetary\nbodies. Our findings cast serious doubt on the validity of current\n\"exoplanetary\" efforts, which have largely ignored the potential role of squars\nand have instead blindly accepted the exoplanet hypothesis without sufficient\ncritical scrutiny. In addition, we discuss the sociopolitical role of climate\nchange in spurring the current exoplanet fervor which has lead to the\nspeculative state of \"exoplanetary science\" today.

In the\nabsence of a short-range-long-range conspiracy, the Standard Model can be\nviewed as the leading term of an effective \"remnant\" theory (referred to as the\nSMEFT) of a more fundamental structure. Over the last years, many aspects of\nthe SMEFT have been investigated and it has become a standard tool to analyze\nexperimental results in an integral way. In this article, after briefly\npresenting the salient features of the Standard Model, we review the\nconstruction of the SMEFT. We discuss the range of its applicability and bounds\non its coefficients imposed by general theoretical considerations. Since new\nphysics models are likely to exhibit exact or approximate accidental global\nsymmetries, especially in the flavor sector, we also discuss their implications\nfor the SMEFT. The main focus of our review is the phenomenological analysis of\nexperimental results. We show explicitly how to use various effective field\ntheories to study the phenomenology of theories beyond the Standard Model. We\ngive a detailed description of the matching procedure and the use of the\nrenormalization group equations, allowing to connect multiple effective\ntheories valid at different energy scales. Explicit examples from low-energy\nexperiments and from high-$p_T$ physics illustrate the workflow.

In this work, we build the first large-scale, part-based\ncross-category object manipulation benchmark, PartManip, which is composed of\n11 object categories, 494 objects, and 1432 tasks in 6 task classes. Compared\nto previous work, our benchmark is also more diverse and realistic, i.e.,\nhaving more objects and using sparse-view point cloud as input without oracle\ninformation like part segmentation. To tackle the difficulties of vision-based\npolicy learning, we first train a state-based expert with our proposed\npart-based canonicalization and part-aware rewards, and then distill the\nknowledge to a vision-based student. We also find an expressive backbone is\nessential to overcome the large diversity of different objects.

The zeroth Landau\nlevel of monolayer graphene with four-fold spin-valley degeneracy is a model\nsystem for such investigations, but the nature of its broken symmetry states -\nparticularly at partial fillings - is still not understood.

We can extract information such as the strength of\nHaldane pseudopotentials that characterize the repulsive interactions\nunderlying the fractional quantum states. Our experiments also demonstrate that\nfractional quantum Hall phases are built upon broken symmetry states that\npersist at partial filling.

In particular, Du et al. (2020) show that even if a learner is given\nlinear features in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ that approximate the rewards in a bandit or\nRL with a uniform error of $\\varepsilon$, searching for an\n$O(\\varepsilon)$-optimal action requires pulling at least $\\Omega(\\exp(d))$\nqueries. Furthermore, Lattimore et al. (2020) show that a degraded\n$O(\\varepsilon\\sqrt{d})$-optimal solution can be learned within\n$\\operatorname{poly}(d/\\varepsilon)$ queries. Yet it is unknown whether a\nstructural assumption on the ground-truth parameter, such as sparsity, could\nbreak the $\\varepsilon\\sqrt{d}$ barrier. In this paper, we address this\nquestion by showing that algorithms can obtain $O(\\varepsilon)$-optimal actions\nby querying $O(\\varepsilon^{-s}d^s)$ actions, where $s$ is the sparsity\nparameter, removing the $\\exp(d)$-dependence. We then establish\ninformation-theoretical lower bounds, i.e., $\\Omega(\\exp(s))$, to show that our\nupper bound on sample complexity is nearly tight if one demands an error $\nO(s^{\\delta}\\varepsilon)$ for $0<\\delta<1$. For $\\delta\\geq 1$, we further show\nthat $\\operatorname{poly}(s/\\varepsilon)$ queries are possible when the linear\nfeatures are \"good\" and even in general settings. These results provide a\nnearly complete picture of how sparsity can help in misspecified bandit\nlearning and provide a deeper understanding of when linear features are\n\"useful\" for bandit and reinforcement learning with misspecification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 19:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

While\nmuch success has been achieved in reducing FLOP and parameter counts while\nmaintaining acceptable task performance, achieving actual speed improvements\nhas typically been much more difficult, particularly on general purpose\naccelerators (GPAs) such as NVIDIA GPUs using low precision number formats. In\nthis work we introduce PopSparse, a library that enables fast sparse operations\non Graphcore IPUs by leveraging both the unique hardware characteristics of\nIPUs as well as any block structure defined in the data. We target two\ndifferent types of sparsity: static, where the sparsity pattern is fixed at\ncompile-time; and dynamic, where it can change each time the model is run. We\npresent benchmark results for matrix multiplication for both of these modes on\nIPU with a range of block sizes, matrix sizes and densities. Results indicate\nthat the PopSparse implementations are faster than dense matrix multiplications\non IPU at a range of sparsity levels with large matrix size and block size.\nFurthermore, static sparsity in general outperforms dynamic sparsity. While\nprevious work on GPAs has shown speedups only for very high sparsity (typically\n99\\% and above), the present work demonstrates that our static sparse\nimplementation outperforms equivalent dense calculations in FP16 at lower\nsparsity (around 90%).

The liquid-argon-based detectors planned for DUNE are expected to\nbe uniquely sensitive to the $\\nu_e$ component of the supernova flux, enabling\na wide variety of physics and astrophysics measurements. A key requirement for\na correct interpretation of these measurements is a good understanding of the\nenergy-dependent total cross section $\\sigma(E_\\nu)$ for charged-current\n$\\nu_e$ absorption on argon. In the context of a simulated extraction of\nsupernova $\\nu_e$ spectral parameters from a toy analysis, we investigate the\nimpact of $\\sigma(E_\\nu)$ modeling uncertainties on DUNE's supernova neutrino\nphysics sensitivity for the first time. We find that the currently large\ntheoretical uncertainties on $\\sigma(E_\\nu)$ must be substantially reduced\nbefore the $\\nu_e$ flux parameters can be extracted reliably: in the absence of\nexternal constraints, a measurement of the integrated neutrino luminosity with\nless than 10\\% bias with DUNE requires $\\sigma(E_\\nu)$ to be known to about 5%.\nThe neutrino spectral shape parameters can be known to better than 10% for a\n20% uncertainty on the cross-section scale, although they will be sensitive to\nuncertainties on the shape of $\\sigma(E_\\nu)$. A direct measurement of\nlow-energy $\\nu_e$-argon scattering would be invaluable for improving the\ntheoretical precision to the needed level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 20:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

In\nnon-cooperative networks, malicious actors may try to decipher, block encrypted\nmessages, or specifically jam wireless radio systems. Such activities can\ndisrupt operations, from causing minor inconvenience, through to fully\nparalyzing the functionality of critical infrastructure. While technological\nmitigation measures do exist, there are very few methods capable of assessing\nthe socio-economic impacts from different mitigation strategies. This leads to\na lack of robust evidence to inform cost-benefit analysis, and thus support\ndecision makers in industry and government. Consequently, this paper presents\ntwo open-source simulation models for assessing the socio-economic impacts of\noperating in untrusted non-cooperative networks. The first focuses on using\nmultiple non-cooperative networks to transmit a message. The second model\nsimulates a case where a message is converted into alternative plain language\nto avoid detection, separated into different portions and then transmitted over\nmultiple non-cooperative networks. A probabilistic simulation of the two models\nis performed for a 15 km by 15 km spatial grid with 5 untrusted non-cooperative\nnetworks and intercepting agents. The results are used to estimate economic\nlosses for private, commercial, government and military sectors. The highest\nprobabilistic total losses for military applications include US$300, US$150,\nand US$75, incurred for a 1, 3 and 5 site multi-transmission approach,\nrespectively, for non-cooperative networks when considering 1,000 texts being\nsent.

Controller\ncoefficient space is partitioned by critical controller sets into different\nconnected regions. The connected regions provide a classification for all\nqualitatively different dynamics of the controlled system. Hence, a state\nfeedback controller design with four small controller coefficients is proposed\nfor an efficient and full singular symmetry-breaking control. Our approach\nworks well for nonlinear control systems with both controllable and\nuncontrollable linearizations. Origin is a primary equilibrium for the\nuncontrolled system. This gives rise to two secondary local equilibria for the\ncontrolled system. These equilibria further experience tertiary fold and\nhysteresis type bifurcations. The secondary and primary equilibria experience\nHopf and Bautin bifurcations leading to the appearance of one limit cycle from\nprimary equilibrium, and either one or two from each secondary equilibria. The\ncollisions of limit cycles with equilibria lead to either a heteroclinic cycle\nor four different homoclinic cycles. Each pair of limit cycles may respectively\nmerge together and disappear. This is a saddle-node bifurcation of limit\ncycles. Different combinations of these give rise to a rich list of bifurcation\nscenarios. Finite determinacy of each of these bifurcations has been thoroughly\ninvestigated. This greatly influences their stabilization potential in\napplications. We consider Chua system with a quadratic state-feedback\ncontroller. Controlled Chua system experiences a pitchfork bifurcation, three\nHopf bifurcations and two homoclinic bifurcations. There exist two different\nregions of controller coefficient choices for feedback regularization and two\nnearby regions for supercritical Hopf stabilization approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 21:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

These generation facilities are generally connected via\npower-electronic inverters. While conventional generation responds dynamically\nto the state of the electric power system, inverters are power electronic\nhardware and need to be programmed to react to the state of the system.\nChoosing an appropriate control scheme and the corresponding parameters is\nnecessary to guarantee that the system operates safely. A prominent control\nscheme for inverters is droop control, which mimics the response of\nconventional generation. In this work, we investigate the stability of coupled\nsystems of droop-controlled inverters in arbitrary network topologies.\nEmploying linear stability analysis, we derive effective local stability\ncriteria that consider both the overall network topology as well as its\ninterplay with the inverters' intrinsic parameters. First, we explore the\nstability of an inverter coupled to an infinite grid in an analytic fashion and\nuncover stability and instability regions. Secondly, we extend the analysis to\na generic topology of inverters and provide mathematical criteria for stability\nand instability of the system. Last, we showcase the usefulness of the criteria\nby examining two model systems using numerical simulations.

Guided by such a immersion mechanism, we propose a GAN-based camera\ncontrol system that is able to generate actor-driven camera movements in the 3D\nvirtual environment to obtain immersive film sequences. The proposed\nencoder-decoder architecture in the generation flow transfers character motion\ninto camera trajectory conditioned on an emotion factor.

Previous single-source methods mainly\nused the audio-visual association as clues to localize sounding objects in each\nimage. Due to the mixed property of multiple sound sources in the original\nspace, there exist rare multi-source approaches to localizing multiple sources\nsimultaneously, except for one recent work using a contrastive random walk in\nthe graph with images and separated sound as nodes. Despite their promising\nperformance, they can only handle a fixed number of sources, and they cannot\nlearn compact class-aware representations for individual sources. To alleviate\nthis shortcoming, in this paper, we propose a novel audio-visual grouping\nnetwork, namely AVGN, that can directly learn category-wise semantic features\nfor each source from the input audio mixture and image to localize multiple\nsources simultaneously. Specifically, our AVGN leverages learnable audio-visual\nclass tokens to aggregate class-aware source features. Then, the aggregated\nsemantic features for each source can be used as guidance to localize the\ncorresponding visual regions. Compared to existing multi-source methods, our\nnew framework can localize a flexible number of sources and disentangle\ncategory-aware audio-visual representations for individual sound sources. We\nconduct extensive experiments on MUSIC, VGGSound-Instruments, and VGG-Sound\nSources benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the proposed AVGN can achieve\nstate-of-the-art sounding object localization performance on both single-source\nand multi-source scenarios.

For instance, an aerial robot could fly a\nlong distance, perch in a high place to survey the surroundings, then walk to\navoid obstacles that could potentially inhibit flight. Birds are capable of\nthese three tasks, and so offer a practical example of how a robot might be\ndeveloped to do the same.

To address this problem, we propose a neural implicit surface learning\nmethod called Depth-NeuS based on depth information optimization for multi-view\nreconstruction. In this paper, we introduce depth loss to explicitly constrain\nSDF regression and introduce geometric consistency loss to optimize for\nlow-texture areas. Specific experiments show that Depth-NeuS outperforms\nexisting technologies in multiple scenarios and achieves high-quality surface\nreconstruction in multiple scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 01:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

The introduced approach focuses on outdoor\nscenes where recovering accurate geometric scaffold and camera pose is\nchallenging, leading to inferior results using the state-of-the-art stable view\nsynthesis (SVS) method. SVS and related methods fail for outdoor scenes\nprimarily due to (i) over-relying on the multiview stereo (MVS) for geometric\nscaffold recovery and (ii) assuming COLMAP computed camera poses as the best\npossible estimates, despite it being well-studied that MVS 3D reconstruction\naccuracy is limited to scene disparity and camera-pose accuracy is sensitive to\nkey-point correspondence selection.

Moreover,\nthe numerical results of the three relations obtained by the SU(3) symmetry are\nbetter in accordance with observation data than those obtained by the SU(6)\nsymmetry. The results will help us to improve the strict constraints of the\nequation of state for neutron stars containing hyperons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 02:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

To understand developers' practices while\nusing these tools and the important usability challenges they face, we\nadministered a survey to a large population of developers and received\nresponses from a diverse set of 410 developers. Through a mix of qualitative\nand quantitative analyses, we found that developers are most motivated to use\nAI programming assistants because they help developers reduce key-strokes,\nfinish programming tasks quickly, and recall syntax, but resonate less with\nusing them to help brainstorm potential solutions. We also found the most\nimportant reasons why developers do not use these tools are because these tools\ndo not output code that addresses certain functional or non-functional\nrequirements and because developers have trouble controlling the tool to\ngenerate the desired output. Our findings have implications for both creators\nand users of AI programming assistants, such as designing minimal cognitive\neffort interactions with these tools to reduce distractions for users while\nthey are programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 03:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

While simply accumulating the embeddings across\nminibatches has proved useful (Wang et al. [2020]), we show that it is equally\nimportant to ensure that the accumulated embeddings are up to date. In\nparticular, it is necessary to circumvent the representational drift between\nthe accumulated embeddings and the feature embeddings at the current training\niteration as the learnable parameters are being updated. In this paper, we\nmodel representational drift as distribution misalignment and tackle it using\nmoment matching. The result is a simple method for updating the stored\nembeddings to match the first and second moments of the current embeddings at\neach training iteration. Experiments on three popular image retrieval datasets,\nnamely, SOP, In-Shop, and DeepFashion2, demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly improves the performance in all scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 03:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

UDA methods\nhave a strong assumption that the source data is accessible during adaptation,\nwhich may not be feasible in many real-world scenarios due to privacy concerns\nand resource constraints of devices. In this regard, source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) excels as access to source data is no longer required during\nadaptation. Recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on SFDA mostly focus on\npseudo-label refinement based self-training which generally suffers from two\nissues: i) inevitable occurrence of noisy pseudo-labels that could lead to\nearly training time memorization, ii) refinement process requires maintaining a\nmemory bank which creates a significant burden in resource constraint\nscenarios. To address these concerns, we propose C-SFDA, a curriculum learning\naided self-training framework for SFDA that adapts efficiently and reliably to\nchanges across domains based on selective pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we\nemploy a curriculum learning scheme to promote learning from a restricted\namount of pseudo labels selected based on their reliabilities. This simple yet\neffective step successfully prevents label noise propagation during different\nstages of adaptation and eliminates the need for costly memory-bank based label\nrefinement. Our extensive experimental evaluations on both image recognition\nand semantic segmentation tasks confirm the effectiveness of our method. C-SFDA\nis readily applicable to online test-time domain adaptation and also\noutperforms previous SOTA methods in this task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 03:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

In this paper, we rethink the\ninstance discrimination framework and find the binary instance labeling\ninsufficient to measure correlations between different samples. For an\nintuitive example, given a random image instance, there may exist other images\nin a mini-batch whose content meanings are the same (i.e., belonging to the\nsame category) or partially related (i.e., belonging to a similar category).\nHow to treat the images that correlate similarly to the current image instance\nleaves an unexplored problem.

A cross-attention module is then introduced to\npredict the correlation score (denoted as positiveness) of other correlated\ninstances with respect to the current one. The positiveness score\nquantitatively measures the positive support from each correlated instance, and\nis encoded into the objective for pretext training.

The rotational dynamics of the particles is modeled using a\nslender-body theory that includes the inertial torque due to sedimentation that\ntends to rotate the particles toward a broadside orientation. The particles are\nassumed to rotate due to viscous forces associated with the turbulent velocity\ngradients occurring on the particle length scale. In the simulations, the\nturbulence is obtained from a stochastic model of the velocity gradient in a\nLagrangian reference frame. In the experiments, the turbulence is generated by\nactive jets in a vertical water tunnel. It is well known that axisymmetric\nparticles rotate according to Jeffery's solution for the rotation of a\nspheroidal particle if one adopts an appropriate effective aspect ratio. We\nshow that the same result applies to a ramified particle consisting of three\ncoplanar fibers connected with equal angles at a central point which rotates\nlike a thin oblate spheroid.

The governing physics of electrokinetic\ntransport is electromigration and electroosmotic flow, which depend on the\nelectric potential gradient, mineral occurrence, domain morphology, and\nelectrolyte properties. Herein, mineral occurrence and its associated zeta\npotential are investigated for EK transport. The governing model includes three\ncoupled equations: (1) Poisson equation, (2) Nernst--Planck equation, and (3)\nNavier--Stokes equation. These equations were solved using the lattice\nBoltzmann method within X-ray computed microtomography images. The proposed\nmodel is validated against COMSOL Multiphysics in a 2-dimensional microchannel\nin terms of fluid flow behavior when the electrical double layer is both\nresolvable and unresolvable.

A contrastive loss is employed to align such\naugmented text and image representations on downstream tasks.

A popular\napproach to Dirichlet processes in a spatial setting relies on a stick-breaking\nrepresentation of the process, where the dependence over space is described in\nthe definition of the stick-breaking probabilities. Extensions to include\ntemporal dependence are still limited, however it is important, in particular\nfor those phenomena which may change rapidly over time and space, with many\nlocal changes. In this work, we propose a Dirichlet process where the\nstick-breaking probabilities are defined to incorporate both spatial and\ntemporal dependence. We will show that this approach is not a simple extension\nof available methodologies and can outperform available approaches in terms of\nprediction accuracy. An advantage of the method is that it offers a natural way\nto test for separability of the two components in the definition of the\nstick-breaking probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 06:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

In the period immediately following the global\nfinancial crisis, the decrease in oil prices and oil and gas demand forced OPEC\ncountries to make frequent adjustments to the production of oil, while, since\nthe first quarter of 2010, the recovery led to more regular meetings, with only\nthree organised extraordinary meetings.

However, creating\nsuch large keypoint labels is time-consuming and costly, and is often\nerror-prone due to inconsistent labeling.

To\nthis end, we present a novel formulation that learns to localize semantically\nconsistent keypoint definitions, even for occluded regions, for varying object\ncategories.

However, in a Continual Learning (CL)\nscenario where new data is introduced progressively, models still suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting. Retraining a model from scratch to adapt to newly\ngenerated data is time-consuming and inefficient. Previous approaches suggested\nre-purposing self-supervised objectives with knowledge distillation to mitigate\nforgetting across tasks, assuming that labels from all tasks are available\nduring fine-tuning. In this paper, we generalize self-supervised continual\nlearning in a practical setting where available labels can be leveraged in any\nstep of the SSL process. With an increasing number of continual tasks, this\noffers more flexibility in the pre-training and fine-tuning phases. With\nKaizen, we introduce a training architecture that is able to mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting for both the feature extractor and classifier with a\ncarefully designed loss function. By using a set of comprehensive evaluation\nmetrics reflecting different aspects of continual learning, we demonstrated\nthat Kaizen significantly outperforms previous SSL models in competitive vision\nbenchmarks, with up to 16.5% accuracy improvement on split CIFAR-100.

In particular, we found that\nlow-energy high-frequency flares could be responsible for the deviation in the\nlinear trend in fast-rotator M dwarfs.

For HDR imaging in photon-limited\nsituations, the dynamic range can be enormous and the noise within one exposure\nis spatially varying. Existing image denoising algorithms and HDR fusion\nalgorithms both fail to handle this situation, leading to severe limitations in\nlow-light HDR imaging. This paper presents two contributions. Firstly, we\nidentify the source of the problem. We find that the issue is associated with\nthe co-existence of (1) spatially varying signal-to-noise ratio, especially the\nexcessive noise due to very dark regions, and (2) a wide luminance range within\neach exposure. We show that while the issue can be handled by a bank of\ndenoisers, the complexity is high. Secondly, we propose a new method called the\nspatially varying high dynamic range (SV-HDR) fusion network to simultaneously\ndenoise and fuse images.

Existing work on sequential\ndisentanglement mostly provides two factor representations, i.e., it separates\nthe data to time-varying and time-invariant factors. In contrast, we consider\nmultifactor disentanglement in which multiple (more than two) semantic\ndisentangled components are generated. Key to our approach is a strong\ninductive bias where we assume that the underlying dynamics can be represented\nlinearly in the latent space. Under this assumption, it becomes natural to\nexploit the recently introduced Koopman autoencoder models. However,\ndisentangled representations are not guaranteed in Koopman approaches, and thus\nwe propose a novel spectral loss term which leads to structured Koopman\nmatrices and disentanglement. Overall, we propose a simple and easy to code new\ndeep model that is fully unsupervised and it supports multifactor\ndisentanglement.

Slender-body theories are typically computationally\nefficient and focus on the mechanics of an isolated fibre that is not too\ncurved. However, slender-body theories that work beyond these standard limits\nare needed to explore more complex systems.

The field strength at the neutron star surface is not\nknown precisely, but indirect signs indicate a magnetic field above $10^{13}$\nG, which makes the object one of the most magnetized known X-ray pulsars. Here\nwe present the results of observations X Persei performed with the Imaging\nX-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). The X-ray polarization signal was found to\nbe strongly dependent on the spin phase of the pulsar. The energy-averaged\npolarization degree in 3-8 keV band varied from several to $\\sim$20 per cent\nover the pulse with a positive correlation with the pulsed X-ray flux. The\npolarization angle shows significant variation and makes two complete\nrevolutions during the pulse period resulting in nearly nil pulse-phase\naveraged polarization. Applying the rotating vector model to the IXPE data we\nobtain the estimates for the rotation axis inclination and its position angle\non the sky as well as for the magnetic obliquity. The derived inclination is\nclose to the orbital inclination reported earlier for X Persei. The\npolarimetric data imply a large angle between the rotation and magnetic dipole\naxes, which is similar to the result reported recently for the X-ray pulsar GRO\nJ1008$-$57. After eliminating the effect of polarization angle rotation over\nthe pulsar phase using the best-fitting rotating vector model, the strong\ndependence of the polarization degree with energy was discovered with its value\nincreasing from 0% at $\\sim$2 keV to 30% at 8 keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 12:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

The data is usually aggregated to provide daily or weekly step\ncounts for the primary analysis. Missing data are common as participants may\nnot wear the device as per protocol. Approaches to handling missing data in the\nliterature have largely defined missingness on the day level using a threshold\non daily wear time, which leads to loss of information on the time of day when\ndata are missing. We propose an approach to identifying and classifying\nmissingness at the finer epoch-level, and then present two approaches to\nhandling missingness.

Secondly, we describe a\nnon-parametric approach to Multiple Imputation (MI) where missing periods\nduring the day are replaced by donor data from the same person where possible,\nor data from a different person who is matched on demographic and physical\nactivity-related variables.

It is well known that social contact patterns differ from\ncountry to country.

This study examined how socioeconomic heterogeneity in selected\nAfrican countries might be factored in to explain better social contact mix\npatterns between countries.\n  Methods. We used a standardized contact matrix for 32 African countries,\nestimated in [31]. We scaled the matrices using an epidemic model from [34]. We\nalso analyzed aggregated data from the World Bank country website. The data\nincludes 28 variables; social, economic, environmental, institutional,\ngovernance, health and well-being, education, gender inequality, and other\ndevelopment-related indicators describing countries. Principal components\nanalysis was used to visualize socioeconomic similarities between countries and\nidentify the indicators for maximum variation. The (2D)2 PC A approach was used\nto reduce the dimension of the synthetic contact matrices for each country to\navoid the dimensionality curse.

In particular, it is\nnot known whether jets or their soft fragments are correlated with particles in\nthe underlying event. To address this question, two-particle correlations are\nmeasured in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV using data collected by the\nATLAS experiment at the LHC, with an integrated luminosity of $15.8$\n$\\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$, in two different configurations. In the first case, charged\nparticles associated with jets are excluded from the correlation analysis,\nwhile in the second case, correlations are measured between particles within\njets and charged particles from the underlying event. Second-order flow\ncoefficients, $v_2$, are presented as a function of event multiplicity and\ntransverse momentum. These measurements show that excluding particles\nassociated with jets does not affect the measured correlations. Moreover,\nparticles associated with jets do not exhibit any significant azimuthal\ncorrelations with the underlying event, ruling out hard processes contributing\nto the ridge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 13:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

Since PBHs form from rare\nover-densities, their abundance is sensitive to the tail of the primordial\nprobability distribution function (PDF) of the perturbations. It is therefore\nimportant to calculate the full PDF of the perturbations, which can be done\nnon-perturbatively using the 'stochastic inflation' framework. In single field\ninflation models generating large enough perturbations to produce an\ninteresting abundance of PBHs requires violation of slow roll. It is therefore\nnecessary to extend the stochastic inflation formalism beyond slow roll. A\ncrucial ingredient for this are the stochastic noise matrix elements of the\ninflaton potential. We carry out analytical and numerical calculations of these\nmatrix elements for a potential with a feature which violates slow roll and\nproduces large, potentially PBH generating, perturbations.

In order to solve the sub-problems above, a combination of\nModel Predictive Control (MPC) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method is\nemployed. Firstly, the selection of pushing point is modeled as a Markov\ndecision process,and an off-policy DRL method is used by reshaping the reward\nfunction to train the decision-making model for selecting pushing point from a\npre-constructed set based on the current state. Secondly, a motion constraint\nregion (MCR) is constructed for the specific pushing point based on the\ndistance from the target, followed by utilizing the MPC controller to regulate\nthe motion of the object within the MCR towards the target pose. The trigger\ncondition for switching the pushing point occurs when the object reaches the\nboundary of the MCR under the pushing action. Subsequently, the pushing point\nand the controller are updated iteratively until the target pose is reached. We\nconducted pushing experiments on four distinct object shapes in both simulated\nand physical environments to evaluate our method.

One\neffective way for GCD is applying self-supervised learning to learn\ndiscriminate representation for unlabeled data.

In principle, a large area LSC could concentrate light onto a much\nsmaller area of PV, thus reducing costs or enabling new architectures. However,\nLSCs suffer from various optical losses which are hard to quantify using simple\nmeasurements of power conversion efficiency. Here, we show that spatially\nresolved photoluminescence quantum efficiency measurements on large area LSCs\ncan be used to resolve various losses processes such as out-coupling,\nself-absorption via emitters and self-absorption from the LSC matrix. Further,\nthese measurements allow for the extrapolation of device performance to\narbitrarily large LSCs.

Recently, over-the-air (OTA) FL has been suggested to\nreduce the bandwidth and energy consumption, by allowing the users to transmit\ntheir data simultaneously over a Multiple Access Channel (MAC). However, this\napproach results in channel noise directly affecting the optimization\nprocedure, which may degrade the accuracy of the trained model. In this paper\nwe jointly exploit the prior distribution of local weights and the channel\ndistribution, and develop an OTA FL algorithm based on a Bayesian approach for\nsignal aggregation. Our proposed algorithm, dubbed Bayesian Air Aggregation\nFederated learning (BAAF), is shown to effectively mitigate noise and fading\neffects induced by the channel. To handle statistical heterogeneity of users\ndata, which is a second major challenge in FL, we extend BAAF to allow for\nappropriate local updates by the users and develop the Controlled Bayesian Air\nAggregation Federated-learning (COBAAF) algorithm. In addition to using a\nBayesian approach to average the channel output, COBAAF controls the drift in\nlocal updates using a judicious design of correction terms. We analyze the\nconvergence of the learned global model using BAAF and COBAAF in noisy and\nheterogeneous environment, showing their ability to achieve a convergence rate\nsimilar to that achieved over error-free channels. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the improved convergence of BAAF and COBAAF over existing\nalgorithms in machine learning tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 14:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

Such a halo should be made of small grains produced in the\nring of parent bodies (PB) and pushed on high-e orbits by radiation pressure.\nIt has been shown that, under several simplifying assumptions, the surface\nbrightness (SB) of this halo should radially decrease as $r^{-3.5}$ in\nscattered light. We aim to revisit the halo phenomenon and focus on two so far\nunexplored issues: 1) How the unavoidable presence of small unbound grains,\nnon-isotropic scattering phase functions (SPF) and finite instrument resolution\naffect scattered light SB profiles, and 2) How the halo phenomenon manifests\nitself at longer wavelengths. We find that unbound grains account for a\nsignificant fraction of the halo's luminosity in scattered light, and can\nsignificantly flatten the SB radial profile. Realistic size-dependent SPFs also\nhave an effect, resulting here again in shallower SB profiles. For edge-on\ndiscs, non-resolving the vertical profile can also flatten the projected SB. We\nshow that roughly half of the observationally-derived halo profiles found in\nthe literature are compatible with our new results, and that roughly half of\nthe remaining systems are probably shaped by additional processes.

Several approaches have been proposed to\nachieve this, with some focusing on the mating phase from coupling dissimilar\nsolutions to some form of self-adaptive selection mechanism. In nature, genetic\ndiversity can be the consequence of many different factors, but when\nconsidering reproduction Sexual Selection can have an impact on promoting\nvariety within a species. Specifically, Mate Choice often results in different\nselective pressures between sexes, which in turn may trigger evolutionary\ndifferences among them. Although some mechanisms of Sexual Selection have been\napplied to Genetic Programming in the past, the literature is scarce when it\ncomes to mate choice. Recently, a way of modelling mating preferences by ideal\nmate representations was proposed, achieving good results when compared to a\nstandard approach. These mating preferences evolve freely in a self-adaptive\nfashion, creating an evolutionary driving force of its own alongside fitness\npressure. The inner mechanisms of this approach operate from personal choice,\nas each individual has its own representation of a perfect mate which affects\nthe mate to be selected. In this paper, we compare this method against a random\nmate choice to assess whether there are advantages in evolving personal\npreferences. We conducted experiments using three symbolic regression problems\nand different mutation rates.

However, the data-driven DNNs always perform like a\nblack box where the lack of interpretability limits the trustworthiness and\ncontrollability of DNNs in most practical CD applications. As a strong\nknowledge-driven tool to measure correlation between random variables, Copula\ntheory has been introduced into CD, yet it suffers from non-robust CD\nperformance without manual prior selection for Copula functions. To address the\nabove issues, we propose a knowledge-data-driven heterogeneous CD method\n(NN-Copula-CD) based on the Copula-guided interpretable neural network. In our\nNN-Copula-CD, the mathematical characteristics of Copula are designed as the\nlosses to supervise a simple fully connected neural network to learn the\ncorrelation between bi-temporal image patches, and then the changed regions are\nidentified via binary classification for the correlation coefficients of all\nimage patch pairs of the bi-temporal images. We conduct in-depth experiments on\nthree datasets with multimodal images (e.g., Optical, SAR, and NIR), where the\nquantitative results and visualized analysis demonstrate both the effectiveness\nand interpretability of the proposed NN-Copula-CD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 15:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

However, in real scenarios, the performance of\nPoseFormer and its follow-ups is limited by two factors: (a) The length of the\ninput joint sequence; (b) The quality of 2D joint detection. Existing methods\ntypically apply self-attention to all frames of the input sequence, causing a\nhuge computational burden when the frame number is increased to obtain advanced\nestimation accuracy, and they are not robust to noise naturally brought by the\nlimited capability of 2D joint detectors. In this paper, we propose\nPoseFormerV2, which exploits a compact representation of lengthy skeleton\nsequences in the frequency domain to efficiently scale up the receptive field\nand boost robustness to noisy 2D joint detection. With minimum modifications to\nPoseFormer, the proposed method effectively fuses features both in the time\ndomain and frequency domain, enjoying a better speed-accuracy trade-off than\nits precursor. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M\nand MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly\noutperforms the original PoseFormer and other transformer-based variants.

The forecasting algorithms are\nevaluated on a real-world dataset provided by the Water Supply and Sewerage\nCompany of Greece revealing key insights about each algorithm and its use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 09:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

To accelerate the\nphysics-based prediction of mechanical properties of IPCs for various\nstructural designs, we employ a deep neural operator (DNO) to learn the\ntransient response of IPCs under dynamic loading as surrogate of physics-based\nFEA models. We consider a 3D IPC beam formed by two metals with a ratio of\nYoung's modulus of 2.7, wherein random blocks of constituent materials are used\nto demonstrate the generality and robustness of the DNO model. To obtain FEA\nresults of IPC properties, 5,000 random time-dependent strain loads generated\nby a Gaussian process kennel are applied to the 3D IPC beam, and the reaction\nforces and stress fields inside the IPC beam under various loading are\ncollected.

After an\noffline training, the DNO model can act as surrogate of physics-based FEA to\npredict the transient mechanical response in terms of reaction force and stress\ndistribution of the IPCs to various strain loads in one second at an accuracy\nof 98%.

Spin of a photon should be linked to\npolarisation, however, the similar argument for an electron was not applicable\nto Maxwell equations, which are already Lorentz invariant. Therefore, the\norigin of polarisation and its relationship with spin are not completely\nelucidated, yet. Here, we discuss propagation of coherent rays of photons in a\ngraded-index optical fibre, which can be solved exactly using the\nLaguerre-Gauss or Hermite-Gauss modes in a cylindrical or a Cartesian\ncoordinate. We found that the energy spectrum is massive with the effective\nmass as a function of the confinement and orbital angular momentum. The\npropagation is described by the one-dimensional ($1D$) non-relativistic\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, which is equivalent to the $2D$ space-time Klein-Gordon\nequation by a unitary transformation. The probabilistic interpretation and the\nconservation law require the factorisation of the Klein-Gordon equation,\nleading to the $2D$ Dirac equation with spin.

We consider\nhow light is characterised in a material, where the speed of light is different\nfrom that in a vacuum due to the finite dielectric constant. The phase velocity\nin a material is smaller than $c$, such that the speed of a moving frame can be\nlarger than the phase velocity, such that the frame can move faster than the\nspeed of light in a material. Consequently, an unusual Doppler effect is\nexpected, and the wavelength in the moving frame changes from the red-shift to\nthe blue-shift upon increasing the speed of the frame. The corresponding energy\nof the light also changes sign from positive to negative, while momentum is\nalways positive, leading to the changes of sings for the phase velocity and the\nhelicity. In a graded index fibre, where the exact solution is available, even\nmore complicated phenomena are expected, due to the finite effective mass of\nphotons. Upon the increase of the energy gap, generated by optical confinements\nand optical orbital angular momentum, the effective mass of photons increases.\nIf the gap is large enough, momentum starts to change the sign upon increasing\nthe frame velocity, while the energy of photons is always positive.

Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters determining the service\nperformance, often used for recommendation, fluctuate over time. Thus, the QoS\nprediction is essential to identify a suitable service among functionally\nequivalent services over time. The contemporary temporal QoS prediction methods\nhardly achieved the desired accuracy due to various limitations, such as the\ninability to handle data sparsity and outliers and capture higher-order\ntemporal relationships among user-service interactions. Even though some recent\nrecurrent neural-network-based architectures can model temporal relationships\namong QoS data, prediction accuracy degrades due to the absence of other\nfeatures (e.g., collaborative features) to comprehend the relationship among\nthe user-service interactions. This paper addresses the above challenges and\nproposes a scalable strategy for Temporal QoS Prediction using Multi-source\nCollaborative-Features (TPMCF), achieving high prediction accuracy and faster\nresponsiveness. TPMCF combines the collaborative-features of users/services by\nexploiting user-service relationship with the spatio-temporal auto-extracted\nfeatures by employing graph convolution and transformer encoder with multi-head\nself-attention.

Research on brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is advancing towards\nrehabilitating severely disabled patients in the real world.

A small but\ndense microelectrode array with 3072 channels was recently developed for\ndecoding user intentions. The process of spike sorting determines the spike\nactivity (SA) of different sources (neurons) from recorded neural data.\nUnfortunately, current spike sorting algorithms are unable to handle the\nmassively increasing amount of data from dense microelectrode arrays, making\nspike sorting a fragile component of the online BCI decoding framework.\nApproach.

This work aims at\npromoting control education on a simple yet challenging process, going from\nfrequency analysis and linear design to an adaptive control method implemented\nwith an online recursive algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 11:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}
