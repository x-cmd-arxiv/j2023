An oxidation-reduction cycle based on iron and its oxides\nrepresents a very promising technology in this regard. The present work\nassesses the potential of converting an existing modern coal-fired power plant\nto operation with iron. For this purpose, a systematic retrofit study is\ncarried out, employing a model that balances all material and energy fluxes in\na state-of-the-art coal-fired power plant. Particular attention is given to\ncomponents of the burner system and the system$'$s heat exchanger. The analysis\nprovides evidence that main components such as the steam generator and steam\ncycle can be reused with moderate modifications. Major modifications are\nrelated to the larger amounts of solids produced during iron combustion, for\ninstance in the particle feeding and removal systems. Since the high particle\ndensities and lower demand for auxiliary systems improve the heat transfer, the\nnet efficiencies of iron operation can be one to two percentage points better\nthan coal operation, depending on operating conditions. This new insight can\nsignificantly accelerate the introduction of this innovative technology by\nguiding future research and the development of the retrofit option.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 16:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 14:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

While vision can provide information about an\nobject's appearance, non-visual sensors, such as audio and haptics, can provide\ninformation about its intrinsic properties, such as weight, temperature,\nhardness, and the object's sound. Using tools to interact with objects can\nreveal additional object properties that are otherwise hidden (e.g., knives and\nspoons can be used to examine the properties of food, including its texture and\nconsistency). Robots can use tools to interact with objects and gather\ninformation about their implicit properties via non-visual sensors. However, a\nrobot's model for recognizing objects using a tool-mediated behavior does not\ngeneralize to a new tool or behavior due to differing observed data\ndistributions. To address this challenge, we propose a framework to enable\nrobots to transfer implicit knowledge about granular objects across different\ntools and behaviors. The proposed approach learns a shared latent space from\nmultiple robots' contexts produced by respective sensory data while interacting\nwith objects using tools.

A large area 3D electron backscatter diffraction\n(EBSD) measurement and crystal plasticity modeling were carried out to\ninvestigate the tensile twinning behaviors in a Mg alloy. The results showed\nthat tensile twinning activity was underestimated using conventional 2D EBSD\nscans. When compressed to yield point, the examined twin frequency with 2D was\nlower than that using 3D EBSD. The effects of Schmid factor (SF) on twinning\nwere investigated. Almost all high Schmid factor (SF>0.35) grains were twinned.\nA surprising high twin frequency of 82% in middle SF (0.35>=SF>=0.15) grains\nwas observed, which was unexpected since the middle SF grains were believed to\nbe unfavorable for twinning. The twin frequency in low SF (SF<0.15) grains was\nslightly increased from 2D to 3D EBSD due to the small volume of twins. The\nshear stress maintained a high level and was homogeneously distributed in high\nSF grains, facilitating twin nucleation and growth. The shear stress was\ndistributed heterogeneously within the middle SF grains, and twins were\nnucleated within areas with positive shear stress. The shear stress in low SF\ngrains was not favorable for twinning and twins occurred in the vicinity of\nstress accumulation. Twinning activities in the same grain varied on different\nlayers. It was attributed to the stress fluctuation derived from grain\nenvironment changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 16:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

We propose a methodology to identify and model\nnovel triggering conditions in a scene in order to assess SOTIF using Bayesian\nnetwork (BN) and p-value hypothesis testing. The experts provide the initial BN\nstructure while the conditional belief tables (CBTs) are learned using dataset.\nP-value hypothesis testing is used to identify the relevant subset of scenes.\nThese scenes are then analyzed by experts who provide potential triggering\nconditions present in the scenes. The novel triggering conditions are modeled\nin the BN and retested. As a case study, we provide p-value hypothesis testing\nof BN of LIDAR using real world data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 16:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

We found that the probabilistic assumptions\n(e.g. distribution tail, support) have a greater impact on uncertainty\nprediction than the deterministic ones (e.g. deep modules, depth). Among the\nfamily of Prob-GNNs, the GNNs with truncated Gaussian and Laplace distributions\nachieve the highest performance in transit and ridesharing data.

Prob-GNNs also reveal\nthe spatiotemporal pattern of uncertainty, which is concentrated on the\nafternoon peak hours and the areas with large travel volumes.

A common approximation is the\n1-exciton model in which processes involving weak excitations are described\nusing a basis comprising of the ground state and singly excited states of the\nmolecule cavity-mode system. In another frequently used approximation in\nnumerical investigations, the electromagnetic field is described classically,\nand the quantum molecular subsystem is treated in the mean-field Hartree\napproximation with its wavefunction assumed to be a product of single\nmolecules' wavefunctions. The former disregards states that take long time to\npopulate, and is therefore essentially a short time approximation.

These so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events are followed by phases\nof relatively mild temperatures termed interstadials, which exhibit gradual\ncooling over several hundred to a few thousand years prior to a final phase of\nabrupt temperature decrease back to cold stadials. To date, there is no\nconsensus on the mechanism of this millennial-scale variability. Here, we\npropose an excitable model system to explain the DO cycles, in which\ninterstadials occur as noise-induced state space excursions. Our model\ncomprises the mutual multi-scale interactions between four dynamical variables\nrepresenting Arctic atmospheric temperatures, Nordic Seas' temperatures and sea\nice cover, and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Crucially, the\nmodel's atmosphere--ocean heat flux is moderated by the sea ice variable, which\nin turn is subject to large perturbations dynamically generated by fast\nevolving intermittent noise. If supercritical, these perturbations trigger\ninterstadial-like state space excursions seizing all four model variables. As a\nphysical source for such a driving noise process we propose convective events\nin the ocean or atmospheric blocking events. The key characteristics of DO\ncycles are reproduced by our model with remarkable resemblance to the proxy\nrecord; in particular, their shape, return time, as well as the dependence of\nthe interstadial and stadial durations on the background conditions are\nreproduced accurately. In contrast to the prevailing understanding that the DO\nvariability showcases bistability in the underlying dynamics, we conclude that\nmulti-scale, monostable excitable dynamics provides a promising alternative\ncandidate to explain the millennial-scale climate variability associated with\nthe DO events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 17:17:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 07:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

The main\nlimitation of conventional VLN algorithms is that if an action is mistaken, the\nagent fails to follow the instructions or explores unnecessary regions, leading\nthe agent to an irrecoverable path. To tackle this problem, we propose\nMeta-Explore, a hierarchical navigation method deploying an exploitation policy\nto correct misled recent actions. We show that an exploitation policy, which\nmoves the agent toward a well-chosen local goal among unvisited but observable\nstates, outperforms a method which moves the agent to a previously visited\nstate. We also highlight the demand for imagining regretful explorations with\nsemantically meaningful clues. The key to our approach is understanding the\nobject placements around the agent in spectral-domain. Specifically, we present\na novel visual representation, called scene object spectrum (SOS), which\nperforms category-wise 2D Fourier transform of detected objects. Combining\nexploitation policy and SOS features, the agent can correct its path by\nchoosing a promising local goal. We evaluate our method in three VLN\nbenchmarks: R2R, SOON, and REVERIE. Meta-Explore outperforms other baselines\nand shows significant generalization performance. In addition, local goal\nsearch using the proposed spectral-domain SOS features significantly improves\nthe success rate by 17.1% and SPL by 20.6% for the SOON benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 17:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

These estimates\nvary widely depending on the type of country, data coverage, and frequency.\nHowever, the ERPT estimation using firm-level high-frequency export data of a\nsmall developing country is rare. In this paper, I estimate the pricing to\nmarket and the exchange rate pass-through at a monthly, quarterly, and annual\nlevel of data frequency to deal with aggregation bias. Furthermore, I\ninvestigate how delivery time-based factors such as frequent shipments and\nfaster transport affect a firm`s pricing-to-market behavior. Using\ntransaction-level export data of Bangladesh from 2005 to 2013 and the Poisson\nPseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimation method, I find very small pricing\nto the markets to the exchange rates in the exporter's price. As pass-through\nshows how the exporters respond to macro shocks, for Bangladesh, this low\nexport price response to the exchange rate changes indicates that currency\ndevaluation might not have a significant effect on the exporter. The minimal\nprice response and high pass-through contrast with the literature on incomplete\npass-through at the annual level.

This relatively constant CN/HCN line\nratio is rather unexpected, as models of photon dominated regions have\nsuggested that HCN emission traces shielded regions with high column densities\nwhile CN should trace dense gas exposed to high ultraviolet radiation fields.\nWe find that the CN/HCN line ratio shows no significant correlation with\nmolecular gas surface density, but shows a mild trend (increase of ~ 1.3 per\ndex) with both star formation rate surface density and star formation\nefficiency (the inverse of the molecular gas depletion time). Some starburst\nand active galactic nuclei show small enhancements in their CN/HCN ratio, while\nother nuclei show no significant difference from their surrounding disks. The\nnearly constant CN/HCN line ratio implies that CN, like HCN, can be used as a\ntracer of dense gas mass and dense gas fraction in nearby galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 18:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

The system\ncomprises a superconducting flux qubit (FQ) and a quarter-wavelength coplanar\nwaveguide resonator ($\\lambda/4$ CPWR) that are coupled inductively through a\nshared edge that contains a Josephson junction to achieve the DSC regime.\nSpectroscopy is performed around the frequency of the fundamental mode of the\nCPWR, and the spectrum is fitted by the single-mode quantum Rabi Hamiltonian to\nobtain the system parameters. Since the qubit is also coupled to a large number\nof higher modes in the resonator, the single-mode fitting does not provide the\nbare qubit energy but a value that incorporates the renormalization from all\nthe other modes. We derive theoretical formulas for the Lamb shift in the\nmultimode resonator system.

We propose an\nextraordinary electronic-correlation-driven mechanism by which this anomalous\nsuperconductivity manifests. Specifically, the electrons tend to avoid band\noccupations near high density of states regions due to their mutual repulsion.\nConsidering the nature of spontaneous symmetry breaking involved, we dub this\navoidance Stoner blockade. We show how a magnetic field softens this blockade,\nallowing weak superconductivity to take place, consistent with experimental\nfindings. Our principle prediction is that a small reduction of the Coulomb\nrepulsion would result in sizable superconductivity gains, both in achieving\nhigher critical temperatures and expanding the superconducting regime.

However, these studies require separate face segmentation and\nblending modules for successful face swapping, and the fixed selection of the\nmanipulated latent code in these works is reckless, thus degrading face\nswapping quality, generalizability, and practicability. This paper proposes a\nnovel and end-to-end integrated framework for high resolution and attribute\npreservation face swapping via Adaptive Latent Representation Learning.\nSpecifically, we first design a multi-task dual-space face encoder by sharing\nthe underlying feature extraction network to simultaneously complete the facial\nregion perception and face encoding. This encoder enables us to control the\nface pose and attribute individually, thus enhancing the face swapping quality.\nNext, we propose an adaptive latent codes swapping module to adaptively learn\nthe mapping between the facial attributes and the latent codes and select\neffective latent codes for improved retention of facial attributes. Finally,\nthe initial face swapping image generated by StyleGAN2 is blended with the\nfacial region mask generated by our encoder to address the background blur\nproblem. Our framework integrating facial perceiving and blending into the\nend-to-end training and testing process can achieve high realistic\nface-swapping on wild faces without segmentation masks. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our approach over state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 19:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

The JEM training relies on \"positive examples\" (i.e.\nexamples from the training data set) as well as on \"negative examples\", which\nare samples from the modeled distribution $p(x)$ generated by means of\nStochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). Unfortunately, SGLD often fails\nto deliver negative samples of sufficient quality during the standard JEM\ntraining, which causes a very unbalanced contribution from the positive and\nnegative examples when calculating gradients for JEM updates. As a consequence,\nthe standard JEM training is quite unstable requiring careful tuning of\nhyper-parameters and frequent restarts when the training starts diverging. This\nmakes it difficult to apply JEM to different neural network architectures,\nmodalities, and tasks. In this work, we propose a training procedure that\nstabilizes SGLD-based JEM training (ST-JEM) by balancing the contribution from\nthe positive and negative examples. We also propose to add an additional\n\"regularization\" term to the training objective -- MI between the input\nobservations $x$ and output labels $y$ -- which encourages the JEM classifier\nto make more certain decisions about output labels.

In\nsuch areas, 5G base stations (BSs) will be densely deployed, allowing for\nline-of-sight (LOS) communications between the user equipment (UE) and multiple\nBSs at the same time. Having access to a plethora of measurement sources grants\nthe need for optimal integration between the BSs to have an accurate and\nprecise positioning solution. Traditionally, 5G multi-BS fusion is conducted\nvia an extended Kalman filter (EKF), that directly utilizes range and angle\nmeasurements in a centralized integration scheme. Such measurements have a\nnon-linear relationship with the positioning states of the filter, giving rise\nto linearization errors. Counter to the common belief, an unscented Kalman\nfilter (UKF) will fail to totally eradicate such linearization errors. In this\npaper, we argue that a decentralized integration between 5G BSs would fully\navoid linearization errors within the filter and significantly enhance the\npositioning performance. This is done by fusing position measurements instead\nof directly fusing range and angle measurements, which inherently leads to a\nlinear measurement model by design. The proposed decentralized KF method was\nevaluated in a quasi-real simulation setup provided by Siradel using a real\ntrajectory in Downtown Toronto. The experiments compared the performance of\ndecentralized KF integration to that of centralized EKF and UKF integration\nschemes.

We then coupled our TESS analysis with the modulation frequency\nresults from Wils et al. (MNRAS 387 (2008) 783-787) and found excellent\nagreement with the Sector 51 data. To further test this result we obtained\nground-based, V-magnitude observations of LS Her in the summer of 2022. This\ndata also showed excellent agreement with our coupled modulation model. We have\nverified that LS Her is a Blazhko star with a modulated Blazhko period of 109\ndays, stability over the 862 days of observations, and possible stability\nlasting over 15 years. We discuss the ramifications of the modulation for other\nBlazhko stars that show Blazhko effect changes over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 19:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

However, travel behavior depends on the factors\nrepresented by both numeric data and urban imagery, thus necessitating a\nsynergetic framework to combine them. This study creates a theoretical\nframework of deep hybrid models with a crossing structure consisting of a\nmixing operator and a behavioral predictor, thus integrating the numeric and\nimagery data into a latent space. Empirically, this framework is applied to\nanalyze travel mode choice using the MyDailyTravel Survey from Chicago as the\nnumeric inputs and the satellite images as the imagery inputs. We found that\ndeep hybrid models outperform both the traditional demand models and the recent\ndeep learning in predicting the aggregate and disaggregate travel behavior with\nour supervision-as-mixing design. The latent space in deep hybrid models can be\ninterpreted, because it reveals meaningful spatial and social patterns. The\ndeep hybrid models can also generate new urban images that do not exist in\nreality and interpret them with economic theory, such as computing substitution\npatterns and social welfare changes. Overall, the deep hybrid models\ndemonstrate the complementarity between the low-dimensional numeric and\nhigh-dimensional imagery data and between the traditional demand modeling and\nrecent deep learning. It generalizes the latent classes and variables in\nclassical hybrid demand models to a latent space, and leverages the\ncomputational power of deep learning for imagery while retaining the economic\ninterpretability on the microeconomics foundation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 19:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

Different distances of\ncanonical genomes can be derived from a structure called breakpoint graph,\nwhich represents the relation between the two given genomes as a collection of\ncycles of even length and paths. Then, the breakpoint distance is equal to n -\n(c_2 + p_0/2), where n is the number of genes, c_2 is the number of cycles of\nlength 2 and p_0 is the number of paths of length 0. Similarly, when the\nconsidered rearrangements are those modeled by the double-cut-and-join (DCJ)\noperation, the rearrangement distance is n - (c + p_e/2), where c is the total\nnumber of cycles and p_e is the total number of even paths.\n  The distance formulation is a basic unit for several other combinatorial\nproblems related to genome evolution and ancestral reconstruction, such as\nmedian or double distance.

Traditionally,\nself-supervised training mainly focuses on imitating previously observed\nbehaviors, and the training demonstrations carry no notion of which behaviors\nshould be explicitly avoided. In this work, we propose Control Barrier\nTransformer (ConBaT), an approach that learns safe behaviors from\ndemonstrations in a self-supervised fashion. ConBaT is inspired by the concept\nof control barrier functions in control theory and uses a causal transformer\nthat learns to predict safe robot actions autoregressively using a critic that\nrequires minimal safety data labeling. During deployment, we employ a\nlightweight online optimization to find actions that ensure future states lie\nwithin the learned safe set.

Materials possessing metallic ground states with\nstrong interactions between localized and itinerant electronic states are\nnatural candidates for the realization of such quantum phases. However, the\nelectronic correlations responsible for increasing the likelihood of novel\nphases simultaneously place the quantum limit beyond the reach of laboratory\nmagnets. Here we propose these difficulties can be surmounted in materials with\nstrong correlations and insulating ground states. Strong correlations in\ninsulators and high magnetic fields conspire to fill Landau levels in the\nreverse order compared to conventional metals, such that the lowest Landau\nlevel is the first observed. Consequently, the quantum limit in strongly\ncorrelated insulators is reached in reverse and at fields accessible in\nlaboratories. Quantum oscillations measured at high fields in YbB12 are shown\nto have features consistent with the reverse quantum limit. These include how\nquantum oscillations move in lock step with the angular evolution of the\ninsulator-metal transition and the field dependence of the quantum oscillation\nfrequency.

In this paper, I develop a model of importer-exporter\nprocurement where the importer procures international inputs from exporting\nfirms in developing countries. The exporters are credit constrained for working\ncapital, incur the per-shipment fixed costs, and get paid after goods are\ndelivered to the importer. The model shows that the shipping frequency\nincreases for high financing costs in origin and destination. Furthermore,\nlonger delivery times increase shipping frequency as well as procurement costs.\nThe model also shows that the higher per-shipment fixed costs reduce the\nshipping frequency, in line with previous literature. Reduced transaction costs\nlower the exporter's demand for financial services through shipping frequency\nadjustment, mitigating the financial frictions of the firm. Then, I empirically\ninvestigate whether the conclusions regarding the effect of per-shipment fixed\ncosts on shipping frequency from the theoretical model and in the existing\nliterature extend to developing countries. My estimation method addresses\nseveral biases. First, I deal with aggregation bias with the firm, product, and\ncountry-level analysis. Second, I consider the Poisson Pseudo Maximum\nLikelihood (PPML) estimation method to deal with heteroscedasticity bias from\nthe OLS estimation of log-linear models. Third, I fix the distance\nnon-linearity of Bangladeshi exports. Finally, I consider the effect of\nfinancing cost on shipping frequency to address omitted variable bias. Using\ntransaction-level export data from Bangladesh, I find that 10% higher\nper-shipment costs reduce the shipping frequency by 3.45%. The findings are\nrobust to different specifications and subsamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 20:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI)\ntechniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content\n(AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music,\nand natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the\ncontent creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the\nproduction of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by\nextracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by\nhuman, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent\ninformation. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly\nimportant in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved\ngeneration results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the\ndistribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to\nreality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This\nsurvey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and\nbasic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and\nmultimodal interaction.

In most papers,\nthe researchers have worked with the Ethereum blockchain almost exclusively.\nEven though, Ethereum and other blockchains have dynamic gas prices this is not\nthe case for all blockchains; many of them have fixed gas prices. Extending the\nresearch to other blockchains with fixed gas price could broaden the scope of\nthe existing studies on MEV. To our knowledge, there is not a vast\nunderstanding of MEV in fixed gas price blockchains. Therefore, we propose to\nstudy Terra Classic as an example to understand how MEV activities affect\nblockchains with fixed gas price. We first analysed the data from Terra Classic\nbefore the UST de-peg event in May 2022 and described the nature of the\nexploited arbitrage opportunities. We found more than 188K successful\narbitrages, and most of them used UST as the initial token. The capital to\nperform the arbitrage was less than 1K UST in 50% of the cases, and 80% of the\narbitrages had less than four swaps. Then, we explored the characteristics that\nattribute to higher MEV.

These\napproaches fail to exploit the different visual cues that give context to\ndifferent hierarchies, such as the country, state, and city level. To this end,\nwe introduce an end-to-end transformer-based architecture that exploits the\nrelationship between different geographic levels (which we refer to as\nhierarchies) and the corresponding visual scene information in an image through\nhierarchical cross-attention. We achieve this by learning a query for each\ngeographic hierarchy and scene type.

The\nexperimental findings in the Rydberg chain can be well captured by a\nkinetically constrained model called the \"PXP\" model, which has been shown to\nhost the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)-violating scar states in\nthe middle of the spectrum. Much effort has been put into identifying similar\nkinetically restricted systems that show a violation of ETH. In this work, we\nstudy the QMBS that can arise in one such model, namely the spin-$1$ Kitaev\nchain, where owing to some conserved quantities, the Hilbert space gets\nfragmented into unequal disconnected subspaces. Recently, You et al. [Phys.\nRev. Research 4, 013103 (2022)] showed that the ground state sector of this\nchain can be mapped exactly onto the prototypical PXP model and thus hosts\nQMBSs. Here, we demonstrate that the phenomenon of scarring is also present in\nother sectors, and in particular, we identify a sector that exhibits\nsubstantially more scarring than the ground state one. We propose an initial\nstate and numerically demonstrate that its fidelity revivals are robust and\nlonger-lived than those in the PXP model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 21:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

Recent works have shown that\nthese capacity increases can influence vehicles' route choices in unexpected\nways similar to the well-known Braess's paradox, such that the network\ncongestion might increase. In this paper, we propose that in mixed-autonomy\nnetworks, i.e., networks where roads are shared between human-driven and\nautonomous cars, the headway of autonomous cars can be directly controlled to\ninfluence vehicles' routing and reduce congestion. We argue that the headway of\nautonomous cars -- and consequently the capacity of link segments -- is not\njust a fixed design choice; but rather, it can be leveraged as an\n{infrastructure control} strategy to {dynamically} regulate capacities. Imagine\nthat similar to variable speed limits which regulate the maximum speed of\nvehicles on a road segment, a control policy regulates the headway of\nautonomous cars along each road segment. We seek to influence vehicles' route\nchoices by directly controlling the headway of autonomous cars to prevent\nBraess-like unexpected outcomes and increase network efficiency. We model the\ndynamics of mixed-autonomy traffic networks while accounting for the vehicles'\nroute choice dynamics. We train an RL policy that learns to regulate the\nheadway of autonomous cars such that the total travel time in the network is\nminimized. We will show empirically that our trained policy can not only\nprevent Braess-like inefficiencies but also decrease total travel time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 22:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

This potentially unauthorized usage of\nonline data leads to concerns regarding data privacy. Recent works aim to make\nunlearnable data for deep learning models by adding small, specially designed\nnoises to tackle this issue. However, these methods are vulnerable to\nadversarial training (AT) and/or are computationally heavy. In this work, we\npropose a novel, model-free, Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA)\ngeneration technique. CUDA is generated using controlled class-wise\nconvolutions with filters that are randomly generated via a private key. CUDA\nencourages the network to learn the relation between filters and labels rather\nthan informative features for classifying the clean data. We develop some\ntheoretical analysis demonstrating that CUDA can successfully poison Gaussian\nmixture data by reducing the clean data performance of the optimal Bayes\nclassifier. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of CUDA with\nvarious datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), and\narchitectures (ResNet-18, VGG-16, Wide ResNet-34-10, DenseNet-121, DeIT,\nEfficientNetV2-S, and MobileNetV2). Our experiments show that CUDA is robust to\nvarious data augmentations and training approaches such as smoothing, AT with\ndifferent budgets, transfer learning, and fine-tuning. For instance, training a\nResNet-18 on ImageNet-100 CUDA achieves only 8.96$\\%$, 40.08$\\%$, and 20.58$\\%$\nclean test accuracies with empirical risk minimization (ERM), $L_{\\infty}$ AT,\nand $L_{2}$ AT, respectively. Here, ERM on the clean training data achieves a\nclean test accuracy of 80.66$\\%$. CUDA exhibits unlearnability effect with ERM\neven when only a fraction of the training dataset is perturbed. Furthermore, we\nalso show that CUDA is robust to adaptive defenses designed specifically to\nbreak it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 22:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

A continuous-function measure kernel $K$\nover $D \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a function of two variables which acts as a\ncontinuous function in the first variable and as a real Radon measure in the\nsecond. Some analytical properties of such kernels are studied, particularly in\nthe case of cross-positive-definite type kernels. The self-integral of $K$ over\na bounded set $D$ is the \"integral of $K$ with respect to itself\". It is\ndefined using Riemann sums and denoted $\\int_{D}K(x,dx)$. Some examples where\nsuch notion is well-defined are presented. This concept turns out to be crucial\nfor unique-definiteness of stochastic integrals, that is, when the integral is\nindependent of the way of approaching it. If $K$ is the cross-covariance kernel\nbetween a mean-square continuous stochastic process $Z$ and a random measure\nwith measure covariance structure $M$, $\\int_{D}K(x,dx)$ is the expectation of\nthe stochastic integral $\\int_{D} ZdM$ when both are uniquely-defined.

Traditional approaches consider fixed CBFs\nduring navigation and hand-tune the underlying parameters apriori. Such\napproaches are inefficient and vulnerable to changes in the environment. The\ngoal of this paper is to learn CBFs for multi-robot navigation based on what\nrobots perceive about their environment. In order to guarantee the feasibility\nof the navigation task, while ensuring robot safety, we pursue a trade-off\nbetween conservativeness and aggressiveness in robot behavior by defining\ndynamic environment-aware CBF constraints. Since the explicit relationship\nbetween CBF constraints and navigation performance is challenging to model, we\nleverage reinforcement learning to learn time-varying CBFs in a model-free\nmanner.

However,\ndesigning Deep Semantic Segmentation models is a complex task, as it may\ninvolve application-dependent aspects. Particularly, when considering\nautonomous driving applications, the robustness-efficiency trade-off, as well\nas intrinsic limitations - computational/memory bounds and data-scarcity - and\nconstraints - real-time inference - should be taken into consideration. In this\nrespect, the use of additional data modalities, such as depth perception for\nreasoning on the geometry of a scene, and temporal cues from videos to explore\nredundancy and consistency, are promising directions yet not explored to their\nfull potential in the literature.

The Bayesian optimization approach is then\nintroduced to allow us to adjust the weights to be assigned to different zone\nfeatures used in solving the zone-level Traveling Salesman Problem. By using a\nreal-world delivery dataset provided by the Amazon Last Mile Routing Research\nChallenge, we demonstrate the importance of having both the optimization and\nthe machine learning components. We also demonstrate how we can use\nroute-related features to identify instances that we might have difficulty\nwith. This paves ways to further research on how we can tackle these difficult\ninstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 02:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

A traditional idea in\nmultitask learning (MTL) is building a shared representation across tasks which\ncan then be adapted to new tasks by tuning last layers. A desirable refinement\nof using a shared one-fits-all representation is to construct task-specific\nrepresentations. To this end, recent PathNet/muNet architectures represent\nindividual tasks as pathways within a larger supernet. The subnetworks induced\nby pathways can be viewed as task-specific representations that are composition\nof modules within supernet's computation graph.

In this paper, we present a flexible and effective OIS framework\nfor LiDAR point cloud that can accurately segment both known and unknown\ninstances (i.e., seen and unseen instance categories during training). It first\nidentifies points belonging to known classes and removes the background by\nleveraging close-set panoptic segmentation networks.

We use femtosecond x-ray radiography\nto observe how dislocations in shock-compressed single-crystalline diamond\ntravel with the plastic shock wavefront.

In recent works, two approaches\nfor UVOS have been discussed that can be divided into: appearance and\nappearance-motion based methods. Appearance based methods utilize the\ncorrelation information of inter-frames to capture target object that commonly\nappears in a sequence. However, these methods does not consider the motion of\ntarget object due to exploit the correlation information between randomly\npaired frames.

The conventional\ncross-correlation operation, while commonly used, has limitations in\neffectively capturing perceptual similarity and incorporates extraneous\nbackground information. To mitigate these limitations, this work presents a\nnovel saliency-guided dynamic vision Transformer (SGDViT) for UAV tracking. The\nproposed method designs a new task-specific object saliency mining network to\nrefine the cross-correlation operation and effectively discriminate foreground\nand background information.

In this\npaper, we present a formulation for finding the elastodynamic effective\nconstitutive relations for general heterogeneous media, including finite-size\nand non-periodic ones, by taking into account boundary terms in the\nHashin-Shtrikman principle. Our proposed formulation relies on the\ninfinite-body Green's function of a reference homogeneous medium, making it\nfree from the difficulty of determining Green's function even for the\nhomogenization of finite-size media. Additionally, we demonstrate the universal\napplicability of this formulation for both random and deterministic\nheterogeneous media.

Given it is\ndifficult to accurately determine animals' emotions from humans' perspective,\nwe assume the dominant noise in neural data representing different emotions is\nthe labeling error.

MiddleNet supports function chains that are essential in both NFV\nand middlebox environments.

The overheads for MiddleNet in L4/L7 are strictly\nload-proportional, without needing the dedicated CPU cores of DPDK-based\napproaches. MiddleNet supports flow-dependent packet processing by leveraging\nSingle Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) to dynamically select the packet\nprocessing needed (Layers 2 - 7).

Moreover, the increase in PV self-consumption\nand consequently the reduction of imported electricity poses a problem in\nrecovering Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System\nOperators (DSOs) grid costs, that until now have been directly linked to the\namount of electricity consumed due to the volumetric nature of traditional\ntariffs.

At inference, any input of the hybrid model is assigned to\neither its interpretable or complex component based on a gating mechanism. The\nadvantages of such models over classical ones are two-fold: 1) They grant users\nprecise control over the level of transparency of the system and 2) They can\npotentially perform better than a standalone black box since redirecting some\nof the inputs to an interpretable model implicitly acts as regularization.\nStill, despite their high potential, hybrid models remain under-studied in the\ninterpretability/explainability literature. In this paper, we remedy this fact\nby presenting a thorough investigation of such models from three perspectives:\nTheory, Taxonomy, and Methods. First, we explore the theory behind the\ngeneralization of hybrid models from the Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC)\nperspective. A consequence of our PAC guarantee is the existence of a sweet\nspot for the optimal transparency of the system. When such a sweet spot is\nattained, a hybrid model can potentially perform better than a standalone black\nbox. Secondly, we provide a general taxonomy for the different ways of training\nhybrid models: the Post-Black-Box and Pre-Black-Box paradigms. These approaches\ndiffer in the order in which the interpretable and complex components are\ntrained. We show where the state-of-the-art hybrid models Hybrid-Rule-Set and\nCompanion-Rule-List fall in this taxonomy. Thirdly, we implement the two\nparadigms in a single method: HybridCORELS, which extends the CORELS algorithm\nto hybrid modeling. By leveraging CORELS, HybridCORELS provides a certificate\nof optimality of its interpretable component and precise control over\ntransparency.

A basic prerequisite for catch-bond formation\nis that force-induced remodeling of ligand binding interface occurs prior to\nbond rupture. However, what strategy receptor proteins utilize to meet such\nspecific kinetic control is still unclear, rendering the mechanistic\nunderstanding of catch-bond an open question. Here we report a bidirectional\nallostery mechanism of catch-bond for the hyaluronan (HA) receptor CD44 which\nis responsible for rolling adhesion of lymphocytes and circulating tumor cells.\nBinding of ligand HA allosterically reduces the threshold force for unlocking\nof otherwise stably folded force-sensing element (i.e., forward allostery), so\nthat much smaller tensile force can trigger the conformational switching of\nreceptor protein to high binding-strength state via backward allosteric\ncoupling before bond rupture. The effect of forward allostery was further\nsupported by performing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Such\nbidirectional allostery mechanism fulfills the specific kinetic control\nrequired by catch-bond and is likely to be commonly utilized in cell adhesion.\nWe also revealed a slip-catch-slip triphasic pattern in force response of\nCD44-HA bond arising from force-induced repartitioning of parallel dissociation\npathways.

However, when focusing on vision applications, there is usually a\nlack of information like sensor measurements (e.g. IMU, LiDAR, joint state), or\ntime continuity.

The data produced can be\npost-processed, e.g. to add noise, and easily expanded with new information\nusing the tools that we provide. To demonstrate GRADE, we use it to generate an\nindoor dynamic environment dataset and then compare different SLAM algorithms\non the produced sequences.

In reality, these two\ntypes of indirect reciprocity often occur in combination.

This invariant manifold is reached subsequent to the decay of the\nfast degrees of freedom, after which the slow dynamics follow on it. By\nparametrizing invariant manifold, the slow dynamics can be simulated via a\nreduced model.

Examples of transparency protocols include\ncertificate transparency, cryptocurrency, transparent decryption, and\nelectronic voting. These protocols usually pose a challenge for automatic\nverification, because they involve sophisticated data types that have strong\nproperties, such as Merkle trees, that allow compact proofs of data presence\nand tree extension.\n  We address this challenge by introducing new features in ProVerif, and a\nmethodology for using them. With our methodology, it is possible to describe\nthe data type quite abstractly, using ProVerif axioms, and prove the\ncorrectness of the protocol using those axioms as assumptions. Then, in\nseparate steps, one can define one or more concrete implementations of the data\ntype, and again use ProVerif to show that the implementations satisfy the\nassumptions that were coded as axioms.

Existing adversarial defenses primarily aim at preventing\nadversarial examples from attacking DNNs successfully, rather than preventing\ntheir generation. If the generation of adversarial examples is unregulated,\nimages within reach are no longer secure and pose a threat to non-robust DNNs.\nAlthough gradient obfuscation attempts to address this issue, it has been shown\nto be circumventable. Therefore, we propose a novel adversarial defense\nmechanism, which is referred to as immune defense and is the example-based\npre-defense. This mechanism applies carefully designed quasi-imperceptible\nperturbations to the raw images to prevent the generation of adversarial\nexamples for the raw images, and thereby protecting both images and DNNs. These\nperturbed images are referred to as Immune Examples (IEs). In the white-box\nimmune defense, we provide a gradient-based and an optimization-based approach,\nrespectively. Additionally, the more complex black-box immune defense is taken\ninto consideration. We propose Masked Gradient Sign Descent (MGSD) to reduce\napproximation error and stabilize the update to improve the transferability of\nIEs and thereby ensure their effectiveness against black-box adversarial\nattacks. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimization-based\napproach has superior performance and better visual quality in white-box immune\ndefense. In contrast, the gradient-based approach has stronger transferability\nand the proposed MGSD significantly improve the transferability of baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 10:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

Most massive stars are located in multiple stellar\nsystems. Magnetic fields are believed to be essential in the accretion and\nejection processes around single massive protostars. Aims. Our aim is to unveil\nthe influence of magnetic fields in the formation of multiple massive stars, in\nparticular on the fragmentation modes and properties of the multiple\nprotostellar system. Methods. Using RAMSES, we follow the collapse of a massive\npre-stellar core with (non-ideal) radiation-(magneto-)hydrodynamics. We choose\na setup which promotes multiple stellar system formation. Results. In the\npurely hydrodynamical models, we always obtain (at least) binary systems. When\nmore than two stars are present, their gravitational interaction triggers\nmergers until there are two stars left. The following gas accretion increases\ntheir orbital separation and hierarchical fragmentation occurs so that both\nstars host a comparable disk and stellar system which then form similar disks\nas well. We identify several modes of fragmentation: Toomre-unstable disk\nfragmentation, arm-arm collision and arm-filament collision. Disks grow in size\nuntil they fragment and become truncated as the newly-formed companion gains\nmass. When including magnetic fields, the picture evolves: the primary disk\nproduces less fragments, arm-filament collision is absent. Magnetic fields\nreduce the initial orbital separation but do not affect its further evolution,\nwhich is mainly driven by gas accretion. With magnetic fields, the growth of\nindividual disks is regulated even in the absence of fragmentation or\ntruncation. Conclusions. Hierarchical fragmentation is seen in unmagnetized and\nmagnetized models. Magnetic fields, including non-ideal effects, are important\nbecause they remove certain fragmentation modes and limit the growth of disks,\nwhich is otherwise only limited through fragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 11:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Extreme precision radial velocity (RV) surveys seeking to detect\nplanets at RV semi-amplitudes of 10 cm/s are facing numerous challenges. One of\nthose challenges is convective blueshift caused by stellar granulation and its\nsuppression through magnetic activity which plays a significant role in hiding\nplanetary signals in stellar jitter. Aims. Previously we found that for main\nsequence stars, convective blueshift as an observational proxy for the strength\nof convection near the stellar surface strongly depends on effective\ntemperature. In this work we investigate 242 post main sequence stars, covering\nthe subgiant, red giant, and asymptotic giant phases and empirically determine\nthe changes in convective blueshift with advancing stellar evolution. Methods.\nWe used the third signature scaling approach to fit a solar model for the\nconvective blueshift to absorption-line shift measurements from a sample of\ncoadded HARPS spectra, ranging in temperature from 3750 K to 6150 K. We compare\nthe results to main sequence stars of comparable temperatures but with a higher\nsurface gravity. Results. We show that convective blueshift becomes\nsignificantly stronger for evolved stars compared to main sequence stars of a\nsimilar temperature. The difference increases as the star becomes more evolved,\nreaching a 5x increase below 4300 K for the most evolved stars. The large\nnumber of stars in the sample, for the first time, allowed for us to\nempirically show that convective blueshift remains almost constant among the\nentire evolved star sample at roughly solar convection strength with a slight\nincrease from the red giant phase onward. We discover that the convective\nblueshift shows a local minimum for subgiant stars, presenting a sweet spot for\nexoplanet searches around higher mass stars, by taking advantage of their\nspin-down during the subgiant transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 13:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

These\nmethods typically rely on signal prediction theory to enhance compression\nperformance by designing high efficient intra and inter prediction strategies\nand compressing video frames one by one. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmodel-based video compression (MVC) framework that regards scenes as the\nfundamental units for video sequences. Our proposed MVC directly models the\nintensity variation of the entire video sequence in one scene, seeking\nnon-redundant representations instead of reducing redundancy through\nspatio-temporal predictions. To achieve this, we employ implicit neural\nrepresentation (INR) as our basic modeling architecture. To improve the\nefficiency of video modeling, we first propose context-related spatial\npositional embedding (CRSPE) and frequency domain supervision (FDS) in spatial\ncontext enhancement. For temporal correlation capturing, we design the scene\nflow constrain mechanism (SFCM) and temporal contrastive loss (TCL). Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 20\\% bitrate\nreduction compared to the latest video coding standard H.266 and is more\nefficient in decoding than existing video coding strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 13:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

The aim of the\npresent study was to understand the role of the metabolic cost of exercise in\ndetermining exercise tolerance, CT and W' and the mechanisms of neuromuscular\nfatigue.Methods: Twelve subjects performed four knee extension time-trials (6,\n8, 10, and 12-minutes) using eccentric, isometric, or concentric contractions\n(3 s-on/2 s-off at 90{\\textdegree} or 30{\\textdegree}/s) to modulate the\nmetabolic cost of exercise.

Cardiometabolic,\nneuromuscular, and ventilatory responses were quantified. Neuromuscular\nfunction was evaluated by maximal voluntary contraction, resting potentiated\nsingle/doublet electrical stimulations, and superimposed single electrical\nstimulation to quantify neuromuscular, peripheral, and central fatigue,\nrespectively.Results: Compared to isometric exercise, total impulse (+36 $\\pm$\n21%; P < 0.001), CT (+27 $\\pm$ 30%; P < 0.001), and W' (+67 $\\pm$ 99%; P <\n0.001) were increased during eccentric exercise whereas total impulse (-25\n$\\pm$ 7%; P < 0.001), critical torque (-26 $\\pm$ 15%; P < 0.001) and W' (-18\n$\\pm$ 19%; P < 0.001) were reduced in concentric exercise.

Businesses therefore aim to increase employee retention rates to\nminimise their costs and maximise their performance. Machine learning (ML) has\nbeen applied in various aspects of human resource management including\nattrition prediction to provide businesses with insights on proactive measures\non how to prevent talented employees from quitting. Among these ML methods, the\nbest performance has been reported by ensemble or deep neural networks, which\nby nature constitute black box techniques and thus cannot be easily\ninterpreted.

With this aim, the gradient-expansion formalism previously proposed for\nthe description of inflationary magnetogenesis in purely kinetic or purely\naxial coupling models, is extended to the case when both types of coupling are\npresent. As it is formulated in position space, this method allows us to\nself-consistently take into account the backreaction of generated gauge fields\non the inflationary background because it captures the nonlinear evolution of\nall physically relevant gauge-field modes at once. Using this extended\ngradient-expansion formalism, suitable for a wide range of inflationary\nmagnetogenesis models, we study the gauge-field production in a specific\ngeneralization of the Starobinsky $R^2$-model with a nonminimal coupling of\ngauge fields to gravity. In the Einstein frame, this model implies, in addition\nto an asymptotically flat inflaton potential, also a nontrivial form of kinetic\nand axial coupling functions which decrease in time and, thus, are potentially\nsuitable for the generation of gauge fields with a scale-invariant or even\nred-tilted power spectrum. The numerical analysis shows, however, that\nbackreaction, which unavoidably occurs in this model for the interesting range\nof parameters, strongly alters the behavior of the spectrum and does not allow\nto obtain a sufficiently large correlation length for the magnetic field. The\noscillatory behavior of the generated field, caused by the retarded response of\nthe gauge field to changes of the inflaton velocity, was revealed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 13:57:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 15:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

However, due to its limited receptive field, FCN cannot\neffectively capture global context information which is vital for semantic\nsegmentation. As a result, it is beaten by state-of-the-art methods which\nleverage different filter sizes for larger receptive fields. However, such a\nstrategy usually introduces more parameters and increases the computational\ncost. In this paper, we propose a novel global receptive convolution (GRC) to\neffectively increase the receptive field of FCN for context information\nextraction, which results in an improved FCN termed FCN+. The GRC provides\nglobal receptive field for convolution without introducing any extra learnable\nparameters. The motivation of GRC is that different channels of a convolutional\nfilter can have different grid sampling locations across the whole input\nfeature map. Specifically, the GRC first divides the channels of the filter\ninto two groups. The grid sampling locations of the first group are shifted to\ndifferent spatial coordinates across the whole feature map, according to their\nchannel indexes. This can help the convolutional filter capture the global\ncontext information. The grid sampling location of the second group remains\nunchanged to keep the original location information. Convolving using these two\ngroups, the GRC can integrate the global context into the original location\ninformation of each pixel for better dense prediction results. With the GRC\nbuilt in, FCN+ can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods\nfor semantic segmentation tasks, as verified on PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes,\nand ADE20K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 14:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

To address these\nproblems, we propose a novel structure-aware registration method by\nincorporating structural information of related organs with segmentation-guided\ndeep registration network. Existing segmentation-guided registration methods\nonly focus on volumetric registration inside the paired organ segmentations,\nignoring the inherent attributes of their anatomical structures. In addition,\nsuch paired organ segmentations are not always available in DCE-CT images due\nto the flow of contrast agents. Different from existing segmentation-guided\nregistration methods, our proposed method extracts structural information in\nhierarchical geometric perspectives of line and surface. Then, according to the\nextracted structural information, structure-aware constraints are constructed\nand imposed on the forward and backward deformation field simultaneously. In\nthis way, all available organ segmentations, including unpaired ones, can be\nfully utilized to avoid the side effect of contrast agent and preserve the\ntopology of organs during registration.

A suitable therapeutic avenue\nin these cases may involve the use of a differentiating agent (DA) to force the\ndifferentiation of the CSCs and of conventional therapies to eliminate the\nremaining differentiated cancer cells (DCCs). To describe the effects of a DA\nthat reprograms CSCs into DCCs, we adapt a differential equation model\ndeveloped to investigate tumorspheres, which are assumed to consist of jointly\nevolving CSC and DCC populations. We analyze the mathematical properties of the\nmodel, finding the equilibria and their stability. We also present numerical\nsolutions and phase diagrams to describe the system evolution and the therapy\neffects, denoting the DA strength by a parameter \\(a_{dif}\\).To obtain\nrealistic predictions, we choose the other model parameters to be those\ndetermined previously from fits to various experimental datasets. These\ndatasets characterize the progression of the tumor under various culture\nconditions. Typically, for small values of \\(a_{dif}\\) the tumor evolves\ntowards a final state that contains a CSC fraction, but a strong therapy leads\nto the suppression of this phenotype. Nonetheless, different external\nconditions lead to very diverse behaviors. For some environmental conditions,\nthe model predicts a threshold not only in the therapy strength, but also in\nits starting time, an early beginning being potentially crucial. In summary,\nour model shows how the effects of a DA depend critically not only on the\ndosage and timing of the drug application, but also on the tumor nature and its\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 14:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

Besides, the minimum cache unit is\nusually the entire VR video, which makes caching inefficient.\n  To address these challenges, we split VR videos into tile files for caching\nbased on the current popular network architecture and provide a reliable\ntransmission mechanism and an effective caching strategy. Since the number of\ndifferent tile files N is too large, the current cooperative caching algorithms\ndo not cope with such large-scale input data.

However, it has recently been shown observationally and\ntheoretically that discs are probably less viscous than previously thought.\nTherefore, in this paper, we explore the dynamics of pairs of giant planets in\nlow-viscosity discs. We performed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations\nusing the grid-based code FARGOCA. In contrast to classical viscous discs, we\nfind that the outer planet never crosses the 2:1 resonance and the pair does\nnot migrate outwards.

This enables capturing visual information at fine time\ngranularities (e.g., microseconds) in rapidly changing environments. This makes\nevent cameras highly useful for high-speed robotics tasks involving rapid\nmotion, such as high-speed perception, object tracking, and control. However,\nconvolutional neural network inference on event camera streams cannot currently\nperform real-time inference at the high speeds at which event cameras operate -\ncurrent CNN inference times are typically closer in order of magnitude to the\nframe rates of regular frame-based cameras. Real-time inference at event camera\nrates is necessary to fully leverage the high frequency and high temporal\nresolution that event cameras offer. This paper presents EvConv, a new approach\nto enable fast inference on CNNs for inputs from event cameras. We observe that\nconsecutive inputs to the CNN from an event camera have only small differences\nbetween them. Thus, we propose to perform inference on the difference between\nconsecutive input tensors, or the increment. This enables a significant\nreduction in the number of floating-point operations required (and thus the\ninference latency) because increments are very sparse. We design EvConv to\nleverage the irregular sparsity in increments from event cameras and to retain\nthe sparsity of these increments across all layers of the network. We\ndemonstrate a reduction in the number of floating operations required in the\nforward pass by up to 98%.

We consider a stochastic \\emph{SIR} model with two levels of\nmixing, accounting for a uniformly mixing general population, each individual\nbelonging also to a household and a workplace. The variance of the workplace\nsize distribution appears to be a good proxy for the impact of this\ndistribution on key outcomes of the epidemic, such as epidemic size and peak.\nIn particular, our findings suggest that strategies where the proportion of\nindividuals teleworking depends sublinearly on the size of the workplace\noutperform the strategy with linear dependence.

Here, I review the studies on time processing of the brain as\nexamples of this protocol, as well as two main application areas of\nneuroscience (neuroengineering and brain-inspired artificial intelligence).\nTime processing is an indispensable dimension of cognition; time is also an\nindispensable dimension of any real-world signal to be processed in technology.\nSo one may expect that the studies of time processing in cognition profoundly\ninfluence brain-related technology. Surprisingly, I found that the results from\ncognitive studies on timing processing are hardly helpful in solving practical\nproblems. This awkward situation may be due to the lack of generalizability of\nthe results of cognitive studies, which are under well-controlled laboratory\nconditions, to real-life situations. This lack of generalizability may be\nrooted in the fundamental unknowability of the world (including cognition).\nOverall, this paper questions and criticizes the usefulness and prospect of the\nabove-mentioned research protocol of cognitive neuroscience. I then give three\nsuggestions for future research. First, to improve the generalizability of\nresearch, it is better to study brain activity under real-life conditions\ninstead of in well-controlled laboratory experiments. Second, to overcome the\nunknowability of the world, we can engineer an easily accessible surrogate of\nthe object under investigation, so that we can predict the behavior of the\nobject by experimenting on the surrogate.

By\nextending their physical monkey algorithm for binding pose prediction, we also\ndiscover that the successful docking rate also achieves near-best performance\namong existing DL-based docking models. Thus, though their conclusions are\nright, their proof process needs more concern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 02:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}
