The way of caching\ndeep learning models in a look-up table (LUT) is recently introduced to respond\nto this demand. However, the size of a single LUT grows exponentially with the\nincrease of its indexing capacity, which restricts its receptive field and thus\nthe performance. To overcome this intrinsic limitation of the single-LUT\nsolution, we propose a universal method to construct multiple LUTs like a\nneural network, termed MuLUT. Firstly, we devise novel complementary indexing\npatterns, as well as a general implementation for arbitrary patterns, to\nconstruct multiple LUTs in parallel. Secondly, we propose a re-indexing\nmechanism to enable hierarchical indexing between cascaded LUTs. Finally, we\nintroduce channel indexing to allow cross-channel interaction, enabling LUTs to\nprocess color channels jointly. In these principled ways, the total size of\nMuLUT is linear to its indexing capacity, yielding a practical solution to\nobtain superior performance with the enlarged receptive field. We examine the\nadvantage of MuLUT on various image restoration tasks, including\nsuper-resolution, demosaicing, denoising, and deblocking. MuLUT achieves a\nsignificant improvement over the single-LUT solution, e.g., up to 1.1dB PSNR\nfor super-resolution and up to 2.8dB PSNR for grayscale denoising, while\npreserving its efficiency, which is 100$\\times$ less in energy cost compared\nwith lightweight deep neural networks. Our code and trained models are publicly\navailable at https://github.com/ddlee-cn/MuLUT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 16:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Given a minimum utility threshold,\na HUIM algorithm extracts all the high-utility itemsets (HUIs) whose utility\nvalues are not less than the threshold. This can reveal a wealth of useful\ninformation, but the precise needs of users are not well taken into account. In\nparticular, users often want to focus on patterns that have some specific items\nrather than find all patterns. To overcome that difficulty, targeted mining has\nemerged, focusing on user preferences, but only preliminary work has been\nconducted. For example, the targeted high-utility itemset querying algorithm\n(TargetUM) was proposed, which uses a lexicographic tree to query itemsets\ncontaining a target pattern. However, selecting the minimum utility threshold\nis difficult when the user is not familiar with the processed database. As a\nsolution, this paper formulates the task of targeted mining of the top-k\nhigh-utility itemsets and proposes an efficient algorithm called TMKU based on\nthe TargetUM algorithm to discover the top-k target high-utility itemsets\n(top-k THUIs).

In particular, our method is based\non the prior that for each pixel, there is a seed pixel in its close\nneighborhood sharing the same prediction with the former. Motivated by this\nprior, we design a novel two-head network, named Offset Vector Network\n(OVeNet), which generates both standard semantic predictions and a dense 2D\noffset vector field indicating the offset from each pixel to the respective\nseed pixel, which is used to compute an alternative, seed-based semantic\nprediction. The two predictions are adaptively fused at each pixel using a\nlearnt dense confidence map for the predicted offset vector field. We supervise\noffset vectors indirectly via optimizing the seed-based prediction and via a\nnovel loss on the confidence map.

As any computer program, smart contracts are subject to the\npresence of residual faults, including severe security vulnerabilities, which\nrequire that the vulnerable contract is terminated in the blockchain. In this\ncontext, research began to be developed to prevent the deployment of smart\ncontract holding vulnerabilities, mostly in the form of vulnerability detection\ntools. Along with these efforts, several and heterogeneous vulnerability\nclassification schemes arised (e.g., most notably DASP and SWC). At the time of\nwriting, these are mostly outdated initiatives, despite the fact that smart\ncontract vulnerabilities are continuously being discovered and the associated\nrich information being mostly disregarded. In this paper, we propose OpenSCV, a\nnew and Open hierarchical taxonomy for Smart Contract Vulnerabilities, which is\nopen to community contributions and matches the current state of the practice,\nwhile being prepared to handle future modifications and evolution. The taxonomy\nwas built based on the analysis of research on vulnerability classification,\ncommunity-maintained classification schemes, and research on smart contract\nvulnerability detection. We show how OpenSCV covers the announced detection\nability of current vulnerability detection tools, and highlight its usefulness\nas a resource in smart contract vulnerability research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 17:31:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 16:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

To address these limitations, this paper\nproposes a novel paradigm called Chat-Rec (ChatGPT Augmented Recommender\nSystem) that innovatively augments LLMs for building conversational recommender\nsystems by converting user profiles and historical interactions into prompts.\nChat-Rec is demonstrated to be effective in learning user preferences and\nestablishing connections between users and products through in-context\nlearning, which also makes the recommendation process more interactive and\nexplainable. What's more, within the Chat-Rec framework, user's preferences can\ntransfer to different products for cross-domain recommendations, and\nprompt-based injection of information into LLMs can also handle the cold-start\nscenarios with new items. In our experiments, Chat-Rec effectively improve the\nresults of top-k recommendations and performs better in zero-shot rating\nprediction task.

The recently proposed Structured State-Space Sequence\n(S4) model with its linear complexity offers a promising direction in this\nspace. However, we demonstrate that treating all image-tokens equally as done\nby S4 model can adversely affect its efficiency and accuracy. To address this\nlimitation, we present a novel Selective S4 (i.e., S5) model that employs a\nlightweight mask generator to adaptively select informative image tokens\nresulting in more efficient and accurate modeling of long-term spatiotemporal\ndependencies in videos. Unlike previous mask-based token reduction methods used\nin transformers, our S5 model avoids the dense self-attention calculation by\nmaking use of the guidance of the momentum-updated S4 model. This enables our\nmodel to efficiently discard less informative tokens and adapt to various\nlong-form video understanding tasks more effectively. However, as is the case\nfor most token reduction methods, the informative image tokens could be dropped\nincorrectly. To improve the robustness and the temporal horizon of our model,\nwe propose a novel long-short masked contrastive learning (LSMCL) approach that\nenables our model to predict longer temporal context using shorter input\nvideos.

In the former case, we use a duality approach and our results suggest\nthat there may be a phase transition in the dimension dependence of vanishing\nviscosity approximations in terms of the growth of the Hamiltonian and the\nlocal coupling. In the latter case, we rely on the regularity analysis of the\nsolution, and derive a faster rate compared to MFGs with a local coupling.

Yet, naively\ncombining all the source tasks with a target task does not always improve the\nprediction performance for the target task due to negative transfers. Thus, a\ncritical problem in multitask learning is identifying subsets of source tasks\nthat would benefit the target task. This problem is computationally challenging\nsince the number of subsets grows exponentially with the number of source\ntasks; efficient heuristics for subset selection does not always capture the\nrelationship between task subsets and multitask learning performances. In this\npaper, we introduce an efficient procedure to address this problem via\nsurrogate modeling. In surrogate modeling, we sample (random) subsets of source\ntasks and precompute their multitask learning performances; Then, we\napproximate the precomputed performances with a linear regression model that\ncan also be used to predict the multitask performance of unseen task subsets.\nWe show theoretically and empirically that fitting this model only requires\nsampling linearly many subsets in the number of source tasks. The fitted model\nprovides a relevance score between each source task and the target task; We use\nthe relevance scores to perform subset selection for multitask learning by\nthresholding. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach predicts\nnegative transfers from multiple source tasks to target tasks much more\naccurately than existing task affinity measures.

Thus, vector glyphs\nsynthesized by DeepVecFont still often contain some distortions and artifacts\nand cannot rival human-designed results. To address the above problems, this\npaper proposes an enhanced version of DeepVecFont mainly by making the\nfollowing three novel technical contributions. First, we adopt Transformers\ninstead of RNNs to process sequential data and design a relaxation\nrepresentation for vector outlines, markedly improving the model's capability\nand stability of synthesizing long and complex outlines. Second, we propose to\nsample auxiliary points in addition to control points to precisely align the\ngenerated and target B\\'ezier curves or lines.

There are many different types\nof waves, and it is important to quantify the wave energy density and growth\nrate for understanding what type of wave instabilities are possible in\ndifferent plasma regimes. There are many situations throughout the universe\nwhere plasmas contain a significant fraction of relativistic particles.\nTheoretical estimates for the wave energy density and growth rate are\nconstrained to either field-aligned propagation angles, or non-relativistic\nconsiderations. Based on linear theory, we derive the analytic expressions for\nthe energy density and growth rate of an arbitrary resonant wave with an\narbitrary propagation angle in relativistic plasmas. For this derivation, we\ncalculate the Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts of the relativistic-plasma\ndielectric tensor. We demonstrate that our analytic expression for the wave\nenergy density presents an explicit energy increase of resonant waves in the\nwavenumber range where the analytic expression for the growth rate is positive\n(i.e., where a wave instability is driven). For this demonstration, we\nnumerically analyse the loss-cone driven instability, as a specific example, in\nwhich the whistler-mode waves scatter relativistic electrons into the loss cone\nin the radiation belt. Our analytic results further develop the basis for\nlinear theory to better understand the wave instability, and have the potential\nto combine with quasi-linear theory, which allows to study the time evolution\nof not only the particle momentum distribution function but also resonant wave\nproperties through an instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2023 04:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Specifically, the propagation of\nperformance anomalies through interactions leads to a high number of abnormal\nmicroservices, making it difficult to identify the root performance bottlenecks\n(PBs) and formulate appropriate scaling strategies. In addition, to balance\nresource consumption and performance, the existing mainstream approaches based\non online optimization algorithms require multiple iterations, leading to\noscillation and elevating the likelihood of performance degradation.

The analysis of this tradeoff enables network operators to determine\nthe effect of performance isolation on the operating cost of each NS.\n  To study the tradeoff, we solve an optimization problem where we find the\nmultiplexing policy that requires the least provisioned resources to honor the\nService Level Agreements (SLAs) of all NSs. The SLA of each NS i states that\nits resource demand should be met for $P^H_i$ fraction of time, and for $P^L_i\n\\leq P^H_i$ fraction of time, it should be met regardless of the demands of\nother NSs.\n  For resource demands that follow ergodic Markov chains, we show that the\nwell-known Max-Weight scheduler is an optimal multiplexing policy. Since the\nMax-Weight scheduler does not require any knowledge of the statistics of the\nresource demands, we also propose its use in non-markovian settings. For\nresource demands obtained in the LTE module of ns-3, we show that the\nMax-Weight scheduler reduces the provisioned bandwidth by 36.2% when no\nperformance isolation is required. Lastly, for these non-markovian resource\ndemands, the Max-Weight scheduler maintains its optimality since it requires as\nmuch provisioned bandwidth as the best non-causal scheduler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2023 05:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

In this work, we study percolation in correlated\nsystems by proposing a framework referred to as the non-isomorphic\ndecomposition analysis. This framework analyzes the evolution of the space of\nnon-isomorphic percolation configuration classes governed by internal\ncorrelations, where a metric called as the automorphism entropy is proposed to\nmeasure the reduction of information (i.e., freedom degrees) in the space. A\nspecial case of our theory under the mean-field approximation is elaborated,\nwhere all concepts can be explicitly calculated based on group theory and\npercolation theory.

The metric of information loss degree,\nautomorphism entropy, serves as a sensitive indicator of percolation transition\nand related processes in diverse systems. Second, the information loss\nintensity depends on the strength of internal correlations.

Generally, model generalization can be\nreflected in the flatness of the loss landscape. Since averaging parameters of\nmultiple models can find flatter minima, we are inspired to extend the process\nto the sampled convex combinations of multi-student models in OKD.\nSpecifically, by linearly weighting students' parameters in each training\nbatch, we construct a Hybrid-Weight Model(HWM) to represent the parameters\nsurrounding involved students. The supervision loss of HWM can estimate the\nlandscape's curvature of the whole region around students to measure the\ngeneralization explicitly.

Pruning is to cut off some weight and\nre-distribute the remaining weight, which sacrifices the complexity of training\nat the cost of extremely high memory and training time, making the cost of\nevaluation and testing relatively low. So efficiency of training and inference\ncan't be obtained in the same time. In this work, we propose a task-oriented\nPruning-Adapter method that achieve a high memory efficiency of training and\nmemory, and speeds up training time and ensures no significant decrease in\naccuracy in GLUE tasks, achieving training and inference efficiency at the same\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2023 12:18:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 03:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

The\nground state properties are also undisturbed by the longer-range repulsive\ninteractions. In addition, inspired by recent experiments on one-dimensional\ncuprates chain $\\mathrm{Ba}_{2-x}\\mathrm{Sr}_x\\mathrm{CuO}_{3+\\delta}$, which\nimplies an effective attraction between the nearest neighbors may exist in the\ncuprates superconductors, we also show that the attractive interaction between\nthe nearest neighbors significantly enhances the superconducting correlation\nwhen it is comparable to the strength of the nearest-neighbor hopping\n$t^\\prime$. Stronger attraction drives the system into a Luther-Emery liquid\nphase. Nevertheless, with the attraction further increasing, the system enters\nan electron-hole phase separation and the superconducting correlation is\ndestroyed. Finally, we investigate the effects of on-site Coulomb interaction\non superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2023 13:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Here we develop a measurement framework to quantify\nthe interdisciplinarity of both research grants and publications and apply it\nto 350K grants from 164 funding agencies over 26 countries and 1.3M papers that\nacknowledged the support of these grants from 1985 to 2009.

Ideally, the designer should select\nonly the relevant, non-redundant features to preserve the complete information\ncontained in the original dataset, with little collinearity among features and\na smaller dimension. This procedure helps mitigate problems like overfitting\nand the curse of dimensionality, which arise when dealing with high-dimensional\nproblems. On the other hand, it is not desirable to simply discard some\nfeatures, since they may still contain information that can be exploited to\nimprove results. Instead, dimensionality reduction techniques are designed to\nlimit the number of features in a dataset by projecting them into a\nlower-dimensional space, possibly considering all the original features.\nHowever, the projected features resulting from the application of\ndimensionality reduction techniques are usually difficult to interpret.

Within the Wigner-Weisskopf\nframework for single coupling points, we obtain the time-delayed quantum master\nequations governing the evolution of the two giant atoms for three different\ncoupling configurations: separated, braided, and nested couplings. For each\ncoupling configuration, we consider both the Markovian and non-Markovian\nentanglement dynamics of the giant atoms, which are initially in two different\nseparable states: single- and double-excitation states. Our results show that\nthe generated entanglement depends on the phase shift, time delay, atomic\ninitial state, and the coupling configuration. For the single-excitation\ninitial state, there exists the steady-state entanglement for each coupling in\nboth the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes due to the appearance of the dark\nstate.

Although these two metrics are responsible\nfor different ranges of temporal consistency, existing state-of-the-art methods\ntreat them as a unified problem and use monotonous modeling structures (e.g.,\nRNN or attention-based block) to design their networks. However, using a single\nkind of modeling structure is difficult to balance the learning of short-term\nand long-term temporal correlations, and may bias the network to one of them,\nleading to undesirable predictions like global location shift, temporal\ninconsistency, and insufficient local details. To solve these problems, we\npropose to structurally decouple the modeling of long-term and short-term\ncorrelations in an end-to-end framework, Global-to-Local Transformer (GLoT).\nFirst, a global transformer is introduced with a Masked Pose and Shape\nEstimation strategy for long-term modeling. The strategy stimulates the global\ntransformer to learn more inter-frame correlations by randomly masking the\nfeatures of several frames. Second, a local transformer is responsible for\nexploiting local details on the human mesh and interacting with the global\ntransformer by leveraging cross-attention.

Crucial challenge in graph representations is\nidentifying the importance of graph edges and their influence on overall\nnetwork efficiency and information flow performance. For example, important\nedges in a transportation network are those roads that, when affected, will\nsignificantly alter the network's overall efficiency. Commonly used approach to\nfinding such important edges is ``edge betweenness centrality'' (EBC), an edge\nranking measure to determine the influential edges of the graph based on\nconnectivity and information spread. Computing the EBC utilizing the common\nBrandes algorithm involves calculating the shortest paths for every node pair,\nwhich can be computationally expensive and restrictive, especially for large\ngraphs. Changes in the graph parameters, e.g., in the edge weight or the\naddition and deletion of nodes or edges, require the recalculation of the EBC.\nAs the main contribution, we propose an approximate method to estimate the EBC\nusing a Graph Neural Network (GNN), a deep learning-based approach. We show\nthat it is computationally efficient compared to the conventional method,\nespecially for large graphs. The proposed method of GNN-based edge ranking is\nevaluated on several synthetic graphs and a real-world transportation data set.\nWe show that this framework can estimate the approximate edge ranking much\nfaster compared to the conventional method.

Numerous detection methods\nare proposed to characterize the feature uniqueness of adversarial examples, or\nto distinguish DNN's behavior activated by the adversarial examples. Detections\nbased on features cannot handle adversarial examples with large perturbations.\nBesides, they require a large amount of specific adversarial examples. Another\nmainstream, model-based detections, which characterize input properties by\nmodel behaviors, suffer from heavy computation cost. To address the issues, we\nintroduce the concept of local gradient, and reveal that adversarial examples\nhave a quite larger bound of local gradient than the benign ones. Inspired by\nthe observation, we leverage local gradient for detecting adversarial examples,\nand propose a general framework AdvCheck. Specifically, by calculating the\nlocal gradient from a few benign examples and noise-added misclassified\nexamples to train a detector, adversarial examples and even misclassified\nnatural inputs can be precisely distinguished from benign ones. Through\nextensive experiments, we have validated the AdvCheck's superior performance to\nthe state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, with detection rate ($\\sim \\times 1.2$)\non general adversarial attacks and ($\\sim \\times 1.4$) on misclassified natural\ninputs on average, with average 1/500 time cost. We also provide interpretable\nresults for successful detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 17:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

Pollution due to industrialization and urbanization has harmful\neffects on both the environment and the lives on Earth. This polluted water can\ncause food poisoning, diarrhea, short-term gastrointestinal problems,\nrespiratory diseases, skin problems, and other serious health complications. In\na developing country like Bangladesh, where ready-made garments sector is one\nof the major sources of the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP), most of the\nwastes released from the garment factories are dumped into the nearest rivers\nor canals. Hence, the quality of the water of these bodies become very\nincompatible for the living beings, and so, it has become one of the major\nthreats to the environment and human health. In addition, the amount of fish in\nthe rivers and canals in Bangladesh is decreasing day by day as a result of\nwater pollution. Therefore, to save fish and other water animals and the\nenvironment, we need to monitor the quality of the water and find out the\nreasons for the pollution. Real-time monitoring of the quality of water is\nvital for controlling water pollution. Most of the approaches for controlling\nwater pollution are mainly biological and lab-based, which takes a lot of time\nand resources. To address this issue, we developed an Internet of Things\n(IoT)-based real-time water quality monitoring system, integrated with a mobile\napplication. The proposed system in this research measures some of the most\nimportant indexes of water, including the potential of hydrogen (pH), total\ndissolved solids (TDS), and turbidity, and temperature of water. The proposed\nsystem results will be very helpful in saving the environment, and thus,\nimproving the health of living creatures on Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2023 07:17:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

The main strength of these learnt compression methods is in\npowerful nonlinear analysis and synthesis transforms that can be facilitated by\ndeep neural networks. However, out of operational expediency, most of these\nend-to-end methods adopt uniform scalar quantizers rather than vector\nquantizers, which are information-theoretically optimal. In this paper, we\npresent a novel Lattice Vector Quantization scheme coupled with a spatially\nAdaptive Companding (LVQAC) mapping. LVQ can better exploit the inter-feature\ndependencies than scalar uniform quantization while being computationally\nalmost as simple as the latter. Moreover, to improve the adaptability of LVQ to\nsource statistics, we couple a spatially adaptive companding (AC) mapping with\nLVQ. The resulting LVQAC design can be easily embedded into any end-to-end\noptimized image compression system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that for\nany end-to-end CNN image compression models, replacing uniform quantizer by\nLVQAC achieves better rate-distortion performance without significantly\nincreasing the model complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 23:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}
