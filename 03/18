Although considerable efforts of adversarial attacks on improving the\ntransferability of adversarial examples have been developed, the attack success\nrate of the transfer-based attacks on the surrogate model is much higher than\nthat on victim model under the low attack strength (e.g., the attack strength\n$\\epsilon=8/255$). In this paper, we first systematically investigated this\nissue and found that the enormous difference of attack success rates between\nthe surrogate model and victim model is caused by the existence of a special\narea (known as fuzzy domain in our paper), in which the adversarial examples in\nthe area are classified wrongly by the surrogate model while correctly by the\nvictim model. Then, to eliminate such enormous difference of attack success\nrates for improving the transferability of generated adversarial examples, a\nfuzziness-tuned method consisting of confidence scaling mechanism and\ntemperature scaling mechanism is proposed to ensure the generated adversarial\nexamples can effectively skip out of the fuzzy domain. The confidence scaling\nmechanism and the temperature scaling mechanism can collaboratively tune the\nfuzziness of the generated adversarial examples through adjusting the gradient\ndescent weight of fuzziness and stabilizing the update direction, respectively.\nSpecifically, the proposed fuzziness-tuned method can be effectively integrated\nwith existing adversarial attacks to further improve the transferability of\nadverarial examples without changing the time complexity. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrated that fuzziness-tuned method can effectively enhance the\ntransferability of adversarial examples in the latest transfer-based attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 16:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

For this purpose, a\nsimple-structure factor model is often preferred as it only requires specifying\nan additional measurement model for item-level RT while leaving the original\nitem response theory (IRT) model for responses intact. The added speed factor\nindicated by item-level RT correlates with the ability factor in the IRT model,\nallowing RT data to carry additional information about respondents' ability.\nHowever, parametric simple-structure factor models are often restrictive and\nfit poorly to empirical data, which prompts under-confidence in the suitablity\nof a simple factor structure. In the present paper, we analyze the 2015\nProgramme for International Student Assessment (PISA) mathematics data using a\nsemiparametric simple-structure model. We conclude that a simple factor\nstructure attains a decent fit after further parametric assumptions in the\nmeasurement model are sufficiently relaxed.

Previous work such as Hofmann et al (2011) has\nevaluated the most promising interleaved methods at the time, on uniform\ndistributions of queries. In the real world, ordinarily, there is an unbalanced\ndistribution of repeated queries that follows a long-tailed users' search\ndemand curve. The more a query is executed, by different users (or in different\nsessions), the higher the probability of collecting implicit feedback\n(interactions/clicks) on the related search results. This paper first aims to\nreplicate the Team Draft Interleaving accuracy evaluation on uniform query\ndistributions and then focuses on assessing how this method generalizes to\nlong-tailed real-world scenarios. The reproducibility work raised interesting\nconsiderations on how the winning ranking function for each query should impact\nthe overall winner for the entire evaluation. Based on what was observed, we\npropose that not all the queries should contribute to the final decision in\nequal proportion. As a result of these insights, we designed two variations of\nthe $\\Delta_{AB}$ score winner estimator that assign to each query a credit\nbased on statistical hypothesis testing.

We quantify this cooling delay in MESA\nC/O WD models over the mass range 0.5-1.0 $M_\\odot$, finding delays of 0.5-0.8\nGyr for typical C/O interior profiles. MESA WD cooling timescales including\nthis effect are generally comparable to other WD evolution models that make\nsimilar assumptions about input physics.

In this paper we design and experimentally validate a state-dependent\nRiccati equation (SDRE) filter for state of charge estimation in a phase change\nmaterial (PCM)-based TES device integrated into a single-phase thermal-fluid\nloop. The advantage of the SDRE filter is that it does not require\nlinearization of the nonlinear finite-volume model; instead, it uses a linear\nparameter-varying system model which can be quickly derived using graph-based\nmethods.

Using\nmeasurements from five thermocouples embedded in the PCM of the TES and two\nthermocouples measuring the fluid temperature at the inlet and outlet of the\ndevice, the state estimator uses a reduced-order finite-volume model to\ndetermine the temperature distribution inside the PCM and in turn, the state of\ncharge of the device.

While developing IRGen we tackle the key technical challenge of\nconverting an image into quite a short sequence of semantic units in order to\nenable efficient and effective retrieval. Empirical experiments demonstrate\nthat our model yields significant improvement over three commonly used\nbenchmarks, for example, 22.9\\% higher than the best baseline method in\nprecision@10 on In-shop dataset with comparable recall@10 score.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 17:07:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 02:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

The cluster can\neffectively be divided in three different environments: the cluster itself, a\ngroup environment in the periphery of the cluster (we call it the Swarm) and\nsubstructure in the cluster itself. We use these to study the dependence of\ngalaxy properties on environment. Aims: We have explored the relationship\nbetween HI deficiency, HI morphology, and star formation deficiency for the\ngalaxies in and around the A2626 galaxy cluster to investigate the\nenvironmental effects on those properties. Methods: To quantify asymmetries of\nthe outer HI disc of a galaxy, we used 1) three visual classes based on the\noutermost reliable HI contour (settled, disturbed, unsettled HI discs), 2) the\noffset between the HI centre and the optical centre of a galaxy, and 3) the\nmodified asymmetry parameter Amod as defined by Lelli et al. (2014). Results:\nThe HI deficiency of a galaxy is strongly correlated with the projected\ndistance from the centre of A2626. Furthermore, substructure galaxies tend to\nbe more asymmetric than the isolated galaxies in A2626, plausibly because of\nmore efficient tidal interactions within substructures than outside\nsubstructures. Moreover, asymmetric, offset, and smaller HI discs are not\nnecessarily the result of the cluster environment, as they are also observed in\nsubstructures in A2626 and in the Swarm. This signifies that \"pre-processing\"\nof the HI discs of galaxies in groups or substructures plays an important role,\ntogether with the \"processing\" in the cluster environment. Finally, the\ngalaxies in all three environments have slightly lower star-formation rates\n(SFRs) than the typical SFR for normal galaxies as manifested by their offset\nfrom the star formation main sequence, implying effective gas removal\nmechanisms in all three environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 17:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

As a solution, we propose a new general\nmethod that dynamically adjusts the update to data (UTD) ratio during training\nbased on under- and overfitting detection on a small subset of the continuously\ncollected experience not used for training. We apply our method to DreamerV2, a\nstate-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, and evaluate it\non the DeepMind Control Suite and the Atari $100$k benchmark. The results\ndemonstrate that one can better balance under- and overestimation by adjusting\nthe UTD ratio with our approach compared to the default setting in DreamerV2\nand that it is competitive with an extensive hyperparameter search which is not\nfeasible for many applications. Our method eliminates the need to set the UTD\nhyperparameter by hand and even leads to a higher robustness with regard to\nother learning-related hyperparameters further reducing the amount of necessary\ntuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 17:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

An LSM harbours a quadratic band-crossing point (QBCP) in its\nbandstructure, where the upper and lower branches of dispersion are doubly\ndegenrate. While a nonzero temperature ($T$) can excite particle-hole pairs\nabout the Fermi level due to thermal effects (even at zero doping), a finite\ndoping ($\\mu$) sets the Fermi level away from the QBCP at any $T$, leading to a\nfinite Fermi surface (rather than a Fermi point). Both these conditions\nnaturally give rise to a finite density of states. A nonzero value of $T$ or\n$\\mu$ is thus a necessary condition for a plasmon to exist, as otherwise the\nzero density of states at the QBCP can never lead to the appearance of this\ncollective mode. In addition to $T$ and $\\mu$, we consider the effects of all\npossible parameters like cubic anisotropy, band-mass asymmetry, and a\nmaterial-dependent parameter $X$, to numerically compute the quasiparticle\ndamping rate $\\tau$ resulting from screened Coulomb interactions. A\nwell-defined sharp peak in the profile of the inelastic scattering rate\n$\\tau^{-1}$ signals the appearance of a plasmon.

It is particularly\nrelevant to quantum state synthesis, where an initial direct-product state is\nsought to be converted into a highly entangled target state. In devices based\non pairwise exchange interactions, such a process can be carried out and\noptimized in various ways. As a benchmark problem, we consider the task of\nspreading one excitation among $N$ two-level atoms or qubits. Starting from an\ninitial state where one qubit is excited, we seek a target state where all\nqubits have the same excitation-amplitude -- a generalized-W state. This target\nis to be reached by suitably chosen pairwise exchange interactions. For\nexample, we may have a a setup where any pair of qubits can be brought into\nproximity for a controllable period of time. We describe three protocols that\naccomplish this task, each with $N-1$ tightly-constrained steps. In the first,\none atom acts as a flying qubit that sequentially interacts with all others. In\nthe second, qubits interact pairwise in sequential order. In these two cases,\nthe required interaction times follow a pattern with an elegant geometric\ninterpretation. They correspond to angles within the spiral of Theodorus -- a\nconstruction known for more than two millennia.

Deep learning (DL) has recently demonstrated the\nability to generate accurate sCT from fixed MRI acquisitions. However, MRI\nprotocols may change over time or differ between centres resulting in\nlow-quality sCT due to poor model generalisation. Purpose: investigating domain\nrandomisation (DR) to increase the generalisation of a DL model for brain sCT\ngeneration. Methods: CT and corresponding T1-weighted MRI with/without\ncontrast, T2-weighted, and FLAIR MRI from 95 patients undergoing RT were\ncollected, considering FLAIR the unseen sequence where to investigate\ngeneralisation. A ``Baseline'' generative adversarial network was trained\nwith/without the FLAIR sequence to test how a model performs without DR. Image\nsimilarity and accuracy of sCT-based dose plans were assessed against CT to\nselect the best-performing DR approach against the Baseline. Results: The\nBaseline model had the poorest performance on FLAIR, with mean absolute error\n(MAE)=106$\\pm$20.7 HU (mean$\\pm\\sigma$). Performance on FLAIR significantly\nimproved for the DR model with MAE=99.0$\\pm$14.9 HU, but still inferior to the\nperformance of the Baseline+FLAIR model (MAE=72.6$\\pm$10.1 HU). Similarly, an\nimprovement in $\\gamma$-pass rate was obtained for DR vs Baseline. Conclusions:\nDR improved image similarity and dose accuracy on the unseen sequence compared\nto training only on acquired MRI.

Load shifting is needed to mitigate space-time fluctuations\nassociated with wind/solar power and other disruptions (e.g., extreme weather).\nThe impact of load shifting on electricity markets is typically quantified via\nsensitivity analysis, which aims to assess impacts in terms of price volatility\nand total welfare. This sensitivity approach does not explicitly quantify\noperational flexibility (e.g., range or probability of feasible operation). In\nthis work, we present a computational framework to enable this; specifically,\nwe quantify operational flexibility by assessing how much uncertainty in net\nloads (which capture uncertain power injections/withdrawals) can be tolerated\nby the system under varying levels of load shifting capacity. The proposed\nframework combines optimization formulations that quantify operational\nflexibility with power grid models that capture load shifting in the form of\nvirtual links (pathways that transfer load across space-time). Our case studies\nreveal that adding a single virtual link that shifts load in either space or\ntime can lead to dramatic improvements in system-wide flexibility; this is\nbecause shifting relieves space-time congestion that results from transmission\nconstraints and generator ramping constraints. Our results provide insights\ninto how the incorporation of flexible technologies can lead to non-intuitive,\nsystem-wide gains in flexibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 19:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Methods: In\nthis study, we propose the CerviFormer -- a model that depends on the\nTransformers and thereby requires minimal architectural assumptions about the\nsize of the input data. The model uses a cross-attention technique to\nrepeatedly consolidate the input data into a compact latent Transformer module,\nwhich enables it to manage very large-scale inputs.

The collective magnetic excitations in such a state are so-called spin\nexcitons that describe the CEF transitions propagating through the lattice. In\nmost cases, spin excitons originating from CEF levels of a localized single ion\nare dispersion-less in momentum (reciprocal) space and well-defined in both the\nmagnetically ordered and paramagnetic states. Here we use thermodynamic and\nneutron scattering experiments to study stoichiometric Ni2Mo3O8 without site\ndisorder, where Ni2+ ions form a bipartite honeycomb lattice comprised of two\ntriangular lattices, with ions subject to the tetrahedral and octahedral\ncrystalline environment, respectively. We find that in both types of ions, the\nCEF excitations have nonmagnetic singlet ground states, yet the material has\nlong-range magnetic order. Furthermore, CEF spin excitons from the\ntriangular-lattice arrangement of tetrahedral sites form, in both the\nantiferromagnetic and paramagnetic states, a dispersive diffusive pattern\naround the Brillouin zone boundary in reciprocal space. The present work thus\ndemonstrates that spin excitons in an ideal triangular lattice magnet can have\ndispersive excitations, irrespective of the existence of static magnetic order,\nand this phenomenon is most likely due to spin entanglement and geometric\nfrustrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 20:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

Data were prepared into daily records containing the number of new COVID\ncase counts, patient demographic data, outdoor weather variables, indoor\nenvironment factors, and human movement based on cell mobility and public\nhealth restrictions. This data was analyzed to determine the most important\nvariables and their interactions. Predictive models were developed using CNN\nand LSTM deep neural network approaches. A 5-fold chronological\ncross-validation approach used these methods to develop predictive models using\ndata from Mar 1 to Oct 14 2020, and test them on data covering Oct 15 to Dec 24\n2020. Results: The best LSTM models forecasted tomorrow's daily COVID case\ncounts with 90.7% accuracy, and the 7-day rolling average COVID case counts\nwith 98.1% accuracy using independent test data.

However these methods are specific and limited to certain network\narchitectures, and they can not be transferred to other models or tasks.\nTherefore, we propose an abstract and universal edge supervision method called\nEdge-aware Plug-and-play Scheme (EPS), which can be easily and quickly applied\nto any semantic segmentation models. The core is edge-width/thickness\npreserving guided for semantic segmentation. The EPS first extracts the Edge\nGround Truth (Edge GT) with a predefined edge thickness from the training data;\nand then for any network architecture, it directly copies the decoder head for\nthe auxiliary task with the Edge GT supervision. To ensure the edge thickness\npreserving consistantly, we design a new boundarybased loss, called Polar\nHausdorff (PH) Loss, for the auxiliary supervision. We verify the effectiveness\nof our EPS on the Cityscapes dataset using 22 models. The experimental results\nindicate that the proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into any\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models with zero modification, resulting in promising\nenhancement of the segmentation performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 02:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

The incompressible N-S equation with high Reynolds number is stabilized\nusing the idea of the VMS stabilization. To model the multiphase materials, a\nmodified level set method is used to track the development of interfaces\nbetween different phases of materials. The interaction between the materials\nand the rigid body structure is realized using the Lagrangian multiplier\nmethod. The mesh of the rigid body structure domain is incompatible with the\nEulerian fixed mesh for material domains. A cutting finite element scheme is\nused to satisfy the coupling condition between the rigid body structure\nboundary and the deformeable multiphase materials. A novel algorithm is\nproposed to track the stress history of the material point in the Eulerian\nfixed-mesh framework such that the stress-history-dependent fluid or solid\nmaterials (e.g. as soil) are also analysable using fixed-mesh. The non-local\nstress theory is used. To consider the stress-history-dependent material in the\nEulerian fixed mesh, in the step of calculating the non-local\nrelative-distance-based averaging treatment, the field point location is based\non the updated material point position,rather than the spatial field point\nlocation. Thus, the convective effect of the previous stress history and the\ncalculation of the non-local stress fields are realized in one shot. Thus, the\nproposed novel VMS-FEM can solve almost any history-dependent materials (fluid\nor solid) in the Eulerian framework (fixed mesh), where the distorted mesh\nproblem is not existent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 02:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Cross-domain classification\nframeworks were developed to handle this data domain shift problem by utilizing\nunsupervised image-to-image (UI2I) translation models to translate an input\nimage from the unlabeled domain to the labeled domain.

Fear speech, as the name suggests, attempts to incite fear\nabout a target community. Although subtle, it might be highly effective, often\npushing communities toward a physical conflict. Therefore, understanding their\nprevalence in social media is of paramount importance. This article presents a\nlarge-scale study to understand the prevalence of 400K fear speech and over\n700K hate speech posts collected from Gab.com. Remarkably, users posting a\nlarge number of fear speech accrue more followers and occupy more central\npositions in social networks than users posting a large number of hate speech.\nThey can also reach out to benign users more effectively than hate speech users\nthrough replies, reposts, and mentions. This connects to the fact that, unlike\nhate speech, fear speech has almost zero toxic content, making it look\nplausible. Moreover, while fear speech topics mostly portray a community as a\nperpetrator using a (fake) chain of argumentation, hate speech topics hurl\ndirect multitarget insults, thus pointing to why general users could be more\ngullible to fear speech. Our findings transcend even to other platforms\n(Twitter and Facebook) and thus necessitate using sophisticated moderation\npolicies and mass awareness to combat fear speech.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 02:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

The crux behind is that the weight\nof the classifier (used to compute CAM) captures only the discriminative\nfeatures of objects. We tackle this by introducing a new computation method for\nCAM that explicitly captures non-discriminative features as well, thereby\nexpanding CAM to cover whole objects. Specifically, we omit the last pooling\nlayer of the classification model, and perform clustering on all local features\nof an object class, where \"local\" means \"at a spatial pixel position\". We call\nthe resultant K cluster centers local prototypes - represent local semantics\nlike the \"head\", \"leg\", and \"body\" of \"sheep\". Given a new image of the class,\nwe compare its unpooled features to every prototype, derive K similarity\nmatrices, and then aggregate them into a heatmap (i.e., our CAM). Our CAM thus\ncaptures all local features of the class without discrimination.

For\ngalaxies selected by $g-r$ color, we find a large assembly bias consistent with\nthe analysis of Barreira et al. (2020) based on hydro-dynamical simulations of\ngalaxy formation. This effect arises from the fact that a larger value of the\nnormalization amplitude $\\sigma_8$ implies a faster mass assembly (at fixed\nhalo mass) and, therefore, older and redder galaxies. On the contrary, for\ngalaxies selected by their H$\\alpha$ luminosity, we do not detect a significant\nassembly bias, at least at $z=1$ and in the halo mass range $3\\times10^{10} < M\n< 10^{12}\\ M_\\odot$ considered here.

To\nachieve locale-aware and robust prediction, this problem can be decomposed into\nthree sub-tasks: depth-based image warping, panorama inpainting and\nhigh-dynamic-range (HDR) reconstruction, among which the success of panorama\ninpainting plays a key role. Recent methods mostly rely on convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) to fill the missing contents in the warped panorama. However,\nthey usually achieve suboptimal performance since the missing contents occupy a\nvery large portion in the panoramic space while CNNs are plagued by limited\nreceptive fields. The spatially-varying distortion in the spherical signals\nfurther increases the difficulty for conventional CNNs. To address these\nissues, we propose a local-to-global strategy for large-scale panorama\ninpainting. In our method, a depth-guided local inpainting is first applied on\nthe warped panorama to fill small but dense holes. Then, a transformer-based\nnetwork, dubbed PanoTransformer, is designed to hallucinate reasonable global\nstructures in the large holes. To avoid distortion, we further employ cubemap\nprojection in our design of PanoTransformer. The high-quality panorama\nrecovered at any locale helps us to capture spatially-varying indoor\nillumination with physically-plausible global structures and fine details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 06:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

If not dealt with appropriately, it significantly hurts\nthe performance of GNNs in minority classes. Due to its practical importance,\nthere have been a series of recent research devoted to this challenge. Existing\nover-sampling techniques smooth the label distribution by generating ``fake''\nminority nodes and synthesizing their features and local topology, which\nlargely ignore the rich information of unlabeled nodes on graphs. In this\npaper, we propose UNREAL, an iterative over-sampling method. The first key\ndifference is that we only add unlabeled nodes instead of synthetic nodes,\nwhich eliminates the challenge of feature and neighborhood generation. To\nselect which unlabeled nodes to add, we propose geometric ranking to rank\nunlabeled nodes. Geometric ranking exploits unsupervised learning in the node\nembedding space to effectively calibrates pseudo-label assignment. Finally, we\nidentify the issue of geometric imbalance in the embedding space and provide a\nsimple metric to filter out geometrically imbalanced nodes.

It has attracted a growing interest in\nrecent years due to its advantages in terms of privacy considerations, and\ncommunication resources. In FL, selected clients train their local models and\nsend a function of the models to the server, which consumes a random processing\nand transmission time. The server updates the global model and broadcasts it\nback to the clients. The client selection problem in FL is to schedule a subset\nof the clients for training and transmission at each given time so as to\noptimize the learning performance.

In urban environment,\nocclusion often arises due to other vehicles obscuring the perception of the\nego vehicle. Since the occlusion condition can impact the trajectories of\nvehicles, the behavior of other vehicles is helpful in making inferences about\nthe occlusion as a remedy for perceptual deficiencies. This paper introduces a\nnovel social occlusion inference approach that learns a mapping from agent\ntrajectories and scene context to an occupancy grid map (OGM) representing the\nview of ego vehicle. Specially, vectorized features are encoded through the\npolyline encoder to aggregate features of vectors into features of polylines. A\ntransformer module is then utilized to model the high-order interactions of\npolylines. Importantly, occlusion queries are proposed to fuse polyline\nfeatures and generate the OGM without the input of visual modality. To verify\nthe performance of vectorized representation, we design a baseline based on a\nfully transformer encoder-decoder architecture mapping the OGM with occlusion\nand historical trajectories information to the ground truth OGM.

FedRight outperforms\nprevious works in four key aspects: (i) Validity: it extracts model features to\ngenerate transferable fingerprints to train a detector to verify the copyright\nof the model. (ii) Fidelity: it is with imperceptible impact on the federated\ntraining, thus promising good main task performance. (iii) Robustness: it is\nempirically robust against malicious attacks on copyright protection, i.e.,\nfine-tuning, model pruning, and adaptive attacks. (iv) Black-box: it is valid\nin the black-box forensic scenario where only application programming interface\ncalls to the model are available. Extensive evaluations across 3 datasets and 9\nmodel structures demonstrate FedRight's superior fidelity, validity, and\nrobustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 11:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Therefore, many\nmethods have been introduced for this task based on deep learning. Among these\napproaches, the methods based on ROIs are in a good position in terms of\naccuracy and complexity. In these techniques, some specific parts of the brain\nare extracted as ROI manually for all of the patients. Extracting ROI manually\nis time-consuming and its results depend on human expertness and precision.\nMethod To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel smart method for\ndetecting ROIs automatically based on Explainable AI using Grad-Cam and a 3DCNN\nmodel that extracts ROIs per patient. After extracting the ROIs automatically,\nAlzheimer's disease is predicted using extracted ROI-based 3D CNN. Results We\nimplement our method on 176 MCI patients of the famous ADNI dataset and obtain\nremarkable results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

To this end, we consider a\n``demonstration case'' which is one of the simplest scenarios encountered in\nthis line of research: repeated flips of a biased coin with probability of\nheads~$p$, and even-money payoff on each flip. First, we formulate a new robust\nnonlinear control problem which we believe is both simple to understand and\napropos for dealing with concerns about distributional robustness; i.e.,\ninstead of assuming that~$p$ is perfectly known as in the case of the classical\nKelly formulation, we begin with a bounding set ~${\\cal P} \\subseteq [0,1]$ for\nthis probability. Then, we provide a theorem, our main result, which gives a\nclosed-form description of the optimal robust nonlinear controller and a\ncorollary which establishes that it robustly outperforms linear controllers\nsuch as those found in the literature. A second, less significant, contribution\nof this paper bears upon the computability of our solution. For an $n$-flip\ngame, whereas an admissible controller has~$2^n-1$ parameters, at the optimum\nonly~$O(n^2)$ of them turn out to be distinct. Finally, it is noted that the\ninitial assumptions on payoffs and the use of the uniform distribution on~$p$\nare made solely for simplicity of the exposition and compliance with length\nrequirements for a Letter. Accordingly, the paper also includes a new section\nwith a discussion indicating how these assumptions can be relaxed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 13:42:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 10:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

Many real-world data mining tasks, however, lack sufficient\nvariables for relation reasoning, and therefore these methods may not properly\nhandle such forecasting problems.

Unlike previous methods, FD-Net enforces the\nforward-distortions of the correct image in both PE directions to be consistent\nwith the acquired reversed-PE image pair. FD-Net further leverages a\nmultiresolution architecture to maintain high local and global performance.\nFD-Net performs competitively with a gold-standard reference method (TOPUP) in\nimage quality, while enabling a leap in computational efficiency. Furthermore,\nFD-Net outperforms recent unwarping-based methods for unsupervised correction\nin terms of both image and field quality. The unsupervised FD-Net method\nintroduces a deep forward-distortion approach to enable fast, high-fidelity\ncorrection of susceptibility artifacts in EPI by maintaining consistency to\nmeasured data. Therefore, it holds great promise for improving the anatomical\naccuracy of EPI imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 15:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Existing studies primarily focus\non connecting visual affordances with geometry structures, e.g. relying on\nannotations to declare interactive regions of interest on the object and\nestablishing a mapping between the regions and affordances. However, the\nessence of learning object affordance is to understand how to use it, and the\nmanner that detaches interactions is limited in generalization. Normally,\nhumans possess the ability to perceive object affordances in the physical world\nthrough demonstration images or videos. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel\ntask setting: grounding 3D object affordance from 2D interactions in images,\nwhich faces the challenge of anticipating affordance through interactions of\ndifferent sources. To address this problem, we devise a novel\nInteraction-driven 3D Affordance Grounding Network (IAG), which aligns the\nregion feature of objects from different sources and models the interactive\ncontexts for 3D object affordance grounding.

Recent works apply visual\ntransformer to WSOL and achieve significant success by exploiting the\nlong-range feature dependency in self-attention mechanism. However, existing\ntransformer-based methods synthesize the classification feature maps as the\nlocalization map, which leads to optimization conflicts between classification\nand localization tasks. To address this problem, we propose to learn a\ntask-specific spatial-aware token (SAT) to condition localization in a weakly\nsupervised manner. Specifically, a spatial token is first introduced in the\ninput space to aggregate representations for localization task. Then a spatial\naware attention module is constructed, which allows spatial token to generate\nforeground probabilities of different patches by querying and to extract\nlocalization knowledge from the classification task. Besides, for the problem\nof sparse and unbalanced pixel-level supervision obtained from the image-level\nlabel, two spatial constraints, including batch area loss and normalization\nloss, are designed to compensate and enhance this supervision.

By making the rendering process\ndifferentiable, one can compute gradients of the output image with respect to\nthe different scene parameters efficiently using automatic differentiation.\nInterested in the potential of such methods for the analysis of fluorescence\nmicroscopy images, we introduce deltaMic, a microscopy renderer that can\ngenerate a 3D fluorescence microscopy image from a 3D scene in a fully\ndifferentiable manner. By convolving the meshes in the scene with the point\nspread function (PSF) of the microscope, that characterizes the response of its\nimaging system to a point source, we emulate the 3D image creation process of\nfluorescence microscopy. This is achieved by computing the Fourier transform\n(FT) of the mesh and performing the convolution in the Fourier domain. Naive\nimplementation of such mesh FT is however slow, inefficient, and sensitive to\nnumerical precision. We solve these difficulties by providing a memory and\ncomputationally efficient fully differentiable GPU implementation of the 3D\nmesh FT.

Extending on two existing classifiers, we developed an XAI system\nthat produces text and region based explanations that are easily interpretable\nby dermatologists alongside its differential diagnoses of melanomas and nevi.\nTo evaluate this system, we conducted a three-part reader study to assess its\nimpact on clinicians' diagnostic accuracy, confidence, and trust in the\nXAI-support. We showed that our XAI's explanations were highly aligned with\nclinicians' explanations and that both the clinicians' trust in the support\nsystem and their confidence in their diagnoses were significantly increased\nwhen using our XAI compared to using a conventional AI system. The clinicians'\ndiagnostic accuracy was numerically, albeit not significantly, increased. This\nwork demonstrates that clinicians are willing to adopt such an XAI system,\nmotivating their future use in the clinic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 17:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

GBO uses many granular-balls to cover the\nsolution space. Quite a lot of small and fine-grained granular-balls are used\nto depict the important parts, and a little number of large and coarse-grained\ngranular-balls are used to depict the inessential parts. Fine multi-granularity\ndata description ability results in a higher global search capability and\nfaster convergence speed. In comparison with the most popular and\nstate-of-the-art algorithms, the experiments on twenty benchmark functions\ndemonstrate its better performance. The faster speed, higher approximation\nability of optimal solution, no hyper-parameters, and simpler design of GBO\nmake it an all-around replacement of most of the existing popular intelligent\noptimization algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 13:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

This is precisely the inadequacy of rigorous\nmathematical models in describing the laws of nature. We propose a\ncomputational model to describe and understand the laws of nature based on\nDarwin's natural selection. In fact, whether it's a macro particle, a micro\nelectron or a security, they can all be considered as an entity, the change of\nthis entity over time can be described by a data series composed of states and\nvalues.
