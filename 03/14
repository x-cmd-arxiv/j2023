These models aim to bridge the gap between text and visual\ninformation, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of multimedia data.\nHowever, as these models become larger and more complex, they also become more\nchallenging to train and deploy. One approach to addressing this challenge is\nthe use of sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) techniques, which divide the\nmodel into smaller, specialized sub-models that can jointly solve a task. In\nthis paper, we explore the effectiveness of MoE in scaling vision-language\nmodels, demonstrating its potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance on\na range of benchmarks over dense models of equivalent computational cost. Our\nresearch offers valuable insights into stabilizing the training of MoE models,\nunderstanding the impact of MoE on model interpretability, and balancing the\ntrade-offs between compute performance when scaling VLMs. We hope our work will\ninspire further research into the use of MoE for scaling large-scale\nvision-language models and other multimodal machine learning applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 16:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

The basic algorithmic question\nconcerning squares is to check if a given string of length $n$ is square-free,\nthat is, does not contain a fragment of such form. Main and Lorentz [J.\nAlgorithms 1984] designed an $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$ time algorithm for this\nproblem, and proved a matching lower bound assuming the so-called general\nalphabet, meaning that the algorithm is only allowed to check if two characters\nare equal. However, their lower bound also assumes that there are $\\Omega(n)$\ndistinct symbols in the string. As an open question, they asked if there is a\nfaster algorithm if one restricts the size of the alphabet. Crochemore [Theor.\nComput. Sci. 1986] designed a linear-time algorithm for constant-size\nalphabets, and combined with more recent results his approach in fact implies\nsuch an algorithm for linearly-sortable alphabets. Very recently, Ellert and\nFischer [ICALP 2021] significantly relaxed this assumption by designing a\nlinear-time algorithm for general ordered alphabets, that is, assuming a linear\norder on the characters that permits constant time order comparisons. However,\nthe open question of Main and Lorentz from 1984 remained unresolved for general\n(unordered) alphabets. In this paper, we show that testing square-freeness of a\nlength-$n$ string over general alphabet of size $\\sigma$ can be done with\n$\\mathcal{O}(n\\log \\sigma)$ comparisons, and cannot be done with $o(n\\log\n\\sigma)$ comparisons. We complement this result with an $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log\n\\sigma)$ time algorithm in the Word RAM model. Finally, we extend the algorithm\nto reporting all the runs (maximal repetitions) in the same complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 16:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Our mapping of what prevents\nworkers from meaningfully consenting to workplace wellbeing technologies\n(challenges) and what they require to do so (interventions) illustrates how the\nlack of meaningful consent is a structural problem requiring socio-technical\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 16:15:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 22:39:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 14:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Our work analyzes the effects of\nmeasurement uncertainty on the performance of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nbased waypoint navigation and obstacle avoidance for UAVs. Measurement\nuncertainty originates from noise in the sensors used for localization and\ndetecting obstacles. Measurement uncertainty/noise is considered to follow a\nGaussian probability distribution with unknown non-zero mean and variance. We\nevaluate the performance of a DRL agent trained using the Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) algorithm in an environment with continuous state and action\nspaces. The environment is randomized with different numbers of obstacles for\neach simulation episode in the presence of varying degrees of noise, to capture\nthe effects of realistic sensor measurements. Denoising techniques like the low\npass filter and Kalman filter improve performance in the presence of unbiased\nnoise. Moreover, we show that artificially injecting noise into the\nmeasurements during evaluation actually improves performance in certain\nscenarios. Extensive training and testing of the DRL agent under various UAV\nnavigation scenarios are performed in the PyBullet physics simulator. To\nevaluate the practical validity of our method, we port the policy trained in\nsimulation onto a real UAV without any further modifications and verify the\nresults in a real-world environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 16:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

The results of\nthe analysis revealed that there were varying degrees of correlation between\nthe stock prices of the holding companies and their subsidiaries. The strongest\npositive correlation was observed between BHIT and BMTR, while the weakest\ncorrelations were found between BHIT and IPTV, and BHIT and MSIN.

This price is encapsulated in the Hellinger\nintegral between the joint and the product of the marginals, which is then\nupper bounded leveraging tensorisation properties. Our bounds represent a\nnatural generalisation of concentration inequalities in the presence of\ndependence: we recover exactly the classical bounds (McDiarmid's inequality)\nwhen the random variables are independent. Furthermore, in a ``large\ndeviations'' regime, we obtain the same decay in the probability as for the\nindependent case, even when the random variables display non-trivial\ndependencies. To show this, we consider a number of applications of interest.\nFirst, we provide a bound for Markov chains with finite state space.

It is difficult for the UVLC channel to be sparse\nrepresented in the time and frequency domains, which limits the chance of using\nsparse signal processing techniques to achieve better performance of channel\nestimation. To this end, a compressed sensing (CS) based framework is\nestablished in this paper by fully exploiting the sparsity of the underwater\nvisible light channel in the distance domain of the propagation links. In order\nto solve the sparse recovery problem and achieve more accurate UVLC channel\nestimation, a sparse learning based underwater visible light channel estimation\n(SL-UVCE) scheme is proposed. Specifically, a deep-unfolding neural network\nmimicking the classical iterative sparse recovery algorithm of approximate\nmessage passing (AMP) is employed, which decomposes the iterations of AMP into\na series of layers with different learnable parameters. Compared with the\nexisting non-CS-based and CS-based schemes, the proposed scheme shows better\nperformance of accuracy in channel estimation, especially in severe conditions\nsuch as insufficient measurement pilots and large number of multipath\ncomponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 16:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

As a result,\nthese subsidies negatively affect alternative terrestrial prey by enhancing\npredator density. However, these aquatic insects can also transport\ncontamination to the terrestrial community that is primarily produced in\naquatic ecosystems. Which can reduce insectivore abundance and biomass, lower\ninsectivore reproductive success, and increase predation pressure on\nalternative prey with consequences for aquatic and terrestrial food webs.\nMotivated by this, here we consider a prey-predator model where the predator\nconsumes contaminated and uncontaminated prey together. We find that, at a high\nlevel of contamination, the vulnerability of contaminated prey and predator is\ndetermined by predation preference. More specifically, a very low predation\npreference towards contaminated prey ensures predator persistence, whereas a\nlow, high preference excludes the predator from the system. Interestingly,\neither contaminated prey or the predator exist at intermediate predation\npreference due to bi-stability. Furthermore, when there is no contamination in\none of the prey, the other prey can not coexist due to apparent competition for\na specific range of predation preferences. However, when sufficient\ncontamination exists in one prey, alternative uncontaminated prey coexists.\nWith this, contamination also stabilizes and destabilizes the three species\ndynamics. Our result also indicates that if the intensity of the contamination\nin predator reproduction is low, then contaminated prey is more susceptible to\nthe contamination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 16:24:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 12:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

From the balance law associated\nwith some of these symmetries, I will discuss generalizations of Wald's Noether\nentropy formula and general entropy balance laws on null hypersurfaces based on\nthe null energy conditions, interpreted as an entropy creation term. The\nentropy is generally the so-called improved Noether charge, a quantity that has\nrecently been investigated by many authors, associated to null future-pointing\ndiffeomorphisms. These local and dynamical definitions of entropy on the black\nhole horizon differ from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy through terms\nproportional to the first derivative of the area along the null geodesics. Two\ndifferent definitions of the dynamical entropy are identified, deduced from\ngravity symplectic potentials providing a suitable notion of gravitational flux\nwhich vanish on non-expanding horizons. The first one is proposed as a\ndefinition of the entropy for dynamical black holes by Wald and Zhang, and it\nsatisfies the physical process first law locally. The second one vanishes on\nany cross section of Minkowski's light cone. I study general properties of its\nbalance law. In particular, I look at first order perturbations around a non\nexpanding horizon. Furthermore, I show that the dynamical entropy increases on\nthe event horizon formed by a spherical symmetric collapse between the two\nstationary states of vanishing flux, i.e the initial flat light cone and the\nfinal stationary black hole. I compare this process to a phase transition, in\nwhich the symmetry group of the stationary black hole phase is enlarged by the\nsupertranslations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 16:42:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 18:11:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 09:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Finding diverse solutions is important in settings where the user is\nnot able to specify all criteria of the desired solution. Motivated by an\napplication in the field of system identification, we initiate the algorithmic\nstudy of $k$-DIVERSE MINIMUM $s$-$t$ CUTS which, given a directed graph $G =\n(V, E)$, two specified vertices $s,t \\in V$, and an integer $k > 0$, asks for a\ncollection of $k$ minimum $s$-$t$ cuts in $G$ that has maximum diversity. We\ninvestigate the complexity of the problem for two diversity measures for a\ncollection of cuts: (i) the sum of all pairwise Hamming distances, and (ii) the\ncardinality of the union of cuts in the collection. We prove that $k$-DIVERSE\nMINIMUM $s$-$t$ CUTS can be solved in strongly polynomial time for both\ndiversity measures via submodular function minimization. We obtain this result\nby establishing a connection between ordered collections of minimum $s$-$t$\ncuts and the theory of distributive lattices. When restricted to finding only\ncollections of mutually disjoint solutions, we provide a more practical\nalgorithm that finds a maximum set of pairwise disjoint minimum $s$-$t$ cuts.\nFor graphs with small minimum $s$-$t$ cut, it runs in the time of a single\nmax-flow computation. These results stand in contrast to the problem of finding\n$k$ diverse global minimum cuts -- which is known to be NP-hard even for the\ndisjoint case (Hanaka et al., 2022) -- and partially answer a long-standing\nopen question of Wagner (Networks 1990) about improving the complexity of\nfinding disjoint collections of minimum $s$-$t$ cuts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 17:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

However,\nquantifying the evolution of this dust component in young stellar clusters is\ndifficult due to the inherent large spread in stellar masses and formation\ntimes. Therefore, we aim to model the collective evolution of a cluster to\ninvestigate the effectiveness of radial drift in clearing the discs of mm-sized\nparticles. We use a protoplanetary disc model that numerically solves for disc\nformation, and the viscous evolution and photoevaporative clearing of the gas\ncomponent, while also including the drift of particles limited in size by\nfragmentation. We find that discs are born with dust masses between 50 Earth\nmasses and 1000 Earth masses, for stars with, respectively, masses between 0.1\nsolar masses and 1 solar masses. The majority of this initial dust reservoir is\ntypically lost through drift before photoevaporation opens a gap in the gas\ndisc for models both with and without strong X-ray-driven mass loss rates.

The general objective is to find a path plan to a\ngoal region that requires minimal sensing effort. In [1], the\ninformation-geometric RRT* (IG-RRT*) algorithm was proposed to efficiently find\nsuch a path. However, like any stochastic sampling-based planner, the\ncomputational complexity of IG-RRT* grows quickly, impeding its use with a\nlarge number of nodes. To remedy this limitation, we suggest running IG-RRT*\nwith a moderate number of nodes, and then using a smoothing algorithm to adjust\nthe path obtained. To develop a smoothing algorithm, we explicitly formulate\nthe minimum sensing path planning problem as an optimization problem. For this\nformulation, we introduce a new safety constraint to impose a bound on the\nprobability of collision with obstacles in continuous-time, in contrast to the\ncommon discrete-time approach. The problem is amenable to solution via the\nconvex-concave procedure (CCP). We develop a CCP algorithm for the formulated\noptimization and use this algorithm for path smoothing.

In our work,\nwe explore the various domain patterns of such fractionalized quasiparticles,\nespecially focusing on charge defects in U(1) quantum spin liquids. We claim\nthat emergent long range interaction between charge defects leads to\ncharacteristic structures with distinct length scales, where they can be\ncontrolled via the ratio of interaction strengths. In this context, the spin\nice phase is the dilute gas of weakly interacting charges, whereas, the\nmacroscopic population of charge defects naturally develops charge ordering for\nlarge Coulomb interaction limit. Interestingly, we find that the competing spin\ninteractions could naturally give rise to stabilize the mosaic structure of\ncharge defects in the absence of uniform ordering. They are characterized by\nliquid-like correlations having a finite length scale. The emergence of such\nintermediate order in the mosaic structure is confirmed by both dynamical and\nstatic correlations. By establishing the microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we also\npresent the distinctive signatures in static spin correlation to detect such\nspatial structure of charge defects.

First, an improved exact solution\nof the dam-break problem is presented, assuming (i) the dependence of the gate\ncontraction coefficient on the upstream flow depth, and (ii) a physically\ncongruent definition for the submerged flow equation. It is shown that a\nrelevant solution always exists for any set of initial conditions, but there\nare also initial conditions for which the solution is multiple. In the last\ncase, a novel disambiguation criterion based on the continuous dependence of\nthe solution on the initial conditions is used to select the physically\ncongruent one among the alternatives. Secondly, a one (1-d) and a\ntwo-dimensional (2-d) form of a SWE Finite Volume numerical model, equipped\nwith an approximate Riemann solver for the sluice gate treatment at cells\ninterfaces, are presented. It is shown that the numerical implementation of\nclassic steady state gate equations (classic equilibrium approach) leads to\nunsatisfactory numerical results in the case of fast transients, while a novel\nrelaxed version of these equations (non-equilibrium approach) supplies very\nsatisfactory results both in the 1-d and 2-d case.

The 2-d model is verified by means of\na test in a realistic detention basin for flood regulation, demonstrating that\nthe novel findings can be promptly applied in real-world cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 18:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

The extended rotation system (ERS) of the drawing is the collection\nof the rotations of all vertices and crossings. A drawing is simple if each\npair of edges has at most one common point. Gioan's Theorem states that for any\ntwo simple drawings of the complete graph $K_n$ with the same crossing edge\npairs, one drawing can be transformed into the other by a sequence of triangle\nflips (a.k.a. Reidemeister moves of Type 3). This operation refers to the act\nof moving one edge of a triangular cell formed by three pairwise crossing edges\nover the opposite crossing of the cell, via a local transformation.\n  We investigate to what extent Gioan-type theorems can be obtained for wider\nclasses of graphs. A necessary (but in general not sufficient) condition for\ntwo drawings of a graph to be transformable into each other by a sequence of\ntriangle flips is that they have the same ERS. As our main result, we show that\nfor the large class of complete multipartite graphs, this necessary condition\nis in fact also sufficient. We present two different proofs of this result, one\nof which is shorter, while the other one yields a polynomial time algorithm for\nwhich the number of needed triangle flips for graphs on $n$ vertices is bounded\nby $O(n^{16})$. The latter proof uses a Carath\\'eodory-type theorem for simple\ndrawings of complete multipartite graphs, which we believe to be of independent\ninterest.\n  Moreover, we show that our Gioan-type theorem for complete multipartite\ngraphs is essentially tight in the sense that having the same ERS does not\nremain sufficient when removing or adding very few edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 18:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

On the other hand, the damping rate of gravitational waves is higher\nfor electromagnetic perturbation. To confirm the quasinormal mode behaviour, we\nhave also investigated the time domain profiles for both types of\nperturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 19:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Ensuring high-fidelity\nentanglement has always been a challenging task owing to interaction with the\nhostile channel environment created due to quantum noise and decoherence.\nThough several methods have been proposed, achieving almost 100% error\ncorrection is still a gigantic task. As one of the main contributions of this\nwork, a new model for large distance communication has been introduced, which\ncan correct all bit flip errors or other errors quite extensively if proper\nencoding is used. To achieve this purpose, at the very first step, the idea of\ndifferentiating the long and short-distance applications has been introduced.\nShort-distance is determined by the maximum range of applying unitary control\ngates by the qubit technology. As far as we know, there is no previous work\nthat distinguishes long and short distance applications. At the beginning, we\nhave applied stabilizer formalism and Repetition Code for decoding to\ndistinguish the error correcting ability in long and short distance\ncommunication. Particularly for short distance communication, it has been\ndemonstrated that a properly encoded bell state can identify all the bit flip,\nor phase flip errors with 100% accuracy theoretically. In contrast, if the bell\nstates are used in long distance communication, the error-detecting and\ncorrecting ability reduces at huge amounts. To increase the fidelity\nsignificantly and correct the errors quite extensively for long-distance\ncommunication, a new model based on classical communication protocol has been\nproposed. All the required circuits in these processes have been generalized\nduring encoding. Proposed analytical results have also been verified with the\nSimulation results of IBM QISKIT QASM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 19:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Despite achieving improved outcomes, the existing\nautomated approaches are inefficient in attaining real-time processing speed.\nMoreover, they suffer from a significant performance drop when evaluated on\ninter-patient data, especially those collected from different centers.\nTherefore, we intend to develop a novel real-time deep learning based\narchitecture, Transformer based Residual network (TransNetR), for colon polyp\nsegmentation and evaluate its diagnostic performance.

The computational load on global servers is a\nsignificant challenge in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. Our\nprimary motivation is to introduce a robust and scalable framework that enables\nefficient network anomaly detection. We address the issue of scalability and\nefficiency for network anomaly detection by leveraging federated learning, in\nwhich multiple participants train a global model jointly. Unlike centralized\ntraining architectures, federated learning does not require participants to\nupload their training data to the server, preventing attackers from exploiting\nthe training data.

A substantial\nhindrance to delivering low-latency is, however, the reliance on interleaving\nto break up omnipresent channel correlations to ensure that decoder input\nmatches decoder assumptions. Consequently, even when using short codes, the\nneed to wait to interleave data at the sender and de-interleave at the receiver\nresults in significant latency that acts contrary to the goals of URLLC.\nMoreover, interleaving reduces channel capacity, so that potential decoding\nperformance is degraded.\n  Here we introduce a variant of Ordered Reliability Bits Guessing Random\nAdditive Noise Decoding (ORBGRAND), which we call ORBGRAND-Approximate\nIndependence (ORBGRAND-AI), a soft-detection decoder that can decode any\nmoderate redundancy code and overcomes the limitation of existing decoding\nparadigms by leveraging channel correlations and circumventing the need for\ninterleaving. By leveraging correlation, not only is latency reduced, but error\ncorrection performance can be enhanced by multiple dB, while decoding\ncomplexity is also reduced, offering one potential solution for the provision\nof URLLC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 20:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

With this formulation, we first construct a theoretical framework to\ncertify whether any surjective contract menu is optimal, and quantify its\nsub-optimality. The framework and its proofs rely on a novel construction and\ncomparison of several related optimization problems. Roughly speaking, our\nframework transforms the question of contract menu optimality into the study of\nduality gaps. We then operationalize the framework to study the optimality of\nsimple -- affine and linear -- contract menus. By our framework, the optimality\ngap of a contract menu is broken down into an adjustability gap and an\ninformation rent. We show that, with strong geometric intuition, these simple\ncontract menus tend to be close to optimal when the social value of production\nis convex in production cost and the conversion ratio is large at the agent's\nhighest effort level. We also provide succinct and closed-form expressions to\nquantify the optimality gap when the social value function is concave. With\nthis systematic analysis, our results shed light on the technical root of a\nhigher-level question -- why are there more positive results in the literature\nin terms of a simple menu's optimality in a \\emph{robust} (worst-case) setting\nrather than in a \\emph{stochastic} (Bayesian) setting?

Hence,\ntraditional deep neural network (DNN) accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs face\nlimitations in processing Transformers efficiently. In-memory accelerators\nbased on non-volatile memory promise to be an effective solution to this\nchallenge, since they provide high storage density while performing massively\nparallel matrix vector multiplications within memory arrays. However, attention\nscore computations, which are frequently used in Transformers (unlike CNNs and\nRNNs), require matrix vector multiplications (MVM) where both operands change\ndynamically for each input.

It has been shown that the SSCL outperforms supervised\ncontinual learning (SCL) as the learned representations are more informative\nand robust to catastrophic forgetting. However, if not designed intelligently,\nthe training complexity of SSCL may be prohibitively high due to the inherent\ntraining cost of SSL. In this work, by investigating the task correlations in\nSSCL setup first, we discover an interesting phenomenon that, with the\nSSL-learned background model, the intermediate features are highly correlated\nbetween tasks. Based on this new finding, we propose a new SSCL method with\nlayer-wise freezing which progressively freezes partial layers with the highest\ncorrelation ratios for each task to improve training computation efficiency and\nmemory efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets are\nperformed, where our proposed method shows superior performance against the\nSoTA SSCL methods under various SSL frameworks.

In\nthis approach, a readily available source of higher spin order, either from\nelectron spins in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) or singlet states in\nhydrogen for PHIP / SABRE, is placed in close contact with the nuclear spin of\ninterest to allow for efficient transfer of the spin order. However, the\nphysics of polarization transfer from electron spins and nuclear singlet states\nappears to differ substantially due to the marked difference in energy scale\nbetween electron and nuclear spins and due to the different physical origin and\nstrength of the interaction with the target nuclei. Nevertheless, utilizing a\npseudo-spin formalism we show that a critical regime of PHIP / SABRE, namely\nthe low-field polarization transfer regime can be mapped to an equivalent\nsystem, where the heteronuclear target spin takes a role analogous to that of\nthe DNP-electron and the pseudospin of the parahydrogen takes the role of the\nnuclear spin in DNP. Using this equivalence we provide a detailed mapping\nbetween some of the most important polarization transfer sequences in PHIP and\nDNP and we show how one can transfer sequences that have been developed in one\nfield to the other.

Multi-microphone speech enhancement problem is\noften decomposed into two decoupled steps: a beamformer that provides spatial\nfiltering and a single-channel speech enhancement model that cleans up the\nbeamformer output. In this work, we propose a speech enhancement solution that\ntakes both the raw microphone and beamformer outputs as the input for an ML\nmodel. We devise a simple yet effective training scheme that allows the model\nto learn from the cues of the beamformer by contrasting the two inputs and\ngreatly boost its capability in spatial rejection, while conducting the general\ntasks of denoising and dereverberation. The proposed solution takes advantage\nof classical spatial filtering algorithms instead of competing with them. By\ndesign, the beamformer module then could be selected separately and does not\nrequire a large amount of data to be optimized for a given form factor, and the\nnetwork model can be considered as a standalone module which is highly\ntransferable independently from the microphone array.

However, the presence of high background\npressure and conductive walls in the chamber leads to facility effects that\nincrease uncertainty in the performance of the thruster in space. To address\nthis issue, this study utilizes a fully kinetic simulation to investigate the\nfacility effects on the thruster plume. The in-chamber condition shows a\ndownstream neutral particle density 100 times larger than the in-space case due\nto ion neutralization at the wall and limited vacuum pump capability, resulting\nin a significant difference in the density and distribution of charge-exchange\nions. The flux, energy, and angle of charge-exchange ions incident on the\nchamber wall are found to be altered by the electron sheath, which can only be\nsimulated by the fully kinetic approach, as opposed to the conventionally used\nquasi-neutral Boltzmann approach. We also examine the effect of backsputtering,\nanother important facility effect, and find that it does not necessarily\nrequire a fully kinetic simulation as the incident flux and energy of the\nsampled charge-exchange ion are negligibly small. Finally, we demonstrate that\nthe carbon deposition rate on the thruster is significantly influenced by the\nangular dependence of the sputtered carbon, with a nearly 50% effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 22:11:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 04:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

It is necessary to resolve such issues since millions of\nofficial documents can be digitized by training deep learning models using a\nlarge and diverse dataset. Due to the lack of data availability, the trained\nmodel does not give the expected result. Thus, it has a high chance of showing\npoor results. This paper proposes a novel way of generating diverse handwritten\nword images using handwritten characters. The idea of our project is to train\nthe BiLSTM-CTC architecture with generated synthetic handwritten words. The\nwhole approach shows the process of generating two types of large and diverse\nhandwritten word datasets: overlapped and non-overlapped. Since handwritten\nwords also have issues like overlapping between two characters, we have tried\nto put it into our experimental part. We have also demonstrated the process of\nrecognizing handwritten documents using the deep learning model. For the\nexperiments, we have targeted the Bangla language, which lacks the handwritten\nword dataset, and can be followed for any language. Our approach is less\ncomplex and less costly than traditional GAN models. Finally, we have evaluated\nour model using Word Error Rate (WER), accuracy, f1-score, precision, and\nrecall metrics. The model gives 39% WER score, 92% percent accuracy, and 92%\npercent f1 scores using non-overlapped data and 63% percent WER score, 83%\npercent accuracy, and 85% percent f1 scores using overlapped data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 22:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Sometimes humans can get confused by the\nsimilarities of the skin lesions, which we can minimize by involving the\nmachine. However, not all deep learning approaches can give better predictions.\nSome deep learning models have limitations, leading the model to a\nfalse-positive result. We have introduced several deep learning models to\nclassify skin lesions to distinguish skin cancer from different types of skin\nlesions.

In this work, using periodic structures as multi-ports is proposed.\nPeriodic structures impose a new constraint on the multi-port theory and\nsimplify it significantly. This simplification leads to closed form solution\nfor calibration and measurement procedures. The closed-form solution also shows\nthat any arbitrary periodic structure will always have a unique solution for\nboth procedures. Therefore, the proposed technique does not rely on\nfrequency-dependent behavior of devices, such as directivity and phase shift to\nmeasure impedance. This fact leads to increased bandwidth and simplified design\nprocedure. In addition, proposed multi-port structures can be calibrated by\nusing fewer known loads than existing multi-port techniques. This fact, coupled\nwith the closed-form solution, reduces computation overhead and test time. The\ntheory and its robustness against non-idealities, such as part-to-part\nvariation, are verified with Monte-Carlo simulations. A practical embodiment of\nthe technique is demonstrated with EM simulations and hardware experiments. In\nthis embodiment, the multi-port structure is embedded into an LC matching\nnetwork. Hardware experiments show that the embedded multi-port structure can\nmeasure test loads with high accuracy from 1.5 GHz to 3.5 GHz, without\ndegrading matching network performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 23:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Machine learning (ML) models for sound\nevent detection (SED) and speaker identification (SID) can enable headphones to\nselectively pass through important sounds; however, implementing these models\nfor a user-centric experience presents several unique challenges. First, most\npeople spend limited time customizing their headphones, so the sound detection\nshould work reasonably well out of the box.

While the removal of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) at large radii is\nwell studied, how the environment impacts the remaining gas in the centres of\ngalaxies, which are dominated by molecular gas, is less clear. Using new\nobservations from the Virgo Environment traced in CO survey (VERTICO) and\narchival HI data, we study the HI and molecular gas within the optical discs of\nVirgo cluster galaxies on 1.2-kpc scales with spatially resolved scaling\nrelations between stellar (${\\Sigma}_{\\star}$), HI (${\\Sigma}_\\mathrm{HI}$),\nand molecular gas (${\\Sigma}_\\mathrm{mol}$) surface densities. Adopting HI\ndeficiency as a measure of environmental impact, we find evidence that, in\naddition to removing the HI at large radii, the cluster processes also lower\nthe average ${\\Sigma}_\\mathrm{HI}$ of the remaining gas even in the central 1.2\nkpc. The impact on molecular gas is comparatively weaker than on the HI, and we\nshow that the lower ${\\Sigma}_\\mathrm{mol}$ gas is removed first. In the most\nHI-deficient galaxies, however, we find evidence that environmental processes\nreduce the typical ${\\Sigma}_\\mathrm{mol}$ of the remaining gas by nearly a\nfactor of 3. We find no evidence for environment-driven elevation of\n${\\Sigma}_\\mathrm{HI}$ or ${\\Sigma}_\\mathrm{mol}$ in HI-deficient galaxies.\nUsing the ratio of ${\\Sigma}_\\mathrm{mol}$-to-${\\Sigma}_\\mathrm{HI}$ in\nindividual regions, we show that changes in the ISM physical conditions,\nestimated using the total gas surface density and midplane hydrostatic\npressure, cannot explain the observed reduction in molecular gas content.\nInstead, we suggest that direct stripping of the molecular gas is required to\nexplain our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 00:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

They can quickly spread and cause severe damage to\npower infrastructure. To reduce the risk, public safety power shutoffs are\noften used to restore power balance and prevent widespread blackouts. However,\nthe unpredictability of wildfires makes it challenging to implement effective\ncounter-measures in a timely manner. This paper proposes an optimization-based\ntopology control problem as a solution to mitigate the impact of wildfires. The\ngoal is to find the optimal network topology that minimizes total operating\ncosts and prevents load shedding during power shutoffs under uncertain line\nshutoff scenarios caused by uncertain spreading wildfires. The solution\ninvolves solving two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programs, with\npreventive and corrective control actions taken when the risk of a wildfire and\ncorresponding outage line scenarios are known with low and high confidence,\nrespectively. The Progressive Hedging algorithm is used to solve both problems.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using data from the\nRTS-GMLC system that is artificially geo-located in Southern California,\nincluding actual wildfire incidents and risk maps. Our work provides a crucial\nstudy of the comparative benefits due to accurate risk forecast and\ncorresponding preventive control over real-time corrective control that may not\nbe realistic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 00:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Here, to\novercome this challenge, we give a general protocol for achieving a quantum\ndouble lock-in amplifier and illustrate its realization. In analog to a\nclassical double lock-in amplifier, our protocol is accomplished via two\nquantum mixers under orthogonal pulse sequences. The two orthogonal pulse\nsequences act the roles of two orthogonal reference signals in a classical\ndouble lock-in amplifier.

In this paper, we explore\nlow-complexity, resource-efficient, causal DNN architectures for real-time\nseparation of two or more simultaneous speakers. A cascade of three neural\nnetwork modules are trained to sequentially perform noise-suppression,\nseparation, and de-reverberation.

To achieve optimal revenue\n(i.e., least regret), the firm needs to learn and exploit the unknown GLMs\nwhile monitoring for potential change-points. To tackle such a problem, we\nfirst design a novel penalized likelihood-based online change-point detection\nalgorithm for high-dimensional GLMs, which is the first algorithm in the\nchange-point literature that achieves optimal minimax localization error rate\nfor high-dimensional GLMs. A change-point detection assisted dynamic pricing\n(CPDP) policy is further proposed and achieves a near-optimal regret of order\n$O(s\\sqrt{\\Upsilon_T T}\\log(Td))$, where $s$ is the sparsity level and\n$\\Upsilon_T$ is the number of change-points.

These drawbacks make it difficult to\nobtain a global state information of the network, and the optimal routing\ndecision cannot be made in real time, affecting network performance. This paper\nproposes a cross-domain intelligent SDN routing method based on a proposed\nmultiagent deep reinforcement learning. First, the network is divided into\nmultiple subdomains managed by multiple local controllers, and the state\ninformation of each subdomain is flexibly obtained by the designed SDN\nmultithreaded network measurement mechanism. Then, a cooperative communication\nmodule is designed to realize message transmission and message synchronization\nbetween root and local controllers, and socket technology is used to ensure the\nreliability and stability of message transmission between multiple controllers\nto realize the real-time acquisition of global network state information.\nFinally, after the optimal intradomain and interdomain routing paths are\nadaptively generated by the agents in the root and local controllers, a\nprediction mechanism for the network traffic state is designed to improve the\nawareness of the cross-domain intelligent routing method and enable the\ngeneration of the optimal routing paths in the global network in real time.\nExperimental results show that the proposed cross-domain intelligent routing\nmethod can significantly improve the network throughput, reduce the network\ndelay and the packet loss rate compared to the Dijkstra and OSPF routing\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 01:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

This is actually impractical due to the high labor and\ntime costs and the unavoidable missing annotations. As a result, the incomplete\nannotation in each image could provide misleading supervision and harm the\ntraining. Recent works on sparsely annotated object detection alleviate this\nproblem by generating pseudo labels for the missing annotations. Such a\nmechanism is sensitive to the threshold of the pseudo label score. However, the\neffective threshold is different in different training stages and among\ndifferent object detectors. Therefore, the current methods with fixed\nthresholds have sub-optimal performance, and are difficult to be applied to\nother detectors. In order to resolve this obstacle, we propose a Calibrated\nTeacher, of which the confidence estimation of the prediction is well\ncalibrated to match its real precision. In this way, different detectors in\ndifferent training stages would share a similar distribution of the output\nconfidence, so that multiple detectors could share the same fixed threshold and\nachieve better performance.

Transformers models have recently\naddressed this issue by incorporating an attention mechanism that assigns\ngreater attention (i.e., relevance) scores to some words than others. Because\nof the attention mechanism's high computational cost, transformer models\nusually have an input-length limitation caused by hardware constraints. This\nlimitation applies to many transformers, including the well-known bidirectional\nencoder representations of the transformer (BERT) model. In this paper, we\nexamined BERT's attention assignment mechanism, focusing on two questions: (1)\nHow can attention be employed to reduce input length? (2) How can attention be\nused as a control mechanism for conditional text generation? We investigated\nthese questions in the context of a text classification task. We discovered\nthat BERT's early layers assign more critical attention scores for text\nclassification tasks compared to later layers. We demonstrated that the first\nlayer's attention sums could be used to filter tokens in a given sequence,\nconsiderably decreasing the input length while maintaining good test accuracy.\nWe also applied filtering, which uses a compute-efficient semantic similarities\nalgorithm, and discovered that retaining approximately 6\\% of the original\nsequence is sufficient to obtain 86.5\\% accuracy.

COSTCO-I is the first known\nlarge-scale region of the IGM that is observed to be transitioning from the\noptically-thin photoionized regime at Cosmic Noon, to eventually coalesce into\nan intra-cluster medium (ICM) by $z=0$. Future observations of similar\nstructures will shed light on the growth of the ICM and allow constraints on\nAGN feedback mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 04:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Report","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.CV","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  Planar object tracking is a critical computer vision problem and has drawn\nincreasing interest owing to its key roles in robotics, augmented reality, etc.\nDespite rapid progress, its further development, especially in the deep\nlearning era, is largely hindered due to the lack of large-scale challenging\nbenchmarks. Addressing this, we introduce PlanarTrack, a large-scale\nchallenging planar tracking benchmark. Specifically, PlanarTrack consists of\n1,000 videos with more than 490K images. All these videos are collected in\ncomplex unconstrained scenarios from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack,\ncompared with existing benchmarks, more challenging but realistic for\nreal-world applications. To ensure the high-quality annotation, each frame in\nPlanarTrack is manually labeled using four corners with multiple-round careful\ninspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack, to date, is the\nlargest and most challenging dataset dedicated to planar object tracking. In\norder to analyze the proposed PlanarTrack, we evaluate 10 planar trackers and\nconduct comprehensive comparisons and in-depth analysis. Our results, not\nsurprisingly, demonstrate that current top-performing planar trackers\ndegenerate significantly on the challenging PlanarTrack and more efforts are\nneeded to improve planar tracking in the future. In addition, we further derive\na variant named PlanarTrack$_{\\mathbf{BB}}$ for generic object tracking from\nPlanarTrack. Our evaluation of 10 excellent generic trackers on\nPlanarTrack$_{\\mathrm{BB}}$ manifests that, surprisingly,\nPlanarTrack$_{\\mathrm{BB}}$ is even more challenging than several popular\ngeneric tracking benchmarks and more attention should be paid to handle such\nplanar objects, though they are rigid.

Lately, algorithms for BAI problems have been developed that minimise\nsample complexity while providing statistical guarantees on the correct arm\nselection. As we observe, these algorithms can be computationally prohibitive.\nWe exploit the fact that the reward process for each arm is well approximated\nby a Compound Poisson process to arrive at algorithms that are faster, with a\nsmall increase in sample complexity. We analyze the problem in an asymptotic\nregime as rarity of reward occurrence reduces to zero, and reward amounts\nincrease to infinity.

Additionally, the semantic masking process is fully trainable,\nenabling FaceMAE to guide the backbone to learn spatial details and contextual\nproperties of fine-grained facial landmarks. Experimental results on several\nFER-W benchmarks prove that the proposed SimFLE is superior in facial landmark\nlocalization and noticeably improved performance compared to the supervised\nbaseline and other self-supervised methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 06:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

This conceptualization has a fundamental\nproblem because the interference produced by the superpositions of pulses\ngenerates colored Gaussian noise, masking the temporal profile of the\ngenerating pulse.

Existing Transformer-based methods usually\ntreat traffic flow forecasting as multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting.\nHowever, too many sensors can cause a vector with a dimension greater than 800,\nwhich is difficult to process without information loss. In addition, these\nmethods design complex mechanisms to capture spatial dependencies in MTS,\nresulting in slow forecasting speed. To solve the abovementioned problems, we\npropose a Fast Pure Transformer Network (FPTN) in this paper. First, the\ntraffic flow data are divided into sequences along the sensor dimension instead\nof the time dimension. Then, to adequately represent complex spatio-temporal\ncorrelations, Three types of embeddings are proposed for projecting these\nvectors into a suitable vector space. After that, to capture the complex\nspatio-temporal correlations simultaneously in these vectors, we utilize\nTransformer encoder and stack it with several layers. Extensive experiments are\nconducted with 4 real-world datasets and 13 baselines, which demonstrate that\nFPTN outperforms the state-of-the-art on two metrics. Meanwhile, the\ncomputational time of FPTN spent is less than a quarter of other\nstate-of-the-art Transformer-based models spent, and the requirements for\ncomputing resources are significantly reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 07:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Spectral modeling of SN 2021ckj reveals that its\ncomposition is dominated by oxygen, carbon and iron group elements, and the\nphotospheric velocity at peak is ~10000 km/s. From the light curve (LC)\nmodeling applied to SNe 2021ckj, 2019hgp, and 2021csp, we find that the ejecta\nand CSM properties of Type Icn SNe are diverse. SNe 2021ckj and 2021csp likely\nhave two ejecta components (an aspherical high-energy component and a spherical\nstandard-energy component) with a roughly spherical CSM, while SN 2019hgp can\nbe explained by a spherical ejecta-CSM interaction alone. The ejecta of SNe\n2021ckj and 2021csp have larger energy per ejecta mass than the ejecta of SN\n2019hgp. The density distribution of the CSM is similar in these three SNe, and\nis comparable to those of Type Ibn SNe. This may imply that the mass-loss\nmechanism is common between Type Icn (and also Type Ibn) SNe. The CSM masses of\nSN 2021ckj and SN 2021csp are higher than that of SN 2019hgp, although all\nthese values are within the diversity seen in Type Ibn SNe. The early spectrum\nof SN 2021ckj shows narrow emission lines from C II and C III, without a clear\nabsorption component, in contrast with that observed in SN 2021csp. The\nsimilarity of the emission components of these lines implies that the emitting\nregions of SNe 2021ckj and 2021csp have similar ionization states, and thus\nsuggests that they have similar properties of the ejecta and CSM, which is\ninferred also from the LC modeling. Taking into account the difference in the\nstrength of the absorption features, this heterogeneity may be attributed to\nviewing angle effects in otherwise common aspherical ejecta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 09:10:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

The difficulty is how\nto find order in disordered systems. The usual treatment of glass as an\nexceptional case causes serious internal inconsistencies in thermodynamics. The\nissue turns out to be ascribed to a fundamental problem of defining state\nvariables in thermodynamics. This study provides a coherent understanding of\nthe nature of order parameters for glasses and crystals, starting from the\nfundamental issue of defining state variables in thermodynamics. The state\nvariable is defined as the time-averaged value of a dynamical variable under\nthe constraint conditions, provided that the time average converges to a unique\nvalue. This property is called time invariance. It gives the same value at any\ntime it is measured once an equilibrium is established. From this definition,\nit is deduced that the state variables of a solid are the time-averaged\npositions of all atoms constituting the solid, regardless of periodicity. The\ngeneral properties of order parameters are fully compatible with the time\ninvariance of state variables. For glass, equilibrium positions are state\nvariables and order parameters too. Because equilibrium positions are order\nparameters, any property determined by equilibrium positions can also be an\norder parameter. This explains why many quantities can be used for order\nparameters. Symmetry introduces redundancy among the averaged positions of the\natoms, reducing the number of independent state variables. The often-claimed\nassociation of order to periodicity lacks generality as explained by abundant\nexamples of well-ordered material, such as DNA. Order in thermodynamics means\nthe time invariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 09:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

By Faraday tomography,\nit is possible to obtain the Faraday dispersion function which contains\ninformation on the line-of-sight distributions of magnetic fields, thermal\nelectron density, and cosmic-ray electron density by measuring the polarization\nspectrum from a source of synchrotron radiation over a wide band. Furthermore,\nby combining it with 2-dimensional imaging, Faraday tomography allows us to\nexplore the 3-dimensional structure of polarization sources. The application of\nFaraday tomography has been active in the last 20 years, when broadband\nobservation has become technically feasible. However, the Faraday dispersion\nfunction is mathematically the Fourier transform of the polarization spectrum,\nand since the observable band is finite, it is impossible to obtain a complete\nFaraday dispersion function by performing Fourier transform. In addition, the\nFaraday dispersion function does not directly reflect the distribution of\nmagnetic field, thermal-electron density, and cosmic-ray electron density in\nthe physical space, and its physical interpretation is not straightforward.\nDespite these two difficult problems, Faraday tomography is attracting much\nattention because it has great potential as a new method for studying cosmic\nmagnetic fields and magnetized plasmas.

Adopting this model, we prove that meaningful inferential privacy\nguarantees can be obtained, even though this is commonly considered to be\nimpossible by the well-known result of Dwork and Naor. Then, we specifically\ndiscuss a privacy measure called pointwise maximal leakage (PML) whose\nguarantees are of the inferential type. We use PML to show that differential\nprivacy admits an inferential formulation: it describes the information leaking\nabout a single entry in a database assuming that every other entry is known,\nand considering the worst-case distribution on the data. Moreover, we define\ninferential instance privacy (IIP) as a bound on the (non-conditional)\ninformation leaking about a single entry in the database under the worst-case\ndistribution, and show that it is equivalent to free-lunch privacy. Overall,\nour approach to privacy unifies, formalizes, and explains many existing ideas,\ne.g., why the informed adversary assumption may lead to underestimating the\ninformation leaking about each entry in the database.

In\nspite of that, load balancing has been a challenging issue in all distributed\nRDBMSs, including shared-nothing ones, which suffers much from skewed data\ndistribution. In this work, we focus on one of the representative operator,\nnamely Hash Join, and investigate how skewness among the nodes of a cluster\nwill affect the load balance and eventual efficiency of an arbitrary query in\nshared-nothing RDBMSs. We found that existing Distributed Hash Join (Dist-HJ)\nsolutions may not provide satisfactory performance when a value is skewed in\nboth the probe and build tables.

Although PnR provide the best\nefficiency in some skewness scenario, our exhaustive experiments over a group\nof shared-nothing RDBMSs show that there is not a single Dist-HJ solution that\nwins in all (data skew) scenarios. To this end, we further propose a\nself-adaptive Dist-HJ solution with a builtin sub-operator cost model that\ndynamically select the best Dist-HJ implementation strategy at runtime\naccording to the data skew of the target query.

To enhance the\nrepresentation discrimination ability, our masked graph autoencoder is designed\nto aggregate global information during the augmentation via reconstructing the\nmasked subgraph structures. Experiments and ablation studies are performed on\nseveral public datasets for recommending products, venues, and locations.\nResults demonstrate the superiority of AutoCF against various baseline methods.\nWe release the model implementation at https://github.com/HKUDS/AutoCF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 11:12:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 03:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

The aim of this paper is to\nanalyse the changes in mobility behaviours, focusing on the sustainability\nlevel of modal choices caused by the pandemic in two countries with different\ncontainment policies in place: Italy and Sweden. Survey data uncovered which\ntransport means was the most used for three different trip purposes (grocery\nshopping, non-grocery shopping and commuting) both before and during the first\nwave of the pandemic. The variation in the sustainability level of modal\nchoices was then observed through descriptive statistics and significance\ntests. By estimating three multinomial logistic regression models, one for each\ntrip purpose, we tried to identify which factors, beyond the country, affected\nthe variation in the sustainability level of the modal choice with the\nbeginning of the pandemic. Results show a greater reduction in mobility among\nthe Italian sample compared to the Swedish one, especially for public transit,\nand a major inclination by Swedes in travelling by foot and by bike compared to\nItalians, also due to the greater possibility of making trips during the first\nwave of the pandemic. Finally, perceived safety on public transit seems to have\nno significant effects on the variation in the sustainability level of the\nmodal choice with the beginning of restrictions.

Computing the Class Activation Map (CAM) from a\nmulti-label classification network is the de facto paradigm for seed area\ngeneration, but CAMs generated from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and\nTransformers are prone to be under- and over-activated, respectively, which\nmakes the strategies to refine CAMs for CNNs usually inappropriate for\nTransformers, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a Unified optimization\nparadigm for Seed Area GEneration (USAGE) for both types of networks, in which\nthe objective function to be optimized consists of two terms: One is a\ngeneration loss, which controls the shape of seed areas by a temperature\nparameter following a deterministic principle for different types of networks;\nThe other is a regularization loss, which ensures the consistency between the\nseed areas that are generated by self-adaptive network adjustment from\ndifferent views, to overturn false activation in seed areas. Experimental\nresults show that USAGE consistently improves seed area generation for both\nCNNs and Transformers by large margins, e.g., outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods by a mIoU of 4.1% on PASCAL VOC.

The learnable filterbank is a 1D\nConv layer, which transforms the raw waveform into a 2D representation. In\ncontrast to the conventional single-channel masking method, we estimate a mask\nfor each individual microphone channel. The estimated masks are then applied to\nthe transformed waveform representation like in the traditional filter-and-sum\nbeamforming operation. Specifically, each mask is used to multiply the\ncorresponding channel's 2D representation, and the masked output of all\nchannels are then summed. At last, a 1D transposed Conv layer is used to\nconvert the summed masked signal into the waveform domain. The experimental\nresults show our method outperforms single-channel masking with a learnable\nfilterbank and can outperform multi-channel complex masking with STFT complex\nspectrum in the STGCSEN model if a learnable filterbank is transformed to a\nhigher feature dimension.

This paper develops a multiscale\nmodel that couples the particle and the continuum systems to facilitate an\neffective representation of the dynamical and statistical features of sea ice\nacross different scales. The multiscale model exploits a Boltzmann-type system\nthat links the particle movement with the continuum equations. For the\nsmall-scale dynamics, it describes the motion of each sea ice floe. Then, as\nthe large-scale continuum component, it treats the statistical moments of mass\ndensity and linear and angular velocities. The evolution of these statistics\naffects the motion of individual floes, which in turn provides bulk feedback\nthat adjusts the large-scale dynamics.

To address this problem, we propose a novel Reference\nHeatmap Transformer (RHT) by introducing reference heatmap information for more\nprecise facial landmark detection.

The perturbative RG is\ncontrolled by working close to a critical dimensionality, ${d_c=6}$ for\nmeasurements and ${d_c=10}$ for random tensors, where interactions become\nmarginal. The resulting RG flows are surprising in several ways.

In this paper, we demonstrate that agents trained to optimize\nexpected returns are more likely to choose a safe action that leads to\nguaranteed but lower rewards. However, there typically exists a risky action\nthat leads to higher rewards in the long run only if agents cooperate, e.g.,\ncooperate-cooperate in ISH. To overcome this, we propose using action value\ndistribution to characterize the decision's risk and corresponding potential\npayoffs.

Furthermore, to\navoid overfitting training opponents, ARSP learns an auxiliary opponent\nmodeling task to infer opponents' types and dynamically alter corresponding\nstrategies during execution. Empirically, agents trained via ARSP can achieve\nstable coordination during training without accessing opponent's rewards or\nlearning process, and can adapt to non-cooperative opponents during execution.\nTo the best of our knowledge, it is the first method to learn coordination\nstrategies between agents both in iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) and\niterated stag hunt (ISH) without shaping opponents or rewards, and can adapt to\nopponents with distinct strategies during execution.

To handle the raw video bit-stream input, we\npropose a novel Three-branch Compressed-domain Spatial-temporal Fusion (TCSF)\nframework, which extracts and aggregates three kinds of low-level visual\nfeatures (I-frame, motion vector and residual features) for effective and\nefficient grounding.

Besides, we explore the motion\ninformation not only by learning the motion vector feature, but also by\nexploring the relations of neighboring frames via the residual feature. In this\nway, a three-branch spatial-temporal attention layer with an adaptive\nmotion-appearance fusion module is further designed to extract and aggregate\nboth appearance and motion information for the final grounding.

Existing literature have applied the\ndata augmentation (DA) to alleviate the model forgetting, while the role of DA\nin OCI has not been well understood so far. In this paper, we theoretically\nshow that augmented samples with lower correlation to the original data are\nmore effective in preventing forgetting.

Typically, SSMs rely on assumptions\nregarding the future evolution of traffic participant trajectories to generate\na measure of risk. As a result, they are only applicable in scenarios where\nthose assumptions hold. To address this issue, we present a novel data-driven\nProbabilistic RISk Measure derivAtion (PRISMA) method. The PRISMA method is\nused to derive SSMs that can be used to calculate in real time the probability\nof a specific event (e.g., a crash). Because we adopt a data-driven approach to\npredict the possible future evolutions of traffic participant trajectories,\nless assumptions on these trajectories are needed. Since the PRISMA is not\nbound to specific assumptions, multiple SSMs for different types of scenarios\ncan be derived. To calculate the probability of the specific event, the PRISMA\nmethod uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the occurrence probability of\nthe specified event. We further introduce a statistical method that requires\nfewer simulations to estimate this probability. Combined with a regression\nmodel, this enables our derived SSMs to make real-time risk estimations.\n  To illustrate the PRISMA method, an SSM is derived for risk evaluation during\nlongitudinal traffic interactions. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to\nobjectively compare the relative merits of two SSMs. Instead, we provide a\nmethod for benchmarking our derived SSM with respect to expected risk trends.\nThe application of the benchmarking illustrates that the SSM matches the\nexpected risk trends.\n  Whereas the derived SSM shows the potential of the PRISMA method, future work\ninvolves applying the approach for other types of traffic conflicts, such as\nlateral traffic conflicts or interactions with vulnerable road users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 13:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Our key insight is to regard point\nclouds as an intermediate representation of meshes, and model the distribution\nof point clouds instead. While meshes can be generated from point clouds via\ntechniques like Shape as Points (SAP), the challenges of directly generating\nmeshes can be effectively avoided. To boost the efficiency and controllability\nof our mesh generation method, we propose to further encode point clouds to a\nset of sparse latent points with point-wise semantic meaningful features, where\ntwo DDPMs are trained in the space of sparse latent points to respectively\nmodel the distribution of the latent point positions and features at these\nlatent points.

In this\narticle, we present a review of statistical and computational methods for\nidentifying optimal cluster randomised trial designs. We also adapt methods\nfrom the experimental design literature for experimental designs with\ncorrelated observations to the cluster trial context. We identify three broad\nclasses of methods: using exact formulae for the treatment effect estimator\nvariance for specific models to derive algorithms or weights for cluster\nsequences; generalised methods for estimating weights for experimental units;\nand, combinatorial optimisation algorithms to select an optimal subset of\nexperimental units. We also discuss methods for rounding weights to whole\nnumbers of clusters and extensions to non-Gaussian models. We present results\nfrom multiple cluster trial examples that compare the different methods,\nincluding problems involving determining optimal allocation of clusters across\na set of cluster sequences, and selecting the optimal number of single\nobservations to make in each cluster-period for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian\nmodels, and including exchangeable and exponential decay covariance structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 14:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Our solution is\nGoNet: a generative grasp sampler that can constrain the grasp approach\ndirection to lie close to a specified direction. This is achieved by\ndiscretizing SO(3) into bins and training GoNet to generate grasps from those\nbins. At run-time, the bin aligning with the second largest principal component\nof the observed point cloud is selected. GoNet is benchmarked against GraspNet,\na state-of-the-art unconstrained grasp sampler, in an unconfined grasping\nexperiment in simulation and on an unconfined and confined grasping experiment\nin the real world. The results demonstrate that GoNet achieves higher\nsuccess-over-coverage in simulation and a 12%-18% higher success rate in\nreal-world table-picking and shelf-picking tasks than the baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 15:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

We propose the continuous processing of PAHs through\nclustering, adsorption on dust grains, and their reverse-processes as key\nmechanisms to reduce the emission-capable PAH abundance in protoplanetary\ndiscs. This cycle of processing is driven by vertical turbulence in the disc\nmixing PAHs between the disc midplane and the photosphere. We used a\ntheoretical Monte Carlo model for photodesorption and a coagulation code in the\ndisc midplane to estimate the relevance and timescale of these processes in a\nHerbig Ae/Be disc environment. By combining these components in a 1D vertical\nmodel, we calculated the gas-phase depletion of PAHs that stick as clusters on\ndust grains. Our results show that the clustering of gas-phase PAHs is very\nefficient, and that clusters with more than 100 monomers can grow for years\nbefore they are able to freeze out in the disc midplane. Once a PAH cluster is\nfrozen on the dust grain surface, the large heat capacity of these clusters\nprevents them from evaporating off the grains in UV-rich environments such as\nthe photosphere. Therefore, the clustering of PAHs followed by freeze-out can\nlead to a depletion of gas-phase PAHs in discs. Evaluated over the lifetime of\nprotoplanetary discs, we find a depletion of PAHs by a factor that ranges\nbetween 50 and 1000 compared to the standard ISM abundance of PAHs in the inner\ndisc through turbulent processing. Through these processes, we favour PAHs\nsmaller than circumovalene as the major gas-phase emitters of the disc\nphotosphere as larger PAH monomers cannot photodesorb from the grain surface.\nThese gas-phase PAHs co-exist with large PAH clusters sticking on dust grains.\nWe find a close relation between the amount of PAHs frozen out on dust grains\nand the dust population, as well as the strength of the vertical turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 15:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

Complex question answering is\na challenge task of KBQA, which comprehensively tests the ability of models in\nsemantic parsing and reasoning. To assess the performance of ChatGPT as a\nquestion answering system (QAS) using its own knowledge, we present a framework\nthat evaluates its ability to answer complex questions.

Crucial in converting s-wave singlet pairs in the\nsuperconductor to s-wave triplets in the ferromagnet is the engineering of\nwell-defined magnetic inhomogeneity (the 'generator') at the interface with the\nsuperconductor. Vertical layer stacks are typically used as such, where two\nseparate thin ferromagnetic layers with homogeneous but non-collinear\nmagnetizations, provide the inhomogeneity. Alternatively, magnetic textures,\nlike ferromagnetic domain walls and vortices, are possible triplet generators,\nalthough they are far less studied. In this paper we review our experiments on\nlateral disk-shaped Josephson junctions where a ferromagnetic bottom layer\nprovides a weak link with a vortex magnetization imposed by the shape of the\ndisk. We present three different junction configurations, exhibiting their own\ngenerator mechanism. In the first, we utilize the non-collinearity with a\nsecond ferromagnetic layer to produce the triplet correlations. The second\nconfiguration consists of only the bottom ferromagnet and the superconducting\ncontacts; it relies on the vortex magnetization itself to generate the\nspin-polarized supercurrents. In the third case we exploit an intrinsic\ngenerator by combining a conventional superconductor (NbTi) and a half-metallic\nferromagnetic oxide (La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$). We find strong supercurrents\nin all cases. A particularly interesting finding is that the supercurrents are\nstrongly confined at the rims of the device, independent of the generating\nmechanism, but directly related to their triplet nature. What causes these rim\ncurrents remains an open question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 15:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Most approaches proposed for\nthis task, namely additive noise models (ANM), are only adequate for\nquantitative data. We propose a criterion to address the cause-effect problem\nwith categorical variables (living in sets with no meaningful order), inspired\nby seeing a conditional probability mass function (pmf) as a discrete\nmemoryless channel. We select as the most likely causal direction the one in\nwhich the conditional pmf is closer to a uniform channel (UC). The rationale is\nthat, in a UC, as in an ANM, the conditional entropy (of the effect given the\ncause) is independent of the cause distribution, in agreement with the\nprinciple of independence of cause and mechanism. Our approach, which we call\nthe uniform channel model (UCM), thus extends the ANM rationale to categorical\nvariables. To assess how close a conditional pmf (estimated from data) is to a\nUC, we use statistical testing, supported by a closed-form estimate of a UC\nchannel. On the theoretical front, we prove identifiability of the UCM and show\nits equivalence with a structural causal model with a low-cardinality exogenous\nvariable.

FL focuses on protecting clients' data but turns\nout to be highly vulnerable to Intellectual Property (IP) threats. Since FL\nperiodically collects and distributes the model parameters, a free-rider can\ndownload the latest model and thus steal model IP. Split Federated Learning\n(SFL), a recent variant of FL that supports training with resource-constrained\nclients, splits the model into two, giving one part of the model to clients\n(client-side model), and the remaining part to the server (server-side model).\nThus SFL prevents model leakage by design. Moreover, by blocking prediction\nqueries, it can be made resistant to advanced IP threats such as traditional\nModel Extraction (ME) attacks. While SFL is better than FL in terms of\nproviding IP protection, it is still vulnerable.

The\nword constructive is construed here in two senses - first, as in constructive\nmathematics, whereby the logic underlying proofs is intuitionistic. In a second\nsense of the word, constructive is taken to mean built up from simpler\ncomponents. Preferences are defined over lotteries that vary continuously over\nsome topological space and are themselves assumed to vary depending upon some\nunderlying process of measurement, deliberation, or observation. The open sets\nof the topology serve as the possible truth values of assertions about\npreference and constrain what can be measured, deduced, or observed. Replacing\nan open set by an open covering of smaller sets serves as a notion of\nrefinement of information, and deductions made for these smaller sets can be\ncombined or collated to yield corresponding deductions over the larger set. The\ntwo notions of constructive turn out to be related because the underlying logic\nof the objects within the system is generally intuitionistic. The classical\nexpected utility theorem is shown to be non-constructive, and a constructive\nversion is proved for the present setting by narrowing the domain of\npreferences. The representation of preferences is via comparisons of continuous\nreal-valued functions. A version of the classical theorem is obtained by\nimposing a restriction on the collection of open sets of the topology, which\nhas the effect of making the logic classical. The proof here illustrates a\nrobustness property of constructive results. They can be carried over virtually\nunchanged to a variety of mathematical settings.

For monotone games, we show that\nthe LLQFP mechanism maintains the concavity property of the perturbed payoff\nfunctions and produces a perturbed NE whose distance from the original NE is\nbounded and adjustable by Laplace parameter tuning. We focus on\nlinear-quadratic games, which is a fundamental type of network games with\nplayers' payoffs being linear-quadratic functions, and derive explicit\nconditions on how the LLQFP mechanism ensures differential privacy with a given\nprivacy budget.

This raises the question of how to design robust DL\nmethods for MRI reconstruction. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nimage reconstruction framework, termed SMOOTHED UNROLLING (SMUG), which\nadvances a deep unrolling-based MRI reconstruction model using a randomized\nsmoothing (RS)-based robust learning operation. RS, which improves the\ntolerance of a model against input noises, has been widely used in the design\nof adversarial defense for image classification. Yet, we find that the\nconventional design that applies RS to the entire DL process is ineffective for\nMRI reconstruction. We show that SMUG addresses the above issue by customizing\nthe RS operation based on the unrolling architecture of the DL-based MRI\nreconstruction model. Compared to the vanilla RS approach and several variants\nof SMUG, we show that SMUG improves the robustness of MRI reconstruction with\nrespect to a diverse set of perturbation sources, including perturbations to\nthe input measurements, different measurement sampling rates, and different\nunrolling steps.
