However, most proposed methods use indirect\nstrategies or strong assumptions on pairs of questions and answers to enforce\nmodel consistency. Instead, we propose a novel strategy intended to improve\nmodel performance by directly reducing logical inconsistencies. To do this, we\nintroduce a new consistency loss term that can be used by a wide range of the\nVQA models and which relies on knowing the logical relation between pairs of\nquestions and answers. While such information is typically not available in VQA\ndatasets, we propose to infer these logical relations using a dedicated\nlanguage model and use these in our proposed consistency loss function. We\nconduct extensive experiments on the VQA Introspect and DME datasets and show\nthat our method brings improvements to state-of-the-art VQA models, while being\nrobust across different architectures and settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 16:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

Here, we\nextend the use of contra plots to determine which results have evidence of\nnegligible (near-zero) effect size. Determining if an effect size is negligible\nis important for eliminating alternative scientific explanations and\nidentifying approximate independence between an intervention and the variable\nmeasured. We illustrate that contra plots can score negligible effect size\nacross studies, inform the selection of a threshold for negligible effect based\non broadly related results, and determine which results have evidence of\nnegligible effect with a hypothesis test. No other data visualization can carry\nout all three of these tasks for analyzing negligible effect size. We\ndemonstrate this analysis technique on real data from biomedical research.

One way to elucidate this is\nto cast the hidden representations as final representations, bypassing the\ntransformer computation in-between. In this work, we suggest a simple method\nfor such casting, by using linear transformations. We show that our approach\nproduces more accurate approximations than the prevailing practice of\ninspecting hidden representations from all layers in the space of the final\nlayer. Moreover, in the context of language modeling, our method allows\n\"peeking\" into early layer representations of GPT-2 and BERT, showing that\noften LMs already predict the final output in early layers. We then demonstrate\nthe practicality of our method to recent early exit strategies, showing that\nwhen aiming, for example, at retention of 95% accuracy, our approach saves\nadditional 7.9% layers for GPT-2 and 5.4% layers for BERT, on top of the\nsavings of the original approach.

The ejecta are predominantly\ndriven by neutrino heating, principally due to neutrino capture on free\nneutrons and protons. Such neutrino interaction plays a crucial role for\nsetting neutron richness in the ejecta. Recent hydrodynamics work with\nsophisticated neutrino transport indicates that the ejecta are only mildly\nneutron rich or even proton rich. In such conditions a wide variety of\ntrans-iron isotopes are synthesized, while the neutron richness is insufficient\nfor the production of r-process nuclei. In this capter, basic concepts of\nnucleosynthesis in neutrino-heated ejecta and neutrino-driven winds of\ncore-collapse supernovae are presented along with latest studies.\nNeutrino-heated ejecta indicate the early ejecta component within the first few\nseocnds in which anisotropic convective activities of material above the\nneutrinosphere become important for nucleosynthesis.

This question is\nimportant because some network properties may guarantee specific dynamical\nproperties, such as existence or uniqueness of equilibria, persistence,\npermanence, or global stability. Here we focus on this problem in the context\nof weakly reversible deficiency one networks. In particular, we describe an\nalgorithm for deciding if a polynomial dynamical system admits a weakly\nreversible deficiency one realization, and identifying one if it does exist. In\naddition, we show that weakly reversible deficiency one realizations can be\npartitioned into mutually exclusive Type I and Type II realizations, where Type\nI realizations guarantee existence and uniqueness of positive steady states,\nwhile Type II realizations are related to stoichiometric generators, and\ntherefore to multistability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 16:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

DS inpainting enjoys the complementary\nsynergy of its building blocks: It offers a high degree of anisotropy along an\neigendirection of the structure tensor. This enables it to connect interrupted\nstructures over large distances. Moreover, it benefits from the sharp edge\nstructure generated by the shock filter, and it exploits the efficient\nfilling-in effect of homogeneous diffusion.

To ensure safe interactions between AVs and HVs, it is crucial to\naccount for the uncertain behaviors of HVs when developing control strategies\nfor AVs. In this paper, we propose an efficient learning-based modeling\napproach for HVs that combines a first-principles model with a Gaussian process\n(GP) learning-based component. The GP model corrects the velocity prediction of\nthe first-principles model and estimates its uncertainty. Utilizing this model,\na model predictive control (MPC) strategy, referred to as GP-MPC, was designed\nto enhance the safe control of a mixed vehicle platoon by integrating the\nuncertainty assessment into the distance constraint. We compare our GP-MPC\nstrategy with a baseline MPC that uses only the first-principles model in\nsimulation studies. We show that our GP-MPC strategy provides more robust safe\ndistance guarantees and enables more efficient travel behaviors (higher travel\nspeeds) for all vehicles in the mixed platoon. Moreover, by incorporating a\nsparse GP technique in HV modeling and a dynamic GP prediction in MPC, we\nachieve an average computation time for GP-MPC at each time step that is only\n5% longer than the baseline MPC, which is approximately 100 times faster than\nour previous work that did not use these approximations. This work demonstrates\nhow learning-based modeling of HVs can enhance safety and efficiency in mixed\ntraffic involving AV-HV interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 16:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

In this\ncontext, autonomous racing is a new area of research that has been attracting\nconsiderable interest recently. Due to the fact that a vehicle is driven by its\nperception, planning, and control limits during racing, numerous research and\ndevelopment issues arise. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the\nautonomous racing system built by team KAIST for the Indy Autonomous Challenge\n(IAC). Our autonomy stack consists primarily of a multi-modal perception\nmodule, a high-speed overtaking planner, a resilient control stack, and a\nsystem status manager. We present the details of all components of our autonomy\nsolution, including algorithms, implementation, and unit test results. In\naddition, this paper outlines the design principles and the results of a\nsystematical analysis. Even though our design principles are derived from the\nunique application domain of autonomous racing, they can also be applied to a\nvariety of safety-critical, high-cost-of-failure robotics applications. The\nproposed system was integrated into a full-scale autonomous race car (Dallara\nAV-21) and field-tested extensively. As a result, team KAIST was one of three\nteams who qualified and participated in the official IAC race events without\nany accidents.

To address this issue, we propose an efficient DM for IR\n(DiffIR), which consists of a compact IR prior extraction network (CPEN),\ndynamic IR transformer (DIRformer), and denoising network.

In the second stage, we train the DM\nto directly estimate the same IRP as pretrained CPEN$_{S1}$ only using LQ\nimages. We observe that since the IPR is only a compact vector, DiffIR can use\nfewer iterations than traditional DM to obtain accurate estimations and\ngenerate more stable and realistic results. Since the iterations are few, our\nDiffIR can adopt a joint optimization of CPEN$_{S2}$, DIRformer, and denoising\nnetwork, which can further reduce the estimation error influence.

As\nan application, we use holomorphic Hamiltonian systems to establish a relation\nbetween Lefschetz fibrations and almost toric fibrations. During the\ninvestigation of action functionals for holomorphic Hamiltonian systems, we\nobserve that the complex structure $J$ corresponding to a holomorphic\nHamiltonian system poses strong restrictions on the existence of certain\ntrajectories.

Due to issues such as varying data\ndistribution and sequence length in different cycles, most existing methods\nrequire health feature extraction technique, which can be time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive. GRU can well solve this problem due to the simple structure\nand superior performance, receiving widespread attentions. However, redundant\ninformation still exists within the network and impacts the accuracy of SOH\nestimation. To address this issue, a new GRU network based on Hilbert-Schmidt\nIndependence Criterion (GRU-HSIC) is proposed. First, a zero masking network is\nused to transform all battery data measured with varying lengths every cycle\ninto sequences of the same length, while still retaining information about the\noriginal data size in each cycle. Second, the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence\nCriterion (HSIC) bottleneck, which evolved from Information Bottleneck (IB)\ntheory, is extended to GRU to compress the information from hidden layers. To\nevaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments on datasets from the\nCenter for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) of the University of\nMaryland and NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our model achieves higher accuracy than other recurrent\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 17:16:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

In this context, we propose the Mars Magnetospheric\nMultipoint Measurement Mission (M$^5$), a multi-spacecraft mission to study the\ndynamics and energy transport of the Martian induced magnetosphere\ncomprehensively.

This will aid the study of atmospheric\nescape processes of planets with induced magnetospheres. In order to resolve\nthe three-dimensional structures varying both in time and space, multi-point\nmeasurements are required. Thus, M$^5$ is a five spacecraft mission, with one\nsolar wind monitor orbiting Mars in a circular orbit at 5 Martian radii, and\nfour smaller spacecraft in a tetrahedral configuration orbiting Mars in an\nelliptical orbit, spanning the far magnetotail up to 6 Mars radii with a\nperiapsis within the Martian magnetosphere of 1.8 Mars radii.

In this paper, we\npropose FateZero, a zero-shot text-based editing method on real-world videos\nwithout per-prompt training or use-specific mask. To edit videos consistently,\nwe propose several techniques based on the pre-trained models. Firstly, in\ncontrast to the straightforward DDIM inversion technique, our approach captures\nintermediate attention maps during inversion, which effectively retain both\nstructural and motion information. These maps are directly fused in the editing\nprocess rather than generated during denoising. To further minimize semantic\nleakage of the source video, we then fuse self-attentions with a blending mask\nobtained by cross-attention features from the source prompt. Furthermore, we\nhave implemented a reform of the self-attention mechanism in denoising UNet by\nintroducing spatial-temporal attention to ensure frame consistency. Yet\nsuccinct, our method is the first one to show the ability of zero-shot\ntext-driven video style and local attribute editing from the trained\ntext-to-image model.

The performance of existing RS-CD methods is attributed to\ntraining on large annotated datasets. Furthermore, most of these models are\nless transferable in the sense that the trained model often performs very\npoorly when there is a domain gap between training and test datasets. This\npaper proposes an unsupervised CD method based on deep metric learning that can\ndeal with both of these issues. Given an MT-RSI, the proposed method generates\ncorresponding change probability map by iteratively optimizing an unsupervised\nCD loss without training it on a large dataset. Our unsupervised CD method\nconsists of two interconnected deep networks, namely Deep-Change Probability\nGenerator (D-CPG) and Deep-Feature Extractor (D-FE). The D-CPG is designed to\npredict change and no change probability maps for a given MT-RSI, while D-FE is\nused to extract deep features of MT-RSI that will be further used in the\nproposed unsupervised CD loss. We use transfer learning capability to\ninitialize the parameters of D-FE. We iteratively optimize the parameters of\nD-CPG and D-FE for a given MT-RSI by minimizing the proposed unsupervised\n``similarity-dissimilarity loss''. This loss is motivated by the principle of\nmetric learning where we simultaneously maximize the distance between change\npair-wise pixels while minimizing the distance between no-change pair-wise\npixels in bi-temporal image domain and their deep feature domain.

We run the generator continuously over 15\nhours, acquiring over 13.46 Gbits of random numbers, of which we ensure that at\nleast 60.52% are private, following the MDI protocol. Our results show the use\nof photonic lanterns to dynamically create spatial modes using only fiber\ncomponents, which due to their robustness and integration capabilities, have\nimportant consequences for photonic classical and quantum information\nprocessing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 18:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

Partial integrodifferential equations for the time evolution of the\nsize distribution for such phase separating systems can be formulated for\narbitrary initial conditions, but these are cumbersome for analyzing data on\nnon-scaling state preparations. Here we show that essential features of the\napproach to the scaling state can be captured by an exactly-solvable ordinary\ndifferential equation for the evolution of the average bubble size. The key\ningredient is to characterize the the bubble size distribution approximately,\nusing the average size of all bubbles and the average size of the critical\nbubbles, which instantaneously neither grow nor shrink. The difference between\nthese two averages serves as a proxy for the width of the size distribution. To\ntest our model, we compare with data for quasi-two dimensional dry foams\ncreated with three different initial amounts of polydispersity.

In the context of\nsurvival models with censored observations, Li et al. (2021) introduced the\nZ-residual, which follows an approximately normal distribution under the true\nmodel. This property makes it possible to use Z-residuals for diagnosing\nsurvival models in a way similar to how Pearson residuals are used in normal\nregression. However, computing residuals based on the full dataset can result\nin a conservative bias that reduces the power of detecting model\nmis-specification, as the same dataset is used for both model fitting and\nvalidation. Although cross-validation is a potential solution to this problem,\nit has not been commonly used in residual diagnostics due to computational\nchallenges. In this paper, we propose a cross-validation approach for computing\nZ-residuals in the context of shared frailty models. Specifically, we develop a\ngeneral function that calculates cross-validatory Z-residuals using the output\nfrom the \\texttt{coxph} function in the \\texttt{survival} package in R.Our\nsimulation studies demonstrate that, for goodness-of-fit tests and outlier\ndetection, cross-validatory Z-residuals are significantly more powerful and\nmore discriminative than Z-residuals without cross-validation. We also compare\nthe performance of Z-residuals with and without cross-validation in identifying\noutliers in a real application that models the recurrence time of kidney\ninfection patients. Our findings suggest that cross-validatory Z-residuals can\nidentify outliers that are missed by Z-residuals without cross-validation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 19:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

The new details that we see allow a number of\nimportant conclusions to be drawn on the nature of the hot gas and its origin\nas well as feedback on the ISM. We use archival data from Chandra with an\nexposure time of 570 ks. The Fexxv emission at 6.7 keV, expected from\nmetal-enriched hot gas, is enhanced only in a limited area close to the\nstarburst disc and is weak or almost absent over the rest of the diffuse\nemission, resulting in spatial variations in EW from <0.1 keV to 1.9 keV. This\nshows the presence of non-thermal emission due to inverse Compton scattering of\nthe FIR photons by radio emitting cosmic ray electrons. The morphological\nresemblance between the diffuse X-ray, radio, and FIR emission maps supports\nthis concept. Our decomposition of the diffuse emission spectrum indicates that\n~70% of the 4-8 keV luminosity originates from the inverse Compton emission.\nThe metal-rich hot gas with kT~5 keV makes a minor contribution to the 4-8 keV\ncontinuum, but it accounts for the majority of the observed Fexxv line. This\nhot gas appears to emerge from the circumnuclear starburst ring and fill the\ngalactic chimneys identified as mid-infrared and radio emission voids. The\nenergetics argument suggests that much of the supernova energy in the starburst\nsite has gone into creating the chimneys and is transported to the halo. We\nargue that a hot, rarefied environment produced by strong supernova feedback\nresults in displacing the brightest X-ray and radio supernova remnants which\nare instead found to reside in GMC. We find a faint X-ray source with a radio\ncounterpart, close to the kinematic centre of the galaxy and we carefully\nexamine the possibility that this source is a low-luminosity AGN in ADAF phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 20:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

In each episode of the search process, a NAS controller predicts a reward\nbased on a combination of accuracy on the downstream task and latency of\ninference.

In order to build\nthese atlases, subsets of neurons (e.g. serotonergic neurons, prefrontal\ncortical neurons etc.) are traced in individual brain samples by placing points\nalong dendrites and axons. Then, the traces are mapped to common coordinate\nsystems by transforming the positions of their points, which neglects how the\ntransformation bends the line segments in between. In this work, we apply the\ntheory of jets to describe how to preserve derivatives of neuron traces up to\nany order. We provide a framework to compute possible error introduced by\nstandard mapping methods, which involves the Jacobian of the mapping\ntransformation. We show how our first order method improves mapping accuracy in\nboth simulated and real neuron traces, though zeroth order mapping is generally\nadequate in our real data setting.

However, prevailing SR\nmodels suffer from prohibitive memory footprint and intensive computations,\nwhich limits further deployment on computational-constrained platforms. In this\nwork, we investigate the potential of network pruning for super-resolution to\ntake advantage of off-the-shelf network designs and reduce the underlying\ncomputational overhead. Two main challenges remain in applying pruning methods\nfor SR. First, the widely-used filter pruning technique reflects limited\ngranularity and restricted adaptability to diverse network structures. Second,\nexisting pruning methods generally operate upon a pre-trained network for the\nsparse structure determination, failing to get rid of dense model training in\nthe traditional SR paradigm. To address these challenges, we adopt unstructured\npruning with sparse models directly trained from scratch. Specifically, we\npropose a novel Iterative Soft Shrinkage-Percentage (ISS-P) method by\noptimizing the sparse structure of a randomly initialized network at each\niteration and tweaking unimportant weights with a small amount proportional to\nthe magnitude scale on-the-fly. We observe that the proposed ISS-P could\ndynamically learn sparse structures adapting to the optimization process and\npreserve the sparse model's trainability by yielding a more regularized\ngradient throughput. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed ISS-P compared with state-of-the-art methods over\ndiverse network architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 21:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

Previous work\nstudying the outgassing of silicate material has demonstrated that such\natmosphere-interior interactions can affect the atmosphere's overall structure\nand extent. But these models only considered SiO in an atmosphere of hydrogen\ngas, without considering chemical reactions between them. Here we couple\ncalculations of the chemical equilibrium between H, Si, and O species with an\natmospheric structure model. We find that substantial amounts of silane,\nSiH$_4$, and water, H$_2$O, are produced by the interaction between the\nsilicate-rich interior and hydrogen-rich atmosphere. These species extend high\ninto the atmosphere, though their abundance is greatest at the hottest, deepest\nregions. For example, for a 4 $M_\\oplus$ planet with an equilibrium temperature\nof 1000 K, a base temperature of 5000 K, and a 0.1 $M_\\oplus$ hydrogen\nenvelope, silicon species and water can comprise 30 percent of the atmosphere\nby number at the bottom of the atmosphere. Due to this abundance enhancement,\nwe find that convection is inhibited at temperatures $\\gtrsim 2500$ K. This\ntemperature is lower, implying that the resultant non-convective region is\nthicker, than was found in previous models which did not account for\natmospheric chemistry. Our findings show that significant endogenous water is\nbe produced by magma-hydrogen interactions alone, without the need to accrete\nice-rich material.

However, researchers have increasingly\nobserved that machine learning practice easily leads to systematic errors in AI\napplications, a phenomenon referred to as AI blindspots. Such blindspots arise\nwhen a model is trained with training samples (e.g., cat/dog classification)\nwhere important patterns (e.g., black cats) are missing or\nperiphery/undesirable patterns (e.g., dogs with grass background) are\nmisleading towards a certain class.

To optimize the multi-mode vehicle globally, this paper studies a\nMIMO control method for energy management of the multi-mode PHEV based on\nmulti-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL).

MOT aims to maintain the identities of multiple objects across\na series of continuous video sequences. In recent years, MOT has made rapid\nprogress. However, modeling the motion and appearance models of objects in\ncomplex scenes still faces various challenging issues. In this paper, we design\na novel direction consistency method for smooth trajectory prediction (STP-DC)\nto increase the modeling of motion information and overcome the lack of\nrobustness in previous methods in complex scenes. Existing methods use\npedestrian re-identification (Re-ID) to model appearance, however, they extract\nmore background information which lacks discriminability in occlusion and\ncrowded scenes. We propose a hyper-grain feature embedding network (HG-FEN) to\nenhance the modeling of appearance models, thus generating robust appearance\ndescriptors. We also proposed other robustness techniques, including CF-ECM for\nstoring robust appearance information and SK-AS for improving association\naccuracy. To achieve state-of-the-art performance in MOT, we propose a robust\ntracker named Rt-track, incorporating various tricks and techniques.

Deep learning classifiers can\nprovide an early warning signal (EWS) for critical transitions by learning\ngeneric features of bifurcations (dynamical instabilities) from large simulated\ntraining data sets. So far, classifiers have only been trained to predict\ncontinuous-time bifurcations, ignoring rich dynamics unique to discrete-time\nbifurcations. Here, we train a deep learning classifier to provide an EWS for\nthe five local discrete-time bifurcations of codimension-1. We test the\nclassifier on simulation data from discrete-time models used in physiology,\neconomics and ecology, as well as experimental data of spontaneously beating\nchick-heart aggregates that undergo a period-doubling bifurcation. The\nclassifier outperforms commonly used EWS under a wide range of noise\nintensities and rates of approach to the bifurcation. It also predicts the\ncorrect bifurcation in most cases, with particularly high accuracy for the\nperiod-doubling, Neimark-Sacker and fold bifurcations.

Wi-Fi sensing enables\ngame-changing applications in remote healthcare, home entertainment, and home\nsurveillance, among others. However, existing work leverages the manual\nextraction of channel state information (CSI) from Wi-Fi chips to classify\nactivities, which is not supported by the Wi-Fi standard and hence requires the\nusage of specialized equipment. On the contrary, BeamSense leverages the\nstandard-compliant beamforming feedback information (BFI) to characterize the\npropagation environment. Conversely from CSI, the BFI (i) can be easily\nrecorded without any firmware modification, and (ii) captures the multiple\nchannels between the access point and the stations, thus providing much better\nsensitivity. BeamSense includes a novel cross-domain few-shot learning (FSL)\nalgorithm to handle unseen environments and subjects with few additional data\npoints. We evaluate BeamSense through an extensive data collection campaign\nwith three subjects performing twenty different activities in three different\nenvironments. We show that our BFI-based approach achieves about 10% more\naccuracy when compared to CSI-based prior work, while our FSL strategy improves\naccuracy by up to 30% and 80% when compared with state-of-the-art cross-domain\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 23:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

Then a normality hypothesis was contrasted by means of the\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test, and since it was significant in all cases, the overall\ncomparison of groups was performed using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis\ntest.

Observational\nstudies are restricted in the kinds of causal questions they can answer and\nnaive A/B tests often lead to biased evaluations due to unaccounted network\ninterference. Furthermore, evaluations in simulation settings are often limited\nto static network models that do not take into account the potential feedback\nloops between link recommendation and organic network evolution. To this end,\nwe study the impacts of recommendations on social networks in dynamic settings.\nAdopting a simulation-based approach, we consider an explicit dynamic formation\nmodel -- an extension of the celebrated Jackson-Rogers model -- and investigate\nhow link recommendations affect network evolution over time. Empirically, we\nfind that link recommendations have surprising delayed and indirect effects on\nthe structural properties of networks. Specifically, we find that link\nrecommendations can exhibit considerably different impacts in the immediate\nterm and in the long term. For instance, we observe that friend-of-friend\nrecommendations can have an immediate effect in decreasing degree inequality,\nbut in the long term, they can make the degree distribution substantially more\nunequal. Moreover, we show that the effects of recommendations can persist in\nnetworks, in part due to their indirect impacts on natural dynamics even after\nrecommendations are turned off. We show that, in counterfactual simulations,\nremoving the indirect effects of link recommendations can make the network\ntrend faster toward what it would have been under natural growth dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 00:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

Prompt detection of such events can prevent potential\nlosses in terms of finances, information, and human resources. With the\nadvancement of computational capabilities and the availability of large\ndatasets, anomaly detection has become a major area of research. Among these,\nanomaly detection in time series has gained more attention recently due to the\nadded complexity imposed by the time dimension. This study presents a novel\nframework for time series anomaly detection using a combination of\nBidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) architecture and Autoencoder.\nThe Bi-LSTM network, which comprises two unidirectional LSTM networks, can\nanalyze the time series data from both directions and thus effectively discover\nthe long-term dependencies hidden in the sequential data.

It remains unclear whether the assembly\nof (some) BCGs is essential to the formation of a mature cluster core or vice\nversa. Here we report the detection of a pair of massive quiescent galaxies\nlikely in the process of merging at the centre of the spectroscopically\nconfirmed, extremely massive protocluster BOSS1244 at a look-back time of 10.58\nbillion years. These galaxies, BOSS1244-QG1 ($5.25\\times 10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$)\nand BOSS1244-QG2 ($1.32\\times 10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$), were detected with Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) grism slitless spectroscopic observations.

BOSS1244-QG1 and\nBOSS1244-QG2 are separated by a projected distance of about 70 physical\nkiloparsecs, implying that we are likely to be witnessing them during the\nformation of a massive BCG, through a dry merger with size and mass similiar to\nthe most massive BCGs in the local Universe. We thus infer that BCG formation\nhave taken place before the virialization of the cluster core, which shatter\nand broaden our previous understanding the BCGs in the mature galaxy clusters.\nMoreover, we find for the first time in BOSS1244 a strong density-star\nformation relation over a scale of 20 co-moving Mpc, implying that the\nquenching of star formation in BCGs and their progenitors is likely governed by\nenvironment-related processes before the virialization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 01:52:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 08:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

However,\ndesigning lightweight and low-latency ViT models for diverse mobile devices\nremains a big challenge. In this work, we propose ElasticViT, a two-stage NAS\napproach that trains a high-quality ViT supernet over a very large search space\nthat supports a wide range of mobile devices, and then searches an optimal\nsub-network (subnet) for direct deployment. However, prior supernet training\nmethods that rely on uniform sampling suffer from the gradient conflict issue:\nthe sampled subnets can have vastly different model sizes (e.g., 50M vs. 2G\nFLOPs), leading to different optimization directions and inferior performance.\nTo address this challenge, we propose two novel sampling techniques:\ncomplexity-aware sampling and performance-aware sampling. Complexity-aware\nsampling limits the FLOPs difference among the subnets sampled across adjacent\ntraining steps, while covering different-sized subnets in the search space.\nPerformance-aware sampling further selects subnets that have good accuracy,\nwhich can reduce gradient conflicts and improve supernet quality. Our\ndiscovered models, ElasticViT models, achieve top-1 accuracy from 67.2% to\n80.0% on ImageNet from 60M to 800M FLOPs without extra retraining,\noutperforming all prior CNNs and ViTs in terms of accuracy and latency.

However, recent works show the adversary can\nforge non-existent cars in the prediction results with a few fake points (i.e.,\nappearing attack). By removing statistical outliers, existing defenses are\nhowever designed for specific attacks or biased by predefined heuristic rules.\nTowards more comprehensive mitigation, we first systematically inspect the\nmechanism of recent appearing attacks: Their common weaknesses are observed in\ncrafting fake obstacles which (i) have obvious differences in the local parts\ncompared with real obstacles and (ii) violate the physical relation between\ndepth and point density. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play\ndefensive module which works by side of a trained LiDAR-based object detector\nto eliminate forged obstacles where a major proportion of local parts have low\nobjectness, i.e., to what degree it belongs to a real object. At the core of\nour module is a local objectness predictor, which explicitly incorporates the\ndepth information to model the relation between depth and point density, and\npredicts each local part of an obstacle with an objectness score. Extensive\nexperiments show, our proposed defense eliminates at least 70% cars forged by\nthree known appearing attacks in most cases, while, for the best previous\ndefense, less than 30% forged cars are eliminated. Meanwhile, under the same\ncircumstance, our defense incurs less overhead for AP/precision on cars\ncompared with existing defenses.

While filter and channel pruning are preferable to other structure\npruning methods in terms of realistic acceleration and hardware compatibility,\npruning methods with a finer granularity, such as intra-channel pruning, are\nexpected to be capable of yielding more compact and computationally efficient\nnetworks. Typical intra-channel pruning methods utilize a static and\nhand-crafted pruning granularity due to a large search space, which leaves room\nfor improvement in their pruning performance. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel structure pruning method, termed as dynamic structure pruning, to\nidentify optimal pruning granularities for intra-channel pruning. In contrast\nto existing intra-channel pruning methods, the proposed method automatically\noptimizes dynamic pruning granularities in each layer while training deep\nneural networks.

To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a\nspatio-temporal decomposition algorithm to solve the C-ED in a distributed and\nparallel manner. In the temporal dimension, the multi-period economic dispatch\n(ED) of transmission grid (TG) is decomposed to several subproblems by\nintroducing auxiliary variables and overlapping time intervals to deal with the\ntemporal coupling constraints. Besides, an accelerated alternative direction\nmethod of multipliers (A-ADMM) based temporal decomposition algorithm with the\nwarm-start strategy, is developed to solve the ED subproblems of TG in\nparallel. In the spatial dimension, a multi-parametric programming projection\nbased spatial decomposition algorithm is developed to coordinate the ED\nproblems of TG and DNs in a distributed manner. To further improve the\nconvergence performance of the spatial decomposition algorithm, the aggregate\nequivalence approach is used for determining the feasible range of boundary\nvariables of TG and DNs.

The standard Hamiltonian function that describes\nthe dynamics of interacting point vortices of constant strength is the\nKirchhoff-Routh (KR) function. This function was not obtained from basic\ndefinitions of classical mechanics (i.e., in terms of kinetic and potential\nenergies), but it was rather devised to match the already known differential\nequations of motion for constant-strength point vortices given by the\nBio-Savart law. Instead, we develop a new variational formulation for vortex\ndynamics based on the principle of least action. As an application, we consider\na system of non-deforming, free vortex patches of constant-strength.\nInterestingly, the obtained equations of motion are second-order differential\nequations defining vortex accelerations, not velocities. In the special case of\nconstant-strength point vortices, the new formulation reduces to the motion\ndetermined from the KR function. However, for finite-core vortices, the\nresulting dynamics are more complex than those obtained from the KR\nformulation. For example, a pair of equal-strength, counter-rotating vortices\ncould be initialized with different velocities, resulting in interesting\npatterns which cannot be handled by the KR approach. Also, the developed model\neasily admits external body forces (e.g., electromagnetic). The interaction\nbetween the electrodynamic force and the hydrodynamic vortex force leads to a\nrich, counter-intuitive behavior that could not be handled by the KR\nformulation. Finally, this new variational formulation, which is derived from\nfirst principles in mechanics, can be easily extended to deforming and/or\narbitrary time-varying vortices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 03:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

Existing methods for this problem typically assume\nsparse linear models for both outcome and univariate treatment, and cannot\nhandle situations with ultra-high dimensional covariates. In this paper, we\npropose a new covariate selection strategy called double screening prior\nadaptive lasso (DSPAL) to select confounders and predictors of the outcome for\nmultivariate treatments, which combines the adaptive lasso method with the\nmarginal conditional (in)dependence prior information to select target\ncovariates, in order to eliminate confounding bias and improve statistical\nefficiency. The distinctive features of our proposal are that it can be applied\nto high-dimensional or even ultra-high dimensional covariates for multivariate\ntreatments, and can deal with the cases of both parametric and nonparametric\noutcome models, which makes it more robust compared to other methods. Our\ntheoretical analyses show that the proposed procedure enjoys the sure screening\nproperty, the ranking consistency property and the variable selection\nconsistency. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed\napproach selects all confounders and predictors consistently and estimates the\nmultivariate treatment effects with smaller bias and mean squared error\ncompared to several alternatives under various scenarios.

These\nMVs are updated repeatedly upon new data ingestion (e.g., daily), from which\ndatabase admins can observe performance metrics (e.g., refresh time of each MV,\nsize on disk) in a consistent way for different types of updates (full vs.\nincremental) and for different systems (single node, distributed,\ncloud-hosted). One missed opportunity is that existing data systems treat those\nMV updates as independent SQL statements without fully exploiting their\ndependency information and performance metrics. However, if we know that the\nresult of a SQL statement will be consumed immediately after for subsequent\noperations, those subsequent operations do not have to wait until the early\nresults are fully materialized on storage because the results are already\nreadily available in memory. Of course, this may come at a cost because keeping\nresults in memory (even temporarily) will reduce the amount of available\nmemory; thus, our decision should be careful. In this paper, we introduce a new\nsystem, called S/C, which tackles this problem through efficient creation and\nupdate of a set of MVs with acyclic dependencies among them. S/C judiciously\nuses bounded memory to reduce end-to-end MV refresh time by short-circuiting\nexpensive reads and writes; S/C's objective function accurately estimates time\nsavings from keeping intermediate data in memory for particular periods. Our\nsolution jointly optimizes an MV refresh order, what data to keep in memory,\nand when to release data from memory. At a high level, S/C still materializes\nall data exactly as defined in MV definitions; thus, it doesn't impact any\nservice-level agreements.

To handle hard samples, we propose a novel method for\nconstructing heterogeneous a priori graphs incorporating three forms of\ninter-pill relationships, including co-occurrence likelihood, relative size,\nand visual semantic correlation. We then offer a framework for integrating a\npriori with pills' visual features to enhance detection accuracy. Our\nexperimental results have proved the robustness, reliability, and\nexplainability of the proposed framework. Experimentally, it outperforms all\ndetection benchmarks in terms of all evaluation metrics. Specifically, our\nproposed framework improves COCO mAP metrics by 9.4% over Faster R-CNN and\n12.0% compared to vanilla YOLOv5. Our study opens up new opportunities for\nprotecting patients from medication errors using an AI-based pill\nidentification solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 05:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

However,\ncurrent researches for robust fusion are all learning-based frameworks, which\ndemand a large amount of training data and are inconvenient to implement in new\nscenes. In this paper, we propose GOOD, a general optimization-based fusion\nframework that can achieve satisfying detection without training additional\nmodels and is available for any combinations of 2D and 3D detectors to improve\nthe accuracy and robustness of 3D detection. First we apply the mutual-sided\nnearest-neighbor probability model to achieve the 3D-2D data association. Then\nwe design an optimization pipeline that can optimize different kinds of\ninstances separately based on the matching result. Apart from this, the 3D MOT\nmethod is also introduced to enhance the performance aided by previous frames.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first optimization-based late fusion\nframework for multi-modal 3D object detection which can be served as a baseline\nfor subsequent research.

As the size of ferroelectric domains\nshrinks to nanometer scale, the heterogeneity of the polarization pattern\nbecomes increasingly pronounced, enabling a large variety of possible polar\ntextures in nanocrystalline and nanocomposite materials. Critical to the\nunderstanding of fundamental physics of such materials and hence their\napplications in electronic nanodevices, is the ability to investigate their\nferroelectric polarization at the nanoscale in a non-destructive way.

Using Kokam 7.5 Ah pouch cell\n(ModelSLPB75106100) as an example, we demonstrate the three-step workflow of\nthe framework that consists of the characterisation data acquisition,\nparametrisation with BatPar, and 3D ECN-simulation with PyECN. With this\nframework, we simulate constant current discharge experiments in the literature\nand compare the simulations with DFN model that coupled with a classical lumped\nthermal model. With a better consideration of thermal process and its coupling\neffects with electrochemistry, the computational model outperforms DFN model,\nespecially at low-temperature and/or high C-rate scenarios. The largest\npredicting error of the framework at 3 C-rate &Tam = 25oC and at 1 C-rate &Tam\n= 0 oC is approximately 1/3 of that for DFN model. At 3 C-rate &Tam = 5oC, the\ndifference between these two can rise to 377 mV. Further analysis reveals that\nthe lumped DFN + thermal model is unsuitable to simulate the performance of\nLi-ion batteries at a scale larger than cell level, due to significant internal\nheat generation and large Biot number. By integrating DFN and 3D-distributed\nECN together, this proposed computational framework is\nelectrochemical-electro-thermal coupled and can be used as a toolset by cell\nmanufacturers and pack designers to predict, analyse, and optimise the\nperformance of Li-based energy storage systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 08:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

We investigate the\ncorrelation between the TeV luminosity, which has been compensated for\nattenuation from extragalactic background light, and the synchrotron peak\nfrequency. We note that there is no correlation between TeV luminosity and peak\nfrequency in the quiescent state and a strong anti-correlation in the flaring\nstate for the observed value. However, there is a strong positive correlation\nin both the quiescent state and the flaring state for the intrinsic value. This\nindicates that the blazar sequence is shown in the flaring state rather than in\nthe quiescent state for the observed value and the blazar sequence is not\npresent in both two states after removing the beaming effect. In addition, to\nconfirm whether the beaming effect results in the blazar sequence, we compare\nthe \\textit{Fermi} $\\gamma$-ray luminosity between the quiescent state and the\nflaring state. We find the \\textit{Fermi} $\\gamma$-ray luminosity in the\nflaring state is greater than that in the quiescent state and the Doppler\nfactor in the flaring state is greater.

Previously, direct\naccurate predictions of image probabilities were not possible due to\ncomputational limitations. Despite the exploration of this idea being indirect,\nmainly based on oversimplified models of the image density or on system design\nmethods, these methods had success in reproducing a wide range of physiological\nand psychophysical phenomena. In this paper, we directly evaluate the\nprobability of natural images and analyse how it may determine perceptual\nsensitivity. We employ image quality metrics that correlate well with human\nopinion as a surrogate of human vision, and an advanced generative model to\ndirectly estimate the probability. Specifically, we analyse how the sensitivity\nof full-reference image quality metrics can be predicted from quantities\nderived directly from the probability distribution of natural images. First, we\ncompute the mutual information between a wide range of probability surrogates\nand the sensitivity of the metrics and find that the most influential factor is\nthe probability of the noisy image. Then we explore how these probability\nsurrogates can be combined using a simple model to predict the metric\nsensitivity, giving an upper bound for the correlation of 0.85 between the\nmodel predictions and the actual perceptual sensitivity. Finally, we explore\nhow to combine the probability surrogates using simple expressions, and obtain\ntwo functional forms (using one or two surrogates) that can be used to predict\nthe sensitivity of the human visual system given a particular pair of images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 10:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

Our main additions are: the\ncomputation of the velocity field in the LPT gravity model, the fully nonlinear\ndisplacement of the evolved, biased density field to redshift space, and a\nsystematic expansion of velocity bias. We test the resulting analysis pipeline\nby applying it to synthetic data sets with a known ground truth at increasing\ncomplexity: mock data generated from the perturbative forward model itself,\nsub-sampled matter particles, and dark matter halos in N-body simulations. By\nfixing the initial-time density contrast to the ground truth, while varying the\ngrowth rate $f$, bias coefficients and noise amplitudes, we perform a stringent\nset of checks.

The latter in particular are well known to have\na drastic influence on the magnetic resistivities in the dense ISM such as\ncollapsing dense cores.

Often, these planets are found to orbit near to the zone of dynamical\ninstability, close to the central binary. The existence of these planets has\nbeen explained by hydrodynamical simulations that show that migrating\ncircumbinary planets, embedded in circumbinary discs, halt at the central\ncavity that is formed by the central binary. Transit surveys are naturally most\nsensitive to finding circumbinary planets with the shortest orbital periods.\nThe future promise of detecting longer period systems using radial-velocity\nsearches, combined with the anticipated detection of numerous circumbinary\nplanets by ESA's PLATO mission, points to the need to model and understand the\nformation and evolution of circumbinary planets in a more general sense than\nhas been considered before.

Examples of these applications include pedestrian\ntracking systems in large areas. Although the ubiquity of camera-based systems,\nthey are not a preferable solution due to the vulnerability of leaking the\nprivacy of pedestrians. In this paper, we introduce a novel privacy-preserving\nsystem for pedestrian tracking in smart environments using multiple distributed\nLiDARs of non-overlapping views. The system is designed to leverage LiDAR\ndevices to track pedestrians in partially covered areas due to practical\nconstraints, e.g., occlusion or cost. Therefore, the system uses the point\ncloud captured by different LiDARs to extract discriminative features that are\nused to train a metric learning model for pedestrian matching purposes. To\nboost the system's robustness, we leverage a probabilistic approach to model\nand adapt the dynamic mobility patterns of individuals and thus connect their\nsub-trajectories. We deployed the system in a large-scale testbed with 70\ncolorless LiDARs and conducted three different experiments. The evaluation\nresult at the entrance hall confirms the system's ability to accurately track\nthe pedestrians with a 0.98 F-measure even with zero-covered areas.

Compared with frame-based sensors,\nevent cameras have microsecond-level latency and high dynamic range, hence\nshowing great potential for object detection under high-speed motion and poor\nillumination conditions. Due to sparsity and asynchronism nature with event\nstreams, most of existing approaches resort to hand-crafted methods to convert\nevent data into 2D grid representation. However, they are sub-optimal in\naggregating information from event stream for object detection. In this work,\nwe propose to learn an event representation optimized for event-based object\ndetection. Specifically, event streams are divided into grids in the x-y-t\ncoordinates for both positive and negative polarity, producing a set of pillars\nas 3D tensor representation. To fully exploit information with event streams to\ndetect objects, a dual-memory aggregation network (DMANet) is proposed to\nleverage both long and short memory along event streams to aggregate effective\ninformation for object detection. Long memory is encoded in the hidden state of\nadaptive convLSTMs while short memory is modeled by computing spatial-temporal\ncorrelation between event pillars at neighboring time intervals. Extensive\nexperiments on the recently released event-based automotive detection dataset\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 12:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

However, semi-SL assumes that the underlying\ndistribution of unaudited data matches that of the few labeled samples, which\nis often violated in practical settings, particularly in medical images. The\npresence of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in the unlabeled training pool of\nsemi-SL is inevitable and can reduce the efficiency of the algorithm. Common\npreprocessing methods to filter out outlier samples may not be suitable for\nmedical images that involve a wide range of anatomical structures and rare\nmorphologies. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for addressing\nopen-set supervised learning challenges in digital histology images. Our\npipeline efficiently estimates an OOD score for each unlabelled data point\nbased on self-supervised learning to calibrate the knowledge needed for a\nsubsequent semi-SL framework. The outlier score derived from the OOD detector\nis used to modulate sample selection for the subsequent semi-SL stage, ensuring\nthat samples conforming to the distribution of the few labeled samples are more\nfrequently exposed to the subsequent semi-SL framework.

Acoustic measurements are one way to obtain\nhigh-quality HRTFs. To reduce measurement time, cost, and complexity of\nmeasurement systems, a promising approach is to capture only a few HRTFs on a\nsparse sampling grid and then upsample them to a dense HRTF set by\ninterpolation. However, HRTF interpolation is challenging because small changes\nin source position can result in significant changes in the HRTF phase and\nmagnitude response. Previous studies greatly improved the interpolation by\ntime-aligning the HRTFs in preprocessing, but magnitude interpolation errors,\nespecially in contralateral regions, remain a problem. Building upon the\ntime-alignment approaches, we propose an additional post-interpolation\nmagnitude correction derived from a frequency-smoothed HRTF representation.\nEmploying all 96 individual simulated HRTF sets of the HUTUBS database, we show\nthat the magnitude correction significantly reduces interpolation errors\ncompared to state-of-the-art interpolation methods applying only time\nalignment. Our analysis shows that when upsampling very sparse HRTF sets, the\nsubject-averaged magnitude error in the critical higher frequency range is up\nto 1.5 dB lower when averaged over all directions and even up to 4 dB lower in\nthe contralateral region. As a result, the interaural level differences in the\nupsampled HRTFs are considerably improved. The proposed algorithm thus has the\npotential to further reduce the minimum number of HRTFs required for\nperceptually transparent interpolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 13:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

Experimental results show that NA improves all 10 tested baseline\ndetectors by 13% (from 0.70 to 0.79 AUC) on average evaluated on nine\nreal-world datasets. Moreover, even outlier detectors that are already based on\nk-NN are also improved. The experiments also show that in some applications,\nthe choice of detector is no more significant when detectors are jointly used\nwith NA, which may pose a challenge to the generally considered idea that the\ndata model is the most important factor.

The optical\nproperties of dust are often estimated using the small particle limit (SPL)\napproximation, and it has been used frequently in modelling AGB stellar winds\nwhen performing radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations.

It aims at providing accurate IR SFR and $M_\\star$\ncalibrations that account for SP age and extinction while quantifying their\nscatter. We use the CIGALE spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code to\ncreate models of galaxies with a wide range of star-formation histories, dust\ncontent, and interstellar medium properties. We fit the relations between\n$M_\\star$ and SFR with IR and optical photometry of the model-galaxy SEDs with\nthe MCMC method, and perform a machine-learning random forest analysis on the\nsame data set in order to validate the latter. This work provides calibrations\nfor the SFR using a combination of the WISE bands 1 and 3, or the JWST F200W\nand F2100W bands.

We outline an\nestimator that is a weighted average of IV estimates within each stratum,\nweighing the stratum estimates by their estimated proportion of compliers.

So there is no preferred time at which to decay -- in this\nsense it is a random process. Here we show, by carefully engineering this\nlight-matter interaction, that we can associate it with a clock, where the\nmatter constitutes the clockwork and the spontaneous emission constitutes the\nticking of the clock. In particular, we show how to realise the quasi-ideal\nclock. Said clock has been proven -- in an abstract and theoretic sense -- to\nbe the most accurate clock permissible by quantum theory, with a polynomial\nenhancement in precision over the best stochastic clock of the same size. Our\nresults thus demonstrate that the seemingly random process of spontaneous\nemission can in actual fact, under the right circumstances, be the most regular\none permissible by quantum theory. To achieve this we use geometric features\nand flux-loop insertions to induce symmetry and Berry phases into the\nlight-matter coupling. We also study the entropy the clock produces per tick\nand show that it also possesses a quantum advantage over that generated from\nthe previously known semi-classical clocks in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 14:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

The\nreduction process is computationally expensive and strategies for reducing the\nfrequency of reduction and the re-utilization of the generated reduced\nmechanisms are key in making DAC methods computationally affordable. In this\nstudy, a new method hereby referred as Tabulated Reactions for Adaptive\nChemistry (TRAC) is proposed to correlate chemical states with their reduced\nmechanisms in order to reduce both the frequency of reduction and to allow for\nre-utilization of reduced chemical schemes.

In this work we use the DEMNUni\ncosmological simulations with massive neutrino cosmologies to study the\nneutrino impact on voids selected in photometric surveys, e.g. via Luminous Red\nGalaxies, as well as on the void- CMB lensing cross-correlation. We show how\nthe void properties observed in this way (size function, profiles) are affected\nby the presence of massive neutrinos compared to the neutrino massless case,\nand show how these can vary as a function of the selection method of the void\nsample. We comment on the possibility for massive neutrinos to be the source of\nthe aforementioned tension. Finally, we identify the most promising setup to\ndetect signatures of massive neutrinos in the voids-CMB lensing\ncross-correlation and define a new quantity useful to distinguish among\ndifferent neutrino masses by comparing future observations against predictions\nfrom simulations including massive neutrinos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 15:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

Towards this aim, we extend\nthe 'ExoGaia Model' - an abstract model of microbial life living on a highly\nsimplified 0-dimensional planet. Via their metabolisms, microbes influence the\natmospheric composition and therefore the temperature of the planet and\nemergent feedback loops allow microbes to regulate their climate and maintain\nlong term habitability.

Purpose: This work aims at\nusing deep learning to efficiently estimate posterior distributions of imaging\nparameters, which in turn can be used to derive the most probable parameters as\nwell as their uncertainties. Methods: Our deep learning-based approaches are\nbased on a variational Bayesian inference framework, which is implemented using\ntwo different deep neural networks based on conditional variational\nauto-encoder (CVAE), CVAE-dual-encoder and CVAE-dual-decoder. The conventional\nCVAE framework, i.e., CVAE-vanilla, can be regarded as a simplified case of\nthese two neural networks.

A similar four-level\nsystem is assumed to connect the ${\\nu}_3$+${\\nu}_1$-${\\nu}_3$ and\n${\\nu}_3$+${\\nu}_4$-${\\nu}_3$ hot bands, which appear due to the population of\nthe low-lying ${\\nu}_3$ state at room temperature, with the\n2${\\nu}_2$+2${\\nu}_3$ and ${\\nu}_2$+${\\nu}_3$-${\\nu}_6$$^{\\pm2}$ perturbing\nstates. This treatment provides a good global agreement of the simulated\nspectra with experiment, and hence accurate line lists and band parameters of\nthe four connected vibrational states in each system. Overall, we assign 4665\ntransitions in the fundamental band system, with an average error of 0.00071\ncm$^{-1}$, a factor of two better than earlier work on the ${\\nu}_1$ band using\nconventional Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The ${\\nu}_1$ band shows\nhyperfine splitting, resolvable for transitions with J $\\le$ 2 x K. Finally,\nthe spectral intensities of 65 lines of the ${\\nu}_1$ band and 7 lines of the\n${\\nu}_3$+${\\nu}_1$-${\\nu}_3$ band are reported for the first time using the\nVoigt line shape as a model in multispectral fitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 15:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

However, all\nprevious work ignores the relationship between the influence block effect and\ncounts of impressions on the user. In this paper, we study the problem of\nminimizing the spread of rumors when impression counts. Given a graph $G(V,E)$,\na rumor set $R \\in V$ and a budget $k$, it aims to find a protector set $P \\in\nV \\backslash R$ to minimize the spread of the rumor set $R$ under the budget\n$k$. Due to the impression counts, two following challenges of our problem need\nto be overcome: (1) our problem is NP-hard; (2) the influence block is\nnon-submodular, which means a straightforward greedy approach is not\napplicable. Hence, we devise a branch-and-bound framework for this problem with\na ($1-1/e-\\epsilon$) approximation ratio. To further improve the efficiency, we\nspeed up our framework with a progressive upper bound estimation method, which\nachieves a ($1-1/e-\\epsilon - \\rho$) approximation ratio.

In this paper, we position prompting as one instantiation of\nPET, and propose a unified CL framework with general PET, dubbed as\nLearning-Accumulation-Ensemble (LAE). PET, e.g., using Adapter, LoRA, or\nPrefix, can adapt a pre-trained model to downstream tasks with fewer parameters\nand resources. Given a PET method, our LAE framework incorporates it for CL\nwith three novel designs. 1) Learning: the pre-trained model adapts to the new\ntask by tuning an online PET module, along with our adaptation speed\ncalibration to align different PET modules, 2) Accumulation: the task-specific\nknowledge learned by the online PET module is accumulated into an offline PET\nmodule through momentum update, 3) Ensemble: During inference, we respectively\nconstruct two experts with online/offline PET modules (which are favored by the\nnovel/historical tasks) for prediction ensemble. We show that LAE is compatible\nwith a battery of PET methods and gains strong CL capability.

The SFE algorithm\nperforms its search process using a search agent and two operators:\nnon-selection and selection. It comprises two phases: exploration and\nexploitation. In the exploration phase, the non-selection operator performs a\nglobal search in the entire problem search space for the irrelevant, redundant,\ntrivial, and noisy features, and changes the status of the features from\nselected mode to non-selected mode. In the exploitation phase, the selection\noperator searches the problem search space for the features with a high impact\non the classification results, and changes the status of the features from\nnon-selected mode to selected mode. The proposed SFE is successful in feature\nselection from high-dimensional datasets. However, after reducing the\ndimensionality of a dataset, its performance cannot be increased significantly.\nIn these situations, an evolutionary computational method could be used to find\na more efficient subset of features in the new and reduced search space. To\novercome this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid algorithm, SFE-PSO (particle\nswarm optimization) to find an optimal feature subset. The efficiency and\neffectiveness of the SFE and the SFE-PSO for feature selection are compared on\n40 high-dimensional datasets. Their performances were compared with six\nrecently proposed feature selection algorithms. The results obtained indicate\nthat the two proposed algorithms significantly outperform the other algorithms,\nand can be used as efficient and effective algorithms in selecting features\nfrom high-dimensional datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 12:28:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Its goal is to go beyond classical assumptions in machine\nlearning and develop models and learning strategies that present high\nrobustness in dynamic environments. The landscape of CL research is fragmented\ninto several learning evaluation protocols, comprising different learning\ntasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, the benchmarks adopted\nso far are still distant from the complexity of real-world scenarios, and are\nusually tailored to highlight capabilities specific to certain strategies. In\nsuch a landscape, it is hard to objectively assess strategies. In this work, we\nfill this gap for CL on image data by introducing two novel CL benchmarks that\ninvolve multiple heterogeneous tasks from six image datasets, with varying\nlevels of complexity and quality. Our aim is to fairly evaluate current\nstate-of-the-art CL strategies on a common ground that is closer to complex\nreal-world scenarios. We additionally structure our benchmarks so that tasks\nare presented in increasing and decreasing order of complexity -- according to\na curriculum -- in order to evaluate if current CL models are able to exploit\nstructure across tasks. We devote particular emphasis to providing the CL\ncommunity with a rigorous and reproducible evaluation protocol for measuring\nthe ability of a model to generalize and not to forget while learning.\nFurthermore, we provide an extensive experimental evaluation showing that\npopular CL strategies, when challenged with our benchmarks, yield sub-par\nperformance, high levels of forgetting, and present a limited ability to\neffectively leverage curriculum task ordering.

Realizing\nits full potential, however, requires a closed loop between CAD and CAE (i.e.,\nCAD/CAE integration) with automatic design modifications and simulation\nupdates. Conventionally the approach of model conversion is often employed to\nform the loop, but this way of working is hard to automate and requires manual\ninputs. As a result, the overall optimization process is too laborious to be\nacceptable. To address this issue, a new method for parametric optimization is\nintroduced in this paper, based on a unified model representation scheme called\neXtended Voxels (XVoxels). This scheme hybridizes feature models and voxel\nmodels into a new concept of semantic voxels, where the voxel part is\nresponsible for FEM solving, and the semantic part is responsible for\nhigh-level information to capture both design and simulation intents. As such,\nit can establish a direct mapping between design models and analysis models,\nwhich in turn enables automatic updates on simulation results for design\nmodifications, and vice versa -- effectively a closed loop between CAD and CAE.\nIn addition, robust and efficient geometric algorithms for manipulating XVoxel\nmodels and efficient numerical methods (based on the recent finite cell method)\nfor simulating XVoxel models are provided. The presented method has been\nvalidated by a series of case studies of increasing complexity to demonstrate\nits effectiveness. In particular, a computational efficiency improvement of up\nto 55.8 times the existing FCM method has been seen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 13:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

The objectives are: (1) to elucidate the uneven social media\nusage among various demographic groups and the disparities of their emotions\ntoward COVID-19, (2) to construct an unbiased measurement for public sentiment\nbased on social media data, the Sentiment Adjusted by Demographics (SAD) index,\nthrough the post-stratification method, and (3) to evaluate the spatially and\ntemporally evolved public sentiment toward COVID-19 using the SAD index. The\nresults show significant discrepancies among demographic groups in their\nCOVID-19-related emotions. Female and under or equal to 18 years old Twitter\nusers expressed long-term negative sentiment toward COVID-19. The proposed SAD\nindex in this study corrected the underestimation of negative sentiment in 31\nstates, especially in Vermont. According to the SAD index, Twitter users in\nWyoming (Vermont) posted the largest (smallest) percentage of negative tweets\ntoward the pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 02:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

Specifically, this recursive computing rule permits\nthe propagation of the changes to all synaptic weights in the network, layer by\nlayer, efficiently. In particular, we use this rule to compute both the up and\ndown partial derivatives of the cost function of all the connections feeding\ninto the output layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 06:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

We demonstrate that with the integration of computer vision\ninto this material research workflow, many of these tasks can be automated,\nsignificantly accelerating the throughput of the workflow for scientists. We\npresent a framework that uses vision to address specific pain points in the\ncharacterization of perovskite semiconductors, a group of materials with the\npotential to form new types of solar cells. With this approach, we automate the\nmeasurement and computation of chemical and optoelectronic properties of\nperovskites. Our framework proposes the following four key contributions: (i) a\ncomputer vision tool for scalable segmentation to arbitrarily many material\nsamples, (ii) a tool to extract the chemical composition of all material\nsamples, (iii) an algorithm capable of automatically computing band gap across\narbitrarily many unique samples using vision-segmented hyperspectral\nreflectance data, and (iv) automating the stability measurement of multi-hour\nperovskite degradation experiments with vision for spatially non-uniform\nsamples. We demonstrate the key contributions of the proposed framework on\neighty samples of unique composition from the formamidinium-methylammonium lead\ntri-iodide perovskite system and validate the accuracy of each method using\nhuman evaluation and X-ray diffraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 17:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}
