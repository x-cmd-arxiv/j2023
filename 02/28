Here, we partially address this issue by proposing a suit of plausible\nmorality metrics to quantify four aspects of justice. We focus our closed-form\ncalculation on the class of reactive strategies because of their mathematical\ntractability and expressive power. We define reactive means as a tool for\nstudying how actors in the IPD and Iterated Snowdrift Game (ISG) behave under\ntypical circumstances. We compute reactive means for four functions intended to\ncapture human intuitions about ``goodness'' and ``fair play''. Two of these\nfunctions are strongly anticorrelated with success in the IPD and ISG, and the\nother two are weakly anticorrelated with success. Our results will aid in\nevaluating and comparing powerful IPD strategies based on machine learning\nalgorithms, using simple and intuitive morality metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 16:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Therefore the identification of\nscenarios that prevent a CPS from performing according to its requirements is\nof fundamental importance. However, the multidisciplinary nature of CPS can\nmake it difficult to identify such scenarios. In this article, we investigate\nthe testing of CPS developed using control theory. In such systems, the\nsoftware is developed collaboratively by control engineers and software\nengineers. When testing, it is important to account for this multidisciplinary\ndevelopment context. In particular, control engineers make design assumptions\nwhen contributing to system development in order to leverage control-theory and\nobtain guarantees on the CPS behaviour. However, such assumptions are not\nalways satisfied in the implemented system and their falsification can lead to\nthe loss of the control-theoretical guarantees. We define the problem of\ngenerating and identifying test cases that falsify such design assumptions as\nthe stress testing of control-based CPS. Among the types of assumptions listed\nin the article, we focus on the use of linearised models of the physics. To\ngenerate test cases that falsify such assumptions, we leverage control theory\nto develop a qualitative characterisation of the input space of the control\nlayer in CPS.

A major issue is that such a human behavior should itself account\nfor the robot behavior, otherwise collaboration cannot happen. In this paper,\nwe rely on Markov decision models, representing the uncertainty over the human\nobjective as a probability distribution over a finite set of objective\nfunctions (inducing a distribution over human behaviors).

This assumption may be difficult to perfectly enforce\nin practice. While there exist other DI security proofs that account for a\nconstrained amount of such leakage, the techniques used are somewhat unsuited\nfor analyzing the recent DI protocol demonstrations.

The question of whether this transformation\noccurs as a smooth or as a discontinuous one is still a matter of debate. This\nquestion can be addressed by studying individual microgels trapped in optical\ntweezers. For this aim, composite particles were obtained by decorating pNIPAM\nmicrogels with iron oxide nanocubes. These composites become self-heating when\nilluminated by the infrared trapping laser, featuring Hot Brownian Motion\nwithin the trap. Above a certain laser power, a single decorated microgel\nfeatures a volume phase transition that is discontinuous, while the usual\ncontinuous sigmoidal-like dependence is recovered after averaging over\ndifferent microgels.

In this article we present: a) an experimental work performed with a\nLi$_2$MoO$_4$ scintillating bolometer, studied in the framework of the CROSS\nexperiment, and utilizing a NTL-LD; b) a simulation method to reproduce,\nsynthetically, randomly coincident two-neutrino double-beta decay events; c) a\nnew analysis method based on a pulse-shape discrimination algorithm capable of\nproviding high pile-up rejection efficiencies. We finally show how the NTL-LDs\noffer a balanced solution between performance and complexity to reach\nbackground index $\\sim$$10^{-4}$ counts/keV/kg/year with 280~g Li$_2$MoO$_4$\n($^{100}$Mo enriched) bolometers at 3034 keV, the Q-value of the double-beta\ndecay, and target the goal of a next generation experiment like CUPID.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 16:47:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 14:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

We identify three issues in the\nstate-of-the-art: (i) failure of claimed privacy protection and (ii) incorrect\nregret bound due to noise miscalculation and (iii) ungrounded communication\ncost. To resolve these issues, we take a two-step principled approach. First,\nwe design an algorithmic framework consisting of a generic federated LCB\nalgorithm and flexible privacy protocols. Then, leveraging the proposed\nframework, we study federated LCBs under two different privacy constraints. We\nfirst establish privacy and regret guarantees under silo-level local\ndifferential privacy, which fix the issues present in state-of-the-art\nalgorithm. To further improve the regret performance, we next consider shuffle\nmodel of differential privacy, under which we show that our algorithm can\nachieve nearly ``optimal'' regret without a trusted server. We accomplish this\nvia two different schemes -- one relies on a new result on privacy\namplification via shuffling for DP mechanisms and another one leverages the\nintegration of a shuffle protocol for vector sum into the tree-based mechanism,\nboth of which might be of independent interest. Finally, we support our\ntheoretical results with numerical evaluations over contextual bandit instances\ngenerated from both synthetic and real-life data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 16:47:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 15:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

Here we mitigate this dimensionality scaling by focusing on\noptical system composed of linear-optical objects.

Our analysis confirms that the choice\nof the $\\beta$-exponent has a strong impact on WR-star spectra, affecting line\nwidths, line strengths and line profiles. In some parameter regimes, the entire\nrange of WR subtypes could be covered. Comparison with observed WR stars and\nhydro models revealed that values of $\\beta \\gtrsim 8$ are unlikely to be\nrealized in nature, but a range of $\\beta$-values needs to be considered in\nspectral analysis. UV spectroscopy is crucial here to avoid an underestimation\nof the terminal velocity $v_\\infty$. Neither single- nor double-$\\beta$\ndescriptions yield an acceptable approximation of the inner wind when compared\nto hydro models. Instead, we find temperature shifts to lower $T_{2/3}$ when\nemploying a hydro model. Additionally, there are further hints that round-lined\nprofiles seen in several early WN stars are an effect from non-$\\beta$ velocity\nlaws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 17:05:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 09:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Prior to absorption, the surface is typically assumed to act as a totally\nreflecting boundary, which means that the contact time is determined by a\nBrownian functional known as the boundary local time. In this paper we develop\na class of encounter-based models that deal with absorption at sticky\nboundaries. Sticky boundaries occur in a diverse range of applications,\nincluding cell biology, colloidal physics, active matter, finance, and human\ncrowd dynamics. We begin by constructing a one-dimensional encounter-based\nmodel of sticky Brownian motion (BM), which is based on the zero-range limit of\nnon-sticky BM with a short-range attractive potential well near the origin. In\nthis limit, the boundary-contact time is given by the amount of time\n(occupation time) that the particle spends at the origin. We calculate the\njoint probability density or propagator for the particle position and the\noccupation time, and then identify an absorption event as the first time that\nthe occupation time crosses a randomly generated threshold. Different models of\nabsorption correspond to different choices for the random threshold probability\ndistribution. We illustrate the theory by considering diffusion in a finite\ninterval with a partially absorbing sticky boundary at one end. We show how\nvarious quantities of interest depend on moments of the random threshold\ndistribution. Finally, we determine how sticky BM can be obtained by taking a\nparticular diffusion limit of a sticky run-and-tumble particle (RTP). The\ndiffusion limit is well-defined provided that the velocity of the RTP is biased\nand spatially varying within a boundary layer around the origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 17:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Several methods have been proposed to address this domain shift, such\nas utilizing adversarial learning or multi-domain mixups to extract\ndomain-invariant high-level features. However, these methods do not explicitly\naccount for or regularize the content and style attributes of the extracted\ndomain-invariant features. Recent studies have demonstrated that CNN models\nexhibit a strong bias toward styles (i.e., textures) rather than content, in\nstark contrast to the human-vision system. Explainable representations are\nparamount for a robust and generalizable understanding of medical images. Thus,\nthe learned high-level semantic features need to be both content-specific,\ni.e., pathology-specific and domain-agnostic, as well as style invariant.\nInspired by this, we propose a novel framework that improves cross-domain\nperformances by focusing more on content while reducing style bias. We employ a\nstyle randomization module at both image and feature levels to create stylized\nperturbation features while preserving the content using an end-to-end\nframework. We extract the global features from the backbone model for the same\nchest X-ray with and without style randomized. We apply content consistency\nregularization between them to tweak the framework's sensitivity toward content\nmarkers for accurate predictions.

Serverless computing can be effective for distributed\nlearning systems by enabling automated resource scaling, less manual\nintervention, and cost reduction. By distributing the workload, distributed\nmachine learning can speed up the training process and allow more complex\nmodels to be trained. Several topologies of distributed machine learning have\nbeen established (centralized, parameter server, peer-to-peer).

Moreover,\ntraining machine learning in a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture can offer\nbenefits in terms of fault tolerance by eliminating the single point of\nfailure.

An optimized 2D\nunit cell of the structure consists of 4um by 160 nm TiN base on glass\nsubstrate covered with 70 nm thick silicon dioxide (SiO2). A periodic structure\nof titanium nitride (TiN) straps (each of 90 nm thick and 2-micron wide) is\ndeposited over SiO2. The straps are capped with 40 nm thick layer of\nhigh-temperature dielectric hafnium dioxide (HfO2) with periodicity of\n4-micron. This unit is symmetric along the other dimension and repeated\nperiodically along the horizontal direction. Additionally, though this\nmicrostructure was optimized for visible light spectrum, it also shows almost\nsimilar absorption of ~96% intigrated over wavelenght spectrum from 400 nm to\n1200 nm.

These models achieve superior accuracy across a wide\nrange of applications. This trend has been consistent over the past several\nyears since Transformer models were originally introduced. However, the amount\nof compute and bandwidth required for inference of recent Transformer models is\ngrowing at a significant rate, and this has made their deployment in\nlatency-sensitive applications challenging. As such, there has been an\nincreased focus on making Transformer models more efficient, with methods that\nrange from changing the architecture design, all the way to developing\ndedicated domain-specific accelerators. In this work, we survey different\napproaches for efficient Transformer inference, including: (i) analysis and\nprofiling of the bottlenecks in existing Transformer architectures and their\nsimilarities and differences with previous convolutional models; (ii)\nimplications of Transformer architecture on hardware, including the impact of\nnon-linear operations such as Layer Normalization, Softmax, and GELU, as well\nas linear operations, on hardware design; (iii) approaches for optimizing a\nfixed Transformer architecture; (iv) challenges in finding the right mapping\nand scheduling of operations for Transformer models; and (v) approaches for\noptimizing Transformer models by adapting the architecture using neural\narchitecture search. Finally, we perform a case study by applying the surveyed\noptimizations on Gemmini, the open-source, full-stack DNN accelerator\ngenerator, and we show how each of these approaches can yield improvements,\ncompared to previous benchmark results on Gemmini. Among other things, we find\nthat a full-stack co-design approach with the aforementioned methods can result\nin up to 88.7x speedup with a minimal performance degradation for Transformer\ninference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 18:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Whether it is a Lindblad master equation,\nthe equation of motion for the Wigner function or a dissipative Keldysh action,\nfeatures evident in one formalism are often masked in another. Here, we\nreformulate the technique of third quantization in a way that explicitly\nconnects all three methods. We first show that our formulation reveals a\nfundamental dissipative symmetry present in all quadratic bosonic or fermionic\nLindbladians. This symmetry can then be used to easily diagonalize these\nmodels, and provides a intuitive way to demonstrate the separation of\ndissipation and fluctations in linear systems.

Two\nimmiscible fluids A and B flow through the pores between these two types of\ngrains denoted \"+\" and \"-\". Fluid A is fully wetting and B is fully non-wetting\nwith respect to \"+\" grains and opposite with \"-\" grains. The direction of the\ncapillary forces in the links between two \"+\" grains is therefore opposite\ncompared to that between two \"-\" grains, whereas the capillary forces in the\nlinks between two opposite types of grains average to zero. For a window of\ngrain occupation probabilities, a percolating regime appears where there is a\nhigh probability of having connected paths with zero capillary forces. Due to\nthese paths, no minimum threshold pressure is required to start a flow in this\nregime. While varying the pressure drop across the porous medium from low to\nhigh in this regime, the relation between the volumetric flow rate and the\npressure drop goes from being linear to a power law with exponent 2.56 to\nlinear again. Outside the percolation regime, there is a threshold pressure. No\nlinear regime is observed for low pressure drops. When the pressure drop is\nhigh enough for there to be flow, we find that the flow rate depends on the\nexcess pressure drop to an exponents around 2.2-2.3. At even higher pressure\ndrops, the relation is linear. We see no change in exponent for the\nintermediate regime at the percolation critical points where the zero-capillary\nforce paths disappear. We measure the mobility at the percolation threshold at\nlow pressure drops so that the flow rate versus pressure drop is linear.\nAssuming a power law, the mobility is proportional to the difference between\nthe occupation probability and the critical occupation probability to a power\nof around 5.7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 19:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

To\ntackle these issues, we propose a novel framework with two objectives: (i)\ncombating uncertainty of renewable energy in smart grid by leveraging\ntime-series forecasting with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) solutions, and (ii)\nestablishing distributed and dynamic decision-making framework with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)\nalgorithm.

For three of these sources we present new CO(1-0)\nobservations, obtained with NOEMA. In two targets, we also detected CN lines,\nboth in emission and absorption. Combining the new observations with already\npublished data, we discuss the main results obtained. Although we found that a\nlarge fraction of the cold molecular gas is distributed in disc-like rotating\nstructures, in most of the sources high turbulence and deviations from purely\nquiescent gas (including outflows) were observed in the region co-spatial with\nthe radio continuum emission. This suggests the presence of an interaction\nbetween radio plasma and cold molecular gas. We found that newly born and young\nradio jets, even those with low power i.e., P_jet<10^45 erg/s), can drive\nmassive outflows of cold, molecular gas. The outflows are, however, limited to\nthe sub-kpc regions and likely short lived. On larger scales (a few kpc), we\nobserved cases where the molecular gas appears to avoid the radio lobes and,\ninstead, wraps around them. The results suggest the presence of an evolutionary\nsequence, consistent with simulations, where the type of impact of the radio\nplasma changes as the jet expands, going from a direct jet-cloud interaction on\nsub-kpc scales to a gentler pushing aside of the gas, increasing its turbulence\nand likely limiting its cooling. This effect can be mediated by the cocoon of\nshocked gas inflated by the jet-cloud interactions. Building larger samples of\nyoung and evolved radio sources for observation at a similar depth and spatial\nresolution to test this scenario is now needed and may be possible thanks to\nmore data becoming available in the growing public archives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 19:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

In this study, we revisit the ring\nmodel by performing a number of high-resolution N-body simulations for 10 Myr\nof a ring of self-interacting planetesimals, with various radial distributions\nof the gas disc. We found that even if all the planetesimals form at ~1 AU in a\nminimum mass solar nebula-like disc, the system tends to spread radially as\naccretion proceeds, resulting in a system of planetary embryos lacking\nmass-concentration at ~1 AU. Modifying the surface density of the gas disc into\na concave shape with a peak at ~1 AU helps to maintain mass concentrated at ~1\nAU and solve the radial dispersion problem. We further propose that such a disc\nshould be short lived (<= 1 Myr) and with a shallower radial gradient in the\ninnermost region (< 1 AU) than previously proposed to prevent a too-rapid\ngrowth of Earth.

Method: To measure the low-energy\nproducts following $\\beta$-delayed 3$\\alpha$p-decay, the TexAT Time Projection\nChamber was employed using the one-at-a-time $\\beta$-delayed charged-particle\nspectroscopy technique at the Cyclotron Institute, Texas A&M University.\nResults: A total of $1.9 \\times 10^{5}$ $^{13}\\mathrm{O}$ implantations were\nmade inside the TexAT Time Projection Chamber. 149 3$\\alpha$+p events were\nobserved yielding a $\\beta$-delayed 3$\\alpha+p$ branching ratio of 0.078(6)%.\nConclusion: Four previously unknown $\\alpha$-decaying states were observed, one\nwith a strong $^{9}\\mathrm{B(g.s)}+\\alpha$ characteristic at 11.3 MeV, one with\na $^{9}\\mathrm{B}(\\frac{1}{2}^{+})+\\alpha$ nature at 12.4 MeV, and another two\nthat are dominated by $^{9}\\mathrm{B}({\\frac{5}{2}}^{+})+\\alpha$ at 13.1 and\n13.7 MeV.

Reducing microwave loss by surface engineering (i.e.,\nreplacing uncontrolled native oxide of superconducting metals with a thin,\nstable surface with predictable characteristics) can be a key enabler for\npushing performance forward with devices of higher quality factor. In this\nwork, we present a novel approach to replace the native oxide of niobium\n(typically formed in an uncontrolled fashion when its pristine surface is\nexposed to air) with an engineered oxide, using a room-temperature process that\nleverages Accelerated Neutral Atom Beam (ANAB) technology at 300 mm wafer\nscale.

For the case where the inner\nintegrand is only approximately given, additional bias is added to the\nestimation of the outer integral.

Plasma production primarily occurs in the path of\nthe beam electrons in the center of the chamber.

The plasma density increases,\nand the plasma becomes more confined near the region of production when the\nmagnetic field strengthens. The magnetic field reduces both electron physical\nand energy transport perpendicular to the magnetic field. $T_{e}$ is uniform\nalong the magnetic field lines and slowly decreases perpendicular to it.\nElectrons are less energetic in the sheath regions where the sheath electric\nfield repels and confines the low-energy electrons from the bulk plasma.

In\nthis work, we propose and study Private Blotto games, a variant connected to\ncrowdsourcing and social media. One key difference in Private Blotto is that\nindividual agents act independently, without being coordinated by a central\n\"Colonel\". This model naturally arises from scenarios such as activist groups\ncompeting over multiple issues, partisan fund-raisers competing over elections\nin multiple states, or politically-biased social media users labeling news\narticles as misinformation.

In general, mean outcome ensures that, if a stable arrangement exists,\nagents are close to evenly spaced across fronts, minimizing misallocated\neffort. However, mean outcome functions also have chaotic patterns as to when\nstable arrangements do and do not exist. For median outcome, we exactly\ncharacterize when a stable arrangement exists, but show that this outcome\nfunction frequently results in extremely unbalanced allocation of agents across\nfronts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 20:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

We observe the beforehand known coreless\nbow-shock source X3 in the near- and mid-infrared (NIR/MIR) with SINFONI (VLT),\nNACO (VLT), ISAAC (VLT), VISIR (VLT), SHARP (NTT), and NIRCAM2 (KECK). In the\nradio domain, we use CO continuum and H30$\\alpha$ ALMA observations to identify\nsystem components at different temperatures and locations concerning the\ncentral stellar source. It is suggested that these radio/submm observations in\ncombination with the NIR Br$\\gamma$ line can be associated with a\nprotoplanetary disk of the YSO which is consistent with manifold VISIR\nobservations that reveal complex molecules and elements such as PAH, SIV, NeII\nand ArIII in a dense and compact region. Based on the photometric\nmulti-wavelength analysis, we infer the mass of $15^{+10}_{-5} M_{\\odot}$ for\nthe YSO with a related age of a few $10^4$ yr. Due to this age estimate and the\nrequired relaxation time scales for high-mass stars, this finding is an\nindication for ongoing star formation in the inner parsec. The proper motion\nand 3d distance imply a relation of X3 and IRS13. We argue that IRS13 may serve\nas a birthplace for young stars that are ejected due to the evaporation of the\ncluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 20:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}

Generally, in computer vision applications, it is seen that the\nfeature activation learned by a higher capacity model contains richer\nknowledge, highlighting complete objects while focusing less on the background.\nBased on this observation, we leverage the dual ability of the teacher to\naccurately distinguish between positive (relevant to the target object) and\nnegative (irrelevant) areas. We propose a new loss function for distillation,\ncalled angular margin-based distillation (AMD) loss. AMD loss uses the angular\ndistance between positive and negative features by projecting them onto a\nhypersphere, motivated by the near angular distributions seen in many feature\nextractors. Then, we create a more attentive feature that is angularly\ndistributed on the hypersphere by introducing an angular margin to the positive\nfeature. Transferring such knowledge from the teacher network enables the\nstudent model to harness the higher discrimination of positive and negative\nfeatures for the teacher, thus distilling superior student models. The proposed\nmethod is evaluated for various student-teacher network pairs on four public\ndatasets. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method has advantages in\ncompatibility with other learning techniques, such as using fine-grained\nfeatures, augmentation, and other distillation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 20:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Unfortunately, existing tools fail to\nprovide valid inference when data is collected adaptively or require many\nuntestable and technical assumptions, e.g., stationarity, iid rewards, bounded\nrandom variables, etc. Our paper introduces the design-based approach to\ninference for multi-arm bandits, where we condition the full set of potential\noutcomes and perform inference on the obtained sample.

This motivates us to shift the paradigm from combining loss at the end,\nto choosing the proper learning method per network layer. Inspired by\nexperimental observations, we find that MIM and CL are suitable to lower and\nhigher layers, respectively.

By resorting to methods recently developed in the\nliterature, which allow to compute conserved charges in the near horizon\nregion, regardless the details of the asymptotia at large distance, we\ninvestigate the properties of the black hole horizon when in its Meissner\nstate. We show that, when in such state, the horizon exhibits two sets of\nsupertranslation symmetries as well as a symmetry generated by the local\nconformal group. The supertranslations are generated by two infinite sets of\ncurrents, one of which comes from local dilations of the advanced null\ncoordinate at the horizon, and the other from local gauge transformations that\npreserve the electromagnetic field configuration at the horizon.

The fixed time convergence is\ndesired in practice because it provides an exciting property that the global\nconvergence of the whole system is independent with the initial states of the\nAUVs.

The closest\nstandard problems related to OVSS are Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Segmentation (ZSS,\nFSS) and their Cross-dataset variants where zero to few annotations are needed\nto segment novel classes. The existing FSS and ZSS methods utilize fully\nsupervised pixel-labelled seen classes to segment unseen classes. Pixel-level\nlabels are hard to obtain, and using weak supervision in the form of\ninexpensive image-level labels is often more practical. To this end, we propose\na novel unified weakly supervised OVSS pipeline that can perform ZSS, FSS and\nCross-dataset segmentation on novel classes without using pixel-level labels\nfor either the base (seen) or the novel (unseen) classes in an inductive\nsetting. We propose Weakly-Supervised Language-Guided Segmentation Network\n(WLSegNet), a novel language-guided segmentation pipeline that i) learns\ngeneralizable context vectors with batch aggregates (mean) to map class prompts\nto image features using frozen CLIP (a vision-language model) and ii) decouples\nweak ZSS/FSS into weak semantic segmentation and Zero-Shot segmentation. The\nlearned context vectors avoid overfitting on seen classes during training and\ntransfer better to novel classes during testing. WLSegNet avoids fine-tuning\nand the use of external datasets during training. The proposed pipeline beats\nexisting methods for weak generalized Zero-Shot and weak Few-Shot semantic\nsegmentation by 39 and 3 mIOU points respectively on PASCAL VOC and weak\nFew-Shot semantic segmentation by 5 mIOU points on MS COCO.

Despite such significant efforts, the results remain unsatisfactory\ndue to the inherently complicated nature of the stock market driven by factors\nincluding supply and demand, the state of the economy, the political climate,\nand even irrational human behavior. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GAN) have been extended for time series data; however, robust methods are\nprimarily for synthetic series generation, which fall short for appropriate\nstock prediction. This is because existing GANs for stock applications suffer\nfrom mode collapse and only consider one-step prediction, thus underutilizing\nthe potential of GAN. Furthermore, merging news and market volatility are\nneglected in current GANs. To address these issues, we exploit expert domain\nknowledge in finance and, for the first time, attempt to formulate stock\nmovement prediction into a Wasserstein GAN framework for multi-step prediction.\nWe propose IndexGAN, which includes deliberate designs for the inherent\ncharacteristics of the stock market, leverages news context learning to\nthoroughly investigate textual information and develop an attentive seq2seq\nlearning network that captures the temporal dependency among stock prices,\nnews, and market sentiment.

Due to the limited research in structured attacks, imposing\nconsistency checks on natural multi-object scenes is a promising yet practical\ndefense against conventional adversarial attacks. More desired attacks, to this\nend, should be able to fool defenses with such consistency checks. Therefore,\nwe present the first approach GLOW that copes with various attack requests by\ngenerating global layout-aware adversarial attacks, in which both categorical\nand geometric layout constraints are explicitly established. Specifically, we\nfocus on object detection task and given a victim image, GLOW first localizes\nvictim objects according to target labels.

Our proposed\nGLOW, on the one hand, is capable of handling various types of requests,\nincluding single or multiple victim objects, with or without specified victim\nobjects.

These properties are investigated further through the\nidentification of anomalous modes which exist within interacting Weyl\nsemimetals.

By idealizing the thin accretion disk\ntemperature profile in the two forms of isothermal and gradient around the\nbumblebee gravity-based slow rotating black hole, we investigate the influence\nof spontaneous LSB on the $\\nu{\\bar \\nu}$-annihilation efficiency. For both\nprofiles, we find that positive values of LSB parameter $l>0$ induce an\nenhancement of the EDR associated with the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation.\nTherefore, the process of powering the GRBs jets around bumblebee gravity\nmodified slowly rotating geometry is more efficient in comparison with standard\nmetric. Using the observed gamma-ray luminosity associated with different GRBs\ntypes (short, long, and ultra-long), we find, through the analysis of the EDR\nin the parameter space $l-a$ ($a^2\\ll1$), some allowed ranges for the LSB\nparameter $l$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 23:35:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 10:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

Specifically, we focus on\nthe nature of broadband plans offered by major ISPs across the US. To this end,\nwe develop a broadband plan querying tool (BQT) that obtains broadband plans\n(upload/download speed and price) offered by seven major ISPs for any street\naddress in the US. We then use this tool to curate a dataset, querying\nbroadband plans for over 837k street addresses in thirty cities for seven major\nwireline broadband ISPs. We use a plan's carriage value, the Mbps of a user's\ntraffic that an ISP carries for one dollar, to compare plans. Our analysis\nprovides us with the following new insights: (1) ISP plans vary inter-city.\nSpecifically, the fraction of census block groups that receive high and low\ncarriage value plans varies widely by city; (2) ISP plans intra-city are\nspatially clustered, and the carriage value can vary as much as 600% within a\ncity; (3) Cable-based ISPs offer up to 30% more carriage value to users when\ncompeting with fiber-based ISPs in a block group; and (4) Average income in a\nblock group plays a critical role in dictating who gets a fiber deployment\n(i.e., a better carriage value) in the US.

Existing\ntechniques address this by using computationally and memory expensive offline\nhard mining, which consists of identifying, at each iteration, the hardest\nsamples from the training set. In this paper we introduce a new technique that\nperforms global hard mini-batch sampling based on proxies. To do so, we add a\nnew end-to-end trainable branch to the network, which generates efficient place\ndescriptors (one proxy for each place). These proxy representations are thus\nused to construct a global index that encompasses the similarities between all\nplaces in the dataset, allowing for highly informative mini-batch sampling at\neach training iteration.

In this article, we\ndemonstrate that the complex Langevin method (CLM) may overcome this issue. We\napply the CLM to the Yang-Mills (YM) type one-dimensional matrix model (matrix\nquantum mechanics) that is a large-$N$ reduction (or dimensional reduction) of\nthe $(D+1)$-dimensional U$(N)$ pure YM theory (bosonic BFSS model). This model\nshows a large-$N$ phase transition at finite temperature, which is analogous to\nthe confinement/deconfinement transition of the original YM theory, and our CLM\npredicts that the transition temperature decreases as the angular momentum\nchemical potential increases. In order to verify our results, we compute\nseveral quantities via the minimum sensitivity method and find good\nquantitative agreements. Hence, the CLM properly works in this rotating system.\nWe also argue that our results are qualitatively consistent with a holography\nand the recent studies of the imaginary angular velocity in QCD.

To address the two issues, this\npaper proposes a novel learning based approach to RGB-D grasp detection, namely\nDepth Guided Cross-modal Attention Network (DGCAN). To better leverage the\ngeometry information recorded in the depth channel, a complete 6-dimensional\nrectangle representation is adopted with the grasp depth dedicatedly considered\nin addition to those defined in the common 5-dimensional one. The prediction of\nthe extra grasp depth substantially strengthens feature learning, thereby\nleading to more accurate results.

We define a\ntarget-visible region (TVR) with topology analysis of not only static obstacles\nbut also dynamic obstacles, and it reflects reachable sets of moving targets\nand obstacles to maintain the whole body of the target within the camera image\nrobustly and ceaselessly. The online performance of the proposed planner is\nvalidated in multiple scenarios, including high-fidelity simulations and\nreal-world experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 03:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Conventionally its\nwireless implementation follows a one-shot approach that first computes local\nresults at devices using local data and then aggregates them to a server with\ncommunication-efficient techniques such as over-the-air computation (AirComp)\nfor global computation. Such implementation is confronted with the issues of\nlimited storage-and-computation capacities and link interruption, which\nmotivates us to propose a framework of on-the-fly communication-and-computing\n(FlyCom$^2$) in this work. The proposed framework enables streaming computation\nwith low complexity by leveraging a random sketching technique and achieves\nprogressive global aggregation through the integration of progressive uploading\nand multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) AirComp. To develop FlyCom$^2$, an\non-the-fly sub-space estimator is designed to take real-time sketches\naccumulated at the server to generate online estimates for the decomposition.\nIts performance is evaluated by deriving both deterministic and probabilistic\nerror bounds using the perturbation theory and concentration of measure. Both\nresults reveal that the decomposition error is inversely proportional to the\npopulation of sketching observations received by the server. To further rein in\nthe noise effect on the error, we propose a threshold-based scheme to select a\nsubset of sufficiently reliable received sketches for DTD at the server.\nExperimental results validate the performance gain of the proposed selection\nalgorithm and show that compared to its one-shot counterparts, the proposed\nFlyCom$^2$ achieves comparable (even better in the case of large eigen-gaps)\ndecomposition accuracy besides dramatically reducing devices' complexity costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 04:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 06:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

However, the existing systems often have a very small search space for\nfeature preprocessing with the same preprocessing pipeline applied to all the\nnumerical features. This may result in sub-optimal performance since different\ndatasets often have various feature characteristics, and features within a\ndataset may also have their own preprocessing preferences. To bridge this gap,\nwe explore personalized preprocessing pipeline search, where the search\nalgorithm is allowed to adopt a different preprocessing pipeline for each\nfeature. This is a challenging task because the search space grows\nexponentially with more features. To tackle this challenge, we propose\nClusterP3S, a novel framework for Personalized Preprocessing Pipeline Search\nvia Clustering. The key idea is to learn feature clusters such that the search\nspace can be significantly reduced by using the same preprocessing pipeline for\nthe features within a cluster. To this end, we propose a hierarchical search\nstrategy to jointly learn the clusters and search for the optimal pipelines,\nwhere the upper-level search optimizes the feature clustering to enable better\npipelines built upon the clusters, and the lower-level search optimizes the\npipeline given a specific cluster assignment. We instantiate this idea with a\ndeep clustering network that is trained with reinforcement learning at the\nupper level, and random search at the lower level. Experiments on benchmark\nclassification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of enabling feature-wise\npreprocessing pipeline search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 05:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Key among these processes are unstable flow disturbances that\ncontribute to fundamental transformations in the flow field. Precise control of\nthese disturbances is possible by introducing a phononic subsurface (PSub).\nThis comprises locally attaching a finite phononic structure perpendicular to\nan elastic surface exposed to the flowing fluid. This structure experiences\nongoing excitation by an unstable flow mode traveling in conjunction with the\nmean flow. The excitation generates small deformations at the surface that\ntrigger elastic wave propagation within the structure. By targeted tuning of\nthe unit-cell and finite-structure characteristics of the PSub, the returning\nwaves may be devised to resonate and reenter the flow out of phase, leading to\nsignificant destructive interference of the incoming flow waves near the\nsurface and subsequently to their attenuation over the spatial extent of the\ncontrol region. This control mechanism is passive, responsive, and engineered\noffline without needing coupled fluid-structure simulations; only the flow\ninstability's frequency, wavelength, and overall modal characteristics must be\nknown. We present a PSub in the form of a locally resonant elastic\nmetamaterial, designed to operate in the elastic subwavelength regime and hence\nbeing significantly shorter in length compared to a phononic-crystal-based\nPSub. Using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of channel flows, both types of\nPSubs are investigated, and their controlled spatial and energetic influence on\nthe wall-bounded flow behavior is demonstrated and analyzed. We show that the\nPSub's effect is spatially localized as intended, with a rapidly diminishing\nstreamwise influence away from its location in the subsurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 05:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

However, extensive research has shown\nthat GCNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. One of the security threats\nfacing GCNs is the backdoor attack, which hides incorrect classification rules\nin models and activates only when the model encounters specific inputs\ncontaining special features (e.g., fixed patterns like subgraphs, called\ntriggers), thus outputting incorrect classification results, while the model\nbehaves normally on benign samples. The semantic backdoor attack is a type of\nthe backdoor attack where the trigger is a semantic part of the sample; i.e.,\nthe trigger exists naturally in the original dataset and the attacker can pick\na naturally occurring feature as the backdoor trigger, which causes the model\nto misclassify even unmodified inputs. Meanwhile, it is difficult to detect\neven if the attacker modifies the input samples in the inference phase as they\ndo not have any anomaly compared to normal samples. Thus, semantic backdoor\nattacks are more imperceptible than non-semantic ones. However, existed\nresearch on semantic backdoor attacks has only focused on image and text\ndomains, which have not been well explored against GCNs. In this work, we\npropose a black-box Semantic Backdoor Attack (SBA) against GCNs.

The control problem is formulated as minimization of the objective\nfunctional, which is the sum of Hilbert-Schmidt norms between four fixed basis\nstates evolved under the GKSL master equation with controls and the same four\nstates evolved under the ideal gate transformation. The exact expression for\nthe gradient of the objective functional with respect to piecewise constant\ncontrols is obtained. Subsequent optimization is performed using a gradient\ntype algorithm with an adaptive step size that leads to oscillating behaviour\nof the gradient norm vs iterations. Optimal trajectories in the Bloch ball for\nvarious initial states are computed. A relation of quantum gate generation with\noptimization on complex Stiefel manifolds is discussed.

In this work we present a method to further\nenhance this immersive experience by adding the hand touch capability (\"remote\nhand clapping\"). In our system, each meeting participant sits in front of a\nlarge screen with haptic feedback. The local participant can reach his hand out\nto the screen and perform hand clapping with the remote participant as if the\ntwo participants were only separated by a virtual glass. A key challenge in\nemulating the remote hand touch is the realistic rendering of the participant's\nhand and arm as the hand touches the screen. When the hand is very close to the\nscreen, the RGBD data required for realistic rendering is no longer available.\nTo tackle this challenge, we present a dual representation of the user's hand.\nOur dual representation not only preserves the high-quality rendering usually\nfound in recent image-based rendering systems but also allows the hand to reach\nthe screen. This is possible because the dual representation includes both an\nimage-based model and a 3D geometry-based model, with the latter driven by a\nhand skeleton tracked by a side view camera. In addition, the dual\nrepresentation provides a distance-based fusion of the image-based and 3D\ngeometry-based models as the hand moves closer to the screen. The result is\nthat the image-based and 3D geometry-based models mutually enhance each other,\nleading to realistic and seamless rendering. Our experiments demonstrate that\nour method provides consistent hand contact experience between remote users and\nimproves the immersive experience of 3D video communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 07:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

It is often\nreported that TS is fairly insensitive to the choice of the prior when it comes\nto regret bounds. However, this property is not necessarily true when\nmultiparameter models are considered, e.g., a Gaussian model with unknown mean\nand variance parameters. In this paper, we first extend the regret analysis of\nTS to the model of uniform distributions with unknown supports. Specifically,\nwe show that a switch of noninformative priors drastically affects the regret\nin expectation. Through our analysis, the uniform prior is proven to be the\noptimal choice in terms of the expected regret, while the reference prior and\nthe Jeffreys prior are found to be suboptimal, which is consistent with\nprevious findings in the model of Gaussian distributions. However, the uniform\nprior is specific to the parameterization of the distributions, meaning that if\nan agent considers different parameterizations of the same model, the agent\nwith the uniform prior might not always achieve the optimal performance. In\nlight of this limitation, we propose a slightly modified TS-based policy,\ncalled TS with Truncation (TS-T), which can achieve the asymptotic optimality\nfor the Gaussian distributions and the uniform distributions by using the\nreference prior and the Jeffreys prior that are invariant under one-to-one\nreparameterizations. The pre-processig of the posterior distribution is the key\nto TS-T, where we add an adaptive truncation procedure on the parameter space\nof the posterior distributions. Simulation results support our analysis, where\nTS-T shows the best performance in a finite-time horizon compared to other\nknown optimal policies, while TS with the invariant priors performs poorly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 08:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

DREAM is able to be\neasily plugged into popular dataset distillation frameworks and reduce the\ndistilling iterations by more than 8 times without performance drop. Given\nsufficient training time, DREAM further provides significant improvements and\nachieves state-of-the-art performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 08:48:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 15:53:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

An excessive electron density in the plasma expansion region\ncan indeed inhibit the negative ion production and introduce potentially\nharmful electrons in the accelerator. Among the set of plasma and beam\ndiagnostics proposed for SPIDER upgrade, a heterodyne microwave (mw)\ninterferometer at 100 GHz is being explored as a possibility to measure\nelectron density in the plasma extraction region. The major issue in applying\nthis technique in SPIDER is the poor accessibility of the probing microwave\nbeam through the source metal walls and the long distance of 4 m at which mw\nmodules should be located outside the vacuum vessel. Numerical investigations\nin a full-scale geometry showed that the power transmitted through the plasma\nsource apertures was sufficient for the microwave module sensitivity. An\nexperimental proof-of-principle of the setup was then performed. The microwave\nsystem was tested on an experimental full-scale test-bench mimicking SPIDER\nviewports accessibility constraints, including the presence of a SPIDER-like\nplasma. The outcome of first tests revealed that, despite the geometrical\nconstraints, in certain conditions, the electron density measurements are\npossible. The main issue arises from decoupling the one-pass signal from\nspurious multipaths generated by mw beam reflections, requiring signal cross\ncorrelation analysis. These preliminary tests demonstrate that despite the 4 m\ndistance between the mw modules and the presence of metal walls, plasma density\nmeasurement is possible when the 80-mm diameter ports are available. In this\ncontribution, we discuss the numerical simulations, the preliminary\nexperimental tests and suggest design upgrades of the interferometric setup to\nenhance signal transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 09:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

To this end, we in this paper present a novel\nhierarchical representation network (HRN) to achieve accurate and detailed face\nreconstruction from a single image. Specifically, we implement the geometry\ndisentanglement and introduce the hierarchical representation to fulfill\ndetailed face modeling. Meanwhile, 3D priors of facial details are incorporated\nto enhance the accuracy and authenticity of the reconstruction results. We also\npropose a de-retouching module to achieve better decoupling of the geometry and\nappearance.

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel point cloud completion approach namely ProxyFormer that\ndivides point clouds into existing (input) and missing (to be predicted) parts\nand each part communicates information through its proxies. Specifically, we\nfuse information into point proxy via feature and position extractor, and\ngenerate features for missing point proxies from the features of existing point\nproxies. Then, in order to better perceive the position of missing points, we\ndesign a missing part sensitive transformer, which converts random normal\ndistribution into reasonable position information, and uses proxy alignment to\nrefine the missing proxies. It makes the predicted point proxies more sensitive\nto the features and positions of the missing part, and thus make these proxies\nmore suitable for subsequent coarse-to-fine processes.

Furthermore, as events represent\nchanges of illumination, they might also represent changes of depth;\nassociating them with a single depth is therefore inadequate. In this work, we\npropose to address these issues by fusing information from an event camera and\na LiDAR using a learning-based approach to estimate accurate dense depth maps.\nTo solve the \"potential change of depth\" problem, we propose here to estimate\ntwo depth maps at each step: one \"before\" the events happen, and one \"after\"\nthe events happen.

However, detecting novel\ncategories with only a few samples usually leads to the problem of\nmisclassification. In FSOD, we notice the false positive (FP) of novel\ncategories is prominent, in which the base categories are often recognized as\nnovel ones. To address this issue, a novel data augmentation pipeline that\nCrops the Novel instances and Pastes them on the selected Base images, called\nCNPB, is proposed. There are two key questions to be answered: (1) How to\nselect useful base images? and (2) How to combine novel and base data? We\ndesign a multi-step selection strategy to find useful base data. Specifically,\nwe first discover the base images which contain the FP of novel categories and\nselect a certain amount of samples from them for the base and novel categories\nbalance. Then the bad cases, such as the base images that have unlabeled ground\ntruth or easily confused base instances, are removed by using CLIP.

The energy-efficient works try to\ndecrease the precision of multiplication or replace the multiplication with\nenergy-efficient operations such as addition or bitwise shift, to reduce the\nenergy consumption of FP32 multiplications.

We exploit the idea of\nhierarchy to learn query embeddings that are scalable across all levels, thus\nmaking this a relevant approach even for extreme classification where we have a\nlarge number of classes.

MDP is limited by\nthe Markovian assumption that a reward only depends on the immediate state and\naction. However, a reward sometimes depends on the history of states and\nactions, which may result in the decision process in a non-Markovian\nenvironment. In such environments, agents receive rewards via\ntemporally-extended behaviors sparsely, and the learned policies may be\nsimilar. This leads the agents acquired with similar policies generally overfit\nto the given task and can not quickly adapt to perturbations of environments.\nTo resolve this problem, this paper tries to learn the diverse policies from\nthe history of state-action pairs under a non-Markovian environment, in which a\npolicy dispersion scheme is designed for seeking diverse policy representation.\nSpecifically, we first adopt a transformer-based method to learn policy\nembeddings. Then, we stack the policy embeddings to construct a dispersion\nmatrix to induce a set of diverse policies. Finally, we prove that if the\ndispersion matrix is positive definite, the dispersed embeddings can\neffectively enlarge the disagreements across policies, yielding a diverse\nexpression for the original policy embedding distribution.

This work revisits the training framework and uncovers two major\nproblems hindering the expressiveness of learned multi-interest\nrepresentations. First, the current training objective (i.e., uniformly sampled\nsoftmax) fails to effectively train discriminative representations in a\nmulti-interest learning scenario due to the severe increase in easy negative\nsamples. Second, a routing collapse problem is observed where each learned\ninterest may collapse to express information only from a single item, resulting\nin information loss. To address these issues, we propose the REMI framework,\nconsisting of an Interest-aware Hard Negative mining strategy (IHN) and a\nRouting Regularization (RR) method. IHN emphasizes interest-aware hard\nnegatives by proposing an ideal sampling distribution and developing a\nMonte-Carlo strategy for efficient approximation. RR prevents routing collapse\nby introducing a novel regularization term on the item-to-interest routing\nmatrices. These two components enhance the learned multi-interest\nrepresentations from both the optimization objective and the composition\ninformation. REMI is a general framework that can be readily applied to various\nexisting multi-interest candidate matching methods.

Firstly, we obtain a\nset of hybrid equations of state (which predict the existence of a third stable\nbranch of compact objects) by employing the well-known Maxwell construction,\nwithin the phenomenological framework of constant speed of sound\nparametrization. Then, we systematically study the influence of certain\nparameters, such as the energy density jump (in the resulting hybrid equation\nof state) and the crust elasticity, on the deviations between the r-mode\ninstability windows and spin-down evolution of twin stars.

Thus, the future possible\ndetection of gravitational waves (due to unstable r-modes) from a star laying\nin the stable region of the frequency-temperature plane would be a strong\nindication for the existence of twin stars. Furthermore, we consider current\ndata for the spin frequencies and temperatures of observed pulsars and compare\nthem to the predictions made from equations of state employed in this study. We\nfind that, depending on the transition density and the rigidness of the crust,\nhybrid equations of state may be a viable solution for the explanation of\nexisting data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 12:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

It has been known that the observed\nenergies of an incoming photon in adjacent strips can be utilized to achieve a\nposition resolution finer than the strip pitch, if and only if the charge cloud\ninduced by an incoming X-ray photon is split into multiple strips and their\nenergies are accurately measured. However, with existing CdTe strip detectors,\nthe ratio of such charge-sharing events is limited. An idea for a potential\nbreakthrough to greatly enhance the ratio of charge-sharing events is to widen\nthe gaps between strips on the detector. To test the concept, we developed a\nwide-gap CdTe strip detector, which has 64 platinum strip electrodes on the\ncathode side with some variations in strip pitches from 60 um (30 um strip and\n30 um gap width) to 80 um (30 um strip and 50 um gap width). We evaluated the\nperformance depending on the strip pitches by irradiating X-rays from Am-241 on\nthe detector. The charge loss due to the wider gaps on the detector was found\nto be significant to the extent that the assumption that the energy of an\nincoming photon for a charge-sharing event was the simple sum of the energies\ndetected in adjacent strips lead to a significant degradation in the energy\nresolution in the accumulated spectrum, compared with those obtained with its\npredecessor having standard gap-widths. We then developed a new\nenergy-reconstruction method to compensate for the charge loss. Application of\nthe method to the data yielded a spectrum with a comparable spectral resolution\nwith that of the predecessor. The ratio of the charge-sharing events for 17.8\nkeV events was doubled from that of the predecessor, from 24.3 to 49.9 percent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 13:09:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 02:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

(2) While users are allowed to\nexecute cells in any order, not every ordering is correct, because a cell can\ndepend on declarations from other cells.

We begin with\nconsidering deterministic systems. Given an open safe set, a target set and a\nnominal controller, we attempt to synthesize a reach-avoid controller, which\nmodifies the nominal controller in a minimal way enforcing the reach-avoid\nobjective, i.e., the system will enter the target set eventually while staying\ninside the safe set before the first target hitting time. Three control\nguidance-barrier functions are developed and three corresponding conditions for\nsynthesizing reach-avoid controllers are constructed, which get progressively\nweaker and thus facilitate the optimal controller design. The first and second\nones are termed exponential and asymptotic control guidance-barrier functions,\nwhich guarantee that every trajectory starting from the safe set will enter the\ntarget set respectively at an exponential rate and in an asymptotic way.\nHowever, it is observed that these two control guidance-barrier functions have\none condition in common of enforcing invariance of its every positive sublevel\nset until the system enters the target set, which is strict and thus limits the\nspace of admissible controllers. Consequently, a lax control guidance-barrier\nfunction is further developed such that only the safe set set is an invariance\nbefore the system enters the target set, expanding the space of admissible\ncontrol inputs. Then, we extend the methodologies for deterministic systems to\nstochastic systems, which synthesize reach-avoid controllers in the\nprobabilistic setting.

In the first part,\nwe study the interplay between internal interactions, environmental changes,\nand effective representations of complex stochastic systems. We model the\nenvironment as an unobserved stochastic process and investigate how the mutual\ninformation between internal degrees of freedom encodes internal and\nenvironmental processes, and how it can help us disentangle them. Then, we\nattempt to build effective representations via information-preserving\nprojections that preserve the dependencies of a complex system. In the\nparadigmatic case of underdamped systems, we find that optimal effective\nrepresentations may be unexpectedly singular, revealing fundamental limits of\napproximating complex models. In the second part of this Thesis, we apply these\napproaches and ideas from criticality to neural systems at different scales,\nshowing that unobserved neural activity may lead to power-law neuronal\navalanches in the absence of criticality. Remarkably, the properties of mutual\ninformation suggest that, whereas avalanches may emerge from stochastic\nmodulation, interactions between neural populations are at the source of\nscale-free correlations.

To this end, we propose exploring diverse fine-grained\nrepresentation, which describes appearance comprehensively from global and\nlocal perspectives.

In this work, we propose a\nnovel optimization-based pruning framework that considers the combined effect\nof pruning (and updating) multiple weights subject to a sparsity constraint.\nOur approach, CHITA, extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon framework and\nresults in significant improvements in speed, memory, and performance over\nexisting optimization-based approaches for network pruning. CHITA's main\nworkhorse performs combinatorial optimization updates on a memory-friendly\nrepresentation of local quadratic approximation(s) of the loss function. On a\nstandard benchmark of pretrained models and datasets, CHITA leads to\nsignificantly better sparsity-accuracy tradeoffs than competing methods. For\nexample, for MLPNet with only 2% of the weights retained, our approach improves\nthe accuracy by 63% relative to the state of the art.

Nevertheless, the cold-start recommendation remains a fundamental\nchallenge in which only a few user-item interactions are available for\npersonalization. Gradient-based meta-learning approaches have recently emerged\nin the sequential recommendation field due to their fast adaptation and\neasy-to-integrate abilities. The meta-learning algorithms formulate the\ncold-start recommendation as a few-shot learning problem, where each user is\nrepresented as a task to be adapted. However, while meta-learning algorithms\ngenerally assume that task-wise samples are evenly distributed over classes or\nvalues, user-item interactions are not that way in real-world applications\n(e.g., watching favorite videos multiple times, leaving only good ratings and\nno bad ones). As a result, in the real-world, imbalanced user feedback that\naccounts for most task training data may dominate the user adaptation and\nprevent meta-learning algorithms from learning meaningful meta-knowledge for\npersonalized recommendations. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel\nsequential recommendation framework based on gradient-based meta-learning that\ncaptures the imbalance of each user's rating distribution and accordingly\ncomputes adaptive loss for user-specific learning. It is the first work to\ntackle the impact of imbalanced ratings in cold-start sequential recommendation\nscenarios. We design adaptive weighted loss and improve the existing\nmeta-learning algorithms for state-of-the-art sequential recommendation\nmethods. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 15:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Interestingly, this correlation is further tightened\n($\\sigma_{int} \\approx 0.2$) by eliminating those SLSNe which show a pre-peak\nbump in their light curve. This result hints at the possibility that the\n\"bumpy\" SLSNe could belong to a different population. Weak correlations are\nobserved between the peak luminosity and colour indices. No relationship is\nfound between UV peak magnitude and the decline rate in contrast to what is\ntypically found in optical band. The correlations found here are promising, and\ngive encouraging insights for the use of SLSNe as cosmological probes at high\nredshifts using standardising relations in the UV. We also highlight the\nimportance of early, and consistent, photometric data for constraining the\nlight curve properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 15:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

The Hi-C method captures contact\nfrequencies between DNA segment pairs across the genome. When analyzing Hi-C\ndata sets, it is common to group these pairs using standard bioinformatics\nmethods (e.g., PCA). Other approaches handle Hi-C data as weighted networks,\nwhere connected node represent DNA segments in 3D proximity. In this\nrepresentation, one can leverage community detection techniques developed in\ncomplex network theory to group nodes into mesoscale communities containing\nsimilar connection patterns. While there are several successful attempts to\nanalyze Hi-C data in this way, it is common to report and study the most\ntypical community structure. But in reality, there are often several valid\ncandidates. Therefore, depending on algorithm design, different community\ndetection methods focusing on slightly different connectivity features may have\ndiffering views on the ideal node groupings. In fact, even the same community\ndetection method may yield different results if using a stochastic algorithm.\nThis ambiguity is fundamental to community detection and shared by most complex\nnetworks whenever interactions span all scales in the network. This is known as\ncommunity inconsistency. This paper explores this inconsistency of 3D\ncommunities in Hi-C data for all human chromosomes. We base our analysis on two\ninconsistency metrics, one local and one global, and quantify the network\nscales where the community separation is most variable. For example, we find\nthat TADs are less reliable than A/B compartments and that nodes with highly\nvariable node-community memberships are associated with open chromatin.\nOverall, our study provides a helpful framework for data-driven researchers and\nincreases awareness of some inherent challenges when clustering Hi-C data into\n3D communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 15:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Achievable guarantees in the two cases exhibit a massive gap:\nNo-regret learning is achievable in Stochastic BwK, but in Adversarial BwK,\nonly competitive ratio style guarantees are achievable, where the competitive\nratio depends on the budget. What makes this gap so vast is that in Adversarial\nBwK the guarantees get worse in the typical case when the budget is more\nbinding.

In addition, real-time traffic types such as voice and video require\na high computational load at the terminal side which has an undesirable impact\non energy/battery lifetime which further affects the throughput QoS performance\nsuch as reduced packet loss, longer battery lifetime, reliability, and high\ndata rates. As a result, this paper proposed an Intelligent Throughput-based\nSleep Control (ITSC) algorithm for throughput QoS and energy efficiency\nenhancement in 5G dense HetNets. In the proposed ITSC algorithm, a deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) was used to determine the cell capacity ratio for the small base\nstations (SBSs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 18:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

We propose a new method for open set action recognition and novelty\ndetection via MUlti-Label Evidential learning (MULE), that goes beyond previous\nnovel action detection methods by addressing the more general problems of\nsingle or multiple actors in the same scene, with simultaneous action(s) by any\nactor. Our Beta Evidential Neural Network estimates multi-action uncertainty\nwith Beta densities based on actor-context-object relation representations. An\nevidence debiasing constraint is added to the objective function for\noptimization to reduce the static bias of video representations, which can\nincorrectly correlate predictions and static cues. We develop a learning\nalgorithm based on a primal-dual average scheme update to optimize the proposed\nproblem. Theoretical analysis of the optimization algorithm demonstrates the\nconvergence of the primal solution sequence and bounds for both the loss\nfunction and the debiasing constraint. Uncertainty and belief-based novelty\nestimation mechanisms are formulated to detect novel actions. Extensive\nexperiments on two real-world video datasets show that our proposed approach\nachieves promising performance in single/multi-actor, single/multi-action\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 18:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

In such scenarios, the object must be reoriented and\nre-positioned into intermediate poses that facilitate accurate placement at the\ntarget pose. To this end, we propose a reorientation planning method,\nReorientDiff, that utilizes a diffusion model-based approach. The proposed\nmethod employs both visual inputs from the scene, and goal-specific language\nprompts to plan intermediate reorientation poses. Specifically, the scene and\nlanguage-task information are mapped into a joint scene-task representation\nfeature space, which is subsequently leveraged to condition the diffusion\nmodel. The diffusion model samples intermediate poses based on the\nrepresentation using classifier-free guidance and then uses gradients of\nlearned feasibility-score models for implicit iterative pose-refinement. The\nproposed method is evaluated using a set of YCB-objects and a suction gripper,\ndemonstrating a success rate of 96.5\\% in simulation. Overall, our study\npresents a promising approach to address the reorientation challenge in\nmanipulation by learning a conditional distribution, which is an effective way\nto move towards more generalizable object manipulation.
