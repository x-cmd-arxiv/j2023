Here we demonstrate a\nnovel concept for creating chiral excited states which does not rely on\nmolecular structure. Instead, it depends on hybridising a non chiral molecule\nwith a chiral electromagnetic field, producing a hybrid light matter chiral\npolariton state. This is achieved by a symmetry controlled strong chiral-light\nmatter interaction between an electromagnetic mode of a chiral nanocavity and\nan achiral molecule, a concept referred to as the electromagnetic enantiomer.\nThis electromagnetic mechanism simplifies the creation of chiral electronic\nstates since it is far less demanding in terms of materials design.

Gamma-ray astronomy plays a fundamental role in this\nfield. Both relativistic protons and electrons can emit in the gamma-ray band\nthrough different processes, but only the detection of hadronic gamma-ray\nemission can probe the acceleration of cosmic rays. In particular, due to the\nKlein-Nishina suppression of inverse Compton emission at the highest energies,\nthe detection of gamma-ray emission above 100 TeV was expected to provide firm\nproof of the acceleration of PeV hadrons.

While hydrodynamic models\nmodels can provide reliable forecasts by simulating water depth at every\nlocation of a catchment, they also have a high computational burden which\njeopardizes their application to real-time prediction in large urban areas at\nhigh spatial resolution.

Our aim is to elucidate the influence\nof self-disassembly of bridges on the collective flow characteristics of swarm\nrobots in a single-lane and periodic system with a gap. In the system, robots\nspan and cross the gap by self-assembling a single-layer bridge. We consider\ntwo scenarios in which self-disassembling bridges is prevented\n(prevent-scenario) or allowed (allow-scenario). We represent the horizontal\nmovement of robots with a typical car-following model, and simply model the\nactions of robots for self-assembling and self-disassembling bridges. Numerical\nsimulations have revealed the following results. Flow-density diagrams in both\nthe scenarios shift to the higher-density region as the gap length increases.\nWhen density is low, allow-scenario exhibits the steady state of repeated\nself-assembly and self-disassembly of bridges. If density is extremely low,\nflow in this state is greater than flow in prevent-scenario owing to the\nincrease in the number of robots moving horizontally. Otherwise, flow in this\nstate is smaller than flow in prevent-scenario. Besides, flow in this state\nincreases monotonically with respect to the velocity of robots in joining and\nleaving bridges. Thus, self-disassembling bridges is recommended for only\nextremely low-density conditions in periodic systems.

Their burst signal is dispersed by the free electrons in the\nlarge-scale-structure (LSS), leading to delayed arrival times at different\nfrequencies. Another potential source of time delay is the well known Shapiro\ndelay, which measures the space-space and time-time metric perturbations along\nthe line-of-sight. If photons of different frequencies follow different\ntrajectories, i.e. if the universality of free fall guaranteed by the weak\nequivalence principle (WEP) is violated, they would experience an additional\nrelative delay. This quantity, however, is not an observable on the background\nlevel as it is not gauge independent, which has led to confusion in previous\npapers. Instead, an imprint can be seen in the correlation between the time\ndelays of different pulses. In this paper, we derive robust and consistent\nconstraints from twelve localised FRBs on the violation of the WEP in the\nenergy range between 4.6 and 6 meV. In contrast to a number of previous\nstudies, we consider our signal to be not in the model, but in the covariance\nmatrix of the likelihood. To do so, we calculate the covariance of the time\ndelays induced by the free electrons in the LSS, the WEP breaking terms, the\nMilky Way and host galaxy. By marginalising over both host galaxy contribution\nand the contribution from the free electrons, we find that the parametrised\npost-Newtonian parameter $\\gamma$ characterising the WEP violation must be\nconstant in this energy range to 1 in $10^{13}$ at 68$\\;\\%$ confidence.

How can we make this easier?\n  Approach: We present Symphony, a new functional programming language for MPCs\namong two or more parties. Symphony starts from the single-instruction,\nmultiple-data (SIMD) semantics of prior MPC languages, in which each party\ncarries out symmetric responsibilities, and generalizes it using constructs\nthat can coordinate many parties. Symphony introduces **first-class shares**\nand **first-class party sets** to provide unmatched language-level expressive\npower with high efficiency.\n  Knowledge: Developing a core formal language called $\\lambda$-Symphony, we\nprove that the intuitive, generalized SIMD view of a program coincides with its\nactual distributed semantics. Thus the programmer can reason about her programs\nby reading them from top to bottom, even though in reality the program runs in\na coordinated fashion, distributed across many machines. We implemented a\nprototype interpreter for Symphony leveraging multiple cryptographic backends.\nWith it we wrote a variety of MPC programs, finding that Symphony can express\noptimized protocols that other languages cannot, and that in general Symphony\nprograms operate efficiently.\n  [ full abstract at https://doi.org/10.22152/programming-journal.org/2023/7/14\n]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 16:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Recently,\ndeep learning based methods have proven effective on some benchmark datasets,\nsuch as KITTI and Scene Flow. UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are commonly\nutilized for surface observation, and their captured images are frequently used\nfor detailed 3D reconstruction due to high resolution and low-altitude\nacquisition. At present, the mainstream supervised learning network requires a\nsignificant amount of training data with ground-truth labels to learn model\nparameters. However, due to the scarcity of UAV stereo matching datasets, the\nlearning-based network cannot be applied to UAV images. To facilitate further\nresearch, this paper proposes a novel pipeline to generate accurate and dense\ndisparity maps using detailed meshes reconstructed by UAV images and LiDAR\npoint clouds. Through the proposed pipeline, this paper constructs a\nmulti-resolution UAV scenario dataset, called UAVStereo, with over 34k stereo\nimage pairs covering 3 typical scenes.

Nowadays, data processing (e.g., storage,\nvisualization, and analytics) is often performed at the programming language\nlevel, hence it is desirable to also adopt columnar data structures for common\nlanguage runtimes. While there are frameworks, libraries, and APIs to enable\ncolumnar data stores in programming languages, their integration into\napplications typically requires developer interference. In prior work,\nresearchers implemented an approach for *automated* transformation of arrays\ninto columnar arrays in the GraalVM JavaScript runtime. However, this approach\nsuffers from performance issues on smaller workloads as well as on more complex\nnested data structures. We find that the key to optimizing accesses to columnar\narrays is to identify queries and apply specific optimizations to them. In this\npaper, we describe novel compiler optimizations in the GraalVM Compiler that\noptimize queries on columnar arrays. At JIT compile time, we identify loops\nthat access potentially columnar arrays and duplicate them in order to\nspecifically optimize accesses to columnar arrays. Additionally, we describe a\nnew approach for creating columnar arrays from arrays consisting of complex\nobjects by performing **multi-level storage transformation**.

Novel manufacturing techniques were used, resulting in a\n1.17$^{\\circ}$ mean beam axis skew angle, a 104 $\\mu$m mean element position\nerror, and a $\\pm$13.6 $\\mu$m deviation in matching layer thickness. The\nnominal acoustic performance was measured using hydrophone scans and watershot\ndata, and the 61.2 dB SNR, 55.4$^{\\circ}$ opening angle, 16.3 mm beamwidth and\n54% transmit-receive bandwidth (-12 dB), were found to be similar to existing\nsystems, and compatible with full waveform inversion reconstruction methods.\nThe inter-element variation in acoustic performance was typically <10% without\nusing normalisation, meaning that the elements can be modelled identically\nduring image reconstruction, removing the need for individual source\ndefinitions based on hydrophone measurements. Finally, data from a phantom\nexperiment was successfully reconstructed. These results demonstrate that the\nopen-UST system is accessible for users, and suitable for UST imaging research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 17:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

On the other hand, non-Hermitian\nphysics, usually associated with dissipation arising from the coupling to\nenvironment, emerges as a frontier of modern physics in recent years. In this\nletter, we investigate the interplay between non-Hermitian physics and strong\ncorrelation in Dirac-fermion systems. We develop a sign-problem-free projector\nquantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) algorithm for the non-Hermitian interacting fermionic\nsystems. Employing state-of-the-art projector QMC simulation, we decipher the\nground-state phase diagram of the Honeycomb Hubbard model in the presence\nnon-Hermitian asymmetric spin resolved hopping processes. Intriguingly, the\nantiferromagnetic ordering induced by Hubbard interaction is enhanced by the\nnon-Hermitian asymmetric hopping. More remarkably, our study reveals that\ncritical properties of the quantum phase transition between Dirac semi-metal\nand AF ordered phases are consistent with the XY universality class in\nHermitian system, implying Hermiticity is emergent at the quantum critical\npoint. The numerically-exact QMC approach utilized in this study is easily\napplied to other non-Hermitian interacting fermionic models, hence paving a new\navenue to investigating quantum many-body physics in non-Hermitian systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 17:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

From the consistency condition of the constraints\nobtained from the Dirac method, we can observe that this model presents, for\ncertain values of the $\\alpha$ parameter, two second-class constraints, which\nmeans that this system does not possess gauge invariance. However, we know that\nit is possible to disclose gauge symmetries in such a system by converting the\noriginal second-class system into a first-class one. This procedure can be done\nthrough the gauge unfixing (GU) formalism by acting with a projection operator\ndirectly on the original second-class Hamiltonian, without adding any extra\ndegrees of freedom in the phase space. One of the constraints becomes the gauge\nsymmetry generator of the theory and the other one is disregarded. At the end,\nwe have a first-class Hamiltonian satisfying a first-class algebra. Here, our\ngoal is to apply a new scheme of embedding second-class constrained systems\nbased on the GU formalism, named improved GU formalism, in the BCSM.

This pattern is especially common amongst logicians and\nset theorists, but workaday mathematicians also commonly do this too, witnessed\nby narrative notes accompanying a proof -- \"the following proof is\nconstructive\", or \"the following proof does not use choice\", for example. Yet,\ncurrent proof assistants provide poor support for capturing these narrative\nnotes formally, an observation that is especially true of systems based on\nGordon's HOL, a classical higher-order logic. Consequently, HOL and its many\nimplementations seem ironically more committed to classical reasoning than\nmainstream mathematicians are themselves, limiting the mathematical content\nthat one may easily formalise. To facilitate these context switches, we propose\nthat mathematicians mentally employ a simple tainting system when temporarily\nworking subclassically -- an idea not currently explored in proof assistants.\nWe introduce a series of modest but far-reaching changes to HOL, extending the\nstandard two-place Natural Deduction relation to incorporate a taint-label,\ntaken from a particular lattice, and which describes or limits the \"amount\" of\nclassical reasoning used within a proof.

Thus, training on tweets is challenging and\ndemands large-scale human-annotated labels, which are time-consuming and costly\nto obtain. In this paper, we find that providing hashtags to social media\ntweets can help alleviate this issue because hashtags can enrich short and\nambiguous tweets in terms of various information, such as topic, sentiment, and\nstance. This motivates us to propose a novel Hashtag-guided Tweet\nClassification model (HashTation), which automatically generates meaningful\nhashtags for the input tweet to provide useful auxiliary signals for tweet\nclassification. To generate high-quality and insightful hashtags, our hashtag\ngeneration model retrieves and encodes the post-level and entity-level\ninformation across the whole corpus.

In previous algorithms, potential solutions to\nthe given optimization problems were encoded as basis states of the Hilbert\nspace. Quantum dueling, however, doubles the number of qubits used, making the\nbasis states represent a pair of potential solutions in the augmented Hilbert\nspace. Under this representation, we realize that if we can construct quantum\noracles that identify one element of such pair over the other based on the\nobjective function, quantum optimization can be achieved by quantum amplitude\namplification. An additional set of parameters are required to compensate for\nreachability issues. We extensively use classical simulation evidence to test\nour designs. For intuitively chosen parameters, quantum dueling performs well,\nthough reachability is highly dependent on solution distribution. In this case,\nthe evolution of the success probability is highly regular. Thus, there might\nbe ways to approximate the state evolution mathematically. For optimal\nparameters, data suggest that quantum dueling requires $O(\\sqrt{N})$ accesses\nto the gates to reach a constant-level success probability threshold and\nperforms well for almost all solution distributions. In addition to potential\nconstant-level optimization compared with the fastest algorithms, quantum\ndueling can also be used as a subroutine for higher-level quantum algorithms.\nMoreover, quantum dueling shares similarities with many variational\noptimization algorithms, most notably QAOA. This suggests that the strategy of\nquantum dueling might be transplanted into a Hamiltonian setup. In that case,\nwe might obtain viable optimization algorithms for near-term quantum computing,\nwith the added advantage of easier training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 18:33:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 05:52:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 May 2023 22:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Since almost all known examples are large, the\nconstruction of small ones, with $k$ close to the order of the plane, is\nconsidered a hard problem. A natural candidate to be a small $(k,n)$-arc with\nfew characters is the set $\\Omega(\\mathcal{C})$ of the points of a plane curve\n$\\mathcal{C}$ of degree $n$ (containing no linear components) such that some\nline meets $\\mathcal{C}$ transversally in the plane, i.e. in $n$ pairwise\ndistinct points.

Our main result for the\nHermitian case is that $\\Omega(\\mathcal{C})$ is complete for $r\\ge 4$. For the\nrational BKS curve, $\\Omega(\\mathcal{C})$ is complete if and only if $r$ is\neven.

Spiking across populations of\nneurons in many regions of the mammalian brain maintains a robust temporal\nmemory, a neural timeline of the recent past. Behavioral results demonstrate\nthat people can estimate an extended temporal model of the future, suggesting\nthat the neural timeline of the past could extend through the present into the\nfuture. This paper presents a mathematical framework for learning and\nexpressing relationships between events in continuous time. We assume that the\nbrain has access to a temporal memory in the form of the real Laplace transform\nof the recent past. Hebbian associations with a diversity of synaptic time\nscales are formed between the past and the present that record the temporal\nrelationships between events. Knowing the temporal relationships between the\npast and the present allows one to predict relationships between the present\nand the future, thus constructing an extended temporal prediction for the\nfuture. Both memory for the past and the predicted future are represented as\nthe real Laplace transform, expressed as the firing rate over populations of\nneurons indexed by different rate constants $s$. The diversity of synaptic\ntimescales allows for a temporal record over the much larger time scale of\ntrial history. In this framework, temporal credit assignment can be assessed\nvia a Laplace temporal difference. The Laplace temporal difference compares the\nfuture that actually follows a stimulus to the future predicted just before the\nstimulus was observed. This computational framework makes a number of specific\nneurophysiological predictions and, taken together, could provide the basis for\na future iteration of RL that incorporates temporal memory as a fundamental\nbuilding block.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 18:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

We find that the\nradial structure of the disc is never mostly supported by the magnetic field.\nIn fact, thin MADs are very near Keplerian. However, as discs gets colder, they\nbecome more magnetized and the largest deviations from standard theory appear\nin our thinnest disc with $h_\\mathrm{th}/r=0.03$. In this case, the disc is\nmuch more extended vertically and much less dense than in standard theory\nbecause of vertical support from the turbulent magnetic pressure and\nwind-driven angular momentum transport that enhances the inflow speed.

Here we\nintroduce a physics-based sparsity-constrained optimization framework that\ntakes into account the constraints on wavefront shaping and the sparse-to-dense\ntransformation via complex media to enhance projection fidelity through complex\nmedia. Our method achieves unprecedented high-fidelity light manipulation at\nthe full speed of DMDs (22 kHz) owing to the pursuit of more feasible, optimal,\nand numerically stable inverse solutions. In addition, our method is\nsystem-agnostic and generalizable, demonstrating consistent superior\nperformance across different types of complex media with up to an 89% increase\nin projection accuracy and a 126% improvement in speckle suppression. The\nproposed optimization framework has the potential to enhance existing\nholographic setups without any change to the hardware, enable high-fidelity and\nhigh-speed wavefront shaping through different scattering media and platforms,\nand directly facilitate a wide range of physics and real-world applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 19:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Mar 2023 14:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

We define a coarse-resolution neural solver for each subtask, which\nrequires fewer computational resources, and jointly train them with the vanilla\nphysics-constrained loss by simply arranging their outputs to reconstruct the\noriginal solution. Due to the perfect parallelism between them, the solution is\nachieved as fast as a coarse-resolution neural solver. In addition, the trained\nsolvers bring the flexibility of simulating with multiple levels of resolution.\nWe demonstrate the successful application of NeuralStagger on 2D and 3D fluid\ndynamics simulations, which leads to an additional $10\\sim100\\times$ speed-up.\nMoreover, the experiment also shows that the learned model could be well used\nfor optimal control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 19:36:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 May 2023 23:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

However, optimizing the non-concave $F_1$ score is\nnot a classic RL problem, thus invalidates standard RL methods. To remedy this\nissue, we develop a reward shaping approach, leveraging properties of the $F_1$\nscore and duality of policy optimization, to provably find the set of all\nPareto-optimal policies for budget-constrained $F_1$ score maximization.

The fingerprint of DQI is the presence of an antiresonance in\nthe transmission function, and its origin is deeply connected to the topology\nof the atomic structure, which we discuss in terms of symmetry arguments\nsupported by numerical simulations. A systematic analysis of the influence of\nsystem size on the transmission function reveals that the DQI antiresonance\npersists for large systems in the ballistic regime and establishes the quantum\nconfinement gap as the intrinsic resolution limit to detect QI effects.\nFurthermore, we consider the influence of disorder, electron-electron and\nelectron-phonon interactions, and provide quantitative criteria for the\nrobustness of DQI in their presence.

We perform the first systematic\nsearch for protoclusters around a homogeneously selected sample of 12\nspectroscopically confirmed submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $z\\sim1.2-5.3$ in\nthe GOODS-N field. We applied the Poisson Probability Method (PPM) to search\nfor Mpc scale overdensities around these SMGs using three photometric redshift\ncatalogs. We detect galaxy overdensities for 11 out of the 12 SMGs\n($92\\%\\pm8$\\%), distributed over eight protoclusters. We confirm three\npreviously discovered protoclusters, and we detect five new ones around the\nSMGs SMMJ123634 ($z=1.225$), ID.19 ($z=2.047$), SMMJ123607 ($z=2.487$),\nSMMJ123606 ($z=2.505$), and GN10 ($z=5.303$). A wavelet-based analysis shows\nthat the SMGs live in protocluster cores with a complex morphology (compact,\nfilamentary, or clumpy) and an average size of $\\sim(0.4-1)$Mpc. By comparing\nthe PPM results obtained using independently the three redshift catalogs, we\npossibly witness a transitioning phase at $z\\gtrsim4$ for the galaxy\npopulations. While $z\\lesssim4$ protoclusters appear to be populated by dusty\ngalaxies, those at highest redshifts $z\\sim5$ are detected as overdensities of\nLyman$\\alpha$ emitters or Lyman break galaxies. We also find a good correlation\nbetween the molecular (H$_2$) gas mass of the SMG and the overdensity\nsignificance. To explain the overall phenomenology, we suggest that galaxy\ninteractions in dense environments likely triggered the starburst and gas-rich\nphase of the SMGs.

Here we present Variational Autoencoding Neural Operators (VANO), a\ngeneral strategy for making a large class of operator learning architectures\nact as variational autoencoders. For this purpose, we provide a novel rigorous\nmathematical formulation of the variational objective in function spaces for\ntraining. VANO first maps an input function to a distribution over a latent\nspace using a parametric encoder and then decodes a sample from the latent\ndistribution to reconstruct the input, as in classic variational autoencoders.\nWe test VANO with different model set-ups and architecture choices for a\nvariety of benchmarks.

In particular, long-term experiments and applications face\nissues such as exhaustion of signaling molecules (SMs) at the transmitter (TX)\nand interference by SMs from previous transmissions at the receiver (RX). To\novercome these practical burdens, a new class of SMs with switchable states\nseems to be promising. For example, certain switchable SMs can be switched\nbetween two states, whereupon the sensitivity of the RX depends on the state.\nHence, only molecules in one of the states are observable at the RX. Assuming\nthat the SMs are already inside the channel, the TX can switch them to the\nobservable state by applying an appropriate trigger. Later, to prevent\ninterference, an eraser (EX) may switch the SMs back to the non-observable\nstate and they can remain in the channel until they get reused for another\ntransmission. In this work, we provide an overview of existing switchable SMs,\nand classify them according to their properties. Furthermore, we highlight how\nswitchable SMs can be utilized for media modulation. In addition, we present\nfirst experimental results for a system employing the $\\textit{green\nfluorescent protein variant \"Dreiklang\"}$ (GFPD) as switchable SM.

However, the oceans are under threat\nfrom climate change, which is devastating the marine ecosystem and the economic\nand social systems that depend on it. The Internet-of-underwater-things\n(IoUTs), a global interconnection of underwater objects, enables\nround-the-clock monitoring of the oceans. It provides high-resolution data for\ntraining machine learning (ML) algorithms for rapidly evaluating potential\nclimate change solutions and speeding up decision-making. The sensors in\nconventional IoUTs are battery-powered, which limits their lifetime, and\nconstitutes environmental hazards when they die. In this paper, we propose a\nsustainable scheme to improve the throughput and lifetime of underwater\nnetworks, enabling them to potentially operate indefinitely. The scheme is\nbased on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) from an\nautonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) used for data collection. We model the\nproblem of jointly maximising throughput and harvested power as a Markov\nDecision Process (MDP), and develop a model-free reinforcement learning (RL)\nalgorithm as a solution. The model's reward function incentivises the AUV to\nfind optimal trajectories that maximise throughput and power transfer to the\nunderwater nodes while minimising energy consumption. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt at using RL to ensure sustainable\nunderwater networks via SWIPT. The scheme is implemented in an open 3D RL\nenvironment specifically developed in MATLAB for this study. The performance\nresults show up 207% improvement in energy efficiency compared to those of a\nrandom trajectory scheme used as a baseline model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 00:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

However, these algorithms are\neither computationally intractable or unable to handle unknown variance of the\nnoise. In this paper, we present a novel solution to this open problem by\nproposing the first computationally efficient algorithm for linear bandits with\nheteroscedastic noise. Our algorithm is adaptive to the unknown variance of\nnoise and achieves an $\\tilde{O}(d \\sqrt{\\sum_{k = 1}^K \\sigma_k^2} + d)$\nregret, where $\\sigma_k^2$ is the variance of the noise at the round $k$, $d$\nis the dimension of the contexts and $K$ is the total number of rounds.

We propose a variance-adaptive\nalgorithm for linear mixture MDPs, which achieves a problem-dependent\nhorizon-free regret bound that can gracefully reduce to a nearly constant\nregret for deterministic MDPs. Unlike existing nearly minimax optimal\nalgorithms for linear mixture MDPs, our algorithm does not require explicit\nvariance estimation of the transitional probabilities or the use of high-order\nmoment estimators to attain horizon-free regret.

In the\npresent paper, we will focus on the general quasilinear Klein-Gordon equation\nwithout the null condition and further show that the existence time of the\nsolution can be improved to $T_\\varepsilon=+\\infty$ if $d\\geq3$ and\n$T_\\varepsilon\\ge e^{C\\varepsilon^{-2}}$ if $d=2$. In addition, for $d=2$ and\nany fixed number $\\alpha>0$, if the weighted $L^2$ norm of the initial data\nwith the weight $(1+|x|)^\\alpha$ is small, then the solution exists globally\nand scatters to a free solution. The arguments are based on the introduction of\na good unknown, the Strichartz estimate, the weighted $L^2$-norm estimate and\nthe resonance analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 01:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Of the various\nnumerically-generated geometries, one is selected as being most suitable for\nfabrication at the microscale, and numerical simulations with the Oldroyd-B and\nPhan-Thien and Tanner models confirm that the optimal flow fields in the chosen\ngeometry are observed for both constant viscosity and shear thinning\nviscoelastic fluids. Fabrication of the geometry, which we name the optimized\nuniaxial and biaxial extensional rheometer (OUBER), is achieved with high\nprecision at the microscale by selective laser-induced etching of a\nfused-silica substrate. Employing a viscous Newtonian fluid with a refractive\nindex matched to that of the optically transparent microfluidic device, we\nconduct microtomographic-particle image velocimetry in order to resolve the\nflow field at low Reynolds number (< 0.1) in a substantial volume around the\nstagnation point. The flow velocimetry confirms the accurate imposition of the\ndesired and predicted flows, with pure extensional flow at an essentially\nuniform deformation rate being applied over a wide region around the stagnation\npoint.

The same models can alternatively be used to determine the\noptimal budget that should be allocated for substation hardening when long-term\nforecasts of storm frequency and impact (specifically restoration times) are\navailable. The two optimization models differ in terms of capturing risk\nattitude: one minimizes the average load shed for given scenario probabilities\nand the other minimizes the worst-case load shed without needing scenario\nprobabilities. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed models, we further\ndevelop a case study for the Texas Gulf Coast using storm surge maps developed\nby the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a synthetic power\ngrid for the state of Texas developed as part of an ARPA-E project.

(2) The priors, e.g., text prior or stroke prior, employed\nin existing works, are extracted from pre-trained text recognizers. That said,\nsuch priors suffer from the domain gap including low resolution and blurriness\ncaused by poor imaging conditions, leading to incorrect guidance. Our work\naddresses these gaps and proposes a plug-and-play module dubbed Dual Prior\nModulation Network (DPMN), which leverages dual image-level priors to bring\nperformance gain over existing approaches.

Many decision-making problems in practice naturally\ninvolve multiple agents and require multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)\nunder centralized training decentralized execution paradigm. Nevertheless,\nexisting MARL algorithms often adopt standard experience replay where the\ntransitions are uniformly sampled regardless of their importance. Finding\nprioritized sampling weights that are optimized for MARL experience replay has\nyet to be explored. To this end, we propose MAC-PO, which formulates optimal\nprioritized experience replay for multi-agent problems as a regret minimization\nover the sampling weights of transitions. Such optimization is relaxed and\nsolved using the Lagrangian multiplier approach to obtain the close-form\noptimal sampling weights. By minimizing the resulting policy regret, we can\nnarrow the gap between the current policy and a nominal optimal policy, thus\nacquiring an improved prioritization scheme for multi-agent tasks.

The frontier-based\nmethod, which is one of the representative works on autonomous exploration,\ndrives autonomous determination by the definition of frontier information, so\nthat complete information about the environment is available to the quadrotor.\nHowever, existing frontier-based methods are able to accomplish the task but\nstill suffer from inefficient exploration. How to improve the efficiency of\nautonomous exploration is the focus of current research. Typical problems\ninclude slow frontier generation, which affects real-time viewpoint\ndetermination, and insufficient determination methods that affect the quality\nof viewpoints. Therefore, to overcome these problems, this paper proposes a\ntwo-level viewpoint determination method for frontier-based autonomous\nexploration. Firstly, a sampling-based frontier detection method is presented\nfor faster frontier generation, which improves the immediacy of environmental\nrepresentation compared to traditional traversal-based methods. Secondly, we\nconsider the access to environmental information during flight for the first\ntime and design an innovative heuristic evaluation function to decide on a\nhigh-quality viewpoint as the next local navigation target in each exploration\niteration. We conducted extensive benchmark and real-world tests to validate\nour method.

It is also challenging\nbecause the complexity of the real-world point cloud brings difficulties in\nlearning object layout experiences from the observation data (non-empty rooms\nwith labeled semantics).

It uses Monte Carlo\nTree Search in combination with an adaptive discretization of the action space\nas well as optimistic optimization to efficiently sample high-dimensional\ncontinuous action spaces and compute the best action to perform. Specifically,\nwe adaptively discretize the action space for each sampled belief using a\nhierarchical partition called Voronoi tree, which is a Binary Space\nPartitioning that implicitly maintains the partition of a cell as the Voronoi\ndiagram of two points sampled from the cell. ADVT uses the estimated diameters\nof the cells to form an upper-confidence bound on the action value function\nwithin the cell, guiding the Monte Carlo Tree Search expansion and further\ndiscretization of the action space. This enables ADVT to better exploit local\ninformation with respect to the action value function, allowing faster\nidentification of the most promising regions in the action space, compared to\nexisting solvers. Voronoi trees keep the cost of partitioning and estimating\nthe diameter of each cell low, even in high-dimensional spaces where many\nsampled points are required to cover the space well.

As one of the most common techniques,\npruning has been studied for a long time. By exploiting the structured sparsity\nof the neural network, existing methods can prune neurons instead of individual\nweights. However, in most existing pruning methods, surviving neurons are\nrandomly connected in the neural network without any structure, and the\nnon-zero weights within each neuron are also randomly distributed. Such\nirregular sparse structure can cause very high control overhead and irregular\nmemory access for the hardware and even increase the neural network\ncomputational complexity. In this paper, we propose a three-layer hierarchical\nprior to promote a more regular sparse structure during pruning.

This additional cost -- called distillation cost -- is most\npronounced when we employ large-scale teacher models such as vision\ntransformers (ViTs). We present MaskedKD, a simple yet effective strategy that\ncan significantly reduce the cost of distilling ViTs without sacrificing the\nprediction accuracy of the student model. Specifically, MaskedKD diminishes the\ncost of running teacher at inference by masking a fraction of image patch\ntokens fed to the teacher, and therefore skipping the computations required to\nprocess those patches. The mask locations are selected to prevent masking away\nthe core features of an image that the student model uses for prediction. This\nmask selection mechanism operates based on some attention score of the student\nmodel, which is already computed during the student forward pass, and thus\nincurs almost no additional computation. Without sacrificing the final student\naccuracy, MaskedKD dramatically reduces the amount of computations required for\ndistilling ViTs. We demonstrate that MaskedKD can save up the distillation cost\nby $50\\%$ without any student performance drop, leading to approximately $28\\%$\ndrop in the overall training FLOPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 07:48:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 04:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose an automated test\ngeneration method for detecting erroneous behaviors of various NLP\napplications. Our method is designed based on the sentence parsing process of\nclassic linguistics, and thus it is capable of assembling basic grammatical\nelements and adjuncts into a grammatically correct test with proper oracle\ninformation. We implement this method into NLPLego, which is designed to fully\nexploit the potential of seed sentences to automate the test generation.\nNLPLego disassembles the seed sentence into the template and adjuncts and then\ngenerates new sentences by assembling context-appropriate adjuncts with the\ntemplate in a specific order. Unlike the taskspecific methods, the tests\ngenerated by NLPLego have derivation relations and different degrees of\nvariation, which makes constructing appropriate metamorphic relations easier.\nThus, NLPLego is general, meaning it can meet the testing requirements of\nvarious NLP applications. To validate NLPLego, we experiment with three common\nNLP tasks, identifying failures in four state-of-art models. Given seed tests\nfrom SQuAD 2.0, SST, and QQP, NLPLego successfully detects 1,732, 5301, and\n261,879 incorrect behaviors with around 95.7% precision in three tasks,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 07:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

However, as the purpose of few-shot learning is to handle\nunknown/unseen classes, such class-specific feature extraction in pretrain is\nnot ideal to generalize into new classes for few-shot learning. Moreover, point\ncloud datasets hardly have a large number of classes due to the annotation\ndifficulty.

To address this problem, we propose RSM, or Reusable\nSlotwise Mechanisms, that jointly learns a slotwise representation of the scene\nand a modular architecture that dynamically chooses one mechanism among a set\nof reusable mechanisms to predict the next state of each slot. RSM crucially\ntakes advantage of a \\textit{Central Contextual Information (CCI)}, which lets\neach selected reusable mechanism access the rest of the slots through a\nbottleneck, effectively allowing for modeling higher order and complex\ninteractions that might require a sparse subset of objects.

The broad wavelength\ncoverage was designed to provide a range of stellar activity indicators to\nassess the nature of potential RV signals and to provide valuable spectral\ninformation to help characterise the stellar targets. The CARMENES Data Release\n1 (DR1) makes public all observations obtained during the CARMENES guaranteed\ntime observations, which ran from 2016 to 2020 and collected 19,633 spectra for\na sample of 362 targets. The CARMENES survey target selection was aimed at\nminimising biases, and about 70% of all known M dwarfs within 10 pc and\naccessible from Calar Alto were included. The data were pipeline-processed, and\nhigh-level data products, including 18,642 precise RVs for 345 targets, were\nderived. Time series data of spectroscopic activity indicators were also\nobtained. We discuss the characteristics of the CARMENES data, the statistical\nproperties of the stellar sample, and the spectroscopic measurements. We show\nexamples of the use of CARMENES data and provide a contextual view of the\nexoplanet population revealed by the survey, including 33 new planets, 17\nre-analysed planets, and 26 confirmed planets from transiting candidate\nfollow-up. A subsample of 238 targets was used to derive updated planet\noccurrence rates, yielding an overall average of 1.44+/-0.20 planets with 1\nM_Earth < M sin i < 1000 M_Earth and 1 d < P_orb < 1000 d per star, and\nindicating that nearly every M dwarf hosts at least one planet. CARMENES data\nhave proven very useful for identifying and measuring planetary companions as\nwell as for additional applications, such as the determination of stellar\nproperties, the characterisation of stellar activity, and the study of\nexoplanet atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 08:54:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 11:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Magnetic fields (B-fields)\nobtained from the polarized emission tend to be perpendicular to the filament's\nspine. We produce a map of B-field strengths for the center region of the\nfilament. The strengths vary in the range of 100-600 $\\mu\\rm{G}$ and are\nstrongest along the filament's spine. The central region is sub-Alfv\\'enic and\nmostly sub-critical meaning that B-fields dominate over turbulence and are\nstrong enough to resist gravitational collapse. The alignment and properties of\ndust grains are studied in the filament using the RAdiative Torque (RAT)\ntheory. We find the decrease of polarization degree $P$ with emission intensity\n$I$, i.e., depolarization effect, of the form $P\\propto I^{-\\alpha}$ with\n$\\alpha\\sim$0.8-0.9, implying a significant loss of grain alignment in the\nfilament's spine. The depolarization can be explained by the decrease in RAT\nalignment efficiency toward the denser regions with lower dust temperature, and\ncannot be explained by the B-field tangling. We study the effect of the\nenhanced magnetic relaxation by embedded iron inclusions on RAT alignment and\nfind that the high polarization fraction $P\\sim$20-30\\% in the outer layer of\nthe filament is potential evidence for the enhanced RAT alignment by magnetic\nrelaxation. This is the first time this effect is evaluated in a filament.\nBased on the polarization fraction and RAT alignment theory, we find evidence\nfor grain growth in the filament.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 09:16:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 02:20:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 06:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

The\ngame is played on a connected graph in which two players, one controlling a\nnumber of cops and the other controlling a robber, take alternating turns. In a\nturn, each player may move each of their pieces: The robber always moves\nbetween adjacent vertices. Regarding the moves of the cops we distinguish four\nversions that differ in whether the cops are on the vertices or the edges of\nthe graph and whether the robber may move on/through them. The goal of the cops\nis to surround the robber, i.e., occupying all neighbors (vertex version) or\nincident edges (edge version) of the robber's current vertex. In contrast, the\nrobber tries to avoid being surrounded indefinitely. Given a graph, the\nso-called cop number denotes the minimum number of cops required to eventually\nsurround the robber. We relate the different cop numbers of these versions and\nprove that none of them is bounded by a function of the classical cop number\nand the maximum degree of the graph, thereby refuting a conjecture by Crytser,\nKomarov and Mackey [Graphs and Combinatorics, 2020].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 10:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

The main\nidea of the present work is to calculate probabilities conditional not on the\nfeatures, but on the trained classifier's output. This calculation is cheap,\nneeds to be made only once, and provides an output-to-probability \"transducer\"\nthat can be applied to all future outputs of the classifier. In conjunction\nwith problem-dependent utilities, the probabilities of the transducer allow us\nto find the optimal choice among the classes or among a set of more general\ndecisions, by means of expected-utility maximization.

They waste valuable developer time by making\ndevelopers investigate false alerts (flaky test failures). To deal with this\nproblem, many prediction methods that identify flaky tests have been proposed.\nWhile promising, the actual utility of these methods remains unclear since they\nhave not been evaluated within a continuous integration (CI) process. In\nparticular, it remains unclear what is the impact of missed faults, i.e., the\nconsideration of fault-triggering test failures as flaky, at different CI\ncycles. To fill this gap, we apply state-of-the-art flakiness prediction\nmethods at the Chromium CI and check their performance. Perhaps surprisingly,\nwe find that, despite the high precision (99.2%) of the methods, their\napplication leads to numerous faults missed, approximately 76.2% of all\nregression faults. To explain this result, we analyse the fault-triggering\nfailures and show that flaky tests have a strong fault-revealing capability,\ni.e., they reveal more than 1/3 of all regression faults, indicating an\ninherent limitation of all methods focusing on identifying flaky tests, instead\nof flaky test failures. Going a step further, we build failure-focused\nprediction methods and optimize them by considering new features.\nInterestingly, we find that these methods perform better than the test-focused\nones, with an MCC increasing from 0.20 to 0.42. Overall, our findings imply\nthat on the one hand future research should focus on predicting flaky test\nfailures instead of flaky tests and the need for adopting more thorough\nexperimental methodologies when evaluating flakiness prediction methods, on the\nother.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 10:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

An intriguing open question is whether\nBPC on such graphs admits the same best known approximation guarantees as\nclassic bin packing.\n  We answer this question negatively, by showing that (in contrast to bin\npacking) there is no asymptotic polynomial-time approximation scheme (APTAS)\nfor BPC already on seemingly easy graph classes, such as bipartite and split\ngraphs. We complement this result with improved approximation guarantees for\nBPC on several prominent graph classes. Most notably, we derive an asymptotic\n$1.391$-approximation for bipartite graphs, a $2.445$-approximation for perfect\ngraphs, and a $\\left(1+\\frac{2}{e}\\right)$-approximation for split graphs. To\nthis end, we introduce a generic framework relying on a novel interpretation of\nBPC allowing us to solve the problem via maximization techniques.\n  Our framework may find use in tackling BPC on other graph classes arising in\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 11:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

The efficacy of\nthis method relies on correctly localizing the host galaxies. However, recent\ntheoretical studies have shown that astrophysical environments could mislead\nthe spatial localization by distorting the GW signals. It is unclear whether\nand to what degree the incorrect spatial localizations of dark sirens would\nimpair the accuracy of the measurement of the cosmological parameters. To\naddress this issue, we consider the future observations of dark sirens using\nthe Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope, and we design a Bayesian\nframework to access the precision of measuring the Hubble-Lema\\^itre constant\n$H_0$. Interestingly, we find that the precision is not compromised when the\nnumber of well-localized dark sirens is significantly below $300$, even in the\nextreme scenario that all the dark sirens are localized incorrectly.

We propose several tests that can be used in future\nobservations to verify the spatial localizations of dark sirens.

For this task, a straightforward method is to directly train an\nend-to-end 3D network. However, it demands much more training data and\nexpensive computational costs. Here, we propose to link in-plane and\nthrough-plane transformers for simultaneous in-plane denoising and\nthrough-plane deblurring, termed as LIT-Former, which can efficiently synergize\nin-plane and through-plane sub-tasks for 3D CT imaging and enjoy the advantages\nof both convolution and transformer networks. LIT-Former has two novel designs:\nefficient multi-head self-attention modules (eMSM) and efficient convolutional\nfeed-forward networks (eCFN). First, eMSM integrates in-plane 2D self-attention\nand through-plane 1D self-attention to efficiently capture global interactions\nof 3D self-attention, the core unit of transformer networks. Second, eCFN\nintegrates 2D convolution and 1D convolution to extract local information of 3D\nconvolution in the same fashion. As a result, the proposed LIT-Former\nsynergizes these two sub-tasks, significantly reducing the computational\ncomplexity as compared to 3D counterparts and enabling rapid convergence.\nExtensive experimental results on simulated and clinical datasets demonstrate\nsuperior performance over state-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 12:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

To tackle these issues, inspired by superimposed feedback and integrated\nsensing and communications (ISAC), a line of sight (LoS) sensing-based\nsuperimposed CSI feedback scheme is proposed. Specifically, on the UAV\ntransmitter side, the ground-to-UAV (G2U) CSI is superimposed on the\nUAVto-ground (U2G) data to feed back to the ground base station (gBS). At the\ngBS, the dedicated LoS sensing network (LoSSenNet) is designed to sense the U2G\nCSI in LoS and NLoS scenarios. With the sensed result of LoS-SenNet, the\ndetermined G2U CSI from the initial feature extraction will work as the priori\ninformation to guide the subsequent operation. Specifically, for the G2U CSI in\nNLoS, a CSI recovery network (CSI-RecNet) and superimposed interference\ncancellation are developed to recover the G2U CSI and U2G data. As for the LoS\nscenario, a dedicated LoS aid network (LoS-AidNet) is embedded before the\nCSI-RecNet and the block of superimposed interference cancellation to highlight\nthe feature of the G2U CSI. Compared with other methods of superimposed CSI\nfeedback, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed feedback scheme\neffectively improves the recovery accuracy of the G2U CSI and U2G data.\nBesides, against parameter variations, the proposed feedback scheme presents\nits robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 13:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Our method\ntakes as input a single RGB image along with its camera pose and gradually\ndenoises a set of 3D points, whose positions are initially sampled randomly\nfrom a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution, into the shape of an object.\nThe key to our method is a geometrically-consistent conditioning process which\nwe call projection conditioning: at each step in the diffusion process, we\nproject local image features onto the partially-denoised point cloud from the\ngiven camera pose. This projection conditioning process enables us to generate\nhigh-resolution sparse geometries that are well-aligned with the input image,\nand can additionally be used to predict point colors after shape\nreconstruction. Moreover, due to the probabilistic nature of the diffusion\nprocess, our method is naturally capable of generating multiple different\nshapes consistent with a single input image.

ANN-SNN conversion, as the most commonly used training method for\napplying SNNs, can ensure that converted SNNs achieve comparable performance to\nANNs on large-scale datasets. However, the performance degrades severely under\nlow quantities of time-steps, which hampers the practical applications of SNNs\nto neuromorphic chips. In this paper, instead of evaluating different\nconversion errors and then eliminating these errors, we define an offset spike\nto measure the degree of deviation between actual and desired SNN firing rates.\nWe perform a detailed analysis of offset spike and note that the firing of one\nadditional (or one less) spike is the main cause of conversion errors. Based on\nthis, we propose an optimization strategy based on shifting the initial\nmembrane potential and we theoretically prove the corresponding optimal\nshifting distance for calibrating the spike. In addition, we also note that our\nmethod has a unique iterative property that enables further reduction of\nconversion errors. The experimental results show that our proposed method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet\ndatasets.

When applying the adversarial voices that are generated by\nattacking white-box surrogate models to black-box victim models, i.e.\n\\textit{transfer-based} black-box attacks, the transferability of the\nadversarial voices is not only far from satisfactory, but also lacks\ninterpretable basis. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a\ngeneral framework, named spectral transformation attack based on modified\ndiscrete cosine transform (STA-MDCT), to improve the transferability of the\nadversarial voices to a black-box victim model. Specifically, we first apply\nMDCT to the input voice. Then, we slightly modify the energy of different\nfrequency bands for capturing the salient regions of the adversarial noise in\nthe time-frequency domain that are critical to a successful attack. Unlike\nexisting approaches that operate voices in the time domain, the proposed\nframework operates voices in the time-frequency domain, which improves the\ninterpretability, transferability, and imperceptibility of the attack.\nMoreover, it can be implemented with any gradient-based attackers. To utilize\nthe advantage of model ensembling, we not only implement STA-MDCT with a single\nwhite-box surrogate model, but also with an ensemble of surrogate models.\nFinally, we visualize the saliency maps of adversarial voices by the class\nactivation maps (CAM), which offers an interpretable basis to transfer-based\nattacks in speaker recognition for the first time. Extensive comparison results\nwith five representative attackers show that the CAM visualization clearly\nexplains the effectiveness of STA-MDCT, and the weaknesses of the comparison\nmethods; the proposed method outperforms the comparison methods by a large\nmargin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 14:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Current approaches to this issue consist in learning general\nrepresentations from huge amounts of data before fine-tuning the model on a\nsmall dataset of interest. While such technique, coined transfer learning, is\nvery effective in domains such as computer vision or natural langage\nprocessing, it does not yet solve common problems of deep learning such as\nmodel interpretability or the overall need for data. This thesis explores a\ndifferent answer to the problem of learning expressive models in data\nconstrained settings: instead of relying on big datasets to learn neural\nnetworks, we will replace some modules by known functions reflecting the\nstructure of the data. Very often, these functions will be drawn from the rich\nliterature of kernel methods. Indeed, many kernels can reflect the underlying\nstructure of the data, thus sparing learning parameters to some extent. Our\napproach falls under the hood of \"inductive biases\", which can be defined as\nhypothesis on the data at hand restricting the space of models to explore\nduring learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in the\ncontext of sequences, such as sentences in natural language or protein\nsequences, and graphs, such as molecules. We also highlight the relationship\nbetween our work and recent advances in deep learning. Additionally, we study\nconvex machine learning models.

The distribution of initial\nresidual grain stresses in the material was observed to prevail as plasticity\nbuilds, though became less pronounced, and therefore less influential as strain\nincreased. The initial Schmid factor of a grain was found to be strongly\ncorrelated to the intergranular stress change and the range of stresses that\nare permissible; a grain well aligned for easy slip is more likely to exhibit a\nrange of stresses than those orientated poorly for dislocation motion. The\norientation path of a grain, however, is not only dependent on its initial\norientation, but hypothesised to be influenced by its stress state and the\nstress state of its grain environment. A grain neighbourhood effect is\nobserved: the Schmid factor of serial adjoining grains influences the stress\nstate of a grain of interest, whereas parallel neighbours are much less\ninfluential. This phenomenon is strongest at low plastic strains only, with the\neffect diminishing as plasticity builds. The influence of initial residual\nstresses becomes less evident, and grains rotate to eliminate any orientation\ndependent load shedding. The ability of the BCC ferrite to exhaust such\nneighbourhood interactions, which would otherwise be detrimental in crystal\nstructures with lower symmetric and fewer slip systems, is considered key to\nthe high ductility possessed by these materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 14:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Methods: The Insight-HXMT Data Analysis\nSoftware package (HXMTDAS) is utilized to extract the spectra of Cas A, blank\nsky, and Crab Nebula using different Good Time Interval (GTI) selections. We\nfit a model with a power-law continuum and several Gaussian lines to different\nranges of Cas A and blank sky spectra to get peak energies of their lines\nthrough xspec.

Prenatal screening and identification of CHD are critically\nimportant, but their availability and accuracy are limited by current fetal\nimaging techniques. To date, few models have been developed for fetal\ncirculation. Considering the fetal aorta is frequently affected in CHDs, this\nstudy aims to develop and validate a novel model to assess the hemodynamics of\nthe fetal aorta. Methods - Fetal echocardiography (FE) and Doppler were used to\nbuild a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model that assesses the fetal aorta\nin 3 dimensions. An inverse approach was used to obtain the material property.\nAn iterative method was also proposed to estimate the outflow boundaries. The\nFSI results have been validated against clinically measured dimensions and\nvelocities over a cardiac cycle for aortas in 4 healthy fetuses. Results - The\nproposed FSI model has been implemented in 4 healthy fetal aortas representing\na range of gestational age (GA = 23.5-36.0 weeks). The iterative method\nsuccessfully estimated Windkessel parameters that match in vivo measured flow\nrates at outflow boundaries. The FSI model has been validated using in vivo\nvelocity waveforms at the aortic isthmus. The resultant L2-norm was [12.5%,\n16.4%], which is acceptable based on previous simulation studies. Also, the\naortic stiffness of the fetal aorta decreased with GA, adding evidence to an\nexisting controversy about the trend between aortic stiffness and GA.\nConclusions - This study represents the first-of-its-kind endeavor of a\nrigorously validated personalized flow model for fetal circulation. The\ndeveloped FSI model has been successfully validated for four subjects. The\nmodel was also used to obtain new evidence of fetal aortic development and\ngrowth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 15:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Most recent publications have focused on improving learning\nalgorithms without distinguishing effects caused by the choice of neural\narchitecture.Therefore, we study how the choice of neural network architecture\naffects catastrophic forgetting in class- and domain-incremental semantic\nsegmentation. Specifically, we compare the well-researched CNNs to recently\nproposed Transformers and Hybrid architectures, as well as the impact of the\nchoice of novel normalization layers and different decoder heads. We find that\ntraditional CNNs like ResNet have high plasticity but low stability, while\ntransformer architectures are much more stable. When the inductive biases of\nCNN architectures are combined with transformers in hybrid architectures, it\nleads to higher plasticity and stability. The stability of these models can be\nexplained by their ability to learn general features that are robust against\ndistribution shifts. Experiments with different normalization layers show that\nContinual Normalization achieves the best trade-off in terms of adaptability\nand stability of the model. In the class-incremental setting, the choice of the\nnormalization layer has much less impact. Our experiments suggest that the\nright choice of architecture can significantly reduce forgetting even with\nnaive fine-tuning and confirm that for real-world applications, the\narchitecture is an important factor in designing a continual learning model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 15:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

We assess\nhotspots formed at shocked crystal-crystal interfaces using quasi-1D molecular\ndynamics simulations that isolate effects due to compression and shear. Two\nhigh explosive materials are considered (TATB and PETN) that exhibit distinctly\ndifferent levels of molecular conformational flexibility and crystal packing\nanisotropy. Temperature and intra-molecular strain energy localization in the\nhotspot is assessed through parametric variation of the crystal orientation and\ntwo velocity components that respectively modulate compression and shear work.\nThe resulting hotspots are found to be highly localized to a region within 5-20\nnm of the crystal-crystal interface. Compressive work plays a considerably\nlarger role in localizing temperature and intra-molecular strain energy for\nboth materials and all crystal orientations considered. Shear induces a\nmoderate increase in energy localization relative to unsheared cases only for\nrelatively weak compressive shock pressures of approximately 10 GPa.

We derived tidal masses of clusters with an\naccuracy of 70%. Our cluster formation and evolution model is based on the\ncluster initial mass function, the cluster formation rate, cluster mass loss\ndue to stellar evolution and the clusters' dynamical evolution in the Galactic\ntidal field. The obtained tidal masses have been added to the MWSC catalogue. A\ngeneral CMF (GCMF), built for all cluster ages around the Sun, extends over\nfour decades in mass. The high-mass slope is +1.14. The CMFs for different age\ngroups show the same high-mass slopes, while the low-mass slope is flat for the\nyoungest sub-sample and about -0.7 for the others. The sub-samples inside and\noutside the solar Galactocentric radius are consistent with the GCMF, once the\nexponential decline of the Galactic disc density is taken into account. The\nmodel suggests star formation with low efficiency of 15%, where 10% of stars\nremain bound in a cluster after gas expulsion and violent relaxation. The\ncluster formation rate required to reproduce the observed age-mass-distribution\nis 0.4 solar masses per square pc and Gyr. The obtained high-mass slope of the\nGCMF for the wide solar neighbourhood is similar to slopes determined in nearby\ngalaxies. The MWSC catalogue supports models with low star-formation\nefficiency, where 90% of stars are lost quickly after gas expulsion. The\ncluster formation rate corresponds to open clusters' contribution to the\nstellar content of the thin disc of 30%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 15:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

In these\nattacks, queries are iteratively perturbed towards a particular class without\nany knowledge of the target model besides its output. The prevalence of\nremotely-hosted ML classification models and Machine-Learning-as-a-Service\nplatforms means that query attacks pose a real threat to the security of these\nsystems. To deal with this, stateful defenses have been proposed to detect\nquery attacks and prevent the generation of adversarial examples by monitoring\nand analyzing the sequence of queries received by the system. Several stateful\ndefenses have been proposed in recent years. However, these defenses rely\nsolely on similarity or out-of-distribution detection methods that may be\neffective in other domains. In the malware detection domain, the methods to\ngenerate adversarial examples are inherently different, and therefore we find\nthat such detection mechanisms are significantly less effective. Hence, in this\npaper, we present MalProtect, which is a stateful defense against query attacks\nin the malware detection domain. MalProtect uses several threat indicators to\ndetect attacks. Our results show that it reduces the evasion rate of\nadversarial query attacks by 80+\\% in Android and Windows malware, across a\nrange of attacker scenarios.

However, the prohibitively high cost associated\nwith these technologies limits their broad adoption. Herein, to alleviate this\nchallenge we introduce an all-group IV mid-infrared cell consisting of GeSn\nalloy directly on a silicon wafer. This emerging class of semiconductors\nprovides strain and composition as degrees of freedom to control the bandgap\nenergy thus covering the entire mid-infrared range. The proposed\nthermophotovoltaic device is composed of a fully relaxed Ge$_{0.83}$Sn$_{0.17}$\ndouble heterostructure corresponding to a bandgap energy of 0.29 eV. A\ntheoretical framework is derived to evaluate cell performance under high\ninjection. The black-body radiation absorption is investigated using the\ngeneralized transfer matrix method thereby considering the mixed\ncoherent/incoherent layer stacking. Moreover, the intrinsic recombination\nmechanisms and their importance in a narrow bandgap semiconductor were also\ntaken into account. In this regard, the parabolic band approximation and\nFermi's golden rule were combined for an accurate estimation of the radiative\nrecombination rate. Based on these analyses, power conversion efficiencies of\nup to 9% are predicted for Ge$_{0.83}$Sn$_{0.17}$ thermophotovoltaic cells\nunder black-body radiation at temperatures in the 500-1500 K range. A slight\nimprovement in the efficiency is observed under the frontside illumination but\nvanishes below 800 K, while the use of a backside reflector improves the\nefficiency across the investigated black-body temperature range.

For example, there are always more faint\nobjects (such as galaxies) than bright ones in any brightness-limited sample,\nbut faint objects may not be of the same kind as bright ones. Assuming they are\ncan lead to mischaracterizing the population of objects near the boundary of\nwhat can be detected.

However, in complex materials, the FBZ\ncan take on irregular shapes where lattice symmetries are not apparent. Thus,\nconventional cells (with more atoms and regular shapes) are often used to\ndescribe materials, though dynamical and transport calculations are more\nexpensive. Here we discuss an efficient anharmonic lattice dynamic method that\nmaps conventional cell dynamics to primitive cell dynamics based on\ntranslational symmetries. This leads to phase interference conditions that act\nlike conserved quantum numbers and a conservation rule for phonon scattering\nthat is hidden in conventional dynamics which significantly reduces\ncomputational cost. We demonstrate this method for phonon transport in a\nvariety of materials with inputs from first-principles calculations and\nattribute its efficiency to reduced scattering phase space and fewer summations\nin scattering matrix element calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 16:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

In addition to\nthe operations of CFL considered previously by the authors, initial attention\nis given to the operations with infinite sets by considering two of them: the\nunion of sets and the intersection of sets.

However, it incorporates a large amount of SRAM cells, making the\ndevice vulnerable to Neutron-induced Single Event Upsets (NSEUs) or otherwise\nsoft errors. Semiconductor vendors incorporate soft error mitigation mechanisms\nto recover memory upsets (i.e., faults) before they propagate to the\napplication output and become an error. But how effective are the MPSoC's\nmitigation schemes? Can they effectively recover upsets in high altitude or\nlarge scale applications under different workloads? This article answers the\nabove research questions through a solid study that entails accelerated neutron\nradiation testing and dependability analysis. We test the device on a broad\nrange of workloads, like multi-threaded software used for pose estimation and\nweather prediction or a software/hardware (SW/HW) co-design image\nclassification application running on the AMD Deep Learning Processing Unit\n(DPU). Assuming a one-node MPSoC system in New York City (NYC) at 40k feet, all\ntested software applications achieve a Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) greater than\n148 months, which shows that upsets are effectively recovered in the processing\nsystem of the MPSoC. However, the SW/HW co-design (i.e., DPU) in the same\none-node system at 40k feet has an MTTF = 4 months due to the high failure rate\nof its PL accelerator, which emphasises that some MPSoC workloads may require\nadditional NSEU mitigation schemes. Nevertheless, we show that the MTTF of the\nDPU can increase to 87 months without any overhead if one disregards the\nfailure rate of tolerable errors since they do not affect the correctness of\nthe classification output.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 11:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

However,\nMaxwell derived a ``general law of electromagnetic induction'' in which the\nvector potential plays a fundamental role. A modern reformulation of Maxwell's\nlaw can be easily obtained by defining the induced electromotive force as\n$\\oint_l (\\vec E +\\vec v_c\\times \\vec B)\\cdot\\vec{dl}$, where $\\vec v_c$ is the\nvelocity of the positive charges which, by convention, are the current\ncarriers. Maxwell did not possess a model for the electric current. Therefore,\nin his law, he took $\\vec v_c$ to be the velocity of the circuit element\ncontaining the charges. This paper aims to show that the modern reformulation\nof Maxwell's law governs electromagnetic induction and that the ``flux rule''\nis not a physical law but only a calculation shortcut that does not always\nyield the correct predictions. The paper also tries to understand why Maxwell's\nlaw has been ignored, and how the ``flux rule'' has taken root. Finally, a\nsection is dedicated to teaching this modern reformulation of Maxwell's law in\nhigh schools and elementary physics courses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 17:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

In particular, we are interested here in the\nscattering of a passive scalar as determined by a steady velocity field which\nis generated by a line of singularity. The velocity undergoes to erratic\nspatial variations, and concurrently the evolution of the scattering is\nconveniently described within a stochastic framework that regards the\nconductivity of the hosting medium as a stationary, Gaussian, random field.\nUnlike the similar one for uniform (in the mean) flow-fields, the problem at\nstake results much more complex. Central for the present study is the\nfluctuation of the driving field, that is computed in closed (analytical) form\nas large time limit of the same quantity in the unsteady state flow regime. The\nstructure of the second-order moment X_{rr}, quantifying the scattering along\nthe radial direction, is explained by the rapid change of the distance along\nwhich the velocities of two fluid particles become uncorrelated. Moreover, two\napproximate, analytical expressions are shown to be quite accurate into\nreproducing the full simulations of X_{rr}. Finally, the same problem is\nencountered in other fields, belonging both to the classical and to the quantum\nphysics. As such, our results lend themselves to be used within a context much\nwider than that exploited in the present study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 12:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}
