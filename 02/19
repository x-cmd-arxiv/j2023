By\napplying spectral clustering on co-trading networks, we uncover economically\nmeaningful clusters of stocks. Beyond the static Global Industry Classification\nStandard (GICS) sectors, our data-driven clusters capture the time evolution of\nthe dependency among stocks. Furthermore, we demonstrate statistically\nsignificant positive relations between low-latency co-trading and return\ncovariance. With the aid of co-trading networks, we develop a robust estimator\nfor high-dimensional covariance matrix, which yields superior economic value on\nportfolio allocation. The mean-variance portfolios based on our covariance\nestimates achieve both lower volatility and higher Sharpe ratios than standard\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 16:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

In addition to the frequencies previously explained by the\n$\\ell = 8$ and $\\ell = 9$ non-radial modes, we have identified a group of stars\nwhere the additional frequencies may belong to the $\\ell = 10$ non-radial\nmodes. We found that stars with no additional frequencies are more common among\nstars with shorter periods, while stars with longer periods almost always show\nadditional frequencies. The incidence rate and this period distribution both\nagree well with the predictions of recent theoretical models. The amplitude and\nphase of additional frequencies are varying in time. The frequencies of\ndifferent non-radial modes appearing in a given star seem to vary on different\ntimescales. We have determined a 10.4 per cent incidence rate for the Blazhko\neffect. For several stars we have detected continuous annual-scale phase change\nwithout significant amplitude variation. This type of variation offers a\nplausible explanation for the `phase jump' phenomenon reported in many RRc\nstars. The main pulsation frequency could show quasi-periodic phase and\namplitude fluctuations. This fluctuation is clearly related to additional\nfrequencies present in the star: stars with two non-radial modes show the\nstrongest fluctuations, while stars with no such modes show no fluctuations at\nall. The summation of the phase fluctuation over time may explain the O-C\nvariations that have long been known for many non-Blazhko RRc stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 16:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

This model evolved out of the traditional $\\alpha \\Omega$ dynamo\nmodel which was first developed at a time when the existence of the Sun's\nmeridional circulation was not known. In these models, the toroidal magnetic\nfield (which gives rise to sunspots) is generated by the stretching of the\npoloidal field by solar differential rotation. The primary source of the\npoloidal field in the flux transport models is attributed to the\nBabcock--Leighton mechanism, in contrast to the mean-field $\\alpha$-effect used\nin earlier models. With the realization that the Sun has a meridional\ncirculation, which is poleward at the surface and is expected to be equatorward\nat the bottom of the convection zone, its importance for transporting the\nmagnetic fields in the dynamo process was recognized. Much of our understanding\nabout the physics of both the meridional circulation and the flux transport\ndynamo has come from the mean field theory obtained by averaging the equations\nof MHD over turbulent fluctuations. The mean field theory of meridional\ncirculation makes clear how it arises out of an interplay between the\ncentrifugal and thermal wind terms. We provide a broad review of mean field\ntheories for solar magnetic fields and flows, the flux transport dynamo\nmodeling paradigm and highlight some of their applications to solar and stellar\nmagnetic cycles. We also discuss how the dynamo-generated magnetic field acts\non the meridional circulation of the Sun and how the fluctuations in the\nmeridional circulation, in turn, affect the solar dynamo. We conclude with some\nremarks on how the synergy of mean field theories, flux transport dynamo\nmodels, and direct numerical simulations can inspire the future of this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 17:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

FP allows the clinician to examine the ocular fundus\nstructures such as the macula, the optic disc (OD) and retinal vessels, whose\nvisibility and clarity in an FP image remain central to ensuring diagnostic\naccuracy, and hence determine the diagnostic quality (DQ). Images with low DQ,\nresulting from eye movement, improper illumination and other possible causes,\nshould obviously be recaptured. However, the technician, often unfamiliar with\nDQ criteria, initiates recapture only based on expert feedback. The process\npotentially engages the imaging device multiple times for single subject, and\nwastes the time and effort of the ophthalmologist, the technician and the\nsubject. The burden could be prohibitive in case of teleophthalmology, where\nobtaining feedback from the remote expert entails additional communication cost\nand delay. Accordingly, a strong need for automated diagnostic quality\nassessment (DQA) has been felt, where an image is immediately assigned a DQ\ncategory. In response, motivated by the notional continuum of DQ, we propose a\nhierarchical deep learning (DL) architecture to distinguish between good,\nusable and unusable categories.

To tackle this problem, this work proposes a\nfair machine learning framework targeting graft failure prediction in liver\ntransplant. Specifically, knowledge distillation is employed to handle dense\nand sparse features by combining the advantages of tree models and neural\nnetworks. A two-step debiasing method is tailored for this framework to enhance\nfairness. Experiments are conducted to analyze unfairness issues in existing\nmodels and demonstrate the superiority of our method in both prediction and\nfairness performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 18:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

StyleGAN-based approaches to face morphing are among the leading\ntechniques; however, they often suffer from noticeable blurring and artifacts\nas a result of the uniform attention in the latent feature space. In this\npaper, we propose to develop a transformer-based alternative to face morphing\nand demonstrate its superiority to StyleGAN-based methods. Our contributions\nare threefold. First, inspired by GANformer, we introduce a bipartite structure\nto exploit long-range interactions in face images for iterative propagation of\ninformation from latent variables to salient facial features. Special loss\nfunctions are designed to support the optimization of face morphing. Second, we\nextend the study of transformer-based face morphing to demorphing by presenting\nan effective defense strategy with access to a reference image using the same\ngenerator of MorphGANFormer. Such demorphing is conceptually similar to\nunmixing of hyperspectral images but operates in the latent (instead of pixel)\nspace. Third, for the first time, we address a fundamental issue of\nvulnerability-detectability trade-off for face morphing studies. It is argued\nthat neither doppelganger norrandom pair selection is optimal, and a Lagrangian\nmultiplier-based approach should be used to achieve an improved trade-off\nbetween recognition vulnerability and attack detectability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 19:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

However, precise segmentation\nmap extraction is quite challenging due to the diverse building structures\ncamouflaged by trees, similar spectral responses between the roads and\nbuildings, and occlusions by heterogeneous traffic over the roads. Existing\nconvolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods focus on either enriched\nspatial semantics learning for the building extraction or the fine-grained road\ntopology extraction. The profound semantic information loss due to the\ntraditional pooling mechanisms in CNN generates fragmented and disconnected\nroad maps and poorly segmented boundaries for the densely spaced small\nbuildings in complex surroundings.

DAMIP mines the salient\nfeatures by employing a novel index pooling mechanism to retain important\ngeometric information. On the other hand, DAMSCA simultaneously extracts the\nmulti-scale spatial and spectral features. Besides, using dilated convolution\nand multi-scale deep supervision in optimizing MSSDMPA-Net helps achieve\nstellar performance.

Although the NLP community has produced several\nstudies on generating backdoor attacks proving the vulnerable state of language\nmodes, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any work to combat\nsuch attacks. To bridge this gap, we present RobustEncoder: a novel\nclustering-based technique for detecting and removing backdoor attacks in the\ntext domain.

Machine learning-based prices are typically generated by complex\nalgorithms trained on historical sales data. However, displaying these prices\nto consumers anchors the realized sales prices, which will in turn become\ntraining samples for future iterations of the algorithms. The economic\nimplications of this machine learning \"feedback loop\" - an indirect\nhuman-algorithm interaction - remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we\ndevelop an analytical model of machine learning feedback loops in the context\nof the housing market. We show that feedback loops lead machine learning\nalgorithms to become overconfident in their own accuracy (by underestimating\nits error), and leads home sellers to over-rely on possibly erroneous\nalgorithmic prices. As a consequence at the feedback loop equilibrium, sale\nprices can become entirely erratic (relative to true consumer preferences in\nabsence of ML price interference). We then identify conditions (choice of ML\nmodels, seller characteristics and market characteristics) where the economic\npayoffs for home sellers at the feedback loop equilibrium is worse off than no\nmachine learning.

Moreover, it\nis infeasible to use offline tuning methods like cross-validation to choose\nhyperparameters under the bandit environment, as the decisions should be made\nin real time. To address this challenge, we propose the first online continuous\nhyperparameter tuning framework for contextual bandits to learn the optimal\nparameter configuration within a search space on the fly. Specifically, we use\na double-layer bandit framework named CDT (Continuous Dynamic Tuning) and\nformulate the hyperparameter optimization as a non-stationary continuum-armed\nbandit, where each arm represents a combination of hyperparameters, and the\ncorresponding reward is the algorithmic result. For the top layer, we propose\nthe Zooming TS algorithm that utilizes Thompson Sampling (TS) for exploration\nand a restart technique to get around the switching environment.

The\nmodel is composed of three primary components: (1) a random seeding process\nthat determines genesis, (2) an intensity-dependent beta-advection model that\ndetermines the track, and (3) a non-linear differential equation set that\ndetermines the intensification rate. The model is entirely forced by the\nlarge-scale environment. Downscaling ERA5 reanalysis data shows that the model\nis generally able to reproduce observed tropical cyclone climatology, such as\nthe global seasonal cycle, genesis locations, track density, and lifetime\nmaximum intensity distributions. Inter-annual variability in tropical cyclone\ncount and power-dissipation is also well captured, on both basin-wide and\nglobal scales. Regional tropical cyclone hazard estimated by this model is also\nanalyzed using return period maps and curves.

In this paper, we seek to go further beyond and explore a new\nlogical inductive bias for better language representation learning. Logic\nreasoning is known as a formal methodology to reach answers from given\nknowledge and facts. Inspired by such a view, we develop a novel neural\narchitecture named FOLNet (First-Order Logic Network), to encode this new\ninductive bias. We construct a set of neural logic operators as learnable Horn\nclauses, which are further forward-chained into a fully differentiable neural\narchitecture (FOLNet). Interestingly, we find that the self-attention module in\ntransformers can be composed by two of our neural logic operators, which\nprobably explains their strong reasoning performance. Our proposed FOLNet has\nthe same input and output interfaces as other pretrained models and thus could\nbe pretrained/finetuned by using similar losses. It also allows FOLNet to be\nused in a plug-and-play manner when replacing other pretrained models. With our\nlogical inductive bias, the same set of ``logic deduction skills'' learned\nthrough pretraining are expected to be equally capable of solving diverse\ndownstream tasks. For this reason, FOLNet learns language representations that\nhave much stronger transfer capabilities. Experimental results on several\nlanguage understanding tasks show that our pretrained FOLNet model outperforms\nthe existing strong transformer-based approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 02:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

However, the stark contrast in the improvement achieved\nthrough pretraining under privacy compared to non-private settings suggests\nthat there may be a deeper, distinct cause driving these gains. To explain this\nphenomenon, we hypothesize that the non-convex loss landscape of a model\ntraining necessitates an optimization algorithm to go through two phases. In\nthe first, the algorithm needs to select a good \"basin\" in the loss landscape.\nIn the second, the algorithm solves an easy optimization within that basin. The\nformer is a harder problem to solve with private data, while the latter is\nharder to solve with public data due to a distribution shift or data scarcity.\nGuided by this intuition, we provide theoretical constructions that provably\ndemonstrate the separation between private training with and without public\npretraining.

However, this type of light emission is generally\nweak, which is intrinsically limited by the weak particle-matter interaction\nand unavoidably impedes the development of many promising applications, such as\nthe miniaturization of free-electron radiation sources and high-energy particle\ndetectors. Here we reveal a mechanism to enhance the particle-matter\ninteraction by exploiting the pseudo-Brewster effect of gain materials -\npresenting an enhancement of at least four orders of magnitude for the light\nemission. This mechanism is enabled by the emergence of an unprecedented phase\ndiagram that maps all phenomena of free-electron radiation into three distinct\nphases in a gain-thickness parameter space, namely the conventional,\nintermediate, and Brewster phases, when an electron penetrates a dielectric\nslab with a modest gain and a finite thickness. Essentially, our revealed\nmechanism corresponds to the free-electron radiation in the Brewster phase,\nwhich also uniquely features ultrahigh directionality, always at the Brewster\nangle, regardless of the electron velocity. Counterintuitively, we find that\nthe intensity of this free-electron Brewster radiation is insensitive to the\nFabry-Perot resonance condition and thus the variation of slab thickness, and\nmoreover, a weaker gain could lead to a stronger enhancement for the light\nemission. The scheme of free-electron Brewster radiation, especially along with\nits compatibility with low-energy electrons, may enable the development of\nhigh-directionality high-intensity light sources at any frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 06:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

In this regard, a considerable research has been\ncarried out in the area of automatic detection and segmentation of MS lesions\nin magnetic resonance images (MRIs).\n  Methodology: In this study, we review the different approaches that have been\nused in computer-aided detection and segmentation of MS lesions. Our review\nresulted in categorizing MS lesion segmentation approaches into six broad\ncategories: data-driven, statistical, supervised machine learning, unsupervised\nmachine learning, fuzzy, and deep learning-based techniques. We critically\nanalyze the different techniques under these approaches and highlight their\nstrengths and weaknesses.\n  Results: From the study, we observe that a considerable amount of work,\naround 25% of related literature, is focused on statistical-based MS lesion\nsegmentation techniques, followed by 21.15% for data-driven based methods,\n19.23% for deep learning and 15.38% for supervised methods.\n  Implication: The study points out the challenges/gaps to be addressed in\nfuture research.

However, the quality of generated\npseudo-labels has long been a concern due to the sensitivity of the\nclassification objective to given labels. To avoid the untrustworthy\nclassification supervision indicating ``a node belongs to a specific class,''\nwe favor the fault-tolerant contrasting supervision demonstrating ``two nodes\ndo not belong to the same class.'' Thus, the problem of generating high-quality\npseudo-labels is then transformed into a relaxed version, i.e., finding\nreliable contrasting pairs. To achieve this, we propose a general framework for\nGNNs, termed Pseudo Contrastive Learning (PCL). It separates two nodes whose\npositive and negative pseudo-labels target the same class. To incorporate\ntopological knowledge into learning, we devise a topologically weighted\ncontrastive loss that spends more effort separating negative pairs with smaller\ntopological distances. Additionally, to alleviate the heavy reliance on data\naugmentation, we augment nodes only by applying dropout to the encoded\nrepresentations. Theoretically, we prove that PCL with the lightweight\naugmentation works like a representation regularizer to effectively learn\nseparation between negative pairs. Experimentally, we employ PCL on various\nmodels, which consistently outperform their counterparts using other popular\ngeneral techniques on five real-world graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 10:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Policymakers and researchers try to understand the role of social\nmedia design in shaping the quality of political discourse around the globe. In\nthe past decades, scholarship on political discourse theory has produced\ndistinct characteristics of different types of prominent political rhetoric\nsuch as deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. This study investigates\nthe relationship between social media reaction mechanisms (i.e., upvotes,\ndownvotes) and political rhetoric in user discussions by engaging in an\nin-depth conceptual analysis of political discourse theory. First, we analyze\n155 million user comments in 55 political subforums on Reddit between 2010 and\n2018 to explore whether users' style of political discussion aligns with the\nessential components of deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse. Second,\nwe perform a quantitative study that combines confirmatory factor analysis with\ndifference in differences models to explore whether different reaction\nmechanism schemes (e.g., upvotes only, upvotes and downvotes, no reaction\nmechanisms) correspond with political user discussion that is more or less\ncharacteristic of deliberative, civic, or demagogic discourse. We produce three\nmain takeaways. First, despite being \"ideal constructs of political rhetoric,\"\nwe find that political discourse theories describe political discussions on\nReddit to a large extent. Second, we find that discussions in subforums with\nonly upvotes, or both up- and downvotes are associated with user discourse that\nis more deliberate and civic. Third, social media discussions are most\ndemagogic in subreddits with no reaction mechanisms at all. These findings\noffer valuable contributions for ongoing policy discussions on the relationship\nbetween social media interface design and respectful political discussion among\nusers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 11:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Here we show that a particle's size\nnot only has a strong correlation with its mobility, but we also observe that,\nas the mode-coupling temperature is crossed and the system becomes more deeply\nsupercooled, a dynamic separation between small mobile and larger quiescent\nparticles emerges at timescales corresponding to cage escape.

Although\nmany methods have been able to guarantee the quality of image restoration, the\nsystem complexity of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods is increasing as well.\nMotivated by this, we present a mixed hierarchy network that can balance these\ncompeting goals. Our main proposal is a mixed hierarchy architecture, that\nprogressively recovers contextual information and spatial details from degraded\nimages while we design intra-blocks to reduce system complexity. Specifically,\nour model first learns the contextual information using encoder-decoder\narchitectures, and then combines them with high-resolution branches that\npreserve spatial detail. In order to reduce the system complexity of this\narchitecture for convenient analysis and comparison, we replace or remove the\nnonlinear activation function with multiplication and use a simple network\nstructure. In addition, we replace spatial convolution with global\nself-attention for the middle block of encoder-decoder.

Gygi recently suggested an analytic, norm-conserving, regularized nuclear\npotential to enable all-electron plane-wave calculations [J. Chem. Theory\nComput. 2023, 19, 1300--1309]. This potential $V(r)$ is determined by inverting\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation for the wave function ansatz\n$\\phi(\\boldsymbol{r})=\\exp[-h(\\boldsymbol{r})]/\\sqrt{\\pi}$ with\n$h(\\boldsymbol{r})=r\\text{erf}(ar)+b\\exp(-a^{2}r^{2})$, where $a$ and $b$ are\nparameters. Gygi fixes $b$ by demanding $\\phi$ to be normalized, the value\n$b(a)$ depending on the strength of the regularization controlled by $a$. We\nbegin this work by re-examining the determination of $b(a)$ and find that the\noriginal 10-decimal tabulations of Gygi are only correct to 5 decimals, leading\nto normalization errors in the order of $10^{-10}$.

This paper makes further\ninvestigation on the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of a small VAWT with\nV-shaped blades and trailing-edge serrations. The feasibility of utilizing the\nReynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes SST k-omega turbulence model and the FW-H\nmethod is verified against experiments. The studied V-shaped blades can\neffectively improve the power performance of VAWT over a wide range of tip\nspeed ratios under normal wind speed conditions, and the trailing-edge\nserrations will also slightly increase the power output of V-bladed VAWT at the\noptimal tip speed ratio. The power coefficient of the V-bladed wind turbine\nwith trailing-edge serrations is about 28.3% higher than that of the original\nturbine. In addition, a dumbbell-shaped noise directivity distribution was\nfirst discovered in the VAWT compared with the traditional elliptical\ndistribution.

Building on this, several crucial questions -- how to measure\nand exploit the sample adaptability to Q under varied bit-width scenarios? how\nto generate the samples with desirable adaptability to benefit the quantized\nnetwork? -- impel us to revisit DFQ. In this paper, we answer the above\nquestions from a game-theory perspective to specialize DFQ as a zero-sum game\nbetween two players -- a generator and a quantized network, and further propose\nan Adaptability-aware Sample Generation (AdaSG) method.

CE loss sharpens the neural network at the\ndecision boundary to achieve a lower loss, rather than pushing the boundary to\na more robust position. A robust boundary should be kept in the middle of\nsamples from different classes, thus maximizing the margins from the boundary\nto the samples. We think this is due to the fact that CE loss has no stationary\npoint. In this paper, we propose a family of new losses, called stationary\npoint (SP) loss, which has at least one stationary point on the correct\nclassification side. We proved that robust boundary can be guaranteed by SP\nloss without losing much accuracy. With SP loss, larger perturbations are\nrequired to generate adversarial examples.

In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic framework to\ninvestigate online raw agricultural product sellers' preemptive EMA behavior on\nan ecommerce platform (EP). Particularly, the sellers differ from each other in\nthe original quality of their products. We characterize the sellers'\nequilibrium pricing and adulteration decisions and the EP's optimal take rate\ndecision, and analyze how the sampling inspections and adulteration penalty\njointly impact these decisions. Moreover, we investigate three managerial\nlevers, such as claiming a higher-than-law-requires penalty, that the\nadministrative departments or the EP can use to deter EMA. Finally, we use the\nreal-word data from Taobao.com to calibrate our model and derive more\nmanagerial insights from the analytical findings.

Previous\nnoise-transition-based methods have achieved theoretically-grounded performance\nunder the Class-Conditional Noise model (CCN). However, these approaches builds\nupon an ideal but impractical anchor set available to pre-estimate the noise\ntransition. Even though subsequent works adapt the estimation as a neural\nlayer, the ill-posed stochastic learning of its parameters in back-propagation\neasily falls into undesired local minimums. We solve this problem by\nintroducing a Latent Class-Conditional Noise model (LCCN) to parameterize the\nnoise transition under a Bayesian framework.

Based the plasmon band gap appearing above the Fermi level,\nnew definitions on plasmonic excitations and plasma parameters in a wide\nelectron temperature-density regime is suggested. The new equation of state\n(EoS) for excited electrons to the plasmon band leads to novel aspects of\nrelativistic collective quantum excitations such as the plasmon black-out and\nquantum pressure collapse which are studied using both non-relativistic and\nrelativistic quantum models. The plasmon black-out effect may be used to\nexplain why metallic elements do not show collective behavior at low\ntemperatures. The model can be used to predict phases of matter in which the\nplasmonic activities is shut down, hence, it may behave like a mysterious dark\nmatter. On the other hand, the energy band structure model predicts the plasmon\npressure collapse in temperature-density coordinates matching that of a white\ndwarf star. The prediction of energy band structure of collective quantum\nexcitations may have direct implications for the inertial confinement fusion\n(ICF), the EoS of warm dense matter (WDM) and evolution of stellar and other\nunknown cosmological structures. It is found that predictions of\nnon-relativistic and relativistic quantum excitation models closely match up to\ntemperature-density of degenerate stars which confirms the relevance of\nnon-relativistic plasmon models used in the warm and dense matter regime. The\neffect of positron on band structure of collective quantum excitations is also\nstudied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 04:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

In addition, in-context learning suffers\nfrom substantial computational, memory, and storage costs which eventually\nleads to high inference latency because it involves running all of the prompt's\nexamples through the model every time a prediction is made. In contrast,\nmethods based on the transfer learning via the fine-tuning paradigm avoid the\naforementioned issues at a one-time cost of fine-tuning weights on a per-task\nbasis. However, such methods lack exposure to few-shot multimodal multitask\nlearning. In this paper, we propose few-shot learning for a multimodal\nmultitask multilingual (FM3) setting by adapting pre-trained vision and\nlanguage models using task-specific hypernetworks and contrastively fine-tuning\nthem to enable few-shot learning. FM3's architecture combines the best of both\nworlds of in-context and fine-tuning based learning and consists of three major\ncomponents: (i) multimodal contrastive fine-tuning to enable few-shot learning,\n(ii) hypernetwork task adaptation to perform multitask learning, and (iii)\ntask-specific output heads to cater to a plethora of diverse tasks. FM3 learns\nthe most prominent tasks in the vision and language domains along with their\nintersections, namely visual entailment (VE), visual question answering (VQA),\nand natural language understanding (NLU) tasks such as neural entity\nrecognition (NER) and the GLUE benchmark including QNLI, MNLI, QQP, and SST-2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 03:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}
