Merge trees are topological descriptors that record\nthe evolution of connected components in the sublevel sets of scalar fields. We\npresent a new technique for modeling and comparing merge trees using tools from\npartial optimal transport. In particular, we model a merge tree as a measure\nnetwork, that is, a network equipped with a probability distribution, and\ndefine a notion of distance on the space of merge trees inspired by partial\noptimal transport. Such a distance offers a new and flexible perspective for\nencoding intrinsic and extrinsic information in the comparative measures of\nmerge trees. More importantly, it gives rise to a partial matching between\ntopological features in time-varying data, thus enabling flexible topology\ntracking for scientific simulations. Furthermore, such partial matching may be\ninterpreted as probabilistic coupling between features at adjacent time steps,\nwhich gives rise to probabilistic tracking graphs. We derive a stability result\nfor our distance and provide numerous experiments indicating the efficacy of\ndistance in extracting meaningful feature tracks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 16:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Therefore, they have to rely on generators to\nguarantee their full functionality. Those generators depend on fuel to function\nand the rate of consumption gets usually high, if not monitored properly.\nMonitoring operation is usually carried out by a (non-expert) human.

This work proposes a label assisted\nautoencoder for anomaly detection in the fuel consumed by power generating\nplants.

A\nconsensus is then reached on whether training should stop or whether the\nthreshold should be updated or the training should continue with the search for\nhyper-parameters. Results show that the proposed model is highly efficient for\nreading anomalies with a detection accuracy of $97.20\\%$ which outperforms the\nexisting model of $96.1\\%$ accuracy trained on the same dataset.

One variation uses reverse\nchannel models with minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimates that give the\nlargest rates but are challenging to optimize. A second variation uses forward\nchannel models with linear MMSE estimates that are easier to optimize. Both\nmodel classes are applied to channels where the receiver is unaware of the CSIT\nand for which adaptive codewords achieve capacity. The forward model inputs are\nchosen as linear functions of the adaptive codeword's entries to simplify the\nanalysis. For scalar channels, the maximum GMI is then achieved by a\nconventional codebook, where the amplitude and phase of each channel symbol are\nmodified based on the CSIT. The GMI increases by partitioning the channel\noutput alphabet and using a different auxiliary model for each partition\nsubset.

A\ncritical factor in cooperative perception is the data transmission size through\nthe communication channels.

Some robust training algorithms (e.g., Group DRO)\nspecialize to group shifts and require group information on all training\npoints. Other methods (e.g., CVaR DRO) that do not need group annotations can\nbe overly conservative, since they naively upweight high loss points which may\nform a contrived set that does not correspond to any meaningful group in the\nreal world (e.g., when the high loss points are randomly mislabeled training\npoints). In this work, we address limitations in prior approaches by assuming a\nmore nuanced form of group shift: conditioned on the label, we assume that the\ntrue group function (indicator over group) is simple. For example, we may\nexpect that group shifts occur along low bitrate features (e.g., image\nbackground, lighting). Thus, we aim to learn a model that maintains high\naccuracy on simple group functions realized by these low bitrate features, that\nneed not spend valuable model capacity achieving high accuracy on contrived\ngroups of examples. Based on this, we consider the two-player game formulation\nof DRO where the adversary's capacity is bitrate-constrained. Our resulting\npractical algorithm, Bitrate-Constrained DRO (BR-DRO), does not require group\ninformation on training samples yet matches the performance of Group DRO on\ndatasets that have training group annotations and that of CVaR DRO on\nlong-tailed distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that in some\nsettings BR-DRO objective can provably yield statistically efficient and less\nconservative solutions than unconstrained CVaR DRO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 17:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Our solution aims\nto exploit the human-AI complementarity to maximize decision rewards by\nlearning both an algorithmic policy that aims to complement humans by a routing\nmodel that defers decisions to either a human or the AI to leverage the\nresulting complementarity. We then extend our approach to leverage\nopportunities and mitigate risks that arise in important contexts in practice:\n1) when a team is composed of multiple humans with differential and potentially\ncomplementary abilities, 2) when the observational data includes consistent\ndeterministic actions, and 3) when the covariate distribution of future\ndecisions differ from that in the historical data. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed methods using data on real human responses and\nsemi-synthetic, and find that our methods offer reliable and advantageous\nperformance across setting, and that it is superior to when either the\nalgorithm or the AI make decisions on their own. We also find that the\nextensions we propose effectively improve the robustness of the human-AI\ncollaboration performance in the presence of different challenging settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 17:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

We consider several standard noise-cleaning algorithms and\ncompare them on two types of datasets. The first type are time series of fMRI\nbrain activity of human subjects at rest. The second type are synthetic time\nseries sampled from a generative Gaussian model of which we can vary the\nfraction of dimensions per sample q = N/T and the strength of off-diagonal\ncorrelations. The reliability of each algorithm is assessed in terms of\ntest-set likelihood and, in the case of synthetic data, of the distance from\nthe true precision matrix.

We propose a variant of the Optimal\nRotationally Invariant Estimator in which one of its parameters is optimised by\ncross-validation.

In this work, we demonstrate the suitability\nof kernel-target alignment as a substitute for accuracy in genetic\nalgorithm-based quantum feature map design. Kernel-target alignment is faster\nto evaluate than accuracy and doesn't require some data points to be reserved\nfor its evaluation. To further accelerate the evaluation of genetic fitness, we\nprovide a method to approximate kernel-target alignment. To improve\nkernel-target alignment and root mean squared error, the final trainable\nparameters of the generated circuits are further trained using COBYLA to\ndetermine whether a hybrid approach applying conventional circuit parameter\ntraining can easily complement the genetic structure optimization approach. A\ntotal of eight new approaches are compared to the original across nine varied\nbinary classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository,\nshowing that kernel-target alignment and its approximation produce feature map\ncircuits enabling comparable accuracy to the previous work but with larger\nmargins on training data (in excess of 20\\% larger) that improve further with\ncircuit parameter training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 18:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

To solve multi-class classification problems, heuristic\nstrategies such as One-vs-One or One-vs-All can be employed.

In contrast to previous\nwork, the number of qubits required, the measurement strategy, and the topology\nof the circuits used is invariant to the number of classes. In addition, unlike\nother architectures for multi-class quantum classifiers, the state\nreconstruction of a single qubit yields sufficient information for multi-class\nclassification tasks.

Finetuning the backbone or adjusting the classifier prototypes\ntrained in the prior sessions would inevitably cause a misalignment between the\nfeature and classifier of old classes, which explains the well-known\ncatastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we deal with this misalignment\ndilemma in FSCIL inspired by the recently discovered phenomenon named neural\ncollapse, which reveals that the last-layer features of the same class will\ncollapse into a vertex, and the vertices of all classes are aligned with the\nclassifier prototypes, which are formed as a simplex equiangular tight frame\n(ETF). It corresponds to an optimal geometric structure for classification due\nto the maximized Fisher Discriminant Ratio. We propose a neural collapse\ninspired framework for FSCIL. A group of classifier prototypes are pre-assigned\nas a simplex ETF for the whole label space, including the base session and all\nthe incremental sessions. During training, the classifier prototypes are not\nlearnable, and we adopt a novel loss function that drives the features into\ntheir corresponding prototypes. Theoretical analysis shows that our method\nholds the neural collapse optimality and does not break the feature-classifier\nalignment in an incremental fashion.

Canonical examples include branching\nrandom walk, $*$-scale invariant fields, with the central example being the two\ndimensional Gaussian free field (GFF), a universal scaling limit of a wide\nrange of statistical mechanics models. The corresponding Gibbs measure obtained\nby exponentiating $\\beta$ (inverse temperature) times $\\phi_N$ is a discrete\nversion of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC) famously constructed by\nKahane.

It can, however, be modeled as a\nsequence of projections carried out in different orders.

Meanwhile, popular deep domain adaptation\nheuristics tend to falter when faced with label proportions shifts. While\nseveral papers modify these heuristics in attempts to handle label proportions\nshifts, inconsistencies in evaluation standards, datasets, and baselines make\nit difficult to gauge the current best practices. In this paper, we introduce\nRLSbench, a large-scale benchmark for relaxed label shift, consisting of $>$500\ndistribution shift pairs spanning vision, tabular, and language modalities,\nwith varying label proportions. Unlike existing benchmarks, which primarily\nfocus on shifts in class-conditional $p(x|y)$, our benchmark also focuses on\nlabel marginal shifts. First, we assess 13 popular domain adaptation methods,\ndemonstrating more widespread failures under label proportion shifts than were\npreviously known. Next, we develop an effective two-step meta-algorithm that is\ncompatible with most domain adaptation heuristics: (i) pseudo-balance the data\nat each epoch; and (ii) adjust the final classifier with target label\ndistribution estimate. The meta-algorithm improves existing domain adaptation\nheuristics under large label proportion shifts, often by 2--10\\% accuracy\npoints, while conferring minimal effect ($<$0.5\\%) when label proportions do\nnot shift.

The main theorem says that Kontsevich's\ncharacteristic classes of a smooth framed bundle $\\pi$ are determined by the\ntopology of the 2-point configuration space bundle of $\\pi$ and framing data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 18:57:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 17:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Thinking about symmetry\nalgebras as commutant algebras allows for the treatment of conventional\nsymmetries and unconventional symmetries (e.g., those responsible for weak\nergodicity breaking phenomena) on equal algebraic footing. In this work, we\ndiscuss two methods for numerically constructing this commutant algebra\nstarting from a family of Hamiltonians. First, we use the equivalence of this\nproblem to that of simultaneous block-diagonalization of a given set of local\noperators, and discuss a probabilistic method that has been found to work with\nprobability 1 for both Abelian and non-Abelian symmetries or commutant\nalgebras. Second, we map this problem onto the problem of determining\nfrustration-free ground states of certain Hamiltonians, and we use ideas from\ntensor network algorithms to efficiently solve this problem in one dimension.\nThese numerical methods are useful in detecting standard and non-standard\nconserved quantities in families of Hamiltonians, which includes examples of\nregular symmetries, Hilbert space fragmentation, and quantum many-body scars,\nand we show many such examples. In addition, they are necessary for verifying\nseveral conjectures on the structure of the commutant algebras in these cases,\nwhich we have put forward in earlier works. Finally, we also discuss similar\nmethods for the inverse problem of determining local operators with a given\nsymmetry or commutant algebra, which connects to existing methods in the\nliterature.

This is\ntypically understood as the particle lowering its potential energy. In this\narticle, we discuss a paradigm where bound states arise purely due to kinetic\nenergy considerations. This phenomenon occurs in certain non-manifold spaces\nthat consist of multiple smooth surfaces that intersect one another. The\nintersection region can be viewed as a singularity where dimensionality is not\ndefined. We demonstrate this idea in a setting where a particle moves on $M$\nspaces ($M=2, 3, 4, \\ldots$), each of dimensionality $D$ ($D=1, 2$ and $3$).\nThe spaces intersect at a common point, which serves as a singularity. To study\nquantum behaviour in this setting, we discretize space and adopt a\ntight-binding approach. We generically find a ground state that is localized\naround the singular point, bound by the kinetic energy of `shuttling' among the\n$M$ surfaces. We draw a quantitative analogy between singularities on the one\nhand and local attractive potentials on the other. To each singularity, we\nassign an equivalent potential that produces the same bound state wavefunction\nand binding energy. The degree of a singularity ($M$, the number of\nintersecting surfaces) determines the strength of the equivalent potential.\nWith $D=1$ and $D=2$, we show that any singularity creates a bound state. This\nis analogous to the well known fact that any attractive potential creates a\nbound state in 1D and 2D. In contrast, with $D=3$, bound states only appear\nwhen the degree of the singularity exceeds a threshold value. This is analogous\nto the fact that in three dimensions, a threshold potential strength is\nrequired for bound state formation.

Relying on a flexible\nthree-dimensional coordinate representation of the nucleus, the model takes\ninto account both triaxial deformation and time-reversal symmetry breaking.\nBSkG2 achieves a state-of-the-art global description of nuclear ground state\n(g.s.) properties and reproduces in particular the known masses with a\nroot-mean-square (rms) deviation of 678 keV. Moving beyond g.s. properties, the\nmodel also reproduces all empirical values for the primary and secondary\nbarriers as well as isomer excitation energies of actinide nuclei with rms\ndeviations below 500 keV, i.e. with unprecedented accuracy. Here we discuss in\ndetail the extension of our framework to the calculation of the fission\nbarriers of 45 actinide nuclei, including odd-mass and odd-odd systems. We\nfocus in particular on the impact of symmetry breaking which is key to the\naccuracy of the model: we allow systematically for axial, reflection and\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking. The effect of the latter on the fission\nproperties of odd-mass and odd-odd nuclei is small, but we find that allowing\nfor shapes with triaxial or octupole deformation, as well as shapes with both,\nis crucial to achieving this accuracy. The numerical accuracy of our coordinate\nspace approach, the variety of nuclear configurations explored and the\nsimultaneous successful description of fission properties and known masses\nmakes BSkG2 the tool of choice for the large-scale study of nuclear structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 19:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 09:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

By using high-quality spectral time series, this method can provide\nprecise distance estimates independent of the distance ladder, which are of\nhigh value for cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 20:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

Artifacts that only occur within scans from specific\nscanners are major causes of this poor generalizability. We aimed to improve\nthe reliability of deep learning classification models by proposing\nUncertainty-Based Instance eXclusion (UBIX). This technique, based on\nmultiple-instance learning, reduces the effect of corrupted instances on the\nbag-classification by seamlessly integrating out-of-distribution (OOD) instance\ndetection during inference. Although UBIX is generally applicable to different\nmedical images and diverse classification tasks, we focused on staging of\nage-related macular degeneration in optical coherence tomography.

Highly multiplexed tissue\nimaging (HMTI) technologies offer a tool which can capture cell properties of\ntissue samples by measuring expression of various proteins and storing them in\nseparate image channels. HMTI technologies can be used to gain insights into\nthe iTME and in particular how the iTME differs for different patient outcome\ngroups of interest (e.g., treatment responders vs. non-responders).\nUnderstanding the systematic differences in the iTME of different patient\noutcome groups is crucial for developing better treatments and personalising\nexisting treatments. However, such analyses are inherently limited by the fact\nthat any two tissue samples vary due to a large number of factors unrelated to\nthe outcome.

The proposed framework offers a key advantage over existing congestion\nmanagement strategies which is the ability to mitigate hysteresis phenomena.\nUnlike existing congestion management strategies that focus on breakdown\nprevention, the proposed framework is extremely effective after breakdown\nformation. The proposed framework assumes partial connectivity between the\nautomated vehicles which share information. The framework requires a basic\nlevel of autonomy defined by one-dimensional longitudinal control. This\nframework is primarily built using a centralized training, centralized\nexecution multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach, where longitudinal\ncontrol is defined by signals of acceleration or deceleration commands which\nare then executed by all agents uniformly. The model undertaken for training\nand testing of the framework is based on the well-known Double Deep Q-Learning\nalgorithm which takes the average state of flow within the traffic stream as\nthe model input and outputs actions in the form of acceleration or deceleration\nvalues.

We\nformalize this data selection problem as selecting a subset of a large raw\nunlabeled dataset to match a desired target distribution, given some unlabeled\ntarget samples. Due to the large scale and dimensionality of the raw text data,\nexisting methods use simple heuristics to select data that are similar to a\nhigh-quality reference corpus (e.g., Wikipedia), or leverage experts to\nmanually curate data. Instead, we extend the classic importance resampling\napproach used in low-dimensions for LM data selection. Crucially, we work in a\nreduced feature space to make importance weight estimation tractable over the\nspace of text. To determine an appropriate feature space, we first show that KL\nreduction, a data metric that measures the proximity between selected data and\nthe target in a feature space, has high correlation with average accuracy on 8\ndownstream tasks (r=0.89) when computed with simple n-gram features. From this\nobservation, we present Data Selection with Importance Resampling (DSIR), an\nefficient and scalable algorithm that estimates importance weights in a reduced\nfeature space (e.g., n-gram features in our instantiation) and selects data\nwith importance resampling according to these weights.

However, theoretical simulations have\nnot yet realized such relations, instead finding that the late evolutionary\nphases are significantly affected by a complicated interplay between nuclear\nreactions, chemical mixing, and neutrino radiation, leading to non-monotonic\ninitial mass dependencies of the iron core mass and the compactness parameter.\nWe conduct a set of stellar evolution simulations, in which evolutions of He\nstar models are followed until their central densities uniformly reach\n10$^{10}$ g cm$^{-3}$, and analyze their final structures as well as their\nevolutionary properties including the lifetime, surface radius change, and\npresumable fates after core collapse.

Intuitive ways for the two issues are Knowledge Graph (KG)\nand Graph Neural Network (GNN) respectively. Entities are semantic units in\ntext and in KG. This paper focuses on both issues by leveraging entities\nmentioned in text to connect GNN and KG for summarization. Firstly, entities\nare leveraged to construct a sentence-entity graph with weighted multi-type\nedges to model sentence relations, and a relational heterogeneous GNN for\nsummarization is proposed to calculate node encodings. Secondly, entities are\nleveraged to link the graph to KG to collect knowledge. Thirdly, entities guide\na two-step summarization framework defining a multi-task selector to select\nsalient sentences and entities, and using an entity-focused abstractor to\ncompress the sentences. GNN is connected with KG by constructing\nsentence-entity graphs where entity-entity edges are built based on KG,\ninitializing entity embeddings on KG, and training entity embeddings using\nentity-entity edges. The relational heterogeneous GNN utilizes both edge\nweights and edge types in GNN to calculate graphs with weighted multi-type\nedges. Experiments show the proposed method outperforms extractive baselines\nincluding the HGNN-based HGNNSum and abstractive baselines including the\nentity-driven SENECA on CNN/DM, and outperforms most baselines on NYT50.\nExperiments on sub-datasets show the density of sentence-entity edges greatly\ninfluences the performance of the proposed method. The greater the density, the\nbetter the performance. Ablations show effectiveness of the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 02:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

In this work, we use time-dependent probability generating\nfunctions (PGFs) to capture these characteristics by modeling a stochastic\nbranching process of the spread of a disease over a network of contacts in\nwhich public health interventions are introduced over time. To achieve this, we\ndefine a general transmissibility equation to account for varying transmission\nrates (e.g. masking), recovery rates (e.g. treatment), contact patterns (e.g.\nsocial distancing) and percentage of the population immunized (e.g.\nvaccination).

Here we\nconsider such satisficing sectary problem that views suboptimal choices\n(finding any of the top $d$ candidates) also as hiring success. We use a\nmultiple stopping criteria $(r_1, r_2, \\cdots, r_d)$ that sequentially lowers\nthe expectation when the prior selection criteria yields no choice. We\ncalculate the probability of securing the top $d$ candidate in closed form\nsolutions which are in excellent agreement with computer simulations. The\nexhaustive search for optimal stopping has to deal with large parameter space\nand thus can quickly incur astronomically large computational times. In light\nof this, we apply the effective computational method of simulated annealing to\nfind optimal $r_i$ values which performs reasonably well as compared with the\nexhaustive search despite having significantly less computing time. Our work\nsheds light on maximizing the likelihood of securing satisficing (suboptimal)\noutcomes using adaptive search strategy in combination with computation\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 03:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Most previous studies neglect\nuser's conformity and entangle interest with it, which may cause the\nrecommender systems fail to provide satisfying results. Therefore, from the\ncause-effect view, disentangling these interaction causes is a crucial issue.\nIt also contributes to OOD problems, where training and test data are\nout-of-distribution.

While previous studies investigated the seismic performance of\nburied water pipelines, the effects of corrosion on the pipeline seismic\nperformance were ignored. The presence of corrosion on metallic pipeline walls\naggravates seismic damage level because corrosion significantly reduces the\npipeline strength. Most of the existing buried pipelines in the United States\nare aged and non-ductile metallic pipelines, which are vulnerable to seismic\nloading. To ensure continuous and smooth water supply to communities during and\nafter earthquakes, it is necessary to evaluate the system-level seismic\nperformance of WDS considering the aging effect in corroded pipelines.

In this study, we propose a\nnovel solution to this challenge by utilizing a principle from statistical\nphysics known as the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) to discover\nknowledge using an AI model that can rapidly produce scenarios for different\nexternal forcings. By leveraging FDT, we are able to extract information\nencoded in a large dataset produced by Earth System Models, which includes 8250\nyears of internal climate fluctuations, to estimate the climate system's\nresponse to forcings. Our model, AiBEDO, is capable of capturing the complex,\nmulti-timescale effects of radiation perturbations on global and regional\nsurface climate, allowing for a substantial acceleration of the exploration of\nthe impacts of spatially-heterogenous climate forcers. To demonstrate the\nutility of AiBEDO, we use the example of a climate intervention technique\ncalled Marine Cloud Brightening, with the ultimate goal of optimizing the\nspatial pattern of cloud brightening to achieve regional climate targets and\nprevent known climate tipping points.

In indirect reciprocity, individuals use reputations to choose whether\nor not to cooperate with a partner and update others' reputations. A major\nquestion is how the rules to choose their actions and the rules to update\nreputations evolve. In the public reputation case, where all individuals share\nthe evaluation of others, social norms called Simple Standing (SS) and Stern\nJudging (SJ) have been known to maintain cooperation. However, in the case of\nprivate assessment where individuals independently evaluate others, the\nmechanism of maintenance of cooperation is still largely unknown. This study\ntheoretically shows for the first time that cooperation by indirect reciprocity\ncan be evolutionarily stable under private assessment. Specifically, we find\nthat SS can be stable, but SJ can never be. This is intuitive because SS can\ncorrect interpersonal discrepancies in reputations through its simplicity. On\nthe other hand, SJ is too complicated to avoid an accumulation of errors, which\nleads to the collapse of cooperation.

Classical methods\nusually boil down to a backtracking framework that needs to navigate a huge\nsearch space with prohibitive computational costs. Some recent studies resort\nto graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a low-dimensional representation for\nboth the query and input graphs, in order to predict the number of subgraph\nisomorphisms on the input graph. However, typical GNNs employ a node-centric\nmessage passing scheme that receives and aggregates messages on nodes, which is\ninadequate in complex structure matching for isomorphism counting. Moreover, on\nan input graph, the space of possible query graphs is enormous, and different\nparts of the input graph will be triggered to match different queries. Thus,\nexpecting a fixed representation of the input graph to match diversely\nstructured query graphs is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a novel GNN\ncalled Count-GNN for subgraph isomorphism counting, to deal with the above\nchallenges. At the edge level, given that an edge is an atomic unit of encoding\ngraph structures, we propose an edge-centric message passing scheme, where\nmessages on edges are propagated and aggregated based on the edge adjacency to\npreserve fine-grained structural information. At the graph level, we modulate\nthe input graph representation conditioned on the query, so that the input\ngraph can be adapted to each query individually to improve their matching.\nFinally, we conduct extensive experiments on a number of benchmark datasets to\ndemonstrate the superior performance of Count-GNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 05:32:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:31:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 12:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

We demonstrate that our active inference agent is able to balance epistemic\nforaging and goal-driven behavior, and outperforms both supervised and\nreinforcement learning baselines by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 06:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Supervised deep learning has demonstrated its\nsuperior capacity in automatic 3D vessel segmentation. However, the reliance on\nexpensive 3D manual annotations and limited capacity for annotation reuse\nhinder the clinical applications of supervised models. To avoid the repetitive\nand laborious annotating and make full use of existing vascular annotations,\nthis paper proposes a novel 3D shape-guided local discrimination model for 3D\nvascular segmentation under limited guidance from public 2D vessel annotations.\nThe primary hypothesis is that 3D vessels are composed of semantically similar\nvoxels and exhibit tree-shaped morphology. Accordingly, the 3D region\ndiscrimination loss is firstly proposed to learn the discriminative\nrepresentation measuring voxel-wise similarities and cluster semantically\nconsistent voxels to form the candidate 3D vascular segmentation in unlabeled\nimages; secondly, based on the similarity of the tree-shaped morphology between\n2D and 3D vessels, the Crop-and-Overlap strategy is presented to generate\nreference masks from 2D structure-agnostic vessel annotations, which are fit\nfor varied vascular structures, and the adversarial loss is introduced to guide\nthe tree-shaped morphology of 3D vessels; thirdly, the temporal consistency\nloss is proposed to foster the training stability and keep the model updated\nsmoothly. To further enhance the model's robustness and reliability, the\norientation-invariant CNN module and Reliability-Refinement algorithm are\npresented.

We highlight that the existing schemes against reactive\njammers use relays with instantaneous full-duplex (FD) radios to evade the\nattack. However, due to the limitation of the radio architecture of the FD\nhelper, instantaneous forwarding may not be possible in practice, thereby\nleading to increased decoding complexity at the destination and a high\ndetection probability at the adversary. Pointing at this drawback, we propose a\ndelay-aware cooperative framework wherein the victim seeks assistance from a\ndelay-aware FD helper to forward its messages to the destination within the\nlatency constraints. In particular, we first model the processing delay at the\nhelper based on its hardware architecture, and then propose two low-complexity\nmitigation schemes, wherein the victim and the helper share their uplink\nfrequencies using appropriate energy-splitting factors. For both the schemes,\nwe solve the optimization problems of computing the near-optimal\nenergy-splitting factors that minimize the joint error rates at the\ndestination.

The state-of-the-art software\ndedicated to Monte Carlo simulation is often written for general-purpose\ncomputing architectures (CPUs), which allow great flexibility but are not\ncompatible with specialized accelerating devices, GPUs. We present two original\ntools, PDFFlow and MadFlow, that manage to combine these two aspects in Python.\nPDFFlow, is a Parton Distribution Functions interpolator, while MadFlow aims at\nbuilding a complete tool suite to accelerate the whole event generation\nframework. The reconstruction pipeline at neutrino detectors is comprised of\nmany different algorithms that work in synergy to extract a high-level\nrepresentation of detector data. All the most important experiments in neutrino\nphysics are developing software to automatically process and extract this\ninformation. This work describes the implementation of deep learning techniques\nto improve neutrino reconstruction efficiency at the ProtoDUNE-SP detector. Two\noriginal contributions are presented concerning raw data denoising and a\nhit-clustering procedure named \"slicing\". Both denoising and slicing involve\nthe implementation and the training of novel neural network architectures,\nbased on state-of-the-art models in machine learning, such as feed-forward,\nconvolutional and graph neural networks. They represent a proof of concept that\nthese models are indeed capable of providing an important impact on signal\nreconstruction at neutrino detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 09:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

The loss of the intermediate mode induces a phase\nlag impinging on the indirect channel for energy transmission, which does not\ndepend on the energy transmission direction. When the direct transmission\nchannel coexists with the indirect lossy transmission channel, the dual-channel\ninterference can be tuned to be destructive simultaneously for backward\ntransmission from the rightmost mode to the leftmost mode, and for forward\ntransmission from the leftmost mode to the intermediate mode. The former\ninterference outcome corresponds to 100% nonreciprocity contrast, and the\nlatter guarantees zero insertion loss for forward transmission. Additionally,\nour scheme also allows a nonreciprocity response over a wide bandwidth by\nincreasing the losses while keeping perfect nonreciprocity at resonance.

The best-performing\napproach is a gradient-boosted tree model utilizing a library to automatically\ngenerate features, followed by a random forest model using the raw spectral\ndata. A convolutional neural network using boolean images of Nyquist\nrepresentations is presented as an alternative, although it achieves a lower\naccuracy. We publish the data and open source the associated code. The\napproaches described in this article can serve as benchmarks for further\nstudies. A key remaining challenge is the identifiability of the labels,\nunderlined by the model performances and the comparison of misclassified\nspectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 10:08:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 16:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

To this\nend, the premise is to obtain the optimal policies of a set of finite-agent\ngames with different population sizes. However, either deriving the closed-form\nsolution for each game is theoretically intractable, training a distinct policy\nfor each game is computationally intensive, or directly applying the policy\ntrained in a game to other games is sub-optimal. We address these challenges\nthrough the Population-size-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO). Our contributions\nare three-fold. First, to efficiently generate efficient policies for games\nwith different population sizes, we propose PAPO, which unifies two natural\noptions (augmentation and hypernetwork) and achieves significantly better\nperformance. PAPO consists of three components: i) the population-size encoding\nwhich transforms the original value of population size to an equivalent\nencoding to avoid training collapse, ii) a hypernetwork to generate a distinct\npolicy for each game conditioned on the population size, and iii) the\npopulation size as an additional input to the generated policy. Next, we\nconstruct a multi-task-based training procedure to efficiently train the neural\nnetworks of PAPO by sampling data from multiple games with different population\nsizes. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple environments show the\nsignificant superiority of PAPO over baselines, and the analysis of the\nevolution of the generated policies further deepens our understanding of the\ntwo fields of finite-agent and infinite-agent games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 10:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

We carried out the first dedicated survey of the molecular\nenvironments of a large sample of FUors/EXors, observing a total of 51 sources\nwith the aim of studying the ammonia (NH$_3$) emission in their host\nenvironments. We observed the ammonia (J,K)=(1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) inversion\ntransitions using the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope.

The rotation period of stars is an important parameter along with\nmass, radius, effective temperature.

From\nStokes V spectropolarimetric sequences observed with SPIRou at CFHT and the\ndata processed with the APERO pipeline, we compute the least squares\ndeconvolution profiles using different masks of atomic stellar lines with known\nLand\\'e factor appropriate to the effective temperature of the star.

From\nspectro-polarimetric analysis, the polarization degree due to the disc emission\nwas found to have an upper limit of $\\sim 9.1$%, and that of the Comptonized\nemission was constrained at $8.7 \\pm 3.3$% (at the 3$\\sigma$ level). The\nobserved polarization angle and energy dependent polarization are in favour of\na slab-like coronal geometry which probably covers part of the accretion disc\nand hides the neutron star surface. IXPE observation of the same source on 2022\nOctober 8 does not show significant polarization which can be attributed to a\nweakening of the coronal Comptonized emission. The implication of these results\nare discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 11:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 08:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Technically, to align the canonical space with the target space and\nthe observation space, we propose a bidirectional neural skinning field based\non skeleton-driven deformation to establish the target-to-canonical and\ncanonical-to-observation correspondences. Then, we disentangle the canonical\nbody geometry into a normalized neutral-sized body and a subject-specific\nresidual for better generalizability.

In this article, in addition to the inflationary\nsolution, we systematically investigate every possible early Universe solution\nin the presence of a barotropic fluid in the general non-minimal\n(scalar-tensor) theory.

Formation of such vortices requires a relatively sharp viscosity\ntransition. Detailed modelling, however, indicates that viscosity transitions\nat the outer edge of the dead zone is relatively smooth. In this study, we\npresent 2D global, non-isothermal, gas-dust coupled hydrodynamic simulations to\ninvestigate the possibility of vortex excitation at smooth viscosity\ntransitions. Our models are based on a recently postulated scenario, wherein\nthe recombination of charged particles on the surface of dust grains results in\nreduced ionisation fraction and in turn the turbulence due to magnetorotational\ninstability. Thus, the alpha-parameter for the disc viscosity depends on the\nlocal dust-to-gas mass ratio. We found that the smooth viscosity transitions at\nthe outer edge of the dead zone can become Rossby unstable and form vortices. A\nsingle large-scale vortex develops if the dust content of the disc is well\ncoupled to the gas, however, multiple small-scale vortices ensue for the case\nof less coupled dust. As both type of vortices are trapped at the dead zone\nouter edge, they provide sufficient time for dust growth. The solid content\ncollected by the vortices can exceed several hundred Earth masses, while the\ndust-to-gas density ratio within often exceeds unity. Thus, such vortices\nfunction as planetary nurseries within the disc, providing ideal sites for\nformation of planetesimals and eventually planetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 12:31:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

We\noutline a collection of existing methods for selecting embedding lag in both\nuniform and non-uniform delay embedding cases. Highlighting the poor dynamical\nexplainability of existing methods of selecting non-uniform lags, we provide an\nalternative method of selecting embedding lags that includes a mixture of both\ndynamical and topological arguments. The proposed method, {\\em Significant\nTimes on Persistent Strands} (SToPS), uses persistent homology to construct a\ncharacteristic time spectrum that quantifies the relative dynamical\nsignificance of each time lag. We test our method on periodic, chaotic and\nfast-slow time series and find that our method performs similar to existing\nautomated non-uniform embedding methods. Additionally, $n$-step predictors\ntrained on embeddings constructed with SToPS was found to outperform other\nembedding methods when predicting fast-slow time series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 13:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

However, a generally valid\nformulation is lacking, as all available drag force correlations have been\nestablished for specific flow situations. In particular, these correlations\nhave not been evaluated for particle-laden flows subjected to electrostatic\nforces. The paper reports the effect of drag force modeling on the flow of\nelectrically charged particles. To this end, we implemented different drag\nforce correlations to the open-source CFD tool pafiX. Then, we performed\nhighly-resolved Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) using the\nEulerian-Lagrangian approach of a particle-laden channel flow with the friction\nReynolds number of 180. The simulations generally revealed a strong influence\nof the precise drag correlation on particles in the near-wall region and a\nminor effect on the particles far from the walls. Due to their turbophoretic\ndrift, particles accumulate close to the channel walls. For uncharged\nparticles, the simulations show large deviations of the particle concentration\nprofile in the near-wall region depending on the drag force correlation.\nTherefore, the disturbance of the flow surrounding a particle by a nearby wall\nor other particles is important for its drag. Driven by electrostatic forces,\ncharged particles accumulate even closer to the wall. Contrary to the uncharged\ncases, when the particles carry a high charge (in our case one femto-coulomb),\nwe found minor effects of drag force modeling on particle concentration\nprofiles. In conclusion, for the investigated conditions, we propose to account\nfor the effect of nearby particles and walls on the drag of low- or uncharged\nparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 13:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

We examine the problem of\ndetermining whether there exist m disjoint r-covers, naming it the Solidarity\nCover Problem (SCP). We consider as well the related optimization problems of\nmaximizing the number of r-covers, referred to as the partition size, and\nminimizing the radius. We analyze the relation between the SCP and a graph\nproblem known as the Domatic Number Problem (DNP), both hard problems in the\ngeneral case. We show that the SCP is hard already in the Euclidean 2D setting,\nimplying hardness of the DNP already in the unit-disc-graph setting. As far as\nwe know, the latter is a result yet to be shown.

One major challenge here\nis catastrophic forgetting, meaning that the model can easily forget knowledge\nlearned from previous datasets when learning from the new dataset. To tackle\nthis challenge, we propose REPEAT, a novel method for continual learning of\ncode intelligence models. Specifically, REPEAT addresses the catastrophic\nforgetting problem with representative exemplars replay and adaptive parameter\nregularization. The representative exemplars replay component selects\ninformative and diverse exemplars in each dataset and uses them to retrain\nmodel periodically. The adaptive parameter regularization component recognizes\nimportant parameters in the model and adaptively penalizes their changes to\npreserve the knowledge learned before. We evaluate the proposed approach on\nthree code intelligence tasks including code summarization, software\nvulnerability detection, and code clone detection. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that REPEAT consistently outperforms baseline methods on all tasks.\nFor example, REPEAT improves the conventional fine-tuning method by 1.22, 5.61,\nand 1.72 on code summarization, vulnerability detection and clone detection,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 14:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Our\nlists, however, also contain many new constructions, which have not been\nstudied in the literature so far. We also briefly discuss how our DM models\ncould be constrained by reinterpretations of LHC searches and the prospects for\nHL-LHC and future lepton colliders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 14:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

The modeling\nof disk fragmentation, a possible mechanism leading to stellar multiplicity,\nrelies on parallel 3D simulation codes whose agreement remains to be evaluated.\nUsing the Cartesian AMR code RAMSES, we compare disk fragmentation in a\ncentrally-condensed protostellar system to the study of Oliva & Kuiper (2020)\nperformed on a grid in spherical coordinates using PLUTO. Two RAMSES runs are\nconsidered and give qualitatively distinct pictures. When allowing for\nunlimited sink particle creation, gas fragmentation leads to a multiple stellar\nsystem whose multiplicity is affected by the grid when triggering fragmentation\nand by numerically-assisted mergers. On the other hand, using a unique,\ncentral, fixed sink particle, a centrally-condensed system forms, similar to\nthat reported in PLUTO. The RAMSES-PLUTO comparison is performed with the\nlatter: agreement between the two codes is found regarding the first\nrotationally-supported disk formation, the presence of an accretion shock onto\nit, the first fragmentation phase. Gaseous fragments form and their properties\nare in agreement between the two codes. As a minor difference, fragments\ndynamics causes the disk structure to be sub-Keplerian in RAMSES whereas it is\nfound to be Keplerian and reaches quiescence in PLUTO. We attribute this\ndiscrepancy to the central star being twice less massive in RAMSES because of\nthe different stellar accretion subgrid models. In a centrally-condensed\nsystem, the agreement between RAMSES and PLUTO regarding many of the collapse\nproperties and fragmentation process is good. Fragmentation occurring in the\ninnermost region and numerical choices (use of sink particles, grid) have a\ncrucial impact when similar but smooth initial conditions are employed - more\ncrucial than the code's choice - on the system's outcome, multiple or\ncentrally-condensed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 14:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

In many\nembedding-based retrieval (EBR) applications where the vectors are generated\nfrom trained models, $D=256\\sim 1024$ are common. In this paper, OPORP (one\npermutation + one random projection) uses a variant of the ``count-sketch''\ntype of data structures for achieving data reduction/compression. With OPORP,\nwe first apply a permutation on the data vectors. A random vector $r$ is\ngenerated i.i.d. with moments: $E(r_i) = 0, E(r_i^2)=1, E(r_i^3) =0,\nE(r_i^4)=s$. We multiply (as dot product) $r$ with all permuted data vectors.\nThen we break the $D$ columns into $k$ equal-length bins and aggregate (i.e.,\nsum) the values in each bin to obtain $k$ samples from each data vector. One\ncrucial step is to normalize the $k$ samples to the unit $l_2$ norm. We show\nthat the estimation variance is essentially: $(s-1)A +\n\\frac{D-k}{D-1}\\frac{1}{k}\\left[ (1-\\rho^2)^2 -2A\\right]$, where $A\\geq 0$ is a\nfunction of the data ($u,v$). This formula reveals several key properties: (1)\nWe need $s=1$. (2) The factor $\\frac{D-k}{D-1}$ can be highly beneficial in\nreducing variances. (3) The term $\\frac{1}{k}(1-\\rho^2)^2$ is a substantial\nimprovement compared with $\\frac{1}{k}(1+\\rho^2)$, which corresponds to the\nun-normalized estimator. We illustrate that by letting the $k$ in OPORP to be\n$k=1$ and repeat the procedure $m$ times, we exactly recover the work of ``very\nspars random projections'' (VSRP). This immediately leads to a normalized\nestimator for VSRP which substantially improves the original estimator of VSRP.\n  In summary, with OPORP, the two key steps: (i) the normalization and (ii) the\nfixed-length binning scheme, have considerably improved the accuracy in\nestimating the cosine similarity, which is a routine (and crucial) task in\nmodern embedding-based retrieval (EBR) applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 14:45:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 15:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

In the purely algebraic context the paradigm is given by the\nB\\'ezout theorem: the number of isolated solutions of a system of polynomial\nequations of degree $\\le d$ in the $n$-dimensional space does not exceed $d^n$,\nthe bound polynomial in $d$ and exponential in $n$. This bound is optimal: if\nwe count solutions properly (i.e., with multiplicities, including complex\nsolutions and solutions on the infinite hyperplane), then the equality holds.\n  This paradigm can be generalized for the transcendental case as described\nabove.

In the case of $f(T)$ gravity we find that no new scalar mode is\npresent in both linear and second order perturbations, which suggests a strong\ncoupling problem.

The work of Cartan is superseded by the\nuse of the canonical Spencer sequence while the work of Vessiot is superseded\nby the use of the canonical Janet sequence but the link between these two\nsequences and thus these two works is still not known today. Using differential\nduality in the linear framework, the adjoint of the Spencer operator for the\ngroup of conformal transformations provides the Cosserat equations, the Maxwell\nequations and the Weyl equations on equal footing. Such a result allows to\nunify the finite elements of engineering sciences but also leads to deep\ncontradictions in the case of gravitational waves. Indeed, the Beltrami\noperator (1892) which is parametrizing the Cauchy operator of elasticity by\nmeans of 6 stress functions is nothing else than the self-adjoint Einstein\noperator (1915) in dimension 3 for the deformation of the metric which is\nparametrizing the div operator induced from the Bianchi identities. The same\nconfusion between the Cauchy and div operators is existing on space-time as the\nCauchy operator can be parametrized by the adjoint of the Ricci operator.\nAccordingly, the foundations of engineering and mathematical physics must be\nrevisited within this new framework, though striking it may sometimes look\nlike.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 23:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

NeuralODEs are capable of\ndescribing stable as well as instable dynamic systems. Selecting an appropriate\nnumerical solver is not trivial, because NeuralODE properties change during\ntraining. If the NeuralODE becomes more stiff, a suboptimal solver may need to\nperform very small solver steps, which significantly slows down the training\nprocess. If the NeuralODE becomes to instable, the numerical solver might not\nbe able to solve it at all, which causes the training process to terminate.\nOften, this is tackled by choosing a computational expensive solver that is\nrobust to instable and stiff ODEs, but at the cost of a significantly decreased\ntraining performance. Our method on the other hand, allows to enforce ODE\nproperties that fit a specific solver or application-related boundary\nconditions. Concerning the convergence behavior, NeuralODEs often tend to run\ninto local minima, especially if the system to be learned is highly dynamic\nand/or oscillating over multiple periods. Because of the vanishing gradient at\na local minimum, the NeuralODE is often not capable of leaving it and converge\nto the right solution.

Concepts are learned by a hybrid classical-quantum network\ntrained to perform concept classification, where the classical image processing\nis carried out by a convolutional neural network and the quantum\nrepresentations are produced by a parameterised quantum circuit.

SkinSense is\ncomprehensively evaluated for a variety of operational parameters, hardware\nsetups and communication settings by means of data collected from human subject\nparticipants. Results from these empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nSkinSense is able to achieve a stable bandwidth of upto 6.6 bps, with bit error\nrates below 0.1 in our custom hardware setup, and can be employed as a\npractical communication side-channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 14:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

The LM-SSS method is applied to\ncouple and decouple state-space models established in the modal domain.\nMoreover, it is used together with tailored postprocessing procedures to\neliminate the redundant states originated from the coupling and decoupling\noperations. This specific formulation of the LM-SSS approach made it possible\nto develop a tailored coupling form, named Unconstrained Coupling Form (UCF).\nUCF just requires the computation of a nullspace and does not rely on the\nselection of a subspace from a nullspace. By exploiting a numerical example,\nLM-SSS was compared with the Lagrange Multiplier Frequency Based Substructuring\n(LMFBS) approach, which is currently widely recognized as a reference approach.\nThis was done both in terms of: a)coupled FRFs derived by coupling the\nstate-space models of two substructures and b) decoupled FRFs derived by\ndecoupling the state-space model of a component from the coupled model. LM-SSS\nshowed to be suitable to compute minimal order coupled models and UCF turned\nout to have similar performance as other coupling forms already presented to\nthe scientific community. As for the decoupling task, the FRFs derived from the\nLM-SSS approach perfectly matched those obtained by LM-FBS. Moreover, it was\nalso demonstrated that the elimination of the redundant states originated from\nthe decoupling operation was correctly performed. The approaches discussed were\nexploited on an experimental substructuring application. LM-SSS resulted to be\na reliable SSS technique to perform coupling and decoupling operations with\nstate-space models estimated from measured FRFs as well as to provide accurate\nminimal-order models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 17:59:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}
