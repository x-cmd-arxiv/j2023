The\nrefractive index of the spin-coated photoswitchable material can be modulated\nvia the reversible trans-to-cis photoisomerization behavior of the AAP unit\nusing different concentrations.

In 0.030 M the refractive index was 2.65 for the\ntrans state and 2.0 for the cis state.

Opinion assimilation is more (less) likely to occur when the\ndistance from the opinion of the role agent is smaller (larger) than the\naverage opinion distance from other neighbors.

In the limit of longitudinal\ncontainer motions, a symmetry-breaking of the planar wave solution occurs, with\nclockwise and anti-clockwise swirling equally likely. In addition to this\nprimary harmonic dynamics, previous experiments have unveiled that diverse\nsuper-harmonic dynamics are observable far from primary resonances. Among\nthese, the so-called double-crest (DC) dynamics, first observed by Reclari et\nal.

However, one main\nshortcoming of these algorithms is that they essentially fit a mixture of\nidentical spherical Gaussians to data that vastly deviates from such a\ndistribution. In comparison, general Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) can fit\nricher structures but require estimating a quadratic number of parameters per\ncluster to represent the covariance matrices. This poses two main issues: (i)\nthe underlying optimization problems are challenging due to their larger number\nof local minima, and (ii) their solutions can overfit the data.

We develop efficient\nglobal optimization algorithms for general GMMs, and we combine these\nalgorithms with regularization strategies that avoid overfitting.

Classification and\ntaxonomy of different prediction approaches into five distinct categories are\npresented focusing on the theoretical concepts and mathematical functioning of\nthe existing state-of-the-art workload prediction methods. The most prominent\nprediction approaches belonging to a distinct class of machine learning models\nare thoroughly surveyed and compared. All five classified machine\nlearning-based workload prediction models are implemented on a common platform\nfor systematic investigation and comparison using three distinct benchmark\ncloud workload traces via experimental analysis. The essential key performance\nindicators of state-of-the-art approaches are evaluated for comparison and the\npaper is concluded by discussing the trade-offs and notable remarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 18:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Based on hybrid density functional calculations, we\npropose adding Bi to TiO2, in the form of dilute Ti_(1-x)Bi_(x)O2 alloys, to\nefficiently shift the optical absorption to the visible region.

While such models have been used extensively for model\nanalysis, there is limited work in the context of statistical inference. In\nthis paper, we explore the extent to which the PWM with the\nsusceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic can be used to infer disease- and\nnetwork-related parameters. The widely-used MLE approach exhibits several\nissues pertaining to parameter unidentifiability and a lack of robustness to\nexact knowledge about key quantities such as population size and/or proportion\nof under reporting. As an alternative, we considered the recently developed\ndynamical survival analysis (DSA).

This has put forward a stronger concept for\nnonlocality in networks, called full network nonlocality. Here, we\nexperimentally observe full network nonlocal correlations in a network where\nthe source-independence, locality, and measurement-independence loopholes are\nclosed. This is ensured by employing two independent sources, rapid setting\ngeneration, and space-like separations of relevant events.

Boolean functions are simply functions from $n$ bits to one bit, and\nthey can describe digital circuits, voting systems, etc. An example of a\nBoolean function is majority, which returns the value that has majority among\nthe $n$ input bits for odd $n$. The complexity of a Boolean function $f$\nmeasures the cost of evaluating it: how many bits of the input are needed to be\ncertain about the result of $f$. There are many competing complexity measures\nbut we focus on level-$p$-complexity -- a function of the probability $p$ that\na bit is 1. The level-$p$-complexity $D_p(f)$ is the minimum expected cost when\nthe input bits are independent and identically distributed with Bernoulli($p$)\ndistribution. We specify the problem as choosing the minimum expected cost of\nall possible decision trees -- which directly translates to a clearly correct,\nbut very inefficient implementation. The library uses thinning and memoization\nfor efficiency and type classes for separation of concerns. The complexity is\nrepresented using polynomials, and the order relation used for thinning is\nimplemented using polynomial factorisation and root-counting.

While detection and moderation of hate speech have\nbeen the early go-to countermeasures, the solution requires a deeper\nexploration of the dynamics of hate generation and propagation. We analyze more\nthan 32 million posts from over 6.8 million users across three popular online\nsocial networks to investigate the interrelations between hateful behavior,\ninformation dissemination, and polarised organization mediated by echo\nchambers. We find that hatemongers play a more crucial role in governing the\nspread of information compared to singled-out hateful content. This observation\nholds for both the growth of information cascades as well as the conglomeration\nof hateful actors. Dissection of the core-wise distribution of these networks\npoints towards the fact that hateful users acquire a more well-connected\nposition in the social network and often flock together to build up information\ncascades. We observe that this cohesion is far from mere organized behavior;\ninstead, in these networks, hatemongers dominate the echo chambers -- groups of\nusers actively align themselves to specific ideological positions. The observed\ndominance of hateful users to inflate information cascades is primarily via\nuser interactions amplified within these echo chambers. We conclude our study\nwith a cautionary note that popularity-based recommendation of content is\nsusceptible to be exploited by hatemongers given their potential to escalate\ncontent popularity via echo-chambered interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 20:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

In this context, semiconductor quantum dots\nplaced in optical microcavities represent excellent candidates to explore\nstrong light-matter interactions beyond the limits of perturbative non-linear\noptics and control the unitary evolution of optically driven quantum systems.\nIn this work, we demonstrate that a sequence of two optical picosecond pulses\ncan be used to establish coherent control over the phase evolution of the\nensemble of trions in (In,Ga)As quantum dots independent of their initial\nquantum state. Our approach is based on coherent transfer between degenerate\nmulti-wave-mixing signals in the strong field limit where Rabi rotations in\nmulti-level systems take place. In particular, we use the two-pulse photon echo\nsequence to uncover the coherent dynamics of the trion ensemble, whereas the\nareas of two additional control pulses serve as tuning knobs for adjusting the\nmagnitude and timing of the coherent emission. Furthermore, we make use of the\nspin degeneracy of ground and excited state of trions to control the\npolarization state of the emitted signal. Surprisingly, we reveal that the use\nof optical control pulses, whose durations are comparable to the dephasing time\nof the ensemble, lifts the temporal degeneracy between wave-mixing processes of\ndifferent order. This phenomenon is manifested in a significant modification of\nthe temporal shape of the coherent optical response for strong optical fields.\nLifting the temporal degeneracy allows to smoothly trace the transition from\nthe perturbative to the regime of Rabi rotations and opens up new possibilities\nfor the optical investigation of complex energy level structures in so far\nunexplored material systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 20:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

DFRC systems use the same waveform for simultaneously probing the\nsurroundings and communicating with other equipment. By exposing the\ncommunication information to potential targets, DFRC systems are vulnerable to\neavesdropping. In this work, we propose to mitigate the problem by leveraging\ndirectional modulation (DM) enabled by a time-modulated array (TMA) that\ntransmits OFDM waveforms. DM can scramble the signal in all directions except\nthe directions of the legitimate user. However, the signal reflected by the\ntargets is also scrambled, thus complicating the extraction of target\nparameters. We propose a novel, low-complexity target estimation method that\nestimates the target parameters based on the scrambled received symbols. We\nalso propose a novel method to refine the obtained target estimates at the cost\nof increased complexity.

In the last decade, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based\nemotion recognition has been intensively investigated due to its prominative\naccuracy and reliability, and graph convolutional network (GCN) has become a\nmainstream model to decode emotions from EEG signals. However, the electrode\nrelationship, especially long-range electrode dependencies across the scalp,\nmay be underutilized by GCNs, although such relationships have been proven to\nbe important in emotion recognition. The small receptive field makes shallow\nGCNs only aggregate local nodes. On the other hand, stacking too many layers\nleads to over-smoothing. To solve these problems, we propose the pyramidal\ngraph convolutional network (PGCN), which aggregates features at three levels:\nlocal, mesoscopic, and global. First, we construct a vanilla GCN based on the\n3D topological relationships of electrodes, which is used to integrate\ntwo-order local features; Second, we construct several mesoscopic brain regions\nbased on priori knowledge and employ mesoscopic attention to sequentially\ncalculate the virtual mesoscopic centers to focus on the functional connections\nof mesoscopic brain regions; Finally, we fuse the node features and their 3D\npositions to construct a numerical relationship adjacency matrix to integrate\nstructural and functional connections from the global perspective. Experimental\nresults on three public datasets indicate that PGCN enhances the relationship\nmodelling across the scalp and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both\nsubject-dependent and subject-independent scenarios. Meanwhile, PGCN makes an\neffective trade-off between enhancing network depth and receptive fields while\nsuppressing the ensuing over-smoothing.

Explicitly optimizing the\ncommon information shared among all modalities (e.g., by maximizing the total\ncorrelation) has been shown to achieve better feature representations and thus\nenhance the segmentation performance. However, existing approaches are\noblivious to partial common information shared by subsets of the modalities.

Since the RTOb-based robust force\ncontrollers are always implemented using computers and/or microcontrollers,\nthis paper proposes a stability analysis in the discrete-time domain.

Once we cover the current\nstate-of-the-art, we introduce two major methodological contributions. First,\nwe present a branch-price-and-cut (BP&C) algorithm for the VRPSD under optimal\nrestocking. The method, which is based on the pricing of elementary routes,\ncompares favorably with previous algorithms and allows the solution of several\nopen benchmark instances. Second, we develop a demand model for dealing with\ncorrelated customer demands. The central concept in this model is the \"external\nfactor\", which represents unknown covariates that affect all demands. We\npresent a Bayesian-based, iterated learning procedure to refine our knowledge\nabout the external factor as customer demands are revealed. This updated\nknowledge is then used to prescribe optimal replenishment decisions under\ndemand correlation. Computational results demonstrate the efficiency of the new\nBP&C method and show that cost savings above 10% may be achieved when\nrestocking decisions take account of demand correlation.

Inspired by the way\nhuman brains acquire knowledge in new domains, we present an innovative\ngenerator structure called Domain Re-Modulation (DoRM). DoRM not only meets the\ncriteria of high quality, large synthesis diversity, and cross-domain\nconsistency, which were achieved by previous research in GDA, but also\nincorporates memory and domain association, akin to how human brains operate.\nSpecifically, DoRM freezes the source generator and introduces new mapping and\naffine modules (M&A modules) to capture the attributes of the target domain\nduring GDA. This process resembles the formation of new synapses in human\nbrains. Consequently, a linearly combinable domain shift occurs in the style\nspace. By incorporating multiple new M&A modules, the generator gains the\ncapability to perform high-fidelity multi-domain and hybrid-domain generation.\nMoreover, to maintain cross-domain consistency more effectively, we introduce a\nsimilarity-based structure loss. This loss aligns the auto-correlation map of\nthe target image with its corresponding auto-correlation map of the source\nimage during training.

Due to the Pareto optimality of sub-problems and the complex\ndependency across UL solutions and LL weights, an UL solution is feasible if\nand only if the LL weight is Pareto optimal. It is computationally expensive to\ndetermine which LL Pareto weight in the LL Pareto weight set is the most\nappropriate for each UL solution. This paper proposes a bi-level\nmulti-objective learning framework (BLMOL), coupling the above decision-making\nprocess with the optimization process of the UL-MOP by introducing LL\npreference $r$.

In a whole delivery period, advertisers usually desire a\ncertain impression count for the ads, and they also expect that the delivery\nperformance is as good as possible (e.g., obtaining high click-through rate).\nAdvertising platforms employ pacing algorithms to satisfy the demands via\nadjusting the selection probabilities to traffic requests in real-time.\nHowever, the delivery procedure is also affected by the strategies from\npublishers, which cannot be controlled by advertising platforms. Preloading is\na widely used strategy for many types of ads (e.g., video ads) to make sure\nthat the response time for displaying after a traffic request is legitimate,\nwhich results in delayed impression phenomenon. Traditional pacing algorithms\ncannot handle the preloading nature well because they rely on immediate\nfeedback signals, and may fail to guarantee the demands from advertisers.\n  In this paper, we focus on a new research problem of impression pacing for\npreloaded ads, and propose a Reinforcement Learning To Pace framework RLTP. It\nlearns a pacing agent that sequentially produces selection probabilities in the\nwhole delivery period. To jointly optimize the two objectives of impression\ncount and delivery performance, RLTP employs tailored reward estimator to\nsatisfy the guaranteed impression count, penalize the over-delivery and\nmaximize the traffic value. Experiments on large-scale industrial datasets\nverify that RLTP outperforms baseline pacing algorithms by a large margin. We\nhave deployed the RLTP framework online to our advertising platform, and\nresults show that it achieves significant uplift to core metrics including\ndelivery completion rate and click-through rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 07:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

This sequence of outbursts (supercycle) is what is seen in many SU\nUMa stars and this observation strengthened the suggestion that the\naccumulating mass and angular momentum in the disk during repeated normal\noutbursts caused a superoutburst even in the unusual system BO Cet.

Multiple-point statistics are\ncommonly used to generate geo-models. In this paper, a deep-learning-based\ngenerative method is developed as an alternative to the traditional Geomodel\ngeneration procedure. The generative method comprises two deep-learning models,\nnamely the hierarchical vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE-2) and\nPixelSNAIL autoregressive model. Based on the principle of neural discrete\nrepresentation learning, the VQ-VAE-2 learns to massively compress the\nGeomodels to extract the low-dimensional, discrete latent representation\ncorresponding to each Geomodel. Following that, PixelSNAIL uses the deep\nautoregressive network to learn the prior distribution of the latent codes. For\nthe purpose of Geomodel generation, PixelSNAIL samples from the newly learned\nprior distribution of latent codes, and then the decoder of the VQ-VAE-2\nconverts the newly sampled latent code to a newly constructed geo-model.\nPixelSNAIL can be used for unconditional or conditional geo-model generation.\nIn an unconditional generation, the generative workflow generates an ensemble\nof geo-models without any constraint. On the other hand, in the conditional\ngeo-model generation, the generative workflow generates an ensemble of\ngeo-models similar to a user-defined source image, which ultimately facilitates\nthe control and manipulation of the generated geo-models. To better construct\nthe fluvial channels in the geo-models, the perceptual loss is implemented in\nthe VQ-VAE-2 model instead of the traditional mean squared error loss. At a\nspecific compression ratio, the quality of multi-attribute geo-model generation\nis better than that of single-attribute geo-model generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 07:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

SA-CB-BRSeg methodically\nutilized smoothening and heterogeneous operations in the encoder and decoder to\ncapture simultaneously COVID-19 specific patterns that are region homogeneity,\ntexture variation, and boundaries. Additionally, the new CB concept is\nintroduced in the decoder of SA-CB-BRSeg by combining additional channels using\nTL to learn the low contrast region. The proposed STM-BRNet and SA-CB-BRSeg\nyield considerable achievement in accuracy: 98.01 %, Recall: 98.12%, F-score:\n98.11%, and Dice Similarity: 96.396%, IOU: 98.845 % for the COVID-19 infectious\nregion, respectively.

We\nobserve circular objects with different amplitude of contrast which evidences\nthe presence of different 3D objects located in various vertical parts of the\nmultilayer. Moreover, we witness during out-of-plane cycling an attractive\ninteraction between cocoons located at various heights, mainly due to the stray\nfield, which impacts their horizontal positioning. The X-ray holography\nmeasurements also allow to determine the size of the cocoons at remanence\nwhich, at room temperature, possess diameter close to 100 nm in average.\nCombining this transmission technique with magnetic force microscopy and\nmicromagnetic simulations gives a precise insight into the 3D distribution of\nthe magnetization which demonstrate the 3D nature of skyrmionic cocoons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 09:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

However, along the journey\nof deploying and iterating on EBR in production, we still identify some\nfundamental issues in existing methods. First, when dealing with large corpus\nof candidate items, EBR models often have difficulties in balancing the\nperformance on distinguishing highly relevant items (positives) from both\nirrelevant ones (easy negatives) and from somewhat related yet not competitive\nones (hard negatives). Also, we have little control in the diversity and\nfairness of the retrieval results because of the ``greedy'' nature of nearest\nvector search. These issues compromise the performance of EBR methods in\nlarge-scale industrial scenarios. This paper introduces a simple and\nproven-in-production solution to overcome these issues. The proposed solution\ntakes a divide-and-conquer approach: the whole set of candidate items are\ndivided into multiple clusters and we run EBR to retrieve relevant candidates\nfrom each cluster in parallel; top candidates from each cluster are then\ncombined by some controllable merging strategies. This approach allows our EBR\nmodels to only concentrate on discriminating positives from mostly hard\nnegatives. It also enables further improvement from a multi-tasking learning\n(MTL) perspective: retrieval problems within each cluster can be regarded as\nindividual tasks; inspired by recent successes in prompting and prefix-tuning,\nwe propose an efficient task adaption technique further boosting the retrieval\nperformance within each cluster with negligible overheads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 09:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Here, we present an open-source\nPython module called PASEOS that is capable of modelling operational scenarios\ninvolving one or multiple spacecraft. It considers several physical phenomena\nincluding thermal, power, bandwidth and communications constraints as well as\nthe impact of radiation on spacecraft. PASEOS can be run both as a\nhigh-performance-oriented numerical simulation and/or in a real-time mode\ndirectly on edge hardware. We demonstrate these capabilities in three\nscenarios, one in real-time simulation on a Unibap iX-10 100 satellite\nprocessor, another in a simulation modelling an entire constellation performing\ntasks over several hours and one training a machine learning model in a\ndecentralised setting.

Our results show that\nPASEOS can model the described scenarios efficiently and thus provide insight\ninto operational considerations. We show this in terms of runtime and overhead\nas well as by investigating the modelled temperature, battery status and\ncommunication windows of a constellation.

Prior\nwork have achieved remarkable successes by learning from human feedback to\nunderstand and follow instructions. Nonetheless, these methods are either\nfounded on hand-picked model generations that are favored by human annotators,\nrendering them ineffective in terms of data utilization and challenging to\napply in general, or they depend on reward functions and reinforcement\nlearning, which are prone to imperfect reward function and extremely\nchallenging to optimize. In this work, we propose a novel technique, Chain of\nHindsight, that is easy to optimize and can learn from any form of feedback,\nregardless of its polarity. Our idea is inspired by how humans learn from\nextensive feedback presented in the form of languages. We convert all types of\nfeedback into sentences, which are then used to fine-tune the model, allowing\nus to take advantage of the language comprehension capabilities of language\nmodels. We condition the model on a sequence of model generations paired with\nfeedback. By doing so, models are trained to generate outputs based on\nfeedback, and models can learn to identify and correct negative attributes or\nerrors. Applying our method to large language models, we observed that Chain of\nHindsight significantly surpasses previous methods in aligning language models\nwith human preferences. We observed significant improvements on summarization\nand dialogue tasks and our approach is markedly preferred in human evaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 10:28:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 21:53:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 10:45:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 16:00:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2023 08:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 23:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

While in glasses\ninstantaneous configurations correspond to minima of the potential-energy\nhypersurface and all eigenvalues of the associated Hessian matrix are therefore\npositive, in liquids this is no longer true, and modes corresponding to both\npositive and negative eigenvalues exist. The instantaneous-normal-mode spectrum\nhas been numerically investigated in the past, and it has been demonstrated to\nbring important information on the liquid dynamics. A systematic deeper\ntheoretical understanding is now needed. Heterogeneous-elasticity theory has\nproven to be successful in explaining many details of the low-frequency\nexcitations in glasses, ranging from the thoroughly studied boson peak, down to\nthe more elusive non-phononic excitations observed in numerical simulations at\nthe lowest frequencies.

The poorly known low-energy alpha-nucleus optical (AOMP)\npotential is a key parameter to estimate the rates of these reactions. The AOMP\ncan be tested by measuring the cross section of alpha-scattering as well as\nalpha-induced reactions. Low energy elastic alpha-scattering on 144Sm has\nrecently been measured with high precision. The aim of the present work was to\ncomplement that work by measuring the (a,n) cross sections on 144Sm at low\nenergies. The experimental data shall be used to constrain the AOMP. From this\npotential the 144Sm(a,g)148Gd reaction rate can be derived with reduced\nuncertainties. The 144Sm(a,n)147Gd reaction was studied by bombarding Sm\ntargets with alpha-beams provided by the cyclotron accelerator of Atomki. The\ncross section was determined using the activation method. The gamma-radiation\nfollowing the decay of the 147Gd reaction product was measured with a HPGe\ndetector. The experimental data are analyzed within the statistical model. The\ncross section was measured in the alpha-energy range between 13 and 20 MeV in 1\nMeV steps, i.e., from close above the (a,n) threshold. The results were\ncompared with statistical model calculations using various approaches and\nparametrizations for the AOMP, and excellent agreement was obtained for two\nrecent potentials. However, these potentials cannot reproduce literature data\nfor the 144Sm(a,g)148Gd reaction with the same accuracy. Constraints for the\nAOMP were derived from an analysis of the new 144Sm(a,n)147Gd data and\nliterature data for 144Sm(a,g)148Gd. These constraints enable a determination\nof the reaction rate of the 144Sm(a,g)148Gd reaction with significantly reduced\nuncertainties of less than a factor of two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 10:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

The LZ formula is commonly used in\nstudies of axion-photon conversion; however, in this context, it relies on the\nassumption that the magnetic field variation is small compared to variations of\nthe plasma frequency, which is frequently not the case in real plasmas. We\nderive a generalised version of the LZ formula by allowing the boundaries to be\nlocated at a scale that is similar to the inhomogeneities. We find that the LZ\nformula fails when the oscillation range is small compared to the resonance\nregion. This failure is more severe in the adiabatic limit, when the plasma\nfrequency varies slowly, resulting in a conversion probability that is not\nmaximal as opposed to a naive application of the LZ formula.

The disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar\nSystem, was reported to extend from 74 to 84 AU from the central star. The high\nphotometric precision of the Characterising Exoplanet Satellite (CHEOPS)\nprovided an exceptional opportunity to observe small variations in the light\ncurve due to transiting material in the disk. This is a unique chance to\ninvestigate processes in the debris disk. Photometric observations of DE Boo of\na total of four days were carried out with CHEOPS. Photometric variations due\nto spots on the stellar surface were subtracted from the light curves by\napplying a two-spot model and a fourth-order polynomial. The photometric\nobservations were accompanied by spectroscopic measurements with the 1m RCC\ntelescope at Piszk\\'estet\\H{o} and with the SOPHIE spectrograph in order to\nrefine the astrophysical parameters of DE Boo. We present a detailed analysis\nof the photometric observation of DE Boo. We report the presence of nonperiodic\ntransient features in the residual light curves with a transit duration of\n0.3-0.8 days. We calculated the maximum distance of the material responsible\nfor these variations to be 2.47 AU from the central star, much closer than most\nof the mass of the debris disk. Furthermore, we report the first observation of\nflaring events in this system. We interpreted the transient features as the\nresult of scattering in an inner debris disk around DE Boo. The processes\nresponsible for these variations were investigated in the context of\ninteractions between planetesimals in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 11:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Our main contributions are\nthree-fold: i) we propose the novel JFCS framework to efficiently and\nadaptively direct traffic to appropriate radio units; ii) we develop\nlow-complexity algorithms based on the reinforcement learning, inner\napproximation and bisection search methods to effectively solve the JFCS\nproblem in different time scales; and iii) the rigorous theoretical performance\nresults are analyzed to show that there exists a scaling factor to improve the\ntradeoff between delay and utility-optimization.

This is an important task that is rooted in many\nreal-world applications, including and not limited to cybersecurity, medicine\nand astrophysics. While fast and efficient online algorithms have been recently\nintroduced, these rely on parametric assumptions which are often violated in\npractical applications. Motivated by data streams from the telecommunications\nsector, we build a flexible nonparametric approach to detect a change in the\ndistribution of a sequence. Our procedure, NP-FOCuS, builds a sequential\nlikelihood ratio test for a change in a set of points of the empirical\ncumulative density function of our data. This is achieved by keeping track of\nthe number of observations above or below those points. Thanks to functional\npruning ideas, NP-FOCuS has a computational cost that is log-linear in the\nnumber of observations and is suitable for high-frequency data streams. In\nterms of detection power, NP-FOCuS is seen to outperform current nonparametric\nonline changepoint techniques in a variety of settings.

Two types of ISS phenomena (intensity scintillation and\npulse broadening) are caused by electron density fluctuations on small scales\n(< 0.01 AU). Theory predicts that these are related, and both have been widely\nemployed to study the properties of the IISM. Larger scales ($\\sim$1-100\\,AU)\ncause measurable changes in dispersion and these can be correlated with ISS\nobservations to estimate the fluctuation spectrum over a very wide scale range.\nIISM measurements can often be modeled by a homogeneous power-law spatial\nspectrum of electron density with the Kolmogorov ($-11/3$) spectral exponent.\nHere we aim to test the validity of using the Kolmogorov exponent with\nPSR~J0826+2637. We do so using observations of intensity scintillation, pulse\nbroadening and dispersion variations across a wide fractional bandwidth (20 --\n180\\,MHz). We present that the frequency dependence of the intensity\nscintillation in the high frequency band matches the expectations of a\nKolmogorov spectral exponent but the pulse broadening in the low frequency band\ndoes not change as rapidly as predicted with this assumption. We show that this\nbehavior is due to an inhomogeneity in the scattering region, specifically that\nthe scattering is dominated by a region of transverse size $\\sim$40\\,AU. The\npower spectrum of the electron density, however, maintains the Kolmogorov\nspectral exponent from spatial scales of 5$\\times10^{-6}$\\,AU to $\\sim$100\\,AU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 11:59:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 14:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

We characterize the spatial structure and evolution of methanol\nand water masers during a flare of methanol maser emission at 6.7 GHz in the\nHMYSO G24.33$+$0.14. VLBA was used to image the 6.7 and 12.2 GHz methanol and\n22.2 GHz water vapor masers at three epochs guided by monitoring the methanol\nline with the Torun 32m telescope. The 6.7 GHz maser maps were also obtained\nwith the EVN and LBA during the flare. WISE data were used to find correlations\nbetween the 6.7 GHz maser and IR fluxes. The 6.7 GHz methanol maser cloudlets\nare distributed over $\\sim$3500 au, and the morphology of most of them is\nstable although their brightness varies following the course of the total flux\ndensity on a timescale of two months. The 12.2 GHz methanol maser cloudlets\ncover an area an order of magnitude smaller than that of 6.7 GHz emission, and\nboth transitions emerge from the same masing gas. The 22.2 GHz maser cloudlets\nlie in the central region and show a systematic increase in brightness and\nmoderate changes in size and orientation, together with the velocity drift of\nthe strongest cloudlet during two months of the VLBI observing period. Time lag\nestimates imply the propagation of changes in the physical conditions of the\nmasing region with a subluminal speed ($\\sim$0.3c). A tight correlation of IR\n(4.6$\\mu$m) and 6.7 GHz flux densities is found, supporting the radiative\npumping model.

We first encode\nheterogeneous spatial relations between the unobserved and observed locations\nby their spatial proximity, functional similarity, and transition probability.\nBased on each relation, we accurately aggregate the information of most\ncorrelated observed locations to produce inductive representations for the\nunobserved locations, by jointly modeling their similarities and differences.\nThen, we design relation-aware gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks to\nadaptively capture the temporal correlations in the generated sequence\nrepresentations for each relation. Finally, we propose a multi-relation\nattention mechanism to dynamically fuse the complex spatio-temporal information\nat different time steps from multiple relations to compute the kriging output.\nExperimental results on three real-world datasets show that our proposed model\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently, and the advantage is more\nsignificant when there are fewer observed locations.

One-time authentication techniques such as\npasswords and physiological biometrics (e.g., fingerprint, face, and iris) have\ntheir own advantages but also disadvantages since they can be stolen or\nemulated, and do not prevent access to the underlying device, once it is\nunlocked. To address these challenges, complementary authentication systems\nbased on behavioural biometrics have emerged. The goal is to continuously\nprofile users based on their interaction with the mobile device. However,\nexisting behavioural authentication schemes are not (i) user-agnostic meaning\nthat they cannot dynamically handle changes in the user-base without model\nre-training, or (ii) do not scale well to authenticate millions of users.\n  In this paper, we present AuthentiSense, a user-agnostic, scalable, and\nefficient behavioural biometrics authentication system that enables continuous\nauthentication and utilizes only motion patterns (i.e., accelerometer,\ngyroscope and magnetometer data) while users interact with mobile apps. Our\napproach requires neither manually engineered features nor a significant amount\nof data for model training.

We perform a\nsystematic measurement study and report the impact of the parameters such as\ninteraction time needed for authentication and n-shot verification (comparison\nwith enrollment samples) at the recognition stage. Remarkably, AuthentiSense\nachieves high accuracy of up to 97% in terms of F1-score even when evaluated in\na few-shot fashion that requires only a few behaviour samples per user (3\nshots). Our approach accurately authenticates users only after 1 second of user\ninteraction. For AuthentiSense, we report a FAR and FRR of 0.023 and 0.057,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 12:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Remote sensing imagery provides the ideal\ndatabase for monitoring calving front positions, however, it is not feasible to\nperform this task manually for all calving glaciers globally due to\ntime-constraints. Deep learning-based methods have shown great potential for\nglacier calving front delineation from optical and radar satellite imagery. The\ncalving front is represented as a single thin line between the ocean and the\nglacier, which makes the task vulnerable to inaccurate predictions. The limited\navailability of annotated glacier imagery leads to a lack of data diversity\n(not all possible combinations of different weather conditions, terminus\nshapes, sensors, etc. are present in the data), which exacerbates the\ndifficulty of accurate segmentation. In this paper, we propose\nAttention-Multi-hooking-Deep-supervision HookNet (AMD-HookNet), a novel glacier\ncalving front segmentation framework for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.\nThe proposed method aims to enhance the feature representation capability\nthrough multiple information interactions between low-resolution and\nhigh-resolution inputs based on a two-branch U-Net. The attention mechanism,\nintegrated into the two branch U-Net, aims to interact between the\ncorresponding coarse and fine-grained feature maps. This allows the network to\nautomatically adjust feature relationships, resulting in accurate\npixel-classification predictions. Extensive experiments and comparisons on the\nchallenging glacier segmentation benchmark dataset CaFFe show that our\nAMD-HookNet achieves a mean distance error of 438 m to the ground truth\noutperforming the current state of the art by 42%, which validates its\neffectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 12:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

Recently, several studies have attempted\nto analyze the generalization error in such settings by using tools from\nfractal geometry. While these works have successfully introduced new\nmathematical tools to apprehend generalization, they heavily rely on a\nLipschitz continuity assumption, which in general does not hold for neural\nnetworks and might make the bounds vacuous. In this work, we address this issue\nand prove fractal geometry-based generalization bounds without requiring any\nLipschitz assumption. To achieve this goal, we build up on a classical covering\nargument in learning theory and introduce a data-dependent fractal dimension.\nDespite introducing a significant amount of technical complications, this new\nnotion lets us control the generalization error (over either fixed or random\nhypothesis spaces) along with certain mutual information (MI) terms. To provide\na clearer interpretation to the newly introduced MI terms, as a next step, we\nintroduce a notion of \"geometric stability\" and link our bounds to the prior\nart.

Clearly, distinct methods designed to\ndetect different types of patterns may provide a variety of answers to the\nnetwork's mesoscale structure. Yet, even multiple runs of a given method can\nsometimes yield diverse and conflicting results, yielding entire landscapes of\npartitions which potentially include multiple (locally optimal) mesoscale\nexplanations of the network. Such ambiguity motivates a closer look at the\nability of these methods to find multiple qualitatively different 'ground\ntruth' partitions in a network. Here, we propose a generative model which\nallows for two distinct partitions to be built into the mesoscale structure of\na single benchmark network. We demonstrate a use case of the benchmark model by\nexploring the power of stochastic block models (SBMs) to detect coexisting\nbi-community and core-periphery structures of different strengths. We find that\nthe ability to detect the two partitions individually varies considerably by\nSBM variant and that coexistence of both partitions is recovered only in a very\nlimited number of cases. Our findings suggest that in most instances only one -\nin some way dominating - structure can be detected, even in the presence of\nother partitions in the generated network. They underline the need for\nconsidering entire landscapes of partitions when different competing\nexplanations exist and motivate future research to advance partition\ncoexistence detection methods. Our model also contributes to the field of\nbenchmark networks more generally by enabling further exploration of the\nability of new and existing methods to detect ambiguity in mesoscale structure\nof networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 14:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

One of the key challenges in\ndecentralized deep MARL is the non-stationarity of the learning environment\nwhen multiple agents are learning concurrently. A commonly used and efficient\nscheme for decentralized MARL is independent learning in which agents\nconcurrently update their policies independent of each other. We first show\nthat independent learning does not always converge, while sequential learning\nwhere agents update their policies one after another in a sequence is\nguaranteed to converge to an agent-by-agent optimal solution. In sequential\nlearning, when one agent updates its policy, all other agent's policies are\nkept fixed, alleviating the challenge of non-stationarity due to concurrent\nupdates in other agents' policies. However, it can be slow because only one\nagent is learning at any time. Therefore it might also not always be practical.\nIn this work, we propose a decentralized cooperative MARL algorithm based on\nmulti-timescale learning. In multi-timescale learning, all agents learn\nconcurrently, but at different learning rates. In our proposed method, when one\nagent updates its policy, other agents are allowed to update their policies as\nwell, but at a slower rate. This speeds up sequential learning, while also\nminimizing non-stationarity caused by other agents updating concurrently.\nMulti-timescale learning outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized learning\nmethods on a set of challenging multi-agent cooperative tasks in the epymarl\n(papoudakis2020) benchmark. This can be seen as a first step towards more\ngeneral decentralized cooperative deep MARL methods based on multi-timescale\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 14:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

To\nsimplify this pipeline and unify the process of feature extraction and target\ninformation integration, in this paper, we present a compact tracking\nframework, termed as MixFormer, built upon transformers. Our core design is to\nutilize the flexibility of attention operations, and propose a Mixed Attention\nModule (MAM) for simultaneous feature extraction and target information\nintegration. This synchronous modeling scheme allows to extract target-specific\ndiscriminative features and perform extensive communication between target and\nsearch area. Based on MAM, we build our MixFormer trackers simply by stacking\nmultiple MAMs and placing a localization head on top. Specifically, we\ninstantiate two types of MixFormer trackers, a hierarchical tracker MixCvT, and\na non-hierarchical tracker MixViT. For these two trackers, we investigate a\nseries of pre-training methods and uncover the different behaviors between\nsupervised pre-training and self-supervised pre-training in our MixFormer\ntrackers. We also extend the masked pre-training to our MixFormer trackers and\ndesign the competitive TrackMAE pre-training technique. Finally, to handle\nmultiple target templates during online tracking, we devise an asymmetric\nattention scheme in MAM to reduce computational cost, and propose an effective\nscore prediction module to select high-quality templates.

However, this scaling has increased the reliance on efficient\ndistributed training techniques. Accordingly, as with other distributed\ncomputing scenarios, it is important to understand how will compute and\ncommunication scale relative to one another as models scale and hardware\nevolves? A careful study which answers this question can better guide the\ndesign of future systems which can efficiently train future large models.\n  Accordingly, this work provides a comprehensive multi-axial (algorithmic,\nempirical, hardware evolution) analysis of compute vs. communication\n(Comp-vs.-Comm) scaling for future Transformer models on future hardware.\nFirst, our algorithmic analysis shows that compute generally enjoys an edge\nover communication as models scale. However, since memory capacity scales\nslower than compute, these trends are being stressed. Next, we quantify this\nedge by empirically studying how Comp-vs.-Comm scales for future models on\nfuture hardware. To avoid profiling numerous Transformer models across many\nsetups, we extract execution regions and project costs using operator models.\nThis allows a spectrum (hundreds) of future model/hardware scenarios to be\naccurately studied ($<$15% error), and reduces profiling costs by 2100$\\times$.\nOur experiments show that communication will be a significant portion (40-75%)\nof runtime as models and hardware evolve. Moreover, communication which is\nhidden by overlapped computation in today's models often cannot be hidden in\nfuture, larger models. Overall, this work highlights the increasingly large\nrole communication will play as models scale and discusses techniques and\nupcoming technologies that can help address it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 14:43:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 22:59:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 01:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Because of this short coincidence time, broadband\nTPA is not sensitive to the spectrum of intermediate levels, making it the\noptimal choice when the intermediate transitions are entirely virtual. In the\ncase of distinct intermediate resonances, it is possible to enhance TPA by\nintroducing a phase dispersion that matches the intermediate resonances. Here,\nwe consider the effects of a phase flip in the single photon spectrum, where\nthe phases of all frequencies above a certain frequency are shifted by half a\nwavelength relative to the frequencies below this frequency. The frequency at\nwhich the phase is flipped can then be scanned to reveal the position of\nintermediate resonances. We find that a resonant phase flip maximizes the\ncontributions of the asymmetric imaginary part of the dispersion that\ncharacterizes a typical resonance, resulting in a considerable enhancement of\nthe TPA rate. Due to the bosonic symmetry of TPA, the enhancement is strongest\nwhen the resonance occurs when the frequency difference of the two photons is\nmuch higher than the linewidth of the resonance.

The\nbenchmarking of HCI algorithms within the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge\n(EIDC) showed that (i) SODINN can produce a high number of false positives in\nthe final detection maps, and (ii) algorithms processing images in a more local\nmanner perform better. This work aims to improve the SODINN detection\nperformance by introducing new local processing approaches and adapting its\nlearning process accordingly. We propose NA-SODINN, a new deep learning\narchitecture that better captures image noise correlations by training an\nindependent SODINN model per noise regime over the processed frame. The\nidentification of these noise regimes is based on a novel technique, named\nPCA-pmaps, which allows to estimate the distance from the star in the image\nfrom which background noise starts to dominate over residual speckle noise.\nNA-SODINN is also fed with local discriminators, such as S/N curves, which\ncomplement spatio-temporal feature maps when training the model.Our new\napproach is tested against its predecessor, as well as two SODINN-based hybrid\nmodels and a more standard annular-PCA approach, through local ROC analysis of\nADI sequences from VLT/SPHERE and Keck/NIRC-2 instruments. Results show that\nNA-SODINN enhances SODINN in both the sensitivity and specificity, especially\nin the speckle-dominated noise regime. NA-SODINN is also benchmarked against\nthe complete set of submitted detection algorithms in EIDC, in which we show\nthat its final detection score matches or outperforms the most powerful\ndetection algorithms, reaching a performance similar to that of the Regime\nSwitching Model algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 15:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

We consider a symmetric integral form\nof these nonlocal equations defined on general geometries and in arbitrary\nbounded domains. A number of challenges are encountered when discretizing these\nequations. The first comes from the heterogeneous kernel singularity in the\nfractional integral operator. The second comes from the dense discrete operator\nwith its quadratic growth in memory footprint and arithmetic operations. An\nadditional challenge comes from the need to handle volume conditions-the\ngeneralization of classical local boundary conditions to the nonlocal setting.\nSatisfying these conditions requires that the effect of the whole domain,\nincluding both the interior and exterior regions, can be computed on every\ninterior point in the discretization. Performed directly, this would result in\nquadratic complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a strategy that\ndecomposes the stiffness matrix into three components. The first is a sparse\nmatrix that handles the singular near-field separately and is computed by\nadapting singular quadrature techniques available for the homogeneous case to\nthe case of spatially variable order. The second component handles the\nremaining smooth part of the near-field as well as the far-field and is\napproximated by a hierarchical $\\mathcal{H}^{2}$ matrix that maintains linear\ncomplexity in storage and operations. The third component handles the effect of\nthe global mesh at every node and is written as a weighted mass matrix whose\ndensity is computed by a fast-multipole type method.

We find large O32 ratios and [S II] deficiencies, which\nprovide strong indications for these galaxies to be LyC Emitters (LCEs). At\nleast 40% of these objects are candidates for featuring cosmologically\nsignificant LyC escape fractions >10%. Their SFHs exhibit strong similarities\nand almost all galaxies appear to contain an old (>1 Gyr) stellar component,\nwhile also harbouring a young, two-stage (~10 Myr and <1 Myr) starburst, which\nwe speculate might be related to LyC escape.\n  The properties of the compact emission line galaxies presented here align\nwell with those observed in many local LCEs. In fact, our sample may prove as\nan extension to the rather small catalogue of local LCEs, as the extreme\ninterstellar medium (ISM) conditions we find are assumed to facilitate LyC\nleakage. Notably, all of our eighteen candidates are significantly closer\n(z<0.1) than most established LCEs.

By contrast, we give a simple\nquantum circuit that correctly decodes the Hadamard code with probability\n$\\Omega(\\varepsilon^2)$ even if a $(1/2 - \\varepsilon)$-fraction of a codeword\nis adversarially corrupted.\n  Our classical hardness result is based on an equidistribution phenomenon for\nmultivariate polynomials over a finite field under biased input-distributions.\nThis is proved using a structure-versus-randomness strategy based on a new\nnotion of rank for high-dimensional polynomial maps that may be of independent\ninterest.\n  Our quantum circuit is inspired by a non-local version of the\nBernstein-Vazirani problem, a technique to generate \"poor man's cat states\" by\nWatts et al., and a constant-depth quantum circuit for the OR function by\nTakahashi and Tani.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 15:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Towards this end,\nrecent work proposes to make interpretable decisions by sequentially asking\ninterpretable queries about data until a prediction can be made with high\nconfidence based on the answers obtained (the history). To promote short\nquery-answer chains, a greedy procedure called Information Pursuit (IP) is\nused, which adaptively chooses queries in order of information gain. Generative\nmodels are employed to learn the distribution of query-answers and labels,\nwhich is in turn used to estimate the most informative query. However, learning\nand inference with a full generative model of the data is often intractable for\ncomplex tasks. In this work, we propose Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP),\na variational characterization of IP which bypasses the need for learning\ngenerative models. V-IP is based on finding a query selection strategy and a\nclassifier that minimizes the expected cross-entropy between true and predicted\nlabels. We then demonstrate that the IP strategy is the optimal solution to\nthis problem. Therefore, instead of learning generative models, we can use our\noptimal strategy to directly pick the most informative query given any history.\nWe then develop a practical algorithm by defining a finite-dimensional\nparameterization of our strategy and classifier using deep networks and train\nthem end-to-end using our objective. Empirically, V-IP is 10-100x faster than\nIP on different Vision and NLP tasks with competitive performance. Moreover,\nV-IP finds much shorter query chains when compared to reinforcement learning\nwhich is typically used in sequential-decision-making problems. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the utility of V-IP on challenging tasks like medical diagnosis\nwhere the performance is far superior to the generative modelling approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 15:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 02:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Meanwhile, evaluating all candidate permutations brings unacceptable\ncomputational costs in practice. Thus, to better balance efficiency and\neffectiveness, online systems usually use a two-stage architecture which uses\nsome heuristic methods such as beam-search to generate a suitable amount of\ncandidate permutations firstly, which are then fed into the evaluation model to\nget the optimal permutation.

Stability of a grip depends on\ngeometric and physical properties of the object as well as the gripper itself.\nCurrent state-of-the-art algorithms can usually predict if a grip would fail.\nHowever, they are not able to predict the force at which the gripped object\nstarts to slip, which is critical as the object might be subjected to external\nforces, e.g. when joining it with another object. This research project aims to\ndevelop a AI-based approach for a grip metric based on tactile sensor data\ncapturing the physical interactions between gripper and object. Thus, the\nmaximum force that can be applied to the object before it begins to slip should\nbe predicted before manipulating the object. The RGB image of the contact\nsurface between the object and gripper jaws obtained from GelSight tactile\nsensors during the initial phase of the grip should serve as a training input\nfor the grip metric. To generate such a data set, a pull experiment is designed\nusing a UR 5 robot.

In\nparticular, we illustrate how multi-level sampling methods, such as multi-level\nMonte Carlo (MLMC) and multi-index Monte Carlo (MIMC), can be applied to assess\nthe impact of variations in the microstructure of polycrystalline materials on\nthe predictions of homogenized materials properties. We show that by adaptively\nexploiting the fidelity hierarchy, we can significantly reduce the number of\nmicrostructures required to reach a certain prescribed accuracy. Finally, we\nshow how our approach can be extended to a multi-fidelity framework, where we\nallow the underlying constitutive model to be chosen from either a\nphenomenological plasticity model or a dislocation-density-based model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 15:34:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 18:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}
