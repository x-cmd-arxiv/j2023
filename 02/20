Previous works typically combine raw\nmessages of teammates with local information as inputs for policy. However,\nneglecting message aggregation poses significant inefficiency for policy\nlearning. Motivated by recent advances in representation learning, we argue\nthat efficient message aggregation is essential for good coordination in\ncooperative MARL. In this paper, we propose Multi-Agent communication via\nSelf-supervised Information Aggregation (MASIA), where agents can aggregate the\nreceived messages into compact representations with high relevance to augment\nthe local policy. Specifically, we design a permutation invariant message\nencoder to generate common information-aggregated representation from messages\nand optimize it via reconstructing and shooting future information in a\nself-supervised manner. Hence, each agent would utilize the most relevant parts\nof the aggregated representation for decision-making by a novel message\nextraction mechanism. Furthermore, considering the potential of offline\nlearning for real-world applications, we build offline benchmarks for\nmulti-agent communication, which is the first as we know. Empirical results\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method in both online and offline settings.\nWe also release the built offline benchmarks in this paper as a testbed for\ncommunication ability validation to facilitate further future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 16:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Establishing an efficient interface between\noptical photons and nuclear spins, while highly desirable for hybridizing these\ntwo quantum systems, is challenging because the interactions between nuclear\nspins and the environment are usually weak in magnitude, and there is also a\nformidable gap between nuclear spin frequencies and optical frequencies. In\nthis work, we propose an opto-nuclear quadrupolar (ONQ) effect, whereby optical\nphotons can be efficiently coupled to nuclear spins, similar to Raman\nscattering. Compared to previous works, ancilla electron spins are not required\nfor the ONQ effect. This leads to advantages such as applicability in\ndefect-free nonmagnetic crystals and longer nuclear spin coherence time. In\naddition, the frequency of the optical photons can be arbitrary, so they can be\nfine-tuned to minimize the material heating and to match telecom wavelengths\nfor long-distance communications. Using perturbation theory and\nfirst-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the ONQ effect is stronger\nby several orders of magnitude than other nonlinear optical effects that could\ncouple to nuclear spins. Based on this rationale, we propose promising\napplications of the ONQ effect, including quantum memory, quantum transduction,\nand materials isotope spectroscopy.

This paper focuses on task-agnostic distillation. It produces a\ncompact pre-trained model that can be easily fine-tuned on various tasks with\nsmall computational costs and memory footprints. Despite the practical\nbenefits, task-agnostic distillation is challenging. Since the teacher model\nhas a significantly larger capacity and stronger representation power than the\nstudent model, it is very difficult for the student to produce predictions that\nmatch the teacher's over a massive amount of open-domain training data. Such a\nlarge prediction discrepancy often diminishes the benefits of knowledge\ndistillation. To address this challenge, we propose Homotopic Distillation\n(HomoDistil), a novel task-agnostic distillation approach equipped with\niterative pruning. Specifically, we initialize the student model from the\nteacher model, and iteratively prune the student's neurons until the target\nwidth is reached. Such an approach maintains a small discrepancy between the\nteacher's and student's predictions throughout the distillation process, which\nensures the effectiveness of knowledge transfer.

The main idea of LLF is to optimize the\nconditional likelihoods of all possible labelings of the data within a\nconstrained space defined by weak signals.

In quantum\nconfined systems, this transformation leads to so-called quantum shape effects\nin the physical properties of confined particles associated with the Dirichlet\nspectrum of the confining medium. Here we show that the geometric couplings\nbetween levels generated by the size-invariant shape transformations cause\nnonuniform scaling in the eigenspectra. In particular, the nonuniform level\nscaling is characterized by two distinct spectral features: lowering of the\nfirst eigenvalue (ground state reduction) and changing of the spectral gaps\n(energy level splitting or degeneracy formation depending on the symmetries).\nWe explain the ground state reduction by the increase in local breadth (i.e.\nparts of the domain becoming less confined) that is associated with the\nsphericity of these local portions of the domain. We accurately quantify the\nsphericity using two different measures: the radius of the inscribed $n$-sphere\nand the Hausdorff distance. Due to Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn inequality, the greater\nthe sphericity, the lower the first eigenvalue. Then, level splitting or\ndegeneracy, depending on the symmetries of the initial configuration, becomes a\ndirect consequence of size-invariance dictating the eigenvalues to have the\nsame asymptotic behavior due to Weyl law. Furthermore, we find that the ground\nstate reduction causes a quantum thermal avalanche which is the underlying\nreason for the peculiar effect of spontaneous transitions to lower entropy\nstates in systems exhibiting the quantum shape effect. Unusual spectral\ncharacteristics of size-preserving transformations can assist in designing\nconfinement geometries that could lead to classically inconceivable quantum\nthermal machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 20:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Non-ergodicity reigns when the time-averaged mean square\ndisplacement $\\mathrm{TA}$-$\\mathrm{MSD}$ differs from the ensemble-averaged\nmean squared displacement $\\mathrm{EA}$-$\\mathrm{MSD}$ even in the limit of\nlong measurement series. In these cases, the typical theoretical results for\nensemble averages cannot be used to understand and interpret data acquired from\ntime averages. The difficulty then lies in obtaining statistical descriptors of\nthe measured diffusion process that are not non-ergodic. We show that linear\ndescriptors such as the standard deviation ($SD$), coefficient of variation\n($CV$), and root mean square ($RMS$) break ergodicity in proportion to\nnon-ergodicity in the diffusion process.

Fairness for multi-label classification, where\neach instance is associated with more than one labels, is still yet to\nestablish.

Decision optimization\n(DO) has classically being practiced by dedicated DO researchers where experts\nneed to spend long periods of time fine tuning a solution through\ntrial-and-error. AutoML pipeline search has sought to make it easier for a data\nscientist to find the best machine learning pipeline by leveraging automation\nto search and tune the solution. More recently, these advances have been\napplied to the domain of AutoDO, with a similar goal to find the best\nreinforcement learning pipeline through algorithm selection and parameter\ntuning. However, Decision Optimization requires significantly more complex\nproblem specification when compared to an ML problem. AutoDOViz seeks to lower\nthe barrier of entry for data scientists in problem specification for\nreinforcement learning problems, leverage the benefits of AutoDO algorithms for\nRL pipeline search and finally, create visualizations and policy insights in\norder to facilitate the typical interactive nature when communicating problem\nformulation and solution proposals between DO experts and domain experts.

Gravastars\nare cold, low entropy, maximally compact objects characterized by a surface\nboundary layer and physical surface tension, instead of an event horizon.\nWithin this thin boundary layer the effective vacuum energy changes rapidly,\nand the interior of a non-rotating gravastar is a non-singular static patch of\nde Sitter space with eq. of state p=-rho.

The surface stress\ntensor on the horizon is determined by a modification of the Lanczos-Israel\njunction conditions for null hypersurfaces, which is applied to rotating\ngravastar solutions as well. The fundamental basis for the quantum phase\ntransition at the horizon is the stress tensor of the conformal anomaly,\ndepending upon a new light scalar field in the low energy effective action for\ngravity. This scalar allows the effective value of the vacuum energy, described\nas a condensate of an exact 4-form abelian gauge field, to change at the\nhorizon. The resulting effective theory thus replaces the fixed constant Lambda\nof classical general relativity, and its apparently unnaturally large\nsensitivity to UV physics, with a dynamical condensate whose ground state value\nin empty flat space is zero identically.

Previous approaches\ncan be categorized as unsupervised physical and supervised deep learning\nmodels. Nevertheless, with physical models able to preserve morphological\ndetails but at the cost of extremely long processing time, existing DL methods\nface challenges of gathering sufficient/qualitative ground truth (GT) for\nrobust training, thus leading to failure in maintaining clinically acceptable\nfalse positive rates. We hereby propose a generalizable yet efficient workflow\nof two stages: (1) training pairs generation with GT bone shadows eliminated in\nby a physical model in spatially transformed gradient fields. (2) fully\nsupervised image denoising network training on stage-one datasets for fast rib\nremoval on incoming CXRs. For step two, we designed a densely connected network\ncalled SADXNet, combined with peak signal to noise ratio and multi-scale\nstructure similarity index measure objective minimization to suppress bony\nstructures. The SADXNet organizes spatial filters in U shape (e.g., X=7;\nfilters = 16, 64, 256, 512, 256, 64, 16) and preserves the feature map\ndimension throughout the network flow. Visually, SADXNet can suppress the rib\nedge and that near the lung wall/vertebra without jeopardizing the\nvessel/abnormality conspicuity. Quantitively, it achieves RMSE of ~0 during\ntesting with one prediction taking <1s. Downstream tasks including lung nodule\ndetection as well as common lung disease classification and localization are\nused to evaluate our proposed rib suppression mechanism. We observed 3.23% and\n6.62% area under the curve (AUC) increase as well as 203 and 385 absolute false\npositive decrease for lung nodule detection and common lung disease\nlocalization, separately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 23:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Buyers often use reviews from other customers that share their\ntype -- such as height for clothing, skin type for skincare products, and\nlocation for outdoor furniture -- to estimate their values, which they may not\nknow a priori. Customers with few relevant reviews may hesitate to make a\npurchase except at a low price, so for the seller, there is a tension between\nsetting high prices and ensuring that there are enough reviews so that buyers\ncan confidently estimate their values. Simultaneously, sellers may use reviews\nto gauge the demand for items they wish to sell.\n  In this work, we study this pricing problem in an online setting where the\nseller interacts with a set of buyers of finitely-many types, one-by-one, over\na series of $T$ rounds. At each round, the seller first sets a price. Then a\nbuyer arrives and examines the reviews of the previous buyers with the same\ntype, which reveal those buyers' ex-post values. Based on the reviews, the\nbuyer decides to purchase if they have good reason to believe that their\nex-ante utility is positive. Crucially, the seller does not know the buyer's\ntype when setting the price, nor even the distribution over types. We provide a\nno-regret algorithm that the seller can use to obtain high revenue. When there\nare $d$ types, after $T$ rounds, our algorithm achieves a problem-independent\n$\\tilde O(T^{2/3}d^{1/3})$ regret bound.

Therefore, it is\nimportant to develop practically meaningful quantum datasets for which we\nexpect quantum methods to be superior. In this paper, we propose a machine\nlearning task that is likely to soon arise in the real world: clustering and\nclassification of quantum circuits. We provide a dataset of quantum circuits\noptimized by the variational quantum eigensolver. We utilized six common types\nof Hamiltonians in condensed matter physics, with a range of 4 to 16 qubits,\nand applied ten different ans\\\"{a}tze with varying depths (ranging from 3 to\n32) to generate a quantum circuit dataset of six distinct classes, each\ncontaining 300 samples.

One avenue of enquiry to prevent cracking would be to realize a\nmaterial that can maintain a stable shape without being solidified.

It is found that the Young's modulus\nincreases rapidly at $\\alpha \\ge 0.6$. We use numerical simulation to show that\nthis sudden increase in the Young's modulus is caused by a rigidity percolation\ntransition. Furthermore, we are able to show that granular slabs containing\ncoated sand have outstanding deformability without collapsing under large\nexternal stress.

This process, known as multi-view pooling, creates\na communication bottleneck due to multi-access by many devices. To alleviate\nthis issue, we propose a task-oriented simultaneous access scheme for\ndistributed sensing called Over-the-Air Pooling (AirPooling). The existing\nOver-the-Air Computing (AirComp) technique can be directly applied to enable\nAverage-AirPooling by exploiting the waveform superposition property of a\nmulti-access channel. However, despite being most popular in practice, the\nover-the-air maximization, called Max-AirPooling, is not AirComp realizable as\nAirComp addresses a limited subset of functions. We tackle the challenge by\nproposing the novel generalized AirPooling framework that can be configured to\nsupport both Max- and Average-AirPooling by controlling a configuration\nparameter. The former is realized by adding to AirComp the designed\npre-processing at devices and post-processing at the server. To characterize\nthe end-to-end sensing performance, the theory of classification margin is\napplied to relate the classification accuracy and the AirPooling error.\nFurthermore, the analysis reveals an inherent tradeoff of Max-AirPooling\nbetween the accuracy of the pooling-function approximation and the\neffectiveness of noise suppression. Using the tradeoff, we optimize the\nconfiguration parameter of Max-AirPooling, yielding a sub-optimal closed-form\nmethod of adaptive parametric control. Experimental results obtained on\nreal-world datasets show that AirPooling provides sensing accuracies close to\nthose achievable by the traditional digital air interface but dramatically\nreduces the communication latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 05:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Phonon\nmodes including the dispersion relation, the density of state, and the\nparticipation ratio are calculated for six GaN superlattices.

In topological\nphonon analyses, it is found that single Weyl phonons are present in all six\nGaN superlattice structures consisting of the trivial (GaN) and nontrivial (AlN\nand AlGaN) combinations and are located at two sides of the kz=0 plane\nsymmetrically in the Brillouin zone.

Despite being a\nrecurring theme in engineering scenarios, the mechanism of boundary layer\ntransition caused by distributed roughness is not well understood, and\nconsequently, methods for mitigating its effects are scarce. In this work, we\npresent a passive method for delaying boundary layer transition caused by\ndistributed roughness (sandpaper strip) using a combination of secondary fine\nroughness strips placed immediately upstream and downstream of the distributed\nroughness. Hot-wire and PIV measurements are used to characterize the flow\nfeatures and quantify transition delay. A combination of secondary roughness\nstrips placed both upstream and downstream is shown to be most effective in\ndelaying transition caused by the primary distributed roughness. Results\nsuggest that the upstream roughness lifts the boundary layer reducing the\neffective Reynolds number of the primary roughness, while the downstream\nroughness reduces the strength of vortices shed from the primary roughness. A\nparametric study on the length and type of secondary roughness shows that\nsmooth strips can also delay the transition and there is likely an optimal\nlength of the secondary roughness beyond which increasing the extent of the\ndownstream roughness has marginal effects on transition delay. Finally, after\nthe onset of transition, there are no specific signatures in the flow\ncorresponding to the secondary roughness which suggests that the secondary\nroughness can delay transition without substantially altering the transitional\nflow features. The results point to an adaptable and practical method for\nincreasing the life cycle and efficiency of aerodynamic surfaces with\ndistributed roughness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 06:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

However, these methods are\noften susceptible to outliers and do not effectively model anomalies, leading\nto suboptimal results. This paper presents a novel approach for unsupervised\nanomaly detection, called the Cooperative Network Time Series (CNTS) approach.\nThe CNTS system consists of two components: a detector and a reconstructor. The\ndetector is responsible for directly detecting anomalies, while the\nreconstructor provides reconstruction information to the detector and updates\nits learning based on anomalous information received from the detector. The\ncentral aspect of CNTS is a multi-objective optimization problem, which is\nsolved through a cooperative solution strategy. Experiments on three real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CNTS and confirm the\ncooperative effectiveness of the detector and reconstructor.

Recent MI attacks leverage a generative adversarial network (GAN) as an\nimage prior to narrow the search space, and can successfully reconstruct even\nthe high-dimensional data (e.g., face images). However, these generative MI\nattacks do not fully exploit the potential capabilities of the target model,\nstill leading to a vague and coupled search space, i.e., different classes of\nimages are coupled in the search space. Besides, the widely used cross-entropy\nloss in these attacks suffers from gradient vanishing. To address these\nproblems, we propose Pseudo Label-Guided MI (PLG-MI) attack via conditional GAN\n(cGAN). At first, a top-n selection strategy is proposed to provide\npseudo-labels for public data, and use pseudo-labels to guide the training of\nthe cGAN. In this way, the search space is decoupled for different classes of\nimages. Then a max-margin loss is introduced to improve the search process on\nthe subspace of a target class.

In\naddition, by using the controllable polyp masks, polyps with various\ncharacteristics can be generated from one input condition. The generated polyp\nimages can be used directly as training images for polyp detection and\nsegmentation without additional labeling. To quantitatively assess the quality\nof generated synthetic polyps, we use public polyp image and video datasets\ncombined with the generated synthetic images to examine the performance\nimprovement of several detection and segmentation models. Experimental results\nshow that we obtain performance gains when the generated polyp images are added\nto the training set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 08:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

While reparative\nmeasures, such as apologies, are often considered as possible strategic\ninteractions, the explicit evolution of the emotion of guilt as a behavioural\nphenotype is not yet well understood. Here, we study the co-evolution of social\nand non-social guilt of homogeneous or heterogeneous populations, including\nwell-mixed, lattice and scale-free networks. Socially aware guilt comes at a\ncost, as it requires agents to make demanding efforts to observe and understand\nthe internal state and behaviour of others, while non-social guilt only\nrequires the awareness of the agents' own state and hence incurs no social\ncost. Those choosing to be non-social are however more sensitive to\nexploitation by other agents due to their social unawareness. Resorting to\nmethods from evolutionary game theory, we study analytically, and through\nextensive numerical and agent-based simulations, whether and how such social\nand non-social guilt can evolve and deploy, depending on the underlying\nstructure of the populations, or systems, of agents. The results show that, in\nboth lattice and scale-free networks, emotional guilt prone strategies are\ndominant for a larger range of the guilt and social costs incurred, compared to\nthe well-mixed population setting, leading therefore to significantly higher\nlevels of cooperation for a wider range of the costs. In structured population\nsettings, both social and non-social guilt can evolve and deploy through\nclustering with emotional prone strategies, allowing them to be protected from\nexploiters, especially in case of non-social (less costly) strategies. Overall,\nour findings provide important insights into the design and engineering of\nself-organised and distributed cooperative multi-agent systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 09:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

When\ngravitational-wave lensing observations become possible, our method can provide\na powerful tool for studying complex lens configurations, including dark matter\nsubhalos and MACHOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 10:01:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 02:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

The proposed method\ncombines two key techniques.

Secondly, the temperature dependence of\nthe coupling constants $g_{\\omega N N}(T)$, $g_{\\omega \\Delta \\Delta}(T)$ and\n$g_{\\omega N \\Delta}(T)$ has been plotted. Comparing $g_{\\omega N N}(T)$ with\nthe coupling constant $g_{\\rho NN}(T)$, it obtained that the isospin symmetry\nof the omega meson is not violated at the finite temperature.

However, the assumption that the ground-truth label is\nalways among the candidate label set would be unrealistic, as the reliability\nof the candidate label sets in real-world applications cannot be guaranteed by\nannotators. Therefore, a generalized PLL named Unreliable Partial Label\nLearning (UPLL) is proposed, in which the true label may not be in the\ncandidate label set. Due to the challenges posed by unreliable labeling,\nprevious PLL methods will experience a marked decline in performance when\napplied to UPLL. To address the issue, we propose a two-stage framework named\nUnreliable Partial Label Learning with Recursive Separation (UPLLRS). In the\nfirst stage, the self-adaptive recursive separation strategy is proposed to\nseparate the training set into a reliable subset and an unreliable subset. In\nthe second stage, a disambiguation strategy is employed to progressively\nidentify the ground-truth labels in the reliable subset. Simultaneously,\nsemi-supervised learning methods are adopted to extract valuable information\nfrom the unreliable subset.

If compact enough, General Relativity modifies Maxwell's\nequations, leading to changes in the interior and exterior electromagnetic\nsolutions. We present analytic solutions for a slowly-rotating magnetized\nneutron star that include the frame-dragging correction to the magnetic field\ncomponents. For typical compactness values, i.e. $R_s \\sim 0.5 [R_*]$, we show\nthat the new terms account for a $0.43\\%$ decrease in magnetic field strength\nat the equator and an average $1\\%$ vectorial angle correction, both compared\nto the case without the magnetic frame-dragging correction. This correction\nleads to a self-consistent redistribution of the surface azimuthal current. We\ntested the validity of the derived solution by prescribing it as an initial\nvalue problem to two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We observe a\nlower early-stage transient amplitude which reflects the proximity between the\nderived and exact solutions. At later times, our solution reduces the azimuthal\nelectric field amplitude by almost an order of magnitude, demonstrating that\nsimulations are more accurate at the expense of a more involved initialization.\nWe show that this can potentially lead to a reduction of simulation runtimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 11:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Our experiments consider seven\ntraditional bag-of-words and seven BERT-based IR approaches, as well as\nnineteen state-of-the-art QPPs evaluated on two collections, Deep Learning '19\nand Robust '04. Our findings show that QPPs perform statistically significantly\nworse on neural IR systems. In settings where semantic signals are prominent\n(e.g., passage retrieval), their performance on neural models drops by as much\nas 10% compared to bag-of-words approaches. On top of that, in lexical-oriented\nscenarios, QPPs fail to predict performance for neural IR systems on those\nqueries where they differ from traditional approaches the most.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 12:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Recently, nonmetallic nanoparticles have become one of the growth seed\ncandidates because of their high melting points and fewer metal impurities. In\nthis study, by using nanodiamond-derived carbon nanoparticles as the solid\ngrowth seeds, we investigated the effect of CO2 and H2O on high-temperature\nSWCNT growth with two types of carbon-source supplies: C2H2 and C2H4. In this\ngrowth system, H2O showed oxidizing ability to etch a-C with either carbon\nsources. CO2 exhibited a similar a-C formation-preventing role in C2H4-supplied\ngrowth and achieved higher-purity SWCNTs with higher concentration of C2H4 than\nthe case of H2O. However, in contrast to the other combinations, CO2 injection\nin the C2H2-supplied growth significantly enhanced the formation of a-C rather\nthan the removal of it while the yield of SWCNTs was also increased, indicating\nthe occurrence of the dehydration reaction between CO2 and C2H2. The present\nfindings will lead to efficient growth of high-quality SWCNTs from nonmetallic\ngrowth seeds with the use of growth enhancers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 12:37:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 01:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

The center line slope (CLS) method is one of such\napproaches, which aims to extract the time correlation function (TCF) from 2DES\nwith minimal error. Since static disorder is widely observed in complex\nsystems, it may be interesting to ask whether the CLS approach still work in\nthe presence of the static disorder. In this paper, the effect of the static\ndisorder on the TCF obtained through the CLS method is investigated. It is\nfound that the steady-state value of the CLS increases monotonically with\nrespect to the static disorder, which suggests that the amplitude of the static\ndisorder can be determined using the CLS in the long-time limit. Additionally,\nas the static disorder rises, the decay rate of the CLS first decreases to a\ncertain value and remains at this value until the static disorder is\nsufficiently large. Afterward, the CLS begins to fluctuate significantly and\nthus results in obtaining the decay rate through the CLS method unreliable.\nBased on these discoveries, we propose a method to fix the error and obtain the\nTCF.

However, discerning small motion from\nnoise is a complex task, especially when attempting to magnify very subtle,\noften sub-pixel movement. As a result, motion magnification techniques\ngenerally suffer from noisy and blurry outputs. This work presents a new\nstate-of-the-art model based on the Swin Transformer, which offers better\ntolerance to noisy inputs as well as higher-quality outputs that exhibit less\nnoise, blurriness, and artifacts than prior-art.

There is now a good number of open source and proprietary clone\ndetectors for programs written in traditional programming languages. However,\nthe increasing adoption of deep learning models in software poses a challenge\nto these tools: these models implement functions that are inscrutable black\nboxes. As more software includes these DNN functions, new techniques are needed\nin order to assess the similarity between deep learning components of software.\nPrevious work has unveiled techniques for comparing the representations learned\nat various layers of deep neural network models by feeding canonical inputs to\nthe models. Our goal is to be able to compare DNN functions when canonical\ninputs are not available -- because they may not be in many application\nscenarios. The challenge, then, is to generate appropriate inputs and to\nidentify a metric that, for those inputs, is capable of representing the degree\nof functional similarity between two comparable DNN functions.\n  Our approach uses random input with values between -1 and 1, in a shape that\nis compatible with what the DNN models expect. We then compare the outputs by\nperforming correlation analysis. Our study shows how it is possible to perform\nsimilarity analysis even in the absence of meaningful canonical inputs. The\nresponse to random inputs of two comparable DNN functions exposes those\nfunctions' similarity, or lack thereof. Of all the metrics tried, we find that\nSpearman's rank correlation coefficient is the most powerful and versatile,\nalthough in special cases other methods and metrics are more expressive. We\npresent a systematic empirical study comparing the effectiveness of several\nsimilarity metrics using a dataset of 56,355 classifiers collected from GitHub.\nThis is accompanied by a sensitivity analysis that reveals how certain models'\ntraining related properties affect the effectiveness of the similarity metrics.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows how\nsimilarity of DNN functions can be detected by using random inputs. Our study\nof correlation metrics, and the identification of Spearman correlation\ncoefficient as the most powerful among them for this purpose, establishes a\ncomplete and practical method for DNN clone detection that can be used in the\ndesign of new tools. It may also serve as inspiration for other program\nanalysis tasks whose approaches break in the presence of DNN components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 14:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

The Stream API introduces two key abstractions. The\nstream, which is a sequence of elements available in a data source, and the\nstream pipeline, which contains operations (e.g., map, filter, reduce) that are\napplied to the elements in the stream upon execution. Streams are getting\npopular among Java developers as they leverage the conciseness of functional\nprogramming and ease the parallelization of data processing.\n  Despite the benefits of streams, in comparison to data processing relying on\nimperative code, streams can introduce significant overheads which are mainly\ncaused by extra object allocations and reclamations, and the use of virtual\nmethod calls. As a result, developers need means to study the runtime behavior\nof streams in the goal of both mitigating such abstraction overheads and\noptimizing stream processing. Unfortunately, there is a lack of dedicated tools\nable to dynamically analyze streams to help developers specifically locate\nissues degrading application performance.\n  In this paper, we address the profiling and optimization of streams. We\npresent a novel profiling technique for measuring the computations performed by\na stream in terms of elapsed reference cycles, which we use to locate\nproblematic streams with a major impact on application performance. While\naccuracy is crucial to this end, the inserted instrumentation code causes the\nexecution of extra cycles, which are partially included in the profiles. To\nmitigate this issue, we estimate and compensate for the extra cycles caused by\nthe inserted instrumentation code.\n  We implement our approach in StreamProf that, to the best of our knowledge,\nis the first dedicated stream profiler for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). With\nStreamProf, we find that cycle profiling is effective to detect problematic\nstreams whose optimization can enable significant performance gains. We also\nfind that the accurate profiling of tasks supporting parallel stream processing\nallows the diagnosis of load imbalance according to the distribution of\nstream-related cycles at a thread level.\n  We conduct an evaluation on sequential and parallel stream-based workloads\nthat are publicly available in three different sources. The evaluation shows\nthat our profiling technique is efficient and yields accurate profiles.\nMoreover, we show the actionability of our profiles by guiding stream-related\noptimizations on two workloads from Renaissance. Our optimizations require the\nmodification of only a few lines of code while achieving speedups up to a\nfactor of 5x.\n  Java streams have been extensively studied by recent work, focusing on both\nhow developers are using streams and how to optimize them. Current approaches\nin the optimization of streams mainly rely on static analysis techniques that\noverlook runtime information, suffer from important limitations to detect all\nstreams executed by a Java application, or are not suitable for the analysis of\nparallel streams. Understanding the dynamic behavior of both sequential and\nparallel stream processing and its impact on application performance is crucial\nto help users make better decisions while using streams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 14:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

To understand this, we first dive deep into the denoised training\nprotocol of diffusion-based sequence generative models and determine their\nthree severe problems, i.e., 1) failing to learn, 2) lack of scalability, and\n3) neglecting source conditions. We argue that these problems can be boiled\ndown to the pitfall of the not completely eliminated discreteness in the\nembedding space, and the scale of noises is decisive herein.

Since launched on 2021 March 22, the 1U-sized CubeSat GRBAlpha operates\nand collects scientific data on high-energy transients, making it the smallest\nastrophysical space observatory to date.

As it was demonstrated in a companion paper, GRBAlpha adds\nsignificant value to the scientific community with accurate characterization of\nbright GRBs, including the recent outstanding event of GRB 221009A. Methods.\nThe GRB detector is a 75x75x5 mm CsI(Tl) scintillator wrapped in a reflective\nfoil (ESR) read out by an array of SiPM detectors, multi-pixel photon counters\nby Hamamatsu, driven by two separate, redundant units. To further protect the\nscintillator block from sunlight and protect the SiPM detectors from particle\nradiation, we apply a multi-layer structure of Tedlar wrapping, anodized\naluminium casing and a lead-alloy shielding on one edge of the assembly. The\nsetup allows observations of gamma radiation within the energy range of 70-890\nkeV with an energy resolution of ~30%. Results.

For this reason, much research has gone into the\ntransformation and optimisation of this family of functions, in particular\nthose written in continuation passing style (CPS).\n  Though the CPS transformation, capable of transforming any recursive function\nto an equivalent tail recursive one, is deeply problematic in the context of\nreversible programming (as it relies on troublesome features such as\nhigher-order functions), we argue that relaxing (local) reversibility to\n(global) invertibility drastically improves the situation. On this basis, we\npresent an algorithm for tail recursion conversion specifically for invertible\nfunctions. The key insight is that functions introduced by program\ntransformations that preserve invertibility, need only be invertible in the\ncontext in which the functions subject of transformation calls them. We show\nhow a bespoke data type, corresponding to such a context, can be used to\ntransform invertible recursive functions into a pair of tail recursive function\nacting on this context, in a way where calls are highlighted, and from which a\ntail recursive inverse can be straightforwardly extracted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 15:54:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 08:25:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 12:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Since the publication of \"Design Patterns\" by Gamma et\nal. in 1994, there have been hundreds of books published about design /\nsoftware patterns, thousands of published pattern languages, and tens of\nthousands of published patterns. \"Notes,\" published in 1964, was quickly\nfollowed by one of Alexander's most important essays, \"A City is Not a Tree,\"\nin which he repudiates the formal method described in \"Notes,\" and his Preface\nto the paperback edition of \"Notes\" in 1971 repeats the repudiation. For many\nclose readers of Alexander, this discontinuity is startling and unexplained.\nWhen I finally read \"Notes\" in 2015, I was struck by the detailed worked\nexample, along with a peculiar mathematical treatment of the method, and a hint\nthat the modularization presented in the example was reckoned by a computer\nprogram he had written -- all in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

By engaging in hermeneutics and software archeology,\nI was able to uncover / discover the trajectory of his thinking as he\nencountered failures and setbacks with his computer programs. My attempted\nreplication also failed, and that led me to try to unearth the five different\nprograms he wrote, understand them, and figure out how one led to the next.\nThey are not described in published papers, only in internal reports. My search\nfor these reports led to their being made available on the Net.\n  What I found in my voyage were the early parts of a chain of thought that\nstarted with cybernetics, mathematics, and a plain-spoken computer; passed\nthrough \"A City is Not a Tree\"; paused to \"make God appear in the middle of a\nfield\"; and ended with this fundamental design goal: **I try to make the volume\nof the building so that it carries in it all feeling.

This article further points out\nsome of the wrong treatment of mathematics in the book of Weinberg, and\nreformulates them, including: Wigner's classification needs to be pass to the\nuniversal cover via Bargmann's theorem, there is no projective representation\nof Poincare group on Fock space in general, the Lorentz transformation of\nfields need to be formulated with representations of the universal covers,\nDirac representation is not a linear representation of the Lorentz group. This\narticle also discusses the physical meaning of the state representation and its\nrelation with Schrodinger equation, compare its difference with state\nrepresentation, and the reason of equations of relativistic quantum mechanics\nshould be understood as a field equation rather than a wave function equation.\nof equations of relativistic quantum mechanics should be understood as a field\nequation rather than a wave function equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 15:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

The cosmological constant has been reintroduced as a free parameter\nwith a value in energy density units that ``happens'' to be of the same order\nas the present matter energy density. There is an internal inconsistency with\nregards to the Hubble constant, the so-called $H_0$ tension. The derived value\nof $H_0$ depends on the type of data that is used. With supernovae as standard\ncandles one gets a $H_0$ that is 4-5 $\\sigma$ larger than the value that one\ngets from CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) data for the early universe. Here\nwe show that these problems are related and can be solved if the cosmological\nconstant represents a covariant integration constant that arises from a spatial\nboundary condition, instead of being a new type of hypothetical physical field,\n``dark energy'', as assumed by standard cosmology. The boundary condition only\napplies to the bounded 3D subspace that represents the observable universe, the\nhypersurface of the past light cone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 10:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

In this paper, we propose a time-varying\nresource relationship graph to model the intertwined impact of the perception,\ncomputation, communication and storage resources across multiple snapshots on\nthe content dissemination process of IoV. Based on this graph model, the\ncontent dissemination process is modeled as a mathematical optimization\nproblem, where the quality of service of both delay tolerant and delay\nsensitive services are considered.

Moreover, a robust resource management\nalgorithm is developed for the power and flow control subproblem, where the\nchannel uncertainties in future snapshots are fully considered in the\nalgorithm.

Nevertheless, the rise of those networks\nin modern computing has been accompanied by concerns regarding their\nvulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel\ngradient-free, gray box, incremental attack that targets the training process\nof neural networks. The proposed attack, which implicitly poisons the\nintermediate data structures that retain the training instances between\ntraining epochs acquires its high-risk property from attacking data structures\nthat are typically unobserved by professionals. Hence, the attack goes\nunnoticed despite the damage it can cause. Moreover, the attack can be executed\nwithout the attackers' knowledge of the neural network structure or training\ndata making it more dangerous. The attack was tested under a sensitive\napplication of secure cognitive cities, namely, biometric authentication. The\nconducted experiments showed that the proposed attack is effective and\nstealthy. Finally, the attack effectiveness property was concluded from the\nfact that it was able to flip the sign of the loss gradient in the conducted\nexperiments to become positive, which indicated noisy and unstable training.\nMoreover, the attack was able to decrease the inference probability in the\npoisoned networks compared to their unpoisoned counterparts by 15.37%, 14.68%,\nand 24.88% for the Densenet, VGG, and Xception, respectively.

A\nparadigm of scheduled supply that is aware of demand but not on-demand is\nproposed, introducing coordination and social and behavioral understanding,\nurban cognition and empowerment of agents, into a novel informational\nframework. Daily routines and other patterns of spatial behaviors outline a\nfundamental demand layer in a supply-oriented paradigm that captures urban\ndynamics and spatial-temporal behaviors, mostly in groups. Rather than\nreal-time requests and instant responses that reward unplanned actions, and\nbeyond just reservation of travels in timetables, the intention is to capture\nmobility flows in scheduled travels along the day considering time of day,\nplaces, passengers etc. Regulating goal-directed behaviors and caring for\nservice resources and the overall system welfare is proposed to minimize\nuncertainty, considering the capacity of mobility interactions to hold value,\ni.e., Motility as a Service (MaaS). The principal-agent problem in the smart\ncity is a problem of collective action among service providers and users that\ncreate expectations based on previous actions and reactions in mutual systems.\nPlanned behavior that accounts for service coordination is expected to\nstabilize excessive rides and traffic load, and to induce a cognitive gain,\nthus balancing information load and facilitating cognitive effort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 10:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-08"}
