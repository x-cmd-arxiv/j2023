In this paper, Metaball-function based\nsolutions are proposed for morphological characterization and generation of\nthree-dimensional realistic particles according to the X-ray Computed\nTomography (XRCT) images. For characterization, we develop a geometric-based\nMetaball-Imaging algorithm. This algorithm can capture the main contour of\nparental particles with a series of non-overlapping spheres and refine\nsurface-texture details through gradient search. Four types of particles,\nhundreds of samples, are applied for evaluations. The result shows good matches\non key morphological indicators(i.e., volume, surface area, sphericity,\ncircularity, corey-shape factor, nominal diameter and surface-equivalent-sphere\ndiameter), confirming its characterization precision. For generation, we\npropose the Metaball Variational Autoencoder. Assisted by deep neural networks,\nthis method can generate 3D particles in Metaball form, while retaining\ncoessential morphological features with parental particles. Additionally, this\nmethod allows for control over the generated shapes through an arithmetic\npattern, enabling the generation of particles with specific shapes. Two sets of\nXRCT images different in sample number and geometric features are chosen as\nparental data. On each training set, one thousand particles are generated for\nvalidations. The generation fidelity is demonstrated through comparisons of\nmorphologies and shape-feature distributions between generated and parental\nparticles. Examples are also provided to demonstrate controllability on the\ngenerated shapes. With Metaball-based simulations frameworks previously\nproposed by the authors, these methods have the potential to provide valuable\ninsights into the properties and behavior of actual geological particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 13:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

The Fourier spectra of the meandering\nperiod Miras have no prominent additional peaks, suggesting that additional\npulsation modes are not the cause of the meandering periods. We confirm that\nbumps are more common among S and C Miras and show, for the first time, that\nMiras with bumps have lower mass-loss rates than those with regular, symmetric\nlight curves. Also Miras with meandering period changes have relatively little\nmass loss. We conclude that Miras with strongly changing periods or asymmetries\nin their light curves have relatively low dust mass-loss rates. Meandering\nperiod changes and light curve asymmetries could be connected to He-shell\nflashes and third dredge-up episodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 17:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

An orientation of $G$ is formed by orienting all the undirected edges of\n$G$, i.e., converting each undirected edge $\\{u,v\\}$ into a directed edge that\nis either $(u,v)$ or $(v,u)$. The problem of finding an orientation of a mixed\ngraph that makes it strongly connected is well understood and can be solved in\nlinear time. Here we introduce the following orientation problem in mixed\ngraphs. Given a mixed graph $G$, we wish to compute its maximal sets of\nvertices $C_1,C_2,\\ldots,C_k$ with the property that by removing any edge $e$\nfrom $G$ (directed or undirected), there is an orientation $R_i$ of\n$G\\setminus{e}$ such that all vertices in $C_i$ are strongly connected in\n$R_i$. We discuss properties of those sets, and we show how to solve this\nproblem in linear time by reducing it to the computation of the $2$-edge\ntwinless strongly connected components of a directed graph. A directed graph\n$G=(V,E)$ is twinless strongly connected if it contains a strongly connected\nspanning subgraph without any pair of antiparallel (or twin) edges. The\ntwinless strongly connected components (TSCCs) of a directed graph $G$ are its\nmaximal twinless strongly connected subgraphs.

It is commonly assumed that I(V) data interpretation is a\nproblem in emission physics and related electrostatics. Many experimentalists\nthen apply Fowler-Nordheim plot methodology, developed in 1929. However, with\nmodern emitting materials this 90-year-old interpretation methodology often\nfails (maybe in nearly 50% of cases), and yields spurious values for\ncharacterization parameters, particularly field enhancement factors. This has\ngenerated an unreliable literature, and validity checks on experimental I(V)\ndata are nearly always needed before use. A new check, supplementing existing\nchecks, is described. Twelve different \"system complications\" that, acting\nsingly or in combinations, can cause validity-check failure are identified. A\ntop-level path forwards from this unsatisfactory situation is proposed. The\nterm \"field electron emission system (FE system)\" is defined to include all\naspects of an experimental system that affect the measured I(V)\ncharacteristics. The analysis of FE systems should now be regarded as a\nspecialized form of electronic/electrical engineering, provisionally called \"FE\nSystems Engineering\". In this approach, the I(V) relationship is split: (a) the\ncurrent is expressed as a function I(F_C) of the local surface-field magnitude\nF_C at some defined emitter surface location \"C\"; and (b) the relationship\nbetween F_C and measured voltage V is expressed and determined separately.\nDetermining I(F_C) is mostly a problem in emission physics; determining the\nrelationship (F_C)(V) depends on system electrostatics and (for systems failing\na validity check) on other aspects of FE Systems Engineering. The scope of FE\nSystems Engineering, and some related research implications and problems, are\noutlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 19:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

The\nConvolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have performed well in this domain for many\nyears, and until recently an alternative network architecture, namely\nTransformer, has demonstrated even stronger performance. One can attribute its\nsuperiority to the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism, which offers a\nlarger receptive field and better input content adaptability than CNNs.\nHowever, as MHSA demands high computational costs that grow quadratically with\nrespect to the input resolution, it becomes impractical for high-resolution\nimage deblurring tasks. In this work, we propose a unified lightweight CNN\nnetwork that features a large effective receptive field (ERF) and demonstrates\ncomparable or even better performance than Transformers while bearing less\ncomputational costs. Our key design is an efficient CNN block dubbed LaKD,\nequipped with a large kernel depth-wise convolution and spatial-channel mixing\nstructure, attaining comparable or larger ERF than Transformers but with a\nsmaller parameter scale. Specifically, we achieve +0.17dB / +0.43dB PSNR over\nthe state-of-the-art Restormer on defocus / motion deblurring benchmark\ndatasets with 32% fewer parameters and 39% fewer MACs. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our network and the effectiveness of\neach module.

Motivated by the LLG issue\nresulting from the use of labels during training, we propose the Generative\nAdversarial Federated Model (GAFM), a novel method designed specifically to\nenhance label privacy protection by integrating splitNN with Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs). GAFM leverages GANs to indirectly utilize label\ninformation by learning the label distribution rather than relying on explicit\nlabels, thereby mitigating LLG. GAFM also employs an additional cross-entropy\nloss based on the noisy labels to further improve the prediction accuracy. Our\nablation experiment demonstrates that the combination of GAN and the\ncross-entropy loss component is necessary to enable GAFM to mitigate LLG\nwithout significantly compromising the model utility. Empirical results on\nvarious datasets show that GAFM achieves a better and more robust trade-off\nbetween model utility and privacy compared to all baselines across multiple\nrandom runs. In addition, we provide experimental justification to substantiate\nGAFM's superiority over splitNN, demonstrating that it offers enhanced label\nprotection through gradient perturbation relative to splitNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 21:18:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 02:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

However, it is not possible to know\nthe number of inequalities apriori from problem data. To address this gap, this\ncontribution presents two computationally efficient methods to obtain upper\nbounds on the complexity of the MAS. The first method is algebraic and is based\non matrix power series, while the second is geometric and is based on Lyapunov\nanalysis. The two methods are rigorously introduced, a detailed numerical\ncomparison between the two is provided, and an extension to systems with\nconstant inputs is presented.

One aim here is to illustrate how that\nambiguity -- or, more positively, freedom of choice -- may arise. Using the\nbasic idea that information equals the average reduction in uncertainty when\ngoing from an initial to a final probability distribution, synergistic\ninformation will likewise be defined as a difference between two entropies. One\nterm is uncontroversial and characterizes ``the whole'' information that source\nvariables carry jointly about a target variable $\\varT$. The other term then is\nmeant to characterize the information carried by the ``sum of its parts.'' Here\nwe interpret that concept as needing a suitable probability distribution\naggregated (``pooled'') from multiple marginal distributions (the parts).\nAmbiguity arises in the definition of the optimum way to pool two (or more)\nprobability distributions. Independent of the exact definition of optimum\npooling, the concept of pooling leads to a lattice that differs from the\noften-used redundancy-based lattice. One can associate not just a number (an\naverage entropy) with each node of the lattice, but (pooled) probability\ndistributions. As an example,one simple and reasonable approach to pooling is\npresented, which naturally gives rise to the overlap between different\nprobability distributions as being a crucial quantity that characterizes both\nsynergistic and unique information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 22:36:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 18:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

In this work, we use a\nknowledge base of 29,900 solid-state synthesis recipes, text-mined from the\nscientific literature, to automatically learn which precursors to recommend for\nthe synthesis of a novel target material. The data-driven approach learns\nchemical similarity of materials and refers the synthesis of a new target to\nprecedent synthesis procedures of similar materials, mimicking human synthesis\ndesign. When proposing five precursor sets for each of 2,654 unseen test target\nmaterials, the recommendation strategy achieves a success rate of at least 82%.\nOur approach captures decades of heuristic synthesis data in a mathematical\nform, making it accessible for use in recommendation engines and autonomous\nlaboratories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 04:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 23:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

In this paper, we propose\na two-stage model to predict the true labels for multicategory classification\ntasks in crowdsourcing. In the first stage, we fit the observed labels with a\nlatent factor model and incorporate subgroup structures for both tasks and\nworkers through a multi-centroid grouping penalty. Group-specific rotations are\nintroduced to align workers with different task categories to solve\nmulticategory crowdsourcing tasks. In the second stage, we propose a\nconcordance-based approach to identify high-quality worker subgroups who are\nrelied upon to assign labels to tasks. In theory, we show the estimation\nconsistency of the latent factors and the prediction consistency of the\nproposed method. The simulation studies show that the proposed method\noutperforms the existing competitive methods, assuming the subgroup structures\nwithin tasks and workers.

While many\ntechniques for model fairness have been proposed, most of them assume that the\ntraining and deployment data distributions are identical, which is often not\ntrue in practice. In particular, when the bias between labels and sensitive\ngroups changes, the fairness of the trained model is directly influenced and\ncan worsen. We make two contributions for solving this problem. First, we\nanalytically show that existing in-processing fair algorithms have fundamental\nlimits in accuracy and group fairness. We introduce the notion of correlation\nshifts, which can explicitly capture the change of the above bias. Second, we\npropose a novel pre-processing step that samples the input data to reduce\ncorrelation shifts and thus enables the in-processing approaches to overcome\ntheir limitations. We formulate an optimization problem for adjusting the data\nratio among labels and sensitive groups to reflect the shifted correlation. A\nkey benefit of our approach lies in decoupling the roles of pre- and\nin-processing approaches: correlation adjustment via pre-processing and\nunfairness mitigation on the processed data via in-processing.

However, due to their constrained\nnature, novel mechanisms are required to provide external, and non-intrusive\nanomaly detection. Among such approaches, one that has gained traction is based\non the analysis of the electromagnetic (EM) signals that get emanated during a\ndevice's operation. However, one of the most neglected challenges of this\napproach is the requirement for manually gathering and fingerprinting the\nsignals that correspond to each execution path of the software/firmware.\nIndeed, even simple programs are comprised of hundreds if not thousands of\nbranches thus, making the fingerprinting stage an extremely time-consuming\nprocess that involves the manual labor of a human specialist. To address this\nissue, we propose a framework for generating synthetic EM signals directly from\nthe machine code. The synthetic signals can be used to train a Machine Learning\nbased (ML) system for anomaly detection. The main advantage of the proposed\napproach is that it completely removes the need for an elaborate and\nerror-prone fingerprinting stage, thus, dramatically increasing the scalability\nof the corresponding protection mechanisms. The experimental evaluations\nindicate that our method provides high detection accuracy (above 90% AUC score)\nwhen employed for the detection of injection attacks.

Under certain conditions this leads to \"quasi-coherent\" emission. It\nis believed that the weakly-relativistic electron-cyclotron-maser instability\nis responsible for this kind of radiation.

To get a better quantitative understanding of the\nphysical mechanics at play in ice melting in salty water, we numerically\ninvestigate the lateral melting of an ice block in stably stratified saline\nwater, using a realistic, nonlinear equation of state (EOS). The developing ice\nshape from our numerical results shows good agreement with the experiments and\ntheory from Huppert & Turner (J. Fluid Mech. 100, 367 (1980)). Furthermore, we\nfind that the melt rate of ice depends non-monotonically on the mean ambient\nsalinity: It first decreases for increasing salt concentration until a local\nminimum is attained, and then increases again. This non-monotonic behavior of\nthe ice melt rate is due to the competition among salinity-driven buoyancy,\ntemperature-driven buoyancy, and salinity-induced stratification. We develop a\ntheoretical model based on the energy balance which gives a prediction of the\nsalt concentration for which the melt rate is minimal, and is consistent with\nour data.

Numerous\ncontrol policies for quantum gate design have been proposed given a dynamical\nmodel of the quantum system of interest. However, a quantum system is often\nhighly sensitive to noise, and obtaining its accurate modeling can be difficult\nfor many practical applications. Thus, the control policy based on a quantum\nsystem model may be unpractical for quantum gate design. Also, quantum\nmeasurements collapse quantum states, which makes it challenging to obtain\ninformation through measurements during the control process. In this paper, we\npropose a novel training framework using deep reinforcement learning for\nmodel-free quantum control.

For conditional DDPMs, most existing\npractices relate conditions only to the reverse process and fit it to the\nreversal of unconditional forward process.

The recent emergence\nof large language models such as GPT has created the need for new approaches to\nexploit data-parallelism. Among these, fully-sharded data parallel (FSDP)\ntraining is highly popular, yet it still encounters scalability bottlenecks.\nOne reason is that applying compression techniques to FSDP is challenging: as\nthe vast majority of the communication involves the model's weights, direct\ncompression alters convergence and leads to accuracy loss. We present QSDP, a\nvariant of FSDP which supports both gradient and weight quantization with\ntheoretical guarantees, is simple to implement and has essentially no\noverheads. To derive QSDP we prove that a natural modification of SGD achieves\nconvergence even when we only maintain quantized weights, and thus the domain\nover which we train consists of quantized points and is, therefore, highly\nnon-convex. We validate this approach by training GPT-family models with up to\n1.3 billion parameters on a multi-node cluster. Experiments show that QSDP\npreserves model accuracy, while completely removing the communication\nbottlenecks of FSDP, providing end-to-end speedups of up to 2.2x.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 14:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

In addition, a physically sensible stress behavior\nof the model is ensured by using analytical growth terms, as well as\nnormalization terms which ensure the undeformed state to be stress free and\nwith zero energy. The normalization terms are formulated for both isotropic and\ntransversely isotropic material behavior and do not violate polyconvexity.

Most define fairness in simple terms,\nwhere fairness means reducing gaps in performance or outcomes between\ndemographic groups while preserving as much of the accuracy of the original\nsystem as possible. This oversimplification of equality through fairness\nmeasures is troubling. Many current fairness measures suffer from both fairness\nand performance degradation, or \"levelling down,\" where fairness is achieved by\nmaking every group worse off, or by bringing better performing groups down to\nthe level of the worst off. When fairness can only be achieved by making\neveryone worse off in material or relational terms through injuries of stigma,\nloss of solidarity, unequal concern, and missed opportunities for substantive\nequality, something would appear to have gone wrong in translating the vague\nconcept of 'fairness' into practice.

A study by varying the number of harmonics (N)\ncontained in the sawtooth waveform is performed. The simulation resultspredict\na non-linear increase in the plasma density and ion flux with N i.e., it first\ndecreases, reaching a minimum value for a critical value of N, and then\nincreases almost linearly with afurther rise in N. The ionization asymmetry\nincreases with N, and higher harmonics on the instantaneous sheath position are\nobserved for higher values of N. These higher harmonics generate multiple\nionization beams that are generated near the expanding sheath edge and are\nresponsible for an enhanced plasma density for higher values of N. The ion\nenergy distribution function (IEDF) depicts a bi-modal shape for different\nvalues of N. A strong DC self-bias is observed on the powered electrode, and\nits value with respect to the plasma potential decreases with an increase in N\ndue to which corresponding ion energy on the powered electrode decreases. The\nsimulation results conclude that by changing the number of harmonics of a\nsawtooth-like in collisionless CCP discharges, the ion flux asymmetry is not\ngenerated, whereas sheath symmetry could be significantly affected and\ntherefore a systematic variation in the ion energy asymmetry is observed. Due\nto an increase in the higher harmonic contents in the sawtooth waveform with N,\na transition from broad bi-modal to narrow-shaped IEDFs is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 15:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

On the\nother hand, there are complex interaction patterns between interacting hands,\nwhich significantly increases the solution space of hand poses and increases\nthe difficulty of network learning. In this paper, we propose a decoupled\niterative refinement framework to achieve pixel-alignment hand reconstruction\nwhile efficiently modeling the spatial relationship between hands.\nSpecifically, we define two feature spaces with different characteristics,\nnamely 2D visual feature space and 3D joint feature space. First, we obtain\njoint-wise features from the visual feature map and utilize a graph convolution\nnetwork and a transformer to perform intra- and inter-hand information\ninteraction in the 3D joint feature space, respectively. Then, we project the\njoint features with global information back into the 2D visual feature space in\nan obfuscation-free manner and utilize the 2D convolution for pixel-wise\nenhancement. By performing multiple alternate enhancements in the two feature\nspaces, our method can achieve an accurate and robust reconstruction of\ninteracting hands.

Estimating covariance from multiway data is a\nfundamental statistical task, however, the intrinsic high dimensionality poses\nsignificant statistical and computational challenges. Recently, several\nfactorized covariance models, paired with estimation algorithms, have been\nproposed to circumvent these obstacles. Despite several promising results on\nthe algorithmic front, it remains under-explored whether and when such a model\nis valid. To address this question, we define the notion of Kronecker-separable\nmultiway covariance, which can be written as a sum of $r$ tensor products of\nmode-wise covariances. The question of whether a given covariance can be\nrepresented as a separable multiway covariance is then reduced to an equivalent\nquestion about separability of quantum states. Using this equivalence, it\nfollows directly that a generic multiway covariance tends to be non-separable\n(even if $r \\to \\infty$), and moreover, finding its best separable\napproximation is NP-hard.

There has been rapid\ninnovation in system identification across scientific domains, but there\nremains a gap in the literature for large-scale methodological comparisons that\nare evaluated on a variety of dynamical systems. In this work, we\nsystematically benchmark sparse regression variants by utilizing the dysts\nstandardized database of chaotic systems. In particular, we demonstrate how\nthis open-source tool can be used to quantitatively compare different methods\nof system identification. To illustrate how this benchmark can be utilized, we\nperform a large comparison of four algorithms for solving the sparse\nidentification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) optimization problem, finding\nstrong performance of the original algorithm and a recent mixed-integer\ndiscrete algorithm. In all cases, we used ensembling to improve the noise\nrobustness of SINDy and provide statistical comparisons. In addition, we show\nvery compelling evidence that the weak SINDy formulation provides significant\nimprovements over the traditional method, even on clean data. Lastly, we\ninvestigate how Pareto-optimal models generated from SINDy algorithms depend on\nthe properties of the equations, finding that the performance shows no\nsignificant dependence on a set of dynamical properties that quantify the\namount of chaos, scale separation, degree of nonlinearity, and the syntactic\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 18:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Although this\nproblem can be represented as a classical collaborative filtering problem, it\nrequires proper modification since the data are sequential, the user feedback\nis distributed among devices and the transmission of users' data to aggregate\ncommon patterns must be protected against leakage. According to such\nrequirements, we modify the structure of the classical matrix factorization\nmodel and update the training procedure to sequential learning. Since the data\nabout user experience are distributed among devices, the federated learning\nsetup is used to train the proposed sequential matrix factorization model. One\nmore ingredient of the proposed approach is a new privacy mechanism that\nguarantees the protection of the sent data from the users to the remote server.\nTo demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model we use publicly available\nmobile user behavior data. We compare our model with sequential rules and\nmodels based on the frequency of app launches. The comparison is conducted in\nstatic and dynamic environments. The static environment evaluates how our model\nprocesses sequential data compared to competitors. Therefore, the standard\ntrain-validation-test evaluation procedure is used. The dynamic environment\nemulates the real-world scenario, where users generate new data by running apps\non devices, and evaluates our model in this case. Our experiments show that the\nproposed model provides comparable quality with other methods in the static\nenvironment. However, more importantly, our method achieves a better\nprivacy-utility trade-off than competitors in the dynamic environment, which\nprovides more accurate simulations of real-world usage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 10:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

Among different hardware platforms capable of executing HDC\nalgorithms, in-memory computing (IMC) has shown promise as it is very efficient\nin performing matrix-vector multiplications, which are common in the HDC\nalgebra. Although HDC architectures based on IMC already exist, how to scale\nthem remains a key challenge due to collective communication patterns that\nthese architectures required and that traditional chip-scale networks were not\ndesigned for. To cope with this difficulty, we propose a scale-out HDC\narchitecture called WHYPE, which uses wireless in-package communication\ntechnology to interconnect a large number of physically distributed IMC cores\nthat either encode hypervectors or perform multiple similarity searches in\nparallel. In this context, the key enabler of WHYPE is the opportunistic use of\nthe wireless network as a medium for over-the-air computation. WHYPE implements\nan optimized source coding that allows receivers to calculate the bit-wise\nmajority of multiple hypervectors (a useful operation in HDC) being transmitted\nconcurrently over the wireless channel. By doing so, we achieve a joint\nbroadcast distribution and computation with a performance and efficiency\nunattainable with wired interconnects, which in turn enables massive\nparallelization of the architecture. Through evaluations at the on-chip network\nand complete architecture levels, we demonstrate that WHYPE can bundle and\ndistribute hypervectors faster and more efficiently than a hypothetical wired\nimplementation, and that it scales well to tens of receivers. We show that the\naverage error rate of the majority computation is low, such that it has\nnegligible impact on the accuracy of HDC classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 22:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

To\nthis end, we introduce a novel framework, which successfully encodes both\ngeometric local features and global representations to distinguish vehicle\ninstances, optimized only by the supervision from official ID labels.\nSpecifically, given our insight that objects in ReID share similar geometric\ncharacteristics, we propose to borrow self-supervised representation learning\nto facilitate geometric features discovery.

With the emergence of Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) such as\nUber and Lyft, the ridesharing market has become increasingly fragmented in\nmany cities around the world, leading to efficiency loss and increased traffic\ncongestion. While an integrated ridesharing market (allowing sharing across\nTNCs) can improve the overall efficiency, how such benefits may vary across\nTNCs based on actual market characteristics is still not well understood. In\nthis study, we extend a shareability network framework to quantify and explain\nthe efficiency benefits of ridesharing market integration using available TNC\ntrip records. Through a case study in Manhattan, New York City, the proposed\nframework is applied to analyze a real-world ridesharing market with 3\nTNCs$-$Uber, Lyft, and Via. It is estimated that a perfectly integrated market\nin Manhattan would improve ridesharing efficiency by 13.3%, or 5% of daily TNC\nvehicle hours traveled. Further analysis reveals that (1) the efficiency\nimprovement is negatively correlated with the overall demand density and\ninter-TNC spatiotemporal unevenness (measured by network modularity), (2)\nmarket integration would generate a larger efficiency improvement in a\ncompetitive market, and (3) the TNC with a higher intra-TNC demand\nconcentration (measured by clustering coefficient) would benefit less from\nmarket integration. As the uneven benefits may deter TNCs from collaboration,\nwe also illustrate how to quantify each TNC's marginal contribution based on\nthe Shapley value, which can be used to ensure equitable profit allocation.\nThese results can help market regulators and business alliances to evaluate and\nmonitor market efficiency and dynamically adjust their strategies, incentives,\nand profit allocation schemes to promote market integration and collaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2023 12:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}
