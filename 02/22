An interaction of the gamma-ray photons with a putative\nbroad-line region may reduce the gamma-ray flux only if its production site\nwere very close to the central engine.

The electronic structure and the single-particle\nenergy levels of these quantum defects in the semiconducting host have been\nused to understand their opto-electronic properties. Optical excitations that\nare central for their initialization and readout are linked to transitions\nbetween occupied and unoccupied single-particle states. It is commonly assumed\nthat only quantum defects introducing levels well within the band gap and far\nfrom the band edges are of interest for quantum technologies as they mimic an\nisolated atom embedded in the host. In this perspective, we contradict this\ncommon assumption and show that optically active defects with energy levels\nclose to the band edges can display similar properties.

It is widely used to blur the\nbackground and highlight the subject in the foreground, thereby drawing the\nviewer's attention to the main focus of the image. In traditional digital\nsingle-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs), this effect is achieved through the use of\na large aperture lens. This allows the camera to capture images with shallow\ndepth-of-field, in which only a small area of the image is in sharp focus,\nwhile the rest of the image is blurred. However, the hardware embedded in\nmobile phones is typically much smaller and more limited than that found in\nDSLRs. Consequently, mobile phones are not able to capture natural shallow\ndepth-of-field photos, which can be a significant limitation for mobile\nphotography. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod for bokeh rendering using the Vision Transformer, a recent and powerful\ndeep learning architecture. Our approach employs an adaptive depth calibration\nnetwork that acts as a confidence level to compensate for errors in monocular\ndepth estimation. This network is used to supervise the rendering process in\nconjunction with depth information, allowing for the generation of high-quality\nbokeh images at high resolutions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving about 24.7% improvements\non LPIPS and obtaining higher PSNR scores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 16:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

However, existing methods tend to ignore the fact that\nnot all traits equally contribute to a given task. Ignoring such inherent\npreferences or relative importance can lead to unintended sub-optimal\nallocations of limited agent resources that do not necessarily contribute to\ntask success. Further, reasoning over a large number of traits can incur a\nhefty computational burden. To alleviate these concerns, we propose an\nalgorithm to infer task-specific trait preferences implicit in expert\ndemonstrations. We leverage the insight that the consistency with which an\nexpert allocates a trait to a task across demonstrations reflects the trait's\nimportance to that task. Inspired by findings in psychology, we account for the\nfact that the inherent diversity of a trait in the dataset influences the\ndataset's informativeness and, thereby, the extent of the inferred preference\nor the lack thereof. Through detailed numerical simulations and evaluations of\na publicly-available soccer dataset (FIFA 20), we demonstrate that we can\nsuccessfully infer implicit trait preferences and that accounting for the\ninferred preferences leads to more computationally efficient and effective task\nallocation, compared to a baseline approach that treats all traits equally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 16:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Here, we use global 2-D\nthermochemical convection models with realistic parameters, including rheology\n(dislocation creep, diffusion creep, and plastic yielding), an experiment-based\nplagioclase (An$_{75}$) crustal rheology, and intrusive magmatism, to\ninvestigate the tectonics and mantle evolution of Venus. We find that surface\ntectonics is strongly affected by crustal rheology. With a ''weak''\nplagioclase-rheology crust, models exhibit episodic overturns but with\ncontinuously high surface mobility and high distributed surface strain rates\nbetween overturns, leading to a new tectonic regime that we name ''deformable\nepisodic lid''. On the other hand, olivine-crustal-rheology models exhibit\neither standard episodic-lid tectonics, i.e. with mobility that is high during\noverturns and near zero between overturns, or stagnant-lid tectonics, i.e. with\nnear-zero mobility over the entire model time. Also, a combination of\nplagioclase crustal rheology and dislocation creep can weaken the lithosphere\nsufficiently to facilitate lithospheric overturns without applying plastic\nyielding. Internally, the composition-dependent density profile results in a\n''basalt barrier'' at the mantle transition zone, which strongly affects Venus'\nmantle evolution. Only strong plumes can penetrate this basalt barrier and\ncause global lithospheric overturns. This basalt barrier also causes global\ninternal episodic overturns that generate global volcanic resurfacing in\nstagnant-lid models, which suggests a new resurfacing mechanism (we name it\n''stagnant episodic-volcanic-resurfacing'') that does not involve lithospheric\noverturns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 16:57:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 21:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

For a large class of\ndistributions satisfying natural symmetry constraints we give a sequence of\nalgorithms that can efficiently estimate its location without incurring\ndimension-dependent factors in the error. Concretely, suppose an adversary can\narbitrarily corrupt an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of the observed samples.

Our class\ncontains products of arbitrary symmetric one-dimensional distributions as well\nas elliptical distributions, a vast generalization of the Gaussian\ndistribution. Examples include product Cauchy distributions and multi-variate\n$t$-distributions. In particular, even the first moment might not exist.\n  We provide the first efficient algorithms for this class of distributions.\nPreviously, such results where only known under boundedness assumptions on the\nmoments of the distribution and in particular, are provably impossible in the\nabsence of symmetry [KSS18, CTBJ22].

Typically, chance\nconstraints are incorporated into the planning problem to provide probabilistic\nsafety guarantees by imposing an upper bound on the collision probability of\nthe planned trajectory. Yet, this results in overly conservative behavior on\nthe grounds that the gap between the obtained risk and the specified upper\nlimit is not explicitly restricted. To address this issue, we propose a\nreal-time capable approach to quantify the risk associated with planned\ntrajectories obtained from multiple probabilistic planners, running in\nparallel, with different upper bounds of the acceptable risk level. Based on\nthe evaluated risk, the least conservative plan is selected provided that its\nassociated risk is below a specified threshold. In such a way, the proposed\napproach provides probabilistic safety guarantees by attaining a closer bound\nto the specified risk, while being applicable to generic uncertainties of\nmoving obstacles.

Io's sodium aurora mostly\ndisappears in eclipse and e-folding timescales, for decline and recovery differ\nsharply: ~10 minutes at ingress and nearly 2 hr at egress. Only ion chemistry\ncan produce such a disparity; Io's molecular ionosphere is weaker at egress due\nto rapid recombination. Interruption of a NaCl+ photochemical pathway best\nexplains Na behavior surrounding eclipse, implying that the role of electron\nimpact ionization is minor relative to photons. Auroral emission is also\nevident from potassium, confirming K as the major source of far red emissions\nseen with spacecraft imaging at Jupiter. In all cases, direct electron impact\non atomic gas is sufficient to explain the brightness without invoking\nsignificant dissociative excitation of molecules.

Significant research has begun to\nestablish brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a potential biomarker to\ndiagnose and monitor the state of the disease. Deep learning has turned into a\nprominent class of machine learning programs in computer vision and has been\nsuccessfully employed to solve diverse medical image analysis tasks. However,\ndeep learning-based methods applied to neuroimaging have not achieved superior\nperformance in ALS patients classification from healthy controls due to having\ninsignificant structural changes correlated with pathological features.\nTherefore, the critical challenge in deep models is to determine useful\ndiscriminative features with limited training data. By exploiting the\nlong-range relationship of image features, this study introduces a framework\nnamed SF2Former that leverages vision transformer architecture's power to\ndistinguish the ALS subjects from the control group. To further improve the\nnetwork's performance, spatial and frequency domain information are combined\nbecause MRI scans are captured in the frequency domain before being converted\nto the spatial domain. The proposed framework is trained with a set of\nconsecutive coronal 2D slices, which uses the pre-trained weights on ImageNet\nby leveraging transfer learning.

We show how\nthese errors are mischaracterized using standard Quantum Computer Verification\nand Validation (QCVV) techniques that rely on Markovianity and are therefore\noften overlooked or assumed to be incoherent. We first demonstrate off-resonant\nerrors within a simple toy model of Z-gates created by the AC Stark effect,\nthen show how off-resonant errors manifest in all gates driven on a\nfixed-frequency transmon architecture, a prominent example being incidental\ncross-resonance interaction driven during single-qubit gates. Furthermore, the\nsame methodology can access the errors caused by two-level systems (TLS),\nshowing evidence of coherent, off-resonant interactions with subsystems that\nare not intentional qubits. While we explore these results and their impact on\ngate error for fixed-frequency devices, we note that off-resonant excitations\npotentially limit any architectures that use frequency selectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 18:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

The polar\nmetallic phase is an unusual metallic phase of matter containing long-range\nferroelectric (FE) order in the electronic and atomic structure. Distinct from\nthe typical FE insulating phase, this phase spontaneously breaks the inversion\nsymmetry but without global polarization. Unexpectedly, the FE order is found\nto be dramatically suppressed by carriers and destroyed at moderate ~10%\ncarrier density. Here, we propose a general mechanism based on carrier-induced\nquantum fluctuations to explain this puzzling phenomenon. Basically, the\nquantum kinetic effect would drive the formation of polaronic quasi-particles\nmade of the carriers and their surrounding dipoles. The disruption in dipolar\ndirections can therefore weaken or even destroy the FE order. We demonstrate\nsuch polaron formation and the associated FE suppression via a simple model\nusing exact diagonalization, perturbation, and quantum Monte Carlo approaches.\nThis quantum mechanism also provides an intuitive picture for many puzzling\nexperimental findings, thereby facilitating new designs of multifunctional FE\nelectronic devices augmented with quantum effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 18:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Hyperspectral snapshot mosaic sensors offer a promising\napproach due to their fast acquisition speed and compact size. However, a\ndemosaicking algorithm is required to fully recover the spatial and spectral\ninformation of the snapshot images. Most state-of-the-art demosaicking\nalgorithms require ground-truth training data with paired snapshot and\nhigh-resolution hyperspectral images, but such imagery pairs with the exact\nsame scene are physically impossible to acquire in intraoperative settings. In\nthis work, we present a fully unsupervised hyperspectral image demosaicking\nalgorithm which only requires exemplar snapshot images for training purposes.\nWe regard hyperspectral demosaicking as an ill-posed linear inverse problem\nwhich we solve using a deep neural network. We take advantage of the spectral\ncorrelation occurring in natural scenes to design a novel inter spectral band\nregularisation term based on spatial gradient consistency. By combining our\nproposed term with standard regularisation techniques and exploiting a standard\ndata fidelity term, we obtain an unsupervised loss function for training deep\nneural networks, which allows us to achieve real-time hyperspectral image\ndemosaicking. Quantitative results on hyperspetral image datasets show that our\nunsupervised demosaicking approach can achieve similar performance to its\nsupervised counter-part, and significantly outperform linear demosaicking. A\nqualitative user study on real snapshot hyperspectral surgical images confirms\nthe results from the quantitative analysis. Our results suggest that the\nproposed unsupervised algorithm can achieve promising hyperspectral\ndemosaicking in real-time thus advancing the suitability of the modality for\nintraoperative use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 18:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

The majority of the AGN\n($75\\%$) are in a SMBH mass growth dominant phase. In these systems, the\nM$_{BH}-$M$_*$ correlation is weaker and their M$_*$ tends to be lower (for the\nsame M$_{BH}$) compared to systems that are in a galaxy mass growth phase.

The free energy ensuing from the Edwards' Hamiltonian\nundergoes variational extremization, and explicitly accounts for the screened\nCoulomb and non-electrostatic interactions among monomers within individual\npolyions and between two polyions. Assuming maximal ion-pair formation of the\ncomplexed part, the system free energy comprising configurational entropy of\nthe polyions and free-ion entropy of the small ions is minimized. The\nthermodynamic drive for complexation is found to increase with the ionizability\nof the symmetric polyions and to be maximum for symmetric chain lengths for\nequally ionizable polyions. The effective charge and size of the complex\nincrease with asymmetry in charge density, where the size can be substantially\nlarger than a collapsed globule found for symmetric chains. The regimes of\nenthalpy- and entropy-driven complexation are found, respectively, for low and\nhigh Coulomb strengths. The crossover strength is found to be strongly\ndependent on the dielectric environment and salt, but marginally dependent on\nthe charge density, thus implying an entropy-driven process at moderate\nstrengths.

In the noiseless regime, it is recently shown that\nover-estimation of the rank leads to progressively fewer sub-optimal local\nsolutions while preserving the identifiability of the true solutions. In this\nwork, we show that with noisy measurements, the global solutions of the\nover-parameterized BM no longer correspond to the true solutions, essentially\ntransmuting over-parameterization from blessing to curse. In particular, we\nstudy two classes of low-rank matrix recovery, namely matrix completion and\nmatrix sensing. For matrix completion, we show that even if the rank is only\nslightly over-estimated and with very mild assumptions on the noise, none of\nthe true solutions are local or global solutions. For matrix sensing, we show\nthat to guarantee the correspondence between global and true solutions, it is\nnecessary and sufficient for the number of samples to scale linearly with the\nover-estimated rank, which can be drastically larger than its optimal sample\ncomplexity that only scales with the true rank.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 19:47:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

The global mass-loss\nand angular momentum loss rates are then given by integrating over the deformed\nstellar surface as appropriate. Evolutionary models were computed and our\nprescription is compared to the currently used simple mass-loss enhancement\nrecipes for rotating stars.\n  Results: We find that mass-loss rates are largely insensitive to rotation for\nmodels not affected by the bi-stability jump. For those affected by the\nbi-stability jump, the increase in mass-loss rates with respect to time is\nsmoothed. As our prescription considers the variation of physical conditions\nover the stellar surface, the region affected by the bi-stability jump is able\nto grow gradually instead of the whole star suddenly being affected.\n  Conclusion: We have provided an easy to implement and flexible, yet\nphysically meaningful prescription for calculating mass and angular momentum\nloss rates of rotating stars in a one-dimensional stellar evolution code which\ncompares favourably to more physically comprehensive models.\n  The implementation of our scheme in the stellar evolution code MESA is\navailable online: https://zenodo.org/record/7437006\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 20:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Accurate\nestimates of the aerodynamic loads on the individual towers and on the overall\ngroup are essential for the safe and economic design of the quayside's\nsupporting structures and foundations. Wind tunnel tests represent the main way\nto address the problem, but results may lead to overconservative designs due to\ninevitable mismatches in the Reynolds number. This crucial issue is dealt with\nhere using an original engineering solution based on concentrated but\ndiscontinuous surface roughness, which allows, for the first time in the case\nof finite-height towers arranged in groups and subjected to an atmospheric\nboundary layer flow, the successful simulation of the target high Reynolds\nnumber regime. This case study assumes slender wind turbine towers with a\nheight of 115 m, and for the sake of generality, the investigations focus\nprincipally on a cylindrical shape rather than the more complex real-world\ngeometry. The constant diameter of the towers is determined based on the\ntheoretical equivalence of the mean overturning moment. The rationality of this\nprocedure is verified a posteriori using a set of measurements on the\nreal-shape towers. The experiments show a regular behavior of the maximum mean\nbase shear force and moment for towers arranged in double-row groups, while the\nresults are more complicated for single-row groups, since biased flow sometimes\noccurs in symmetric or nearly-symmetric configurations. Dynamic loads are also\ninspected, and gust factors in good agreement with Eurocode 1's prescriptions\nare found.

Using our bound, we demonstrate that orthogonal network slicing\nenables massive and critical IoT to coexist under the requirement of high\nenergy efficiency.

In\nthis research, we explore deep learning video classification techniques to\ndetect violence as they are happening.

Such\nmorphology are expected to be the outcome of dynamical interaction between the\ndisk and planets. However, other mechanisms are able to produce similar dust\nsub-structures. A solution is to look at the perturbation induced by the planet\nto the gas surface density and/or to the kinematics. In the case of the disk\naround AS 209, a prominent gap has been reported in the surface density of CO\nat $r \\sim 100\\,$au. Recently, Bae et al. (2022) detected a localized velocity\nperturbation in the $^{12}$CO $J=2-1$ emission along with a clump in $^{13}$CO\n$J=2-1$ at nearly 200 au, interpreted as a gaseous circumplanetary disk. We\nreport a new analysis of ALMA archival observations of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO\nJ=2-1. A clear kinematics perturbation (kink) is detected in multiple channels\nand over a wide azimuth range in both dataset. We compared the observed\nperturbation with a semi-analytic model of velocity perturbations due to\nplanet-disk interaction. The observed kink is not consistent with a planet at\n200\\,au as this would require a low gas disk scale height ($< 0.05$) in\ncontradiction with previous estimate ($h/r \\sim 0.118$ at $r = 100$ au). When\nwe fix the disk scale height to 0.118 (at $r = 100$ au) we find instead that a\nplanet of 3-5 M$_{\\rm Jup}$ at 100 au induces a kinematics perturbation similar\nto the observed one. Thus, we conclude that a giant protoplanet orbiting at $r\n\\sim 100\\,$au is responsible of the large scale kink as well as of the\nperturbed dust and gas surface density previously detected. The position angle\nof the planet is constrained to be between 60$^{\\circ}$-100$^{\\circ}$. Future\nobservations with high contrast imaging technique in the near- and mid-\ninfrared are needed to confirm the presence and position of such a planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 22:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Since pathological\nlabels have rich information about their relationship to each other, modeling\nthe co-occurrence dependencies between pathological labels is essential to\nimprove recognition performance. However, previous methods rely on state\nvariable coding and attention mechanisms-oriented to model local label\ninformation, and lack learning of global co-occurrence relationships between\nlabels. Furthermore, these methods roughly integrate image features and label\nembedding, ignoring the alignment and compactness problems in cross-modal\nvector fusion.To solve these problems, a Bi-modal Bridged Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (BB-GCN) model is proposed. This model mainly consists of a backbone\nmodule, a pathology Label Co-occurrence relationship Embedding (LCE) module,\nand a Transformer Bridge Graph (TBG) module. Specifically, the backbone module\nobtains image visual feature representation. The LCE module utilizes a graph to\nmodel the global co-occurrence relationship between multiple labels and employs\ngraph convolutional networks for learning inference. The TBG module bridges the\ncross-modal vectors more compactly and efficiently through the GroupSum\nmethod.We have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed BB-GCN in two\nlarge-scale CXR datasets (ChestX-Ray14 and CheXpert).

The components of the responses have known and\nstructured interrelationships. To make use of these relationships in modeling,\nwe develop a two-pronged regularization approach to borrow information across\nthe responses. The first component of our approach encourages joint selection\nof the effects of each variable across possibly overlapping groups related\nresponses and the second component encourages shrinkage of effects towards each\nother for related responses. As the responses in our motivating study are not\nnormally-distributed, our approach does not rely on an assumption of\nmultivariate normality of the responses. We show that with an adaptive version\nof our penalty, our approach results in the same asymptotic distribution of\nestimates as if we had known in advance which variables were non-zero and which\nvariables have the same effects across some outcomes. We demonstrate the\nperformance of our method in extensive numerical studies and in an application\nin the prediction of functional status of pediatric patients using\nadministrative health data in a population of children with neurological injury\nor illness at a large children's hospital.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 02:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

For a given chirality of the\nerupting field, both the external and internal drivers cause the same rotation\ndirection. Therefore, it remains elusive from direct observations which\nmechanism yields the dominant contribution to the rotation. In this paper, we\nexploit a full MHD simulation of solar eruption by tether-cutting magnetic\nreconnection to study the mechanism of MFR rotation. In the simulation, the\nMFR's height-rotation profile suggests that the force by the external\nshear-field component is a dominant contributor to the rotation. Furthermore,\nthe torque analysis confirms that it is also the only factor in driving the\ncounterclockwise rotation.

With the increasing\nurbanization, the area of the city and the density of infrastructure continues\nto increase, which brings two issues: (1) Due to the energy constraint, it is\nhard for the homogeneous robot team to cover the large-scale linear\ninfrastructure starting from one depot; (2) In the large urban scene, the\nimbalance of robots' path greatly extends the time cost of the multi-robot\nsystem, which is more serious than that in smaller-size scenes. To address\nthese issues, we propose a heterogeneous multi-robot approach consisting of\nseveral teams, each of which contains one transportation robot (TRob) and\nseveral coverage robots (CRobs).

In Yata and Aoshima (2010), cross-data-matrix PCA (CDM-PCA) was\nproposed and shown to have smaller bias than PCA in estimating eigenvalues.\nWhile CDM-PCA has the potential to achieve better estimation of the leading\neigen-subspace than the usual PCA, its robustness is not well recognized. In\nthis article, we first develop a more stable variant of CDM-PCA, which we call\nproduct-PCA (PPCA), that provides a more convenient formulation for theoretical\ninvestigation. Secondly, we prove that, in the presence of outliers, PPCA is\nmore robust than PCA in maintaining the correct ordering of leading\neigenvalues. The robustness gain in PPCA comes from the random data partition,\nand it does not rely on a data down-weighting scheme as most robust statistical\nmethods do. This enables us to establish the surprising finding that, when\nthere are no outliers, PPCA and PCA share the same asymptotic distribution.\nThat is, the robustness gain of PPCA in estimating the leading eigen-subspace\nhas no efficiency loss in comparison with PCA. Simulation studies and a face\ndata example are presented to show the merits of PPCA.

In this paper, the design of artificial noise (AN) to enhance\nphysical layer security in VLC systems is studied in the context of input\nsignals with no explicit amplitude constraint (e.g., multicarrier systems). In\nsuch systems, clipping is needed to constrain the input signals within the\nlimited linear ranges of the LEDs. However, this clipping process gives rise to\nnon-linear clipping distortion, which must be incorporated into the AN design.\nTo facilitate the solution of this problem, a sub-optimal design approach is\npresented using the Charnes-Cooper transformation and the convex-concave\nprocedure (CCP). Then, a novel AN transmission scheme is proposed to reduce the\nimpact of clipping distortion, thus improving the secrecy performance. The\nproposed scheme exploits the common structure of LED luminaries that they are\noften composed of several light-emitting chips. Capitalizing on this property,\nLED chips in each luminaire are divided into two groups driven by separate\ndriver circuits. One group is used to transmit the information-bearing signal,\nwhile the other group transmits the AN. Numerical results show that the\nclipping distortion significantly reduces the secrecy level, and using AN is\nadvantageous over the no-AN scheme in improving the secrecy performance.\nMoreover, the proposed AN transmission scheme is shown to achieve considerable\nsecrecy improvements compared with the traditional transmission approaches\n(e.g., about 1 bit/s/Hz improvement in the achievable secrecy rate when the\nstandard deviation of the LEDs' modulating current is 0.25 A and the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the eavesdropper's received signal\nis limited to $0$ dB).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 03:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

We present a genetic algorithm for state preparation (GASP)\nwhich generates relatively low-depth quantum circuits for initialising a\nquantum computer in a specified quantum state. The method uses a basis set of\nR_x, R_y, R_z, and CNOT gates and a genetic algorithm to systematically\ngenerate circuits to synthesize the target state to the required fidelity.

Due to the\nlarge variability of properties of subsurface formations (such as permeability\nand porosity) it may be of value to localize the sampling strategy so that it\ncan better adapt to large local variability of rock properties. In this paper,\nwe introduce the concept of multiscale sampling to localize the search in the\nstochastic space. We combine the simplicity of a preconditioned Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo method with a new algorithm to decompose the stochastic space into\northogonal subspaces, through a one-to-one mapping of the subspaces to\nsubdomains of a non-overlapping domain decomposition of the region of interest.\nThe localization of the search is performed by a multiscale blocking strategy\nwithin Gibbs sampling: we apply a KL expansion locally, at the subdomain level.\nWithin each subdomain, blocking is applied again, for the sampling of the KLE\nrandom coefficients.

This paper seeks to address\nthese issues by explicitly denoting each node as the combination of inherited\nfeature (i.e., structural part) and incremental feature (i.e., supplementary\npart). Specifically, the inherited feature originates from \"parent\" nodes and\nis weighted by an inheritance factor. With this node representation, the\nhierarchy of semantics in taxonomies (i.e., the inheritance and accumulation of\nfeatures from \"parent\" to \"child\") could be embodied. Additionally, based on\nthis representation, the directionality of is-a relation could be easily\ntranslated into the irreversible inheritance of features. Inspired by the\nDarmois-Skitovich Theorem, we implement this irreversibility by a non-Gaussian\nconstraint on the supplementary feature. A log-likelihood learning objective is\nfurther utilized to optimize the proposed model (dubbed DNG), whereby the\nrequired non-Gaussianity is also theoretically ensured.

Second, VI methods typically rely on gradient-based optimization,\nwhich can be computationally expensive or intractable when applied to BIPs\ninvolving partial differential equations (PDEs). To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel approximation method for estimating the high-dimensional\nposterior distribution.

However, a pervasive difficulty in applying RFF is\nthat the user does not know the actual error of the approximation, or how this\nerror will propagate into downstream learning tasks. Up to now, the RFF\nliterature has primarily dealt with these uncertainties using theoretical error\nbounds, but from a user's standpoint, such results are typically impractical --\neither because they are highly conservative or involve unknown quantities. To\ntackle these general issues in a data-driven way, this paper develops a\nbootstrap approach to numerically estimate the errors of RFF approximations.\nThree key advantages of this approach are: (1) The error estimates are specific\nto the problem at hand, avoiding the pessimism of worst-case bounds. (2) The\napproach is flexible with respect to different uses of RFF, and can even\nestimate errors in downstream learning tasks. (3) The approach enables adaptive\ncomputation, so that the user can quickly inspect the error of a rough initial\nkernel approximation and then predict how much extra work is needed.

It is of great difficulty to deploy a large DNN model to a single\nresource-limited device with small memory capacity. Distributed computing is a\ncommon approach to reduce single-node memory consumption and to accelerate the\ninference of DNN models. In this paper, we explore the \"within-layer model\nparallelism\", which distributes the inference of each layer into multiple\nnodes. In this way, the memory requirement can be distributed to many nodes,\nmaking it possible to use several edge devices to infer a large DNN model. Due\nto the dependency within each layer, data communications between nodes during\nthis parallel inference can be a bottleneck when the communication bandwidth is\nlimited. We propose a framework to train DNN models for Distributed Inference\nwith Sparse Communications (DISCO). We convert the problem of selecting which\nsubset of data to transmit between nodes into a model optimization problem, and\nderive models with both computation and communication reduction when each layer\nis inferred on multiple nodes. We show the benefit of the DISCO framework on a\nvariety of CV tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic\nsegmentation, and image super resolution. The corresponding models include\nimportant DNN building blocks such as convolutions and transformers. For\nexample, each layer of a ResNet-50 model can be distributively inferred across\ntwo nodes with five times less data communications, almost half overall\ncomputations and half memory requirement for a single node, and achieve\ncomparable accuracy to the original ResNet-50 model.

This paper proposes an efficient vision transformer with\nresidual dense connections and local feature fusion to achieve efficient\nsingle-image super-resolution (SISR) of medical modalities. Moreover, we\nimplement a general-purpose perceptual loss with manual control for image\nquality improvements of desired aspects by incorporating prior knowledge of\nmedical image segmentation.

The studied models of\ntime variation are motivated by adversarial attacks on the computation of value\niteration in Markov decision processes. In this application, the hitting time\nquantifies the extent that the computation is robust to adversarial\ndisturbance. We develop upper bounds on the hitting time by analyzing the\ncontraction-expansion transformation appeared in the time-variation models. We\nprove that the hitting time of the value function in the value iteration with a\nprobabilistic contraction-expansion transformation is logarithmic in terms of\nthe inverse of a desired precision. In addition, the hitting time is analyzed\nfor optimization of unknown continuous or discrete time-varying functions whose\nnoisy evaluations are revealed over time. The upper bound for a continuous\nfunction is super-quadratic (but sub-cubic) in terms of the inverse of a\ndesired precision and the upper bound for a discrete function is logarithmic in\nterms of the cardinality of the function domain.

The intensity of the weak interaction is\nset by the parameters that determine the contributions to the probability\namplitude from the scalar products of the leptonic and nucleon currents. The\nresulting expressions are of interest, at least in the problem of direct\ndetection of neutral massive weakly interacting particles of dark matter, since\nin this case, in contrast to the generally accepted approach, both elastic and\ninelastic processes are simultaneously considered. It is shown that the\npresence of the inelastic contribution accompanied by emission of\ncharacteristic radiation (photons) from the deexcitation of the nucleus turns\nout to be decisive when the coherent cross section is strongly suppressed or\ncannot be detected. Therefore in order to extract maximum information about\ndark matter particles, one should plan experiments aimed at the direct\ndetection of dark matter particles in a setting that allows one to detect both\nthe recoil energy of the nucleus and the gamma quanta from the deexcitation of\nthe nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 08:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Modern deep learning tools have achieved great\nempirical success, but a framework for deep principal component analysis is\nstill lacking. Here we develop a deep kernel PCA methodology (DKPCA) to extract\nmultiple levels of the most informative components of the data. Our scheme can\neffectively identify new hierarchical variables, called deep principal\ncomponents, capturing the main characteristics of high-dimensional data through\na simple and interpretable numerical optimization. We couple the principal\ncomponents of multiple KPCA levels, theoretically showing that DKPCA creates\nboth forward and backward dependency across levels, which has not been explored\nin kernel methods and yet is crucial to extract more informative features.\nVarious experimental evaluations on multiple data types show that DKPCA finds\nmore efficient and disentangled representations with higher explained variance\nin fewer principal components, compared to the shallow KPCA. We demonstrate\nthat our method allows for effective hierarchical data exploration, with the\nability to separate the key generative factors of the input data both for large\ndatasets and when few training samples are available. Overall, DKPCA can\nfacilitate the extraction of useful patterns from high-dimensional data by\nlearning more informative features organized in different levels, giving\ndiversified aspects to explore the variation factors in the data, while\nmaintaining a simple mathematical formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 09:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

In this paper, instead of the popularly used similarity condition, a\nseeming similarity is introduced, which is defined by a non-orthogonality\ntogether with a smoothness. Such a condition is naturally satisfied under\ncommon situations and even implies the dissimilarity in some sense. Based on\nthe seeming similarity together with an $L_2$-adjustment, a source-function\nweighted-transfer learning estimation (sw-TLE) is constructed. By\nsource-function weighting, an adaptive transfer learning is achieved in the\nsense that it is applied to similar and dissimilar scenarios with a relatively\nhigh estimation efficiency. Particularly, under the case with homogenous source\nand target models, the sw-TLE even can be competitive with the full data\nestimator. The hidden relationship between the source-function weighting\nestimator and the James-Stein estimator is established as well, which reveals\nthe structural reasonability of our methodology.

Obtaining an accurate and fast gravitational waveform template is of\ngreat significance for the estimation of gravitational wave parameters. This\npaper aims to do an extended study of the phenomenological fitting model\nproposed by Setyawati and Ohme for adding eccentricity to quasi-circular\norbital waveforms. It can be applied to higher eccentricity up to e = 0.4. But\nthe higher the eccentricity, the less the accuracy. For e in [0, 0.1], it gives\nan overlap of more than 99.99%. For e in [0.1, 0.2], it gives an overlap of\nmore than 99.9%. For e in [0.2, 0.3], it gives an overlap of more than 99%. For\ne in [0.3, 0.4], it gives an overlap of more than 90%. The reason for these\nphenomena is that the larger the eccentricity, the larger the deviation of the\neccentricity estimator from the cosine function due to the large change in the\nmorphology of the eccentric waveform, and the worse the fitting effect of the\nmodel. It can be applied to higher-order modes and gives the same overlap\nbehavior. After adding a shift parameter, it can be applied to spin-aligned or\nspin-antialigned waveforms. After obtaining spin-precessing effect, it can be\napplied to the spin-precessing case. In summary, non-spining, spin-aligned,\nspin-antialigned or spin-precessing waveforms with eccentricity can be\nconstructed from quasi-circular non-spining waveforms by the phenomenological\nmodel, which is not only helpful for us to quickly construct phenomenological\ngravitational wave templates, but also reveals a phenomenological and universal\nrelationship between eccentric waveform and quasi-circular orbital waveform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 09:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

A commutative family of graph building\noperators $H_\\alpha$ for ladder diagrams is constructed and investigated. The\ncomplete set of eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues for the\noperators $H_\\alpha$ are found. This enables us to explicitly express a wide\nclass of four-point ladder diagrams and a general two-loop propagator-type\nmaster diagram (with arbitrary indices on the lines) as Mellin-Barnes-type\nintegrals. Special cases of these integrals are explicitly evaluated. A certain\nclass of zig-zag four-point and two-point planar Feynman diagrams (relevant to\nthe bi-scalar $D$-dimensional \"fishnet\" field theory and to the calculation of\nthe $\\beta$-function in $\\phi^4$-theory) is considered. The graph building\noperators and convenient integral representations for these Feynman diagrams\nare obtained. The explicit form of the eigenfunctions for the graph building\noperators of the zig-zag diagrams is fixed by conformal symmetry and these\neigenfunctions coincide with the 3-point correlation functions in\n$D$-dimensional conformal field theories. By means of this approach, we exactly\nevaluate the diagrams of the zig-zag series in special cases.

To detect and analyze\neccentric signals, there is an increasing effort to develop waveform models,\nnumerical relativity simulations, and parameter estimation frameworks for\neccentric binaries. Unfortunately, current models and simulations adopt\ndifferent internal parameterisations of eccentricity in the absence of a unique\nnatural definition of eccentricity in general relativity, which can result in\nincompatible eccentricity measurements. In this paper, we present a standard\ndefinition of eccentricity and mean anomaly based solely on waveform\nquantities. This definition is free of gauge ambiguities, has the correct\nNewtonian limit, and can be applied as a postprocessing step when comparing\neccentricity measurements from different models. This standardization puts all\nmodels and simulations on the same footing and enables direct comparisons\nbetween eccentricity estimates from gravitational wave observations and\nastrophysical predictions. We demonstrate the applicability of our definition\nfor waveforms of different origins, including post-Newtonian theory, effective\none body, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and numerical relativity simulations.\nWe focus on binaries without spin-precession in this work, but possible\ngeneralizations to spin-precessing binaries are discussed.

Motivated by an SW-CRT of a geriatric care intervention to\nimprove quality of life, we conducted a simulation study to compare model\nformulations analysing data from an SW-CRT under different scenarios in which\ntime was related to the covariates and the outcome.

For example, if a user has\ndownloaded ciphertexts of several episodes of a show, the service provider can\ndecide to provide some of the contents (e.g., the first episode) available for\nfree while requiring a fee for the remaining contents. However, no concrete\naccess control method has been implemented in the original Cache-22 system.

This\nstems from the awareness that bias in the input data for machine learning\nsystems may result in discriminatory outputs. For clustering tasks, one of the\nmost central notions of fairness is the formalization by Chierichetti, Kumar,\nLattanzi, and Vassilvitskii [NeurIPS 2017]. A clustering is said to be fair, if\neach cluster has the same distribution of manifestations of a sensitive\nattribute as the whole input set. This is motivated by various applications\nwhere the objects to be clustered have sensitive attributes that should not be\nover- or underrepresented.\n  We discuss the applicability of this fairness notion to Correlation\nClustering. The existing literature on the resulting Fair Correlation\nClustering problem either presents approximation algorithms with poor\napproximation guarantees or severely limits the possible distributions of the\nsensitive attribute (often only two manifestations with a 1:1 ratio are\nconsidered). Our goal is to understand if there is hope for better results in\nbetween these two extremes. To this end, we consider restricted graph classes\nwhich allow us to characterize the distributions of sensitive attributes for\nwhich this form of fairness is tractable from a complexity point of view.\n  While existing work on Fair Correlation Clustering gives approximation\nalgorithms, we focus on exact solutions and investigate whether there are\nefficiently solvable instances. The unfair version of Correlation Clustering is\ntrivial on forests, but adding fairness creates a surprisingly rich picture of\ncomplexities. We give an overview of the distributions and types of forests\nwhere Fair Correlation Clustering turns from tractable to intractable. The most\nsurprising insight to us is the fact that the cause of the hardness of Fair\nCorrelation Clustering is not the strictness of the fairness condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 11:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

Despite great success, existing progress mainly focuses on\ntwo-stage detection networks like FasterRCNN, while the research on one-stage\ndetectors is often ignored. In this paper, we focus on the semi-supervised\nlearning for the advanced and popular one-stage detection network YOLOv5.\nCompared with Faster-RCNN, the implementation of YOLOv5 is much more complex,\nand the various training techniques used in YOLOv5 can also reduce the benefit\nof SSOD. In addition to this challenge, we also reveal two key issues in\none-stage SSOD, which are low-quality pseudo-labeling and multi-task\noptimization conflict, respectively. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel teacher-student learning recipe called OneTeacher with two innovative\ndesigns, namely Multi-view Pseudo-label Refinement (MPR) and Decoupled\nSemi-supervised Optimization (DSO). In particular, MPR improves the quality of\npseudo-labels via augmented-view refinement and global-view filtering, and DSO\nhandles the joint optimization conflicts via structure tweaks and task-specific\npseudo-labeling. In addition, we also carefully revise the implementation of\nYOLOv5 to maximize the benefits of SSOD, which is also shared with the existing\nSSOD methods for fair comparison. To validate OneTeacher, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on COCO and Pascal VOC.

Jain et al.

In this mission phase, the spacecraft\nobserves the celestial body rotating and tracks features in images.

This electric\nfield modulation of the excitonic states in monolayer TMDs provides a paradigm\nof the manipulation of 2D excitons for potential applications of the\nelectro-optical modulation in 2D semiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 13:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

This innovative\ntechnique permits the study of energetic plasma by means of analysing the\nresult of the interaction of this plasma with a neutral thermal population or\nwith a surface. The main advantage, when compared to the direct ion detection,\nis that it is possible to have an instantaneous survey of the whole\nmagnetosphere of a planet. An example could help. Before the first ENA data,\nmost of the knowledge about the Earth magnetospheric plasma came from in situ\nmeasurements of ions, electrons and electromagnetic fields. Those measurements,\nof course, could not represent any real instantaneous situation, but only an\naveraged picture of it, since the temporal and spatial variation cannot be\neasily be distinguished. Some short time scale phenomena, such as substorms,\nhave been found difficult to comprehend without a global and continuous\nimaging. Even if some information about the plasma may be extracted from other\nsources, such as UV imaging [like aurorae, e.g. Horwitz, 1987], some\npopulations (for example, the ring current) remained invisible. Furthermore,\nneutral atom imaging gives information not only about the energetic plasma, but\nalso about the thermal neutral population (in the case of charge-exchange) or\nabout the surface composition (in the case of sputtering). Conversely, it is\nnecessary to set up some dedicated unfolding techniques to recover the 3D\nplasma distributions from the 2D ENA images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 13:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

To this end, we\npropose an elegant framework, dubbed as SeMani, forming the Semantic\nManipulation of real-world images that can not only edit the appearance of\nentities but also generate new entities corresponding to the text guidance.

In the image manipulation phase,\nSeMani adopts a generative model to synthesize new images conditioned on the\nentity-irrelevant regions and target text descriptions.

However, due to\nthe risks and uncertainty, a crucial and urgent problem to be settled is\nestablishing reliable relationships within SIoT, that is, trust evaluation.\nGraph neural networks for trust evaluation typically adopt a straightforward\nway such as one-hot or node2vec to comprehend node characteristics, which\nignores the valuable semantic knowledge attached to nodes. Moreover, the\nunderlying structure of SIoT is usually complex, including both the\nheterogeneous graph structure and pairwise trust relationships, which renders\nhard to preserve the properties of SIoT trust during information propagation.\nTo address these aforementioned problems, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced\ngraph neural network (KGTrust) for better trust evaluation in SIoT.\nSpecifically, we first extract useful knowledge from users' comment behaviors\nand external structured triples related to object descriptions, in order to\ngain a deeper insight into the semantics of users and objects.

At the point of tangency\nof the arctic curve with the domain-boundary, the tiles of a certain shape form\nfor large-size domains a singly interlacing set, fluctuating according to the\neigenvalues of the principal minors of a GUE-matrix (Gaussian unitary\nensemble). Introducing non-convexities in large domains may lead to the\nappearance of several interacting liquid regions: they can merely touch,\nleading to either a split tacnode (also called hard tacnode), with two distinct\nadjacent frozen phases descending into the tacnode, or a soft tacnode. For\nappropriate scaling of the nonconvex domains and probing about such split\ntacnodes, filaments of tiles of a certain type will connect the liquid patches:\nthey evolve in a bricklike-sea of dimers of another type.

The dynamic coupling to the liquid phase is modeled through local\nvolume averaging. The second approach is stochastic; ensemble-phase averaging\nis used to derive mixture-averaged equations and field equations for the\nassociated bubble properties are evolved in an Eulerian reference frame.

However, we discover that it is still plagued by\ntwo challenges: A, the quality of the identified bias-conflicting samples is\nfar from satisfactory; B, the emphasizing strategies only produce suboptimal\nperformance. In this paper, for challenge A, we propose an effective\nbias-conflicting scoring method (ECS) to boost the identification accuracy,\nalong with two practical strategies -- peer-picking and epoch-ensemble. For\nchallenge B, we point out that the gradient contribution statistics can be a\nreliable indicator to inspect whether the optimization is dominated by\nbias-aligned samples.

However, the large variations in the appearance of different nuclei\ntypes cause difficulties in identifying nuclei. Most neural network based\nmethods are affected by the local receptive field of convolutions, and pay less\nattention to the spatial distribution of nuclei or the irregular contour shape\nof a nucleus. In this paper, we first propose a novel polygon-structure feature\nlearning mechanism that transforms a nucleus contour into a sequence of points\nsampled in order, and employ a recurrent neural network that aggregates the\nsequential change in distance between key points to obtain learnable shape\nfeatures. Next, we convert a histopathology image into a graph structure with\nnuclei as nodes, and build a graph neural network to embed the spatial\ndistribution of nuclei into their representations. To capture the correlations\nbetween the categories of nuclei and their surrounding tissue patterns, we\nfurther introduce edge features that are defined as the background textures\nbetween adjacent nuclei.

Numerous quantum measurement techniques have been\ndeveloped recently, but it is unclear how these state-of-the-art measurement\ntechniques will perform in extensions of VQE for obtaining excited electronic\nstates. Assessing the measurement techniques' performance in the excited state\nVQE is crucial because the measurement requirements in these extensions are\ntypically much greater than in conventional VQE, as one must measure the\nexpectation value of multiple observables in addition to that of the electronic\nHamiltonian.

In contrast, randomized measurement techniques are\nmore appropriate for quantum subspace expansion, with many more observables of\nvastly different energy scales to measure.

Moreover,\nend-to-end training of policies often requires a large number of labeled data\nor training iterations to reach convergence. In this paper, we present a novel\nImperative Learning (IL) approach. This approach leverages a differentiable\ncost map to provide implicit supervision during policy training, eliminating\nthe need for demonstrations or labeled trajectories. Furthermore, the policy\ntraining adopts a Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) process, which combines network\nupdate and metric-based trajectory optimization, to generate a smooth and\ncollision-free path toward the goal based on a single depth measurement. The\nproposed method allows task-level costs of predicted trajectories to be\nbackpropagated through all components to update the network through direct\ngradient descent. In our experiments, the method demonstrates around 4x faster\nplanning than the classic approach and robustness against localization noise.\nAdditionally, the IL approach enables the planner to generalize to various\nunseen environments, resulting in an overall 26-87% improvement in SPL\nperformance compared to baseline learning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 15:16:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 20:08:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 22:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

In\nprinciple, we can use data from multiple arms testing varying combinations to\njointly estimate toxicity of the drug combinations. However, such efforts have\nhighlighted limitations when modelling drug-drug interactions in the Bayesian\nLogistic Regression Model (BLRM) framework used to ensure patient safety.\nPrevious models either do not account for non-monotonicity due to antagonistic\ntoxicity, or exhibit the fundamental flaw of exponentially overpowering the\ncontributions of the individual drugs in the dose-response.

However,\nthe use of a uniaxial compressive stress as an additional external stimulus to\na magnetic field requires good mechanical stability. Improvement of mechanical\nstability and strength by doping has been shown in several studies. However,\ndoping is always accompanied by grain refinement and a change in transition\ntemperature. This raises the question of the extent to which mechanical\nstrength is related to grain refinement, transition temperature, or\nprecipitates. This study shows a direct comparison between a single-phase\nNi-Mn-Sn and a two-phase Gd-doped Ni-Mn-In alloy with the same transition\ntemperature and grain size. It is shown that the excellent magnetocaloric\nproperties of the Ni-Mn-In matrix are maintained with doping. The isothermal\nentropy change and adiabatic temperature change are reduced by only 15% in the\ntwo-phase Ni-Mn-In-Heusler alloy compared to the single-phase alloy, which is\nresulting from a slight increase in thermal hysteresis and the width of the\ntransition. Due to the same grain size and transition temperature, this effect\ncan be directly related to the precipitates. The introduction of Gd\nprecipitates leads to a 100% improvement in mechanical strength, which is\nsignificantly lower than the improvement observed for Ni-Mn-In alloys with\ngrain refinement and Gd precipitates. This reveals that a significant\ncontribution to the improved mechanical stability in Gd-doped Heusler alloys is\nrelated to grain refinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 15:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

However, economic growth,\nrobustness, and resilience crucially depend on the detailed structure of\nnon-aggregated firm-level production networks (FPNs). Due to non-availability\nof data little is known about how much aggregated sector-based and detailed\nfirm-level-based model-predictions differ. Using a nearly complete nationwide\nFPN, containing 243,399 Hungarian firms with 1,104,141 supplier-buyer-relations\nwe self-consistently compare production losses on the aggregated industry-level\nproduction network (IPN) and the granular FPN. For this we model the\npropagation of shocks of the same size on both, the IPN and FPN, where the\nlatter captures relevant heterogeneities within industries. In a COVID-19\ninspired scenario we model the shock based on detailed firm-level data during\nthe early pandemic.

However,\ndetecting MDS signals in STEM is challenging due to their overlap with the\nstronger thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) signals. In bcc Fe at 300~K, MDS\nsignals greater than or comparable to TDS signals occur under the central Bragg\ndisk, into a currently inaccesible energy-loss region. Therefore, to detect MDS\nin STEM, it is necessary to identify conditions in which TDS and MDS signals\ncan be distinguished from one another. Temperature may be a key factor due to\nthe distinct thermal signatures of magnon and phonon signals. In this work, we\npresent a study on the effects of temperature on MDS and TDS in bcc Fe --\nconsidering a detector outside the central Bragg disk -- using the frozen\nphonon and frozen magnon multislice methods. Our study reveals that neglecting\nthe effects of atomic vibrations causes the MDS signal to grow approximately\nlinearly up to the Curie temperature of Fe, after which it exhibits less\nvariation. The MDS signal displays an alternating behavior due to dynamical\ndiffraction, instead of increasing monotonically as a function of thickness.\nThe inclusion of the Debye-Waller factor (DWF) causes the linear growth of the\nMDS signal to change to an oscillatory behavior that exhibits a predominant\npeak for each thickness, which increases and shifts to higher temperatures as\nthe thickness increases. In contrast, the TDS signal grows more linearly than\nthe MDS signal (with DWF) but still exhibits dynamical diffraction effects.

Although it is computationally\nefficient to construct $k$-nn graphs, the constructed graph might not be very\nuseful for learning. In a $k$-nn graph, points are restricted to have a fixed\nnumber of edges, and all edges in the graph have equal weights. We present a\nnew way to construct the graph and initialize the GCN.

Our DMMG consists of a viewpoint variation\nmin-max game and an edge perturbation min-max game. These two min-max games\nadopt an adversarial paradigm to perform data augmentation on the skeleton\nsequences and graph-structured body joints, respectively. Our viewpoint\nvariation min-max game focuses on constructing various hard contrastive pairs\nby generating skeleton sequences from various viewpoints. These hard\ncontrastive pairs help our model learn representative action features, thus\nfacilitating model transfer to downstream tasks. Moreover, our edge\nperturbation min-max game specializes in building diverse hard contrastive\nsamples through perturbing connectivity strength among graph-based body joints.\nThe connectivity-strength varying contrastive pairs enable the model to capture\nminimal sufficient information of different actions, such as representative\ngestures for an action while preventing the model from overfitting. By fully\nexploiting the proposed DMMG, we can generate sufficient challenging\ncontrastive pairs and thus achieve discriminative action feature\nrepresentations from unlabeled skeleton data in a self-supervised manner.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior results\nunder various evaluation protocols on widely-used NTU-RGB+D and NTU120-RGB+D\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 08:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

To address above\nchallenges, we systematically summarize the distribution shift in TSF into two\ncategories. Regarding lookback windows as input-space and horizon windows as\noutput-space, there exist (i) intra-space shift, that the distribution within\nthe input-space keeps shifted over time, and (ii) inter-space shift, that the\ndistribution is shifted between input-space and output-space. Then we\nintroduce, Dish-TS, a general neural paradigm for alleviating distribution\nshift in TSF. Specifically, for better distribution estimation, we propose the\ncoefficient net (CONET), which can be any neural architectures, to map input\nsequences into learnable distribution coefficients. To relieve intra-space and\ninter-space shift, we organize Dish-TS as a Dual-CONET framework to separately\nlearn the distribution of input- and output-space, which naturally captures the\ndistribution difference of two spaces. In addition, we introduce a more\neffective training strategy for intractable CONET learning. Finally, we conduct\nextensive experiments on several datasets coupled with different\nstate-of-the-art forecasting models. Experimental results show Dish-TS\nconsistently boosts them with a more than 20% average improvement.

One fundamental question to\naddress with structural connectivity is how to properly summarize and perform\nstatistical inference for a group-level connectivity architecture, for\ninstance, under different sex groups, or disease cohorts. Existing analyses\ncommonly summarize group-level brain connectivity by a simple entry-wise sample\nmean or median across individual brain connectivity matrices. However, such a\nheuristic approach fully ignores the associations among structural connections\nand the topological properties of brain networks. In this project, we propose a\nlatent space-based generative network model to estimate group-level brain\nconnectivity. We name our method the attributes-informed brain connectivity\n(ABC) model, which compared with existing group-level connectivity estimations,\n(1) offers an interpretable latent space representation of the group-level\nconnectivity, (2) incorporates the anatomical knowledge of nodes and tests its\nco-varying relationship with connectivity and (3) quantifies the uncertainty\nand evaluates the likelihood of the estimated group-level effects against\nchance. We devise a novel Bayesian MCMC algorithm to estimate the model. By\napplying the ABC model to study brain structural connectivity stratified by sex\namong Alzheimer's Disease (AD) subjects and healthy controls incorporating the\nanatomical attributes (volume, thickness and area) on nodes, our method shows\nsuperior predictive power on out-of-sample structural connectivity and\nidentifies meaningful sex-specific network neuromarkers for AD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 21:20:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}
