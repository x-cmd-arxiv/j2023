Ideally, we could\nleverage an explicit external knowledge base to supplement contextual and\ncultural information in hateful memes. However, there is no known explicit\nexternal knowledge base that could provide such hate speech contextual\ninformation. To address this gap, we propose PromptHate, a simple yet effective\nprompt-based model that prompts pre-trained language models (PLMs) for hateful\nmeme classification. Specifically, we construct simple prompts and provide a\nfew in-context examples to exploit the implicit knowledge in the pre-trained\nRoBERTa language model for hateful meme classification. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on two publicly available hateful and offensive meme datasets. Our\nexperimental results show that PromptHate is able to achieve a high AUC of\n90.96, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on the hateful meme\nclassification task. We also perform fine-grained analyses and case studies on\nvarious prompt settings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the prompts on\nhateful meme classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 16:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

Unfortunately, existing\nmethods fail to test them comprehensively, as they typically focus on finding\nthe simplest-to-craft manipulations for a testing goal, and are also unable to\ndetermine when a test is simply a minor permutation of another, i.e. based on\nthe same causal events. In this work, we propose a guided fuzzing approach for\nfinding 'meaningfully different' tests for an ICS via a general formalisation\nof sensor/actuator-manipulation strategies. Our algorithm identifies the causal\nevents in a test, generalises them to an equivalence class, and then updates\nthe fuzzing strategy so as to find new tests that are causally different from\nthose already identified. An evaluation of our approach on a real-world water\ntreatment system shows that it is able to find 106% more causally different\ntests than the most comparable fuzzer.

In addition\nto finding a solution with minimum cost, problems of high relevance involve a\nnumber of constraints that the solution must satisfy. Variational quantum\nalgorithms have emerged as promising candidates for solving these problems in\nthe noisy intermediate-scale quantum stage. However, the constraints are often\ncomplex enough to make their efficient mapping to quantum hardware difficult or\neven infeasible. An alternative standard approach is to transform the\noptimization problem to include these constraints as penalty terms, but this\nmethod involves additional hyperparameters and does not ensure that the\nconstraints are satisfied due to the existence of local minima. In this paper,\nwe introduce a new method for solving combinatorial optimization problems with\nchallenging constraints using variational quantum algorithms.

To elucidate the\nrole of reservoir fluctuations in a long-time evolution of nonclassicality and\nentanglement, we consider and compare the predictions from two alternative\nmodels in which no fatal long-time detrimental effects on the nonclassicality\nand entanglement are observed.

In\norder to explain this evidence and assess ancient Mars's habitability, one must\nunderstand the size and composition of the ancient atmosphere. Here we place\nconstraints on the ancient Martian atmosphere by modeling the coupled,\nself-consistent evolution of atmospheric CO2, N2, and Ar on Mars from 3.8\nbillion years ago (Ga) to the present. Our model traces the evolution of these\nspecies' abundances and isotopic composition caused by atmospheric escape,\nvolcanic outgassing, and crustal interaction. Using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo\nmethod to explore a plausible range of parameters, we find hundreds of\nthousands of model solutions that recreate the modern Martian atmosphere. These\nsolutions indicate that Mars's atmosphere contained 0.3-1.5 bar CO2 and 0.1-0.5\nbar N2 at 3.8 Ga. The global volume of deposited carbonates critically\ndetermines the ancient atmospheric composition. For example, a ~1 bar CO2\nancient atmosphere with 0.2-0.4 bar N2 requires ~0.9 bar CO2 deposited in\ncarbonates primarily in open-water systems. With the joint analysis of C, N,\nand Ar isotopes, we refine the constraints on the relative strengths of\noutgassing and sputtering, leading to an indication of a reduced early mantle\nfrom which the outgassing is sourced.

The presence of cool circum-galactic matter\ngravitationally bound to its galaxy's halo up to distances of at least ten\ntimes the size of the galaxy's disk, mitigates the problem but is far from\nbeing sufficient for its solution. It has instead been suggested, that the\ngalaxy missing baryons may hide in a much hotter gaseous phase of the\ncircum-galactic medium, possibly near the halo virial temperature and\nco-existing with the cool phase.

Their intrinsically small\nsize, i.e., 1-2 nm, enables them to sense fields at short distances and in\nvarious geometries. This feature, in conjunction with tunable optical read-out\nof spin information, offers the potential for molecular color centers to be a\nparadigm shifting materials class beyond diamond-NV centers by accessing a\ndistance scale opaque to NVs. This capability could, for example, address\nambiguity in the reported magnetic fields arising from two-dimensional magnets\nby allowing for a single sensing technique to be used over a wider range of\ndistances. Yet, so far, these abilities have only been hypothesized with\ntheoretical validation absent. We show through simulation that\nCr($o$-tolyl)$_{4}$ can spatially resolve proximity-exchange versus direct\nmagnetic field effects from monolayer CrI$_{3}$ by quantifying how these\ninteractions impact the excited states of the molecule. At short distances,\nproximity exchange dominates through molecule-substrate interactions, but at\nfurther distances the molecule behaves as a typical magnetic sensor, with\nmagnetostatic effects dominating changes to the energy of the excited state.\nOur models effectively demonstrate how a molecular color center could be used\nto measure the magnetic field of a 2D magnet and the role different\ndistance-dependent interactions contribute to the measured field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 18:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

We estimated B_lon by applying the weak-field\napproximation (WFA) to high-spatial-resolution Ca II 854.2 nm data taken with\nthe Swedish 1m Solar Telescope. Specifically, we analyzed the estimates\ninferred for different spectral ranges using the data at the original cadence\nand temporally integrated signals. The longitudinal magnetic field in each\nconsidered plasma structure correlates with its size. Using a spectral range\nrestricted to the line core leads to chromospheric longitudinal fields varying\nfrom 50 G at the edges to 150-500 G at the center of the structure. These\nvalues increase as the spectral range widens due to the photospheric\ncontribution. However, the difference between this contribution and the\nchromospheric one is not uniform for all structures. Small and medium-sized\nconcentrations show a steeper height gradient in B_lon compared to their\nchromospheric values, so estimates for wider ranges are less trustworthy.\nSignal addition does not alleviate this situation as the height gradients in\nB_lon are consistent with time. Finally, despite the amplified noise levels\nthat deconvolving processes may cause, data restored with the destretching\ntechnique show similar results, though are affected by smearing.

We investigate the occurrence of out-of-band\nresonances (OBR) which could constrain the bandwidth of the FDM readout of TES\nbolometers. The study includes SPICE modeling of the entire setup including the\ncryogenic harness, LC filters, Superconducting Quantum Interference Device\n(SQUID) and room-temperature amplifier. Simulation results show that the long\nharness (for flight model) could cause multiple reflections that generate\nrepetitive spikes in the spectrum. Peaks of the OBR are mainly due to the\nparasitic capacitances at the input of SQUID. Implementing a low-pass RC\ncircuit (snubber) at the input of the SQUID dampened the OBR. As a result, the\nfirst peak only appears around 20 MHz which is a safe margin for the 1 MHz-3.8\nMHz FDM in use in the prototype readout. Using a spectrum analyzer and\nbroadband LNAs,we also measured the OBR for the prototype FDM readout in the\nlab up to 500 MHz. The measurement was conducted at temperatures of 50 mK and 4\nK and for various biasing of the DC SQUID. It turns out that OBR are more\nintense at 50 mK and are caused by the harness impedance mismatch rather than\nthe SQUID.

These systems also\ntend to split information transmitted between any two components across\nmultiple channels. A common hypothesis is that such inverse multiplexing\nstrategies reduce total thermodynamic costs. So far, however, there have been\nno physics-based results supporting this hypothesis. This gap existed partially\nbecause we have lacked a theoretical framework that addresses the interplay of\nthermodynamics and information in off-equilibrium systems at any spatiotemporal\nscale. Here we present the first study that rigorously combines such a\nframework, stochastic thermodynamics, with Shannon information theory. We\ndevelop a minimal model that captures the fundamental features common to a wide\nvariety of communication systems. We find that the thermodynamic cost in this\nmodel is a convex function of the channel capacity, the canonical measure of\nthe communication capability of a channel. We also find that this function is\nnot always monotonic, in contrast to previous results not derived from first\nprinciples physics. These results clarify when and how to split a single\ncommunication stream across multiple channels. In particular, we present Pareto\nfronts that reveal the trade-off between thermodynamic costs and channel\ncapacity when inverse multiplexing. Due to the generality of our model, our\nfindings could help explain empirical observations of how thermodynamic costs\nof information transmission make inverse multiplexing energetically favorable\nin many real-world communication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 20:30:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 02:12:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 15:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

There\nare two complexity classes that can be considered quantum analogues of\nclassical free games: (1) AM*, the multiprover interactive proof class\ncorresponding to free games with entangled players, and, somewhat less\nobviously, (2) BellQMA(2), the class of quantum Merlin-Arthur proof systems\nwith two unentangled Merlins, whose proof states are separately measured by\nArthur. In this work, we make significant progress towards a tight\ncharacterization of both of these classes. 1. We show a BellQMA(2) protocol for\n3SAT on $n$ variables, where the total amount of communication is\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$.

The\nexperiment results demonstrate the proposed method can avoid tag jumping and\noutperform the existing methods on tongue motion estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 20:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

The idea of real-time processing is especially\nimportant in audio domain as the human perception of sound is sensitive to any\nkind of disturbance in perceived signals, especially the lag between auditory\nand visual modalities. The rise of deep learning (DL) models complicated the\nlandscape of signal processing. Although they often have superior quality\ncompared to standard DSP methods, this advantage is diminished by higher\nlatency. In this work we propose novel method for minimization of inference\ntime latency and memory consumption, called Short-Term Memory Convolution\n(STMC) and its transposed counterpart. The main advantage of STMC is the low\nlatency comparable to long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Furthermore, the\ntraining of STMC-based models is faster and more stable as the method is based\nsolely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this study we demonstrate an\napplication of this solution to a U-Net model for a speech separation task and\nGhostNet model in acoustic scene classification (ASC) task. In case of speech\nseparation we achieved a 5-fold reduction in inference time and a 2-fold\nreduction in latency without affecting the output quality.

Our research finds that, after training an Android malware\nclassifier on one year's worth of data, the F1 score quickly dropped from 0.99\nto 0.76 after 6 months of deployment on new test samples.\n  In this paper, we propose new methods to combat the concept drift problem of\nAndroid malware classifiers.

Our key idea is, similarity-based uncertainty is more\nrobust against concept drift. Therefore, we combine contrastive learning with\nactive learning. We propose a new hierarchical contrastive learning scheme, and\na new sample selection technique to continuously train the Android malware\nclassifier. Our evaluation shows that this leads to significant improvements,\ncompared to previously published methods for active learning.

We consider and computationally model mechanisms by which humoral\nmemory present at baseline might instead increase infection load; we refer to\nthis effect as EI-HM (enhancement of infection by humoral memory). We first\nconsider antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) in which antibody enhances the\ngrowth of the pathogen, typically a virus, and typically at intermediate\n\"Goldilocks\" levels of antibody. Our ADE model reproduces ADE in vitro and\nenhancement of infection in vivo from passive antibody transfer. But notably\nthe simplest implementation of our ADE model never results in EI-HM. Adding\ncomplexity, by making the cross-reactive antibody much less neutralizing than\nthe de novo generated antibody or by including a sufficiently strong\nnon-antibody immune response, allows for ADE-mediated EI-HM. We next consider\nthe possibility that cross-reactive memory causes EI-HM by crowding out a\npossibly superior de novo immune response. We show that, even without ADE,\nEI-HM can occur when the cross-reactive response is both less potent and\n\"directly\" (i.e. independently of infection load) suppressive with regard to\nthe de novo response. In this case adding a non-antibody immune response to our\ncomputational model greatly reduces or completely eliminates EI-HM, which\nsuggests that \"crowding out\" is unlikely to cause substantial EI-HM. Hence, our\nresults provide examples in which simple models give qualitatively opposite\nresults compared to models with plausible complexity.

As a result, more and more research efforts have been\ndedicated to testing DL libraries and frameworks. However, existing work\nlargely overlooked one crucial component of any DL system, automatic\ndifferentiation (AD), which is the basis for the recent development of DL. To\nthis end, we propose $\\nabla$Fuzz, the first general and practical approach\nspecifically targeting the critical AD component in DL libraries. Our key\ninsight is that each DL library API can be abstracted into a function\nprocessing tensors/vectors, which can be differentially tested under various\nexecution scenarios (for computing outputs/gradients with different\nimplementations). We have implemented $\\nabla$Fuzz as a fully automated\nAPI-level fuzzer targeting AD in DL libraries, which utilizes differential\ntesting on different execution scenarios to test both first-order and\nhigh-order gradients, and also includes automated filtering strategies to\nremove false positives caused by numerical instability. We have performed an\nextensive study on four of the most popular and actively-maintained DL\nlibraries, PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, and OneFlow. The result shows that\n$\\nabla$Fuzz substantially outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in terms of\nboth code coverage and bug detection. To date, $\\nabla$Fuzz has detected 173\nbugs for the studied DL libraries, with 144 already confirmed by developers\n(117 of which are previously unknown bugs and 107 are related to AD).\nRemarkably, $\\nabla$Fuzz contributed 58.3% (7/12) of all high-priority AD bugs\nfor PyTorch and JAX during a two-month period.

The identification of parametric choice-based demand\nmodels is typically straightforward. However, nonparametric models, which are\nhighly effective and flexible in explaining customer choice, may encounter the\nchallenge of the dimensionality curse, hindering their identification. A\nprominent example of a nonparametric model is the ranking-based model, which\nmirrors the random utility maximization (RUM) class and is known to be\nnonidentifiable from the collection of choice probabilities alone. Our\nobjective in this paper is to develop a new class of nonparametric models that\nis not subject to the problem of nonidentifiability. Our model assumes bounded\nrationality of consumers, which results in symmetric demand cannibalization and\nintriguingly enables full identification. Additionally, our choice model\ndemonstrates competitive prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks in a real-world case study, despite incorporating the assumption of\nbounded rationality which could, in theory, limit the representation power of\nour model.\n  In addition, we tackle the important problem of finding the optimal\nassortment under the proposed choice model. We demonstrate the NP-hardness of\nthis problem and provide a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme through\ndynamic programming. Additionally, we propose an efficient estimation framework\nusing a combination of column generation and expectation-maximization\nalgorithms, which proves to be more tractable than the estimation algorithm of\nthe aforementioned ranking-based model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 22:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

For detected\nstellar and intermediate mass compact binaries, the induced strain from the\nmemory effect is one or two orders below the detector noise background.\nAdditionally, since most of the energy is radiated at merger the strain induced\nby the memory effect resembles a step function at the merger time.

While entropy production in isotropic temperature environments can\nbe expressed in terms of the length (in the Wasserstein-2 metric) traversed by\nthe thermodynamic state of the system, anisotropy complicates substantially the\nmechanism of entropy production since, besides dissipation, seepage of energy\nbetween ambient anisotropic heat sources by way of the system dynamics is often\na major contributing factor.

Here, we assess the\nperformance of over 600 model chemistries in scaled harmonic frequencies\ncalculations evaluating different scaling factors types.\n  We can summarise our results into three main findings: (1) using model\nchemistry-specific scaling factors optimised for three different frequency\nregions (low (below 1,000cm-1), mid (1,000-2,000cm-1), and high (above\n2,000cm-1)) results in better agreement between the scaled harmonic and\nexperimental frequencies compared to other choices; (2) larger basis sets and\nmore robust levels of theory generally lead to superior performance; however,\nthe particular model chemistry choice matters; and (3) outliers should be\nexpected in routine calculations.\n  In terms of specific recommendations, overall, the highest accuracy model\nchemistries are double-hybrid functionals with non-Pople augmented triple-zeta\nbasis sets, which can produce median frequency errors of down to 7.6cm-1\n(DSD-PBEP86/def2-TZVPD) lying close to the error in the harmonic approximation.\nDouble-zeta basis sets should not be used with double-hybrid functionals as\nthere is no improvement compared to hybrid functionals.

Since different consumers might respond differently to\nincentives, individual-level budget allocation is an essential task in\nmarketing campaigns. Recent advances in this field often address the budget\nallocation problem using a two-stage paradigm: the first stage estimates the\nindividual-level treatment effects using causal inference algorithms, and the\nsecond stage invokes integer programming techniques to find the optimal budget\nallocation solution. Since the objectives of these two stages might not be\nperfectly aligned, such a two-stage paradigm could hurt the overall marketing\neffectiveness.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework to directly optimize\nthe business goal under budget constraints. Our core idea is to construct a\nregularizer to represent the marketing goal and optimize it efficiently using\ngradient estimation techniques. As such, the obtained models can learn to\nmaximize the marketing goal directly and precisely. We extensively evaluate our\nproposed method in both offline and online experiments, and experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art\nmethods.

It involves multiple iterations of a parameterised\nansatz that consists of a problem and mixer Hamiltonian, with the parameters\nbeing classically optimised. While QAOA can be implemented on near-term quantum\nhardware, physical limitations such as gate noise, restricted qubit\nconnectivity, and state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) errors can limit\ncircuit depth and decrease performance. To address these limitations, this work\nintroduces the eXpressive QAOA (XQAOA), a modified version of QAOA that assigns\nmore classical parameters to the ansatz to improve the performance of low-depth\nquantum circuits. XQAOA includes an additional Pauli-Y component in the mixer\nHamiltonian, thereby allowing the mixer to implement arbitrary unitary\ntransformations on each qubit. To benchmark the performance of the XQAOA ansatz\nat low depth, we derive its closed-form expression for the MaxCut problem and\ncompare it to QAOA, Multi-Angle QAOA (MA-QAOA), a Classical-Relaxed (CR)\nalgorithm, and the state-of-the-art Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm on a set\nof unweighted regular graphs with 128 and 256 nodes and degrees ranging from 3\nto 10. Our results show that XQAOA performs better than QAOA, MA-QAOA, and the\nCR algorithm on all graphs and outperforms the GW algorithm on graphs with\ndegrees greater than 4. Additionally, we find an infinite family of graphs for\nwhich XQAOA solves MaxCut exactly and show analytically that for some graphs in\nthis family, special cases of XQAOA can achieve a larger approximation ratio\nthan QAOA. Overall, XQAOA is a more viable choice for implementing quantum\ncombinatorial optimisation on near-term quantum devices, as it can achieve\nbetter results with a single iteration, despite requiring additional classical\nresources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 07:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

Conventional satellite or aerial-based remote sensing\n(RS) platforms can provide the necessary data sources for the 3D reconstruction\nof large-scale landforms and cities. Even with low-altitude UAVs (Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles), 3D reconstruction in complicated situations, such as urban\ncanyons and indoor scenes, is challenging due to frequent tracking failures\nbetween camera frames and high data collection costs. Recently, spherical\nimages have been extensively used due to the capability of recording\nsurrounding environments from one camera exposure. In contrast to perspective\nimages with limited FOV (Field of View), spherical images can cover the whole\nscene with full horizontal and vertical FOV and facilitate camera tracking and\ndata acquisition in these complex scenes. With the rapid evolution and\nextensive use of professional and consumer-grade spherical cameras, spherical\nimages show great potential for the 3D modeling of urban and indoor scenes.\nClassical 3D reconstruction pipelines, however, cannot be directly used for\nspherical images. Besides, there exist few software packages that are designed\nfor the 3D reconstruction of spherical images. As a result, this research\nprovides a thorough survey of the state-of-the-art for 3D reconstruction of\nspherical images in terms of data acquisition, feature detection and matching,\nimage orientation, and dense matching as well as presenting promising\napplications and discussing potential prospects.

With the use of commodity compute nodes and\nnetworks, failures such as system crashes and network partitioning are common.\nIt is therefore important for ACP to dynamically adapt to the operating\ncondition for efficiency while ensuring the consistency of the database.\nExisting ACPs often assume stable operating conditions, hence, they are either\nnon-generalizable to different environments or slow in practice.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel and practical ACP, called Failure-Aware\nAtomic Commit (FLAC). In essence, FLAC includes three protocols, which are\nspecifically designed for three different environments: (i) no failure occurs,\n(ii) participant nodes might crash but there is no delayed connection, or (iii)\nboth crashed nodes and delayed connection can occur. It models these\nenvironments as the failure-free, crash-failure, and network-failure robustness\nlevels. During its operation, FLAC can monitor if any failure occurs and\ndynamically switch to operate the most suitable protocol, using a robustness\nlevel state machine, whose parameters are fine-tuned by reinforcement learning.\nConsequently, it improves both the response time and throughput, and\neffectively handles nodes distributed across the Internet where crash and\nnetwork failures might occur. We implement FLAC in a distributed transactional\nkey-value storage system based on Google Percolator and evaluate its\nperformance with both a micro benchmark and a macro benchmark of real workload.\nThe results show that FLAC achieves up to 2.22x throughput improvement and\n2.82x latency speedup, compared to existing ACPs for high-contention workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 08:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 13:15:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 06:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Upon\ncomputing these explicitly, and calculating their cosmological parameter\nbiases, using a maximum multipole of $\\ell=5000$, we find that the\nmagnification bias, source-lens clustering, source obscuration, and local\nUniverse terms individually produce significant ($\\,>0.25\\sigma$) cosmological\nbiases in one or more parameters, and accordingly must be accounted for.

Methods:\nFrom the autoregressive model can be derived the Yule-Walker equations, which\nshow the emergence of a symmetric positive definite matrix: the augmented\ncovariance matrix. The state-of the art for classifying covariance matrices is\nbased on Riemannian Geometry. A fairly natural idea is therefore to extend the\nstandard approach using these augmented covariance matrices. The methodology\nfor creating the augmented covariance matrix shows a natural connection with\nthe delay embedding theorem proposed by Takens for dynamical systems. Such an\nembedding method is based on the knowledge of two parameters: the delay and the\nembedding dimension, respectively related to the lag and the order of the\nautoregressive model. This approach provides new methods to compute the\nhyper-parameters in addition to standard grid search. Results: The augmented\ncovariance matrix performed noticeably better than any state-of-the-art\nmethods. We will test our approach on several datasets and several subjects\nusing the MOABB framework, using both within-session and cross-session\nevaluation.

Many accidents are caused by distracted drivers, who take\ntheir attention away from driving. Motivated by the success of Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision, many researchers developed CNN-based\nalgorithms to recognize distracted driving from a dashcam and warn the driver\nagainst unsafe behaviors. However, current models have too many parameters,\nwhich is unfeasible for vehicle-mounted computing. This work proposes a novel\nknowledge-distillation-based framework to solve this problem. The proposed\nframework first constructs a high-performance teacher network by progressively\nstrengthening the robustness to illumination changes from shallow to deep\nlayers of a CNN. Then, the teacher network is used to guide the architecture\nsearching process of a student network through knowledge distillation. After\nthat, we use the teacher network again to transfer knowledge to the student\nnetwork by knowledge distillation. Experimental results on the Statefarm\nDistracted Driver Detection Dataset and AUC Distracted Driver Dataset show that\nthe proposed approach is highly effective for recognizing distracted driving\nbehaviors from photos: (1) the teacher network's accuracy surpasses the\nprevious best accuracy; (2) the student network achieves very high accuracy\nwith only 0.42M parameters (around 55% of the previous most lightweight model).\nFurthermore, the student network architecture can be extended to a\nspatial-temporal 3D CNN for recognizing distracted driving from video clips.\nThe 3D student network largely surpasses the previous best accuracy with only\n2.03M parameters on the Drive&Act Dataset.

The explainability of decisions is crucial for users to develop trust\non these systems. In recent years, the globally-consistent rule-based\nsummary-explanation and its max-support (MS) problem have been proposed, which\ncan provide explanations for particular decisions along with useful statistics\nof the dataset. However, globally-consistent summary-explanations with limited\ncomplexity typically have small supports, if there are any. In this paper, we\npropose a relaxed version of summary-explanation, i.e., the $q$-consistent\nsummary-explanation, which aims to achieve greater support at the cost of\nslightly lower consistency. The challenge is that the max-support problem of\n$q$-consistent summary-explanation (MSqC) is much more complex than the\noriginal MS problem, resulting in over-extended solution time using standard\nbranch-and-bound solvers. To improve the solution time efficiency, this paper\nproposes the weighted column sampling~(WCS) method based on solving smaller\nproblems by sampling variables according to their simplified increase support\n(SIS) values.

To better safeguard people from these harms, the\nEuropean Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) requires platforms, especially\nthose with large numbers of users, to make their algorithmic systems more\ntransparent and follow due diligence obligations.

Besides, the hump-like Hall effect anomaly, which might have a\ntopological origin, has also been reported for this material. Here, we show\nthat the emergence of such phenomena is governed by the degree of scattering\ndetermined by the defect density (Ru-deficiency- and/or interface-driven-defect\nscattering) and measurement temperature (phonon scattering), where the former\nis controlled by varying the growth conditions of the SrRuO3 films in molecular\nbeam epitaxy as well as the film thickness. The resulting electronic transport\nproperties can be classified into three categories: clean, intermediate, and\ndirty regimes. The transport of Weyl fermions emerges in the clean regime,\nwhereas that of topologically trivial conduction electrons in the ferromagnetic\nmetal state prevail in the intermediate and dirty regimes. In the clean and\nintermediate regimes, anomalous Hall resistivity obeys a scaling law\nincorporating the intrinsic Karplus-Luttinger (Berry phase) and extrinsic\nside-jump mechanisms. The hump-like Hall effect anomaly is observed only in the\ndirty regime, which is contrary to the scaling law between anomalous Hall\nresistivity and longitudinal resistivity. Hence, we conclude that this anomaly\nis not inherent to the material and does not have a topological origin. We also\nprovide defect- and temperature-dependent transport phase diagrams of\nstoichiometric SrRuO3 and Ru-deficient SrRu0.7O3 where the appearance of Weyl\nfermions and hump-like Hall effect anomaly are mapped.

Among them, the phase change heat transfer\ndevices such as heat pipes and vapour chambers have shown tremendous potential.\nThese devices rely on the physics of capillary-driven thin-film evaporation\nwhich is inherently coupled with the design and optimization of the evaporator\nwicks used in these devices. Here, we introduce a biomimetic evaporator wick\ndesign inspired by the peristome of the Nepenthes alata that can achieve\nsignificantly enhanced evaporative cooling. It consists of array of\nmicropillars with multiple wedges along the sidewall of each micropillar. The\nefficacy of the wedged micropillar is evaluated based on a validated numerical\nmodel on the metrics of dryout heat flux and effective heat transfer\ncoefficient. The wedge angle is chosen such that wedged micropillars cause\nliquid filaments to rise along the micropillar vertical walls. This results in\na significant increase in thin-film area for evaporation. Additionally, the\nlarge mean curvature of the liquid meniscus produces strong capillary pumping\npressure and simultaneously, the wedges increase the overall permeability of\nthe wick. Consequently, our model predicts that the wedged micropillar wick can\nattain ~234% enhancement of dryout heat flux compared to a conventional\ncylindrical micropillar wick of similar geometrical dimensions. Moreover, the\nwedged micropillars can also attain higher effective heat transfer coefficient\nunder dryout conditions thus outperforming the cylindrical micropillar in terms\nof heat transfer efficiency.

For the challenging\nproblem, we first construct a teacher-student learning baseline by stabilizing\nthe predictions under data augmentation and network ensembles.

Crowded star\nformation regions typically feature strong nebular emission, both in emission\nlines and continuum. In this work, nebular emission is referred to as nebular\ncontamination. Nebular contamination can obscure the light from the stars,\nmaking it more challenging to obtain high quality spectra. The amount of the\nnebular contamination mainly depends on the brightness distribution of the\nobserved `scene'.

We provide comprehensive mathematical analysis of\nextinction and persistence scenarios for both prey and predator species. To\nbetter explore the dynamics of the system, a thorough investigation of\nbifurcation analysis has been performed using fear level, prey birth rate, and\nprey death rate caused by intra-prey competition as bifurcation parameter. All\npotential occurrences of bi-stability dynamics have also been investigated for\nsome relevant sets of parametric values. Our numerical evaluations show that\nhigh levels of fear can stabilize the prey-predator system by ruling out the\npossibility of periodic solutions. Also, our model Hopf bifurcation is\nsubcritical in contrast to traditional prey-predator models, which ignore the\ncost of fear and have supercritical Hopf bifurcations in general. In contrast\nto the general trend, predator species go extinct at higher values of prey\nbirth rates. We have also found that, contrary to the typical tendency for prey\nspecies to go extinct, both prey and predator populations may coexist in the\nsystem as intra-prey competition level grows noticeably. The stability and\nTuring instability of associated spatial model have also been investigated\nanalytically.

In this paper two\neccentric eclipsing binary systems, TYC 5378-1590-1 and TYC 8378-252-1, are\nstudied in detail for the first time. Methods: Radial velocities were obtained\nusing cross-correlation methods applied to mid-resolution spectra covering\nalmost the entire orbital phase domains of these two systems. TESS photometry\nwas used for the analysis of TYC 5378-1590-1, whereas ASAS-SN photometry was\nused for the analysis of TYC 8378-252-1. Results: We obtained the first precise\nderivation of the physical parameters of these systems. Both systems display\nmoderately eccentric orbits (e = 0.3 and 0.2) with periods of 3.7323 and 2.8776\ndays, respectively. The apsidal motion is very slow, with a duration of several\ncenturies. We present two models for the apsidal motion of TYC 5378-1590-1. The\ninternal structure constant derived from observations for TYC 8378-252-1 is\napproximately 11% lower than theoretical predictions. We discuss possible\nreasons for this discrepancy. Our analysis indicates that the components of\nboth systems are on the main sequence. The components of TYC 5378-1590-1 are\nrelatively young stars (age 600 Myr) close to the ZAMS, whereas the components\nof TYC 8378-252-1 are relatively old stars (age 4 Gyr) close to the TAMS. Our\nfinding that the circularization timescale for TYC 5378-1590-1 is 200 times\nlonger than its evolutionary age is compatible with theory; however, our the\nevolutionary age of TYC 8378-252-1 is approximately ten times longer than the\ncirculation age, while its orbital eccentricity is quite high (e= 0.2),\nchallenges the present theories of circularization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 12:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

We argue that current intra-image contrast\nis shallow, which suffers from spatial-level and occlusion-level variance. In\nthis paper, we present a novel deep intra-image contrastive learning using a\nSiamese network. Two key modules are spatial-invariant contrast (SIC) and\nocclusion-invariant contrast (OIC). SIC performs many-to-one contrasts between\ntwo branches of Siamese network and dense prediction contrasts in one branch of\nSiamese network.

The intermittent intervals of time when eclipses of the inner\nbinary are switched on and off are caused by a mutual 26.2 (+/- 2.6)\ninclination of the inner- and outer-orbit planes, and a favorable inclination\nof about 71 deg of the total angular momentum of the system. The nodal\nprecession period is Pv = 63.5 +/- 3.3 yr. The inner binary will remain\neclipsing for another approx 26 yr, offering an opportunity to significantly\nimprove the parameters of the model. This is especially true during the next\ndecade when the inner-orbit inclination will increase to nearly 90 degrees.\nFurther spectroscopic observations are also desirable, as they can help to\nimprove constraints on the system's orbital architecture and its physical\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 13:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

Our results produce several\nsubtle features in the electron spectra and confirm the key role of\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations on the appearance of the pseudogap. Upon\nhole doping, the electron spectra exhibit a single peak near the Fermi energy\nin the absence of AFM correlations. When AFM correlations are included, a\nsecond peak emerges at slightly lower energy and pushes the other peak to\nhigher energy, so that a pseudogap emerges between the two peaks at small\ndoping. Both peaks grow rapidly with increasing doping and eventually merge\ntogether, where the pseudogap no longer exists. Detailed analyses of the\nspectral evolution with doping and AFM correlations as well as its momentum\ndependence confirm that the lower-energy peak comes from a polaronic mechanism\ndue to the holon-spinon interaction in the AFM correlated background and the\nhigher-energy peak arises from the holon hybridization to form the electron\nquasiparticles. Thus, the pseudogap arises from the interplay of the polaronic\nand hybridization mechanisms.

The analysis of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of\nprotoplanetary disks to determine their physical properties is known to be\nhighly degenerate.

The challenge here is computational speed, as\none radiative transfer model requires a couple of minutes to compute. We\nperformed a Bayesian analysis for 30 well-known protoplanetary disks to\ndetermine their physical disk properties, including uncertainties and\ndegeneracies. To circumvent the computational cost problem, we created neural\nnetworks (NNs) to emulate the SED generation process. We created two sets of\nradiative transfer disk models to train and test two NNs that predict SEDs for\ncontinuous and discontinuous disks. A Bayesian analysis was then performed on\n30 protoplanetary disks with SED data collected by the DIANA project to\ndetermine the posterior distributions of all parameters. We ran this analysis\ntwice, (i) with old distances and additional parameter constraints as used in a\nprevious study, to compare results, and (ii) with updated distances and free\nchoice of parameters to obtain homogeneous and unbiased model parameters. We\nevaluated the uncertainties in the determination of physical disk parameters\nfrom SED analysis, and detected and quantified the strongest degeneracies.

Localised perturbations are introduced at arbitrary regions\nof a triple-periodic decaying flow at ${Re}_\\lambda \\approx 190$, and their\nevolution is used as a marker of the significance of said regions to the flow.\nTheir dimensions are found to be an important parameter, with sizes of the\norder of the integral scale being controlled by the kinetic energy content, and\nsizes within the dissipative range, by the enstrophy and dissipation. The three\nquantities are found to be important at intermediate (inertial) scales.\nProminent differences emerge between regions of high and low significance. The\nformer typically contain strong gradients and/or kinetic energy and the latter\nare weak. An analysis of the structure of significant and insignificant flow\npatterns reveals that strain is more efficient than vorticity at propagating\nthe contents of the perturbation to other regions of the flow. Moreover, the\nflow patterns of significant regions are found to be more complex, typically\ncontaining vortex clusters, while simpler vortex sheets are found in\ninsignificant regions. The present results suggest that strategies aiming to\nmanipulate the flow should focus on strain-dominated vortex clusters, avoiding\nenstrophy-dominated vortex sheets. This is confirmed through an assimilation\nexperiment, in which greater synchronisation between two simulations is\nachieved when simulations share significant regions rather than insignificant\nones. These conclusions have implications for both the control of turbulent\nflows and the making of predictions based on limited or noisy measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 13:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

To\nreproduce the observations, quite a few stochastic CF models have been\nproposed. However, while calibrating the deterministic CF models is well\ninvestigated, studies on how to calibrate the stochastic models are lacking.\nMotivated by this fact, this paper aims to address this fundamental research\ngap. Firstly, the CF experiment under the same driving environment is conducted\nand analyzed. Based on the experimental results, we test two previous\ncalibration methods, i.e., the method to minimize the Multiple Runs Mean\n(MRMean) error and the method of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).\nDeficiencies of the two methods have been identified. Next, we propose a new\nmethod to minimize the Multiple Runs Minimum (MRMin) error. Calibration based\non the experimental data and the synthetic data demonstrates that the new\nmethod outperforms the two previous methods. Furthermore, the mechanisms of\ndifferent methods are explored from the perspective of error analysis. The\nanalysis indicates that the new method can be regarded as a nested optimization\nmodel. The method separates the aleatoric errors caused by stochasticity from\nthe epistemic error caused by parameters, and it is able to deal with the two\nkinds of errors effectively. Finally, we find that under the calibration\nframework of stochastic CF models, the calibrated parameter set using spacing\nas MoP may not always outperform that using velocity as MoP. These findings are\nexpected to enhance the understanding of the role of stochasticity in CF\ndynamics where the new calibration framework for stochastic CF models is\nestablished.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 14:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

We notice that,\nbased on lensed images alone, only the Einstein radii ($R_{\\rm E}$) or the mean\nconvergence within them can be well determined, with negligible bias (typically\n$<1\\%$) and controllable uncertainty. Away from the Einstein radii, the radial\nand mean convergence profiles can hardly be constrained unless well-designed\npriors are applied to the BPL model. We find that, with rigid priors, the BPL\nmodel can clearly outperform the singular power-law models by recovering the\nlens mass distributions with small biases out to several Einstein radii (e.g.,\nno more than $5\\%$ biases for the mean convergence profiles within $3~R_{\\rm\nE}$). We find that the source light reconstructions are sensitive to both lens\nlight contamination and lens mass models, where the BPL model with rigid priors\nstill performs best when there is no lens light contamination. It is shown\nthat, by correcting for the projection effect, the BPL model is capable of\nestimating the aperture and luminosity weighted line-of-sight velocity\ndispersions to an accuracy of $\\sim6\\%$. These results further highlight the\ngreat potential of the BPL model in strong lensing related studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 14:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

To this end, we introduce a new metric, i.e.,\nthroughput-overhead-complexity (TOC), for the proposed machine learning-based\nalgorithm, which supports a trade-off between these performance indicators. In\nparticular, the decision making based on TOC is solved via deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) which determines an appropriate resource allocation policy.\n  Furthermore, for the selected algorithm, we employ the soft actor-critic\n(SAC) method which is more accurate, scalable, and robust than other learning\nmethods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed smart network\nachieves better performance in terms of TOC compared to fixed centralized or\ndistributed resource management schemes that lack dynamism.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have\nproven effective in learning the graph representations of source code and are\ncommonly adopted by existing DL-based vulnerability detection methods. However,\nthe existing methods are still limited by the fact that GNNs are essentially\ndifficult to handle the connections between long-distance nodes in a code\nstructure graph. Besides, they do not well exploit the multiple types of edges\nin a code structure graph (such as edges representing data flow and control\nflow). Consequently, despite achieving state-of-the-art performance, the\nexisting GNN-based methods tend to fail to capture global information (i.e.,\nlong-range dependencies among nodes) of code graphs.

One approach to modeling this problem mathematically is as a\nmixture of Markov chains. Recently, Gupta, Kumar and Vassilvitski [GKV16]\nintroduced an algorithm (GKV-SVD) based on the singular value decomposition\n(SVD) that under certain conditions can perfectly recover a mixture of L chains\non n states, given only the distribution of trails of length 3 (3-trail).\n  In this work we contribute to the problem of unmixing Markov chains by\nhighlighting and addressing two important constraints of the GKV-SVD algorithm\n[GKV16]: some chains in the mixture may not even be weakly connected, and\nsecondly in practice one does not know beforehand the true number of chains. We\nresolve these issues in the Gupta et al. paper [GKV16]. Specifically, we\npropose an algebraic criterion that enables us to choose a value of L\nefficiently that avoids overfitting. Furthermore, we design a reconstruction\nalgorithm that outputs the true mixture in the presence of disconnected chains\nand is robust to noise. We complement our theoretical results with experiments\non both synthetic and real data, where we observe that our method outperforms\nthe GKV-SVD algorithm.

Here, one investigates the quantum dynamics of non-Hermitian\nfermionic particles with effective mass assuming a $(1+1)$-dimension flat\nspacetime. In seeking a Schr\\\"{o}dinger-like theory with PT symmetry is\nappropriate to assume a complex potential. This imaginary interaction produces\nan effective potential purely dependent on mass distribution. Furthermore, we\nstudy the non-relativistic limit by adopting the Foldy-Wouthuysen\ntransformation. As a result, that limit leads to an ordering equivalent to the\nordering that describes abrupt heterojunctions. Posteriorly, particular cases\nof mass distribution also were analyzed. Thus, interesting results arise for\nthe case of a linear PDM, which produces an effective harmonic oscillator and\ninduces the emergence of bound states. For a hyperbolic PDM, an effective\npotential barrier emerges. However, in this case, the fermions behave as free\nparticles with positive-defined energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 15:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

We run 2.5D\nideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the open-source MPI-AMRVAC\ncode far into the nonlinear evolution of an RT instability perturbed at the\nprominence-corona interface. Our simulation achieves a resolution down to $\\sim\n23$ km on a 2D $(x,y)$ domain of size 30 Mm $\\times$ 30 Mm.

As global and concurrent\ninformation of all swarm members is not available in natural swarms, these\nsystems use local observations to achieve the desired behavior. Similarly,\nPACNav relies only on local observations of relative positions of UAVs, making\nit suitable for large swarms deprived of communication capabilities and\nexternal localization systems. We introduce the novel concepts of path\npersistence and path similarity that allow each swarm member to analyze the\nmotion of other members in order to determine its own future motion.

The two-fluid model for superfluidity coincides with\nthe Israel-Stewart theory for heat conduction in the limit of infinite\nconductivity, and this explains why the latter has a second sound. Also,\nMIS$^*$ is equivalent to the Burgers model for viscoelasticity, and this\nimplies that the former must exhibit an elastic behavior at high frequencies.\nAdditionally, we show that if the degrees of freedom and the conservation laws\nof a hydrodynamic theory have the same geometric character as those of the\nIsrael-Stewart theory, then such theory must be indistinguishable from the\nIsrael-Stewart theory in the linear regime. This explains why all second-order\ntheories turn out to be identical near equilibrium. Finally, we construct the\nfirst linearized model for a relativistic supersolid that is proven to be\ncausal, stable, and strongly hyperbolic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 19:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

Vehicle manufacturers are\nunable to readily eliminate the B-pillar due to regulatory guidelines intended\nto protect vehicular occupants in the event of side collisions and rollover\nincidents. Furthermore, assistance implements utilized to counteract the\nadverse effects of blind spots remain ineffective due to technological\nlimitations and optical impediments. This paper introduces mechanisms to\nquantify the obstruction caused by the B-pillar when the head of the driver is\nfacing forward and turning 90 degrees, typical of an over-the-shoulder blind\nspot check. It uses the metrics developed to demonstrate the relationship\nbetween B-pillar width and the obstruction angle. The paper then creates a\nmethodology to determine the movement required of the driver to eliminate blind\nspots. Ultimately, this paper proposes a solution, the Blind Spot Eliminator,\nand demonstrates that it successfully decreases both the obstruction angle and,\nconsequently, the required driver movement. A prototype of the Blind Spot\nEliminator is also constructed and experimented with using a mannequin to model\nhuman vision in a typical passenger vehicle. The results of this experiment\nillustrated a substantial improvement in viewing ability, as predicted by\nearlier calculations.

As a\nconsequence, there is currently no solid basis for assessing the quality with\nwhich the dynamics of large-scale GCS operations can be forecasted.\n  To meet this knowledge gap, we have conducted a major GCS validation\nbenchmark study. To achieve reasonable time scales, a laboratory-size\ngeological storage formation was constructed (the \"FluidFlower\"), forming the\nbasis for both the experimental and computational work. A validation experiment\nconsisting of repeated GCS operations was conducted in the FluidFlower,\nproviding what we define as the true physical dynamics for this system. Nine\ndifferent research groups from around the world provided forecasts, both\nindividually and collaboratively, based on a detailed physical and\npetrophysical characterization of the FluidFlower sands.\n  The major contribution of this paper is a report and discussion of the\nresults of the validation benchmark study, complemented by a description of the\nbenchmarking process and the participating computational models. The forecasts\nfrom the participating groups are compared to each other and to the\nexperimental data by means of various indicative qualitative and quantitative\nmeasures. By this, we provide a detailed assessment of the capabilities of\nreservoir simulators and their users to capture both the injection and\npost-injection dynamics of the GCS operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 12:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

In\na decentralized manufacturing system, the involved units may fabricate same or\nsimilar products and deploy their own machine learning model for online process\nmonitoring. However, due to the possible inconsistency of task progress during\nthe operation, it is also common that some units are data-rich while some are\ndata-poor. Thus, the learning progress of the machine learning-based process\nmonitoring model for each unit may vary. Therefore, it is highly valuable to\nachieve efficient and secured knowledge sharing among the units in a\ndecentralized manufacturing system. To realize this goal, this paper proposes a\nknowledge distillation-based information sharing (KD-IS) framework, which could\ndistill informative knowledge from data-rich unit to improve the monitoring\nperformance of data-poor unit. To validate the effectiveness of this method, a\nreal-world case study is conducted in a connected fused filament fabrication\n(FFF)-based additive manufacturing (AM) platform. The experimental results show\nthat the developed method is efficient in improving model monitoring\nperformance at data-poor unit, with solid protection on potential data privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 23:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

However, more advanced\ncharacterization and analysis are needed to form a fundamental understating of\nthe fuel performance, and make U-10Zr fuel qualify for commercial use. The\nmovement of lanthanides across the fuel section from the hot fuel center to the\ncool cladding surface is one of the key factors to affect fuel performance. In\nthe advanced annular U-10Zr fuel, the lanthanides present as fission gas\nbubbles. Due to a lack of annotated data, existing literature utilized a\nmultiple-threshold method to separate the bubbles and calculate bubble\nstatistics on an annular fuel. However, the multiple-threshold method cannot\nachieve robust performance on images with different qualities and contrasts,\nand cannot distinguish different bubbles. This paper proposes a hybrid\nframework for efficient bubble segmentation. We develop a bubble annotation\ntool and generate the first fission gas bubble dataset with more than 3000\nbubbles from 24 images. A multi-task deep learning network integrating U-Net\nand ResNet is designed to accomplish instance-level bubble segmentation.\nCombining the segmentation results and image processing step achieves the best\nrecall ratio of more than 90% with very limited annotated data. Our model shows\noutstanding improvement by comparing the previously proposed thresholding\nmethod. The proposed method has promising to generate a more accurate\nquantitative analysis of fission gas bubbles on U-10Zr annular fuels. The\nresults will contribute to identifying the bubbles with lanthanides and finally\nbuild the relationship between the thermal gradation and lanthanides movements\nof U-10Zr annular fuels.

It was found that the corrosion properties\nof the non-surface-treated wire could be optimized by means of thermal\ntreatment within certain limits, but the corrosion rate remained very high.\nHence, strength and ductility of these wires vanished after 24 h of immersion\nin simulated body fluid at 37$^\\circ$C and, as a result of that rather quick\ndegradation, direct tests did not show any MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cell\nattachment on the surface of the Mg wires. In contrast, surface modification of\nthe annealed WE43 Mg wires by a continuous PEO process led to the formation of\na homogeneous oxide layer of $\\approx$ 8$\\mu$m and significantly improved the\ncorrosion resistance and hence the biocompatibility of the WE43 Mg wires. It\nwas found that a dense layer of Ca/P was formed at the early stages of\ndegradation on top of the Mg(OH)2 layer and hindered the diffusion of the\nCl-ions which dissolve Mg(OH)2 and accelerate the corrosion of Mg alloys. As a\nresult, pitting corrosion was suppressed and the strength of the Mg wires was\nabove 100 MPa after 96 h of immersion in simulated body fluid at 37$^\\circ$C.\nMoreover, many cells were able to attach on the surface of the PEO\nsurface-modified wires during cell culture testing.
