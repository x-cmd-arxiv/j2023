We performed a\nmulti-wavelength spectroscopic follow-up of thirteen such systems with\nVLT/X-Shooter. Here, we present the observations and study the overall chemical\nenrichment measured from the HI, H2 and metal lines. We combine this with an\ninvestigation of the neutral gas kinematics with respect to the quasar host. We\nfind gas-phase metallicities in the range 2% to 40% of the Solar value, i.e. in\nthe upper-half range of HI-selected proximate damped Lyman-alpha systems, but\nsimilar to what is seen in intervening H2-bearing systems. This is likely\ndriven by similar selection effects that play against the detection of most\nmetal and molecular rich systems in absorption. Differences are however seen in\nthe abundance of dust (from [Zn/Fe]) and its depletion pattern, when compared\nto intervening systems, possibly indicating different dust production or\ndestruction close to the AGN. We also note the almost-ubiquitous presence of a\nhigh-ionisation phase traced by NV in proximate systems. In spite of the hard\nUV field from the quasars, we found no strong overall deficit of neutral argon,\nat least when compared to intervening DLAs. This likely results from argon\nbeing mostly neutral in the H2 phase, which actually accounts for a large\nfraction of the total amount of metals. We measure the quasar systemic\nredshifts through emission lines from both ionised gas and CO(3-2) emission,\nthe latter being detected in all 6 cases for which we obtained 3-mm data from\ncomplementary NOEMA observations. For the first time, we observe a trend\nbetween line-of-sight velocity with respect to systemic redshift and\nmetallicity of the absorbing gas.

While initially the focus has been mostly\non efficiency, recently fairness criteria have been taken into account in this\nsetting. Most work has focused on the maximin criteria however, and thus still\ndifferent groups can receive very different shares of information. In this work\nwe propose to consider fairness as a notion to be guaranteed by an algorithm\nrather than as a criterion to be maximized. To this end, we propose three\noptimization problems that aim at maximizing the overall spread while enforcing\nstrict levels of demographic parity fairness via constraints (either ex-post or\nex-ante). The level of fairness hence becomes a user choice rather than a\nproperty to be observed upon output. We study this setting from various\nperspectives. First, we prove that the cost of introducing demographic parity\ncan be high in terms of both overall spread and computational complexity, i.e.,\nthe price of fairness may be unbounded for all three problems and optimal\nsolutions are hard to compute, in some case even approximately or when fairness\nconstraints may be violated. For one of our problems, we still design an\nalgorithm with both constant approximation factor and fairness violation. We\nalso give two heuristics that allow the user to choose the tolerated fairness\nviolation. By means of an extensive experimental study, we show that our\nalgorithms perform well in practice, that is, they achieve the best demographic\nparity fairness values. For certain instances we additionally even obtain an\noverall spread comparable to the most efficient algorithms that come without\nany fairness guarantee, indicating that the empirical price of fairness may\nactually be small when using our algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 16:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Most works in this context study the question of how to find seeding\nstrategies (deterministic or probabilistic) such that nodes or communities in\nthe network get their fair share of coverage.

All these works assume that the entity that is\nspreading the information has an inherent interest in spreading the information\nfairly, otherwise why would they want to use the developed fair algorithms?\nThis assumption may however be flawed in reality -- the spreading entity may be\npurely \\emph{efficiency-oriented}.

These\ntechnologies allow for programmable network topologies that can be reconfigured\nto better serve network traffic, thus enabling a trade-off between the benefits\n(i.e., shorter routes) and costs of reconfigurations (i.e., overhead).\nSelf-Adjusting Networks (SANs) aim at addressing this trade-off by exploiting\npatterns in network traffic, both when it is revealed piecewise (online dynamic\ntopologies) or known in advance (offline static topologies). In this paper, we\ntake the first steps toward Self-Adjusting k-ary tree networks. These are more\npowerful generalizations of existing binary search tree networks (like\nSplayNets), which have been at the core of SAN designs. k-ary search tree\nnetworks are a natural generalization offering nodes of higher degrees, reduced\nroute lengths for a fixed number of nodes, and local routing in spite of\nreconfigurations. We first compute an offline (optimal) static network for\narbitrary traffic patterns in $O(n^3 \\cdot k)$ time via dynamic programming,\nand also improve the bound to $O(n^2 \\cdot k)$ for the special case of\nuniformly distributed traffic. Then, we present a centroid-based topology of\nthe network that can be used both in the offline static and the online setting.\nIn the offline uniform-workload case, we construct this quasi-optimal network\nin linear time $O(n)$ and, finally, we present online self-adjusting k-ary\nsearch tree versions of SplayNet.

Motivated by this, we propose\nsequential query encoding (SQE) as an alternative to encode queries for CQA.\nInstead of parameterizing and executing the computational graph, SQE first uses\na search-based algorithm to linearize the computational graph to a sequence of\ntokens and then uses a sequence encoder to compute its vector representation.\nThen this vector representation is used as a query embedding to retrieve\nanswers from the embedding space according to similarity scores.

Moreover, it can simulate groups of\nrobots hundreds of times faster than real-time.\n  The results show how applying a communication strategy improves the\nperformance of the distributed model, letting it decide which actions to take\nalmost as precisely and quickly as the expert controller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 17:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

However, past\napproaches often require a complete and accurate embedding of the source\nlanguage in the logic of the underlying solver, an approach difficult for\nindustrial-grade languages. Other approaches couple the semantics of the source\nlanguage with purpose-built synthesizers, necessarily tying the synthesis\nengine to a particular language model. In this paper, we propose Absynthe, an\nalternative approach based on user-defined abstract semantics that aims to be\nboth lightweight and language agnostic, yet effective in guiding the search for\nprograms. A synthesis goal in Absynthe is specified as an abstract\nspecification in a lightweight user-defined abstract domain and concrete test\ncases. The synthesis engine is parameterized by the abstract semantics and\nindependent of the source language. Absynthe validates candidate programs\nagainst test cases using the actual concrete language implementation to ensure\ncorrectness. We formalize the synthesis rules for Absynthe and describe how the\nkey ideas are scaled-up in our implementation in Ruby. We evaluated Absynthe on\nSyGuS strings benchmark and found it competitive with other enumerative search\nsolvers. Moreover, Absynthe's ability to combine abstract domains allows the\nuser to move along a cost spectrum, i.e., expressive domains prune more\nprograms but require more time. Finally, to verify Absynthe can act as a\ngeneral purpose synthesis tool, we use Absynthe to synthesize Pandas data frame\nmanipulating programs in Python using simple abstractions like types and column\nlabels of a data frame. Absynthe reaches parity with AutoPandas, a deep\nlearning based tool for the same benchmark suite.

The merging of the tip vortices is\nfound to be strongly dependent on $\\lambda$. A convective length scale ($L_c$)\nrelated to the pitch of the helical vortices is defined which is shown to be a\nbetter length scale than turbine diameter ($D$) to demarcate the near wake from\nthe far wake. The tower induced strong vertical asymmetry in the flow by\ndestabilising the tip vortices and promoting mixing in the lower (below the\nnacelle) plane.

However, labeling EEG data for affective\nexperiments is challenging, as it can be difficult for participants to\naccurately distinguish between similar emotions, resulting in ambiguous\nlabeling (reporting multiple emotions for one EEG instance). This notion could\ncause model performance degradation, as the ground truth is hidden within\nmultiple candidate labels. To address this issue, Partial Label Learning (PLL)\nhas been proposed to identify the ground truth from candidate labels during the\ntraining phase, and has shown good performance in the computer vision domain.\nHowever, PLL methods have not yet been adopted for EEG representation learning\nor implemented for emotion recognition tasks. In this paper, we adapt and\nre-implement six state-of-the-art PLL approaches for emotion recognition from\nEEG on a large emotion dataset (SEED-V, containing five emotion classes). We\nevaluate the performance of all methods in classical and real-world\nexperiments. The results show that PLL methods can achieve strong results in\naffective computing from EEG and achieve comparable performance to fully\nsupervised learning. We also investigate the effect of label disambiguation, a\nkey step in many PLL methods. The results show that in most cases, label\ndisambiguation would benefit the model when the candidate labels are generated\nbased on their similarities to the ground truth rather than obeying a uniform\ndistribution. This finding suggests the potential of using label\ndisambiguation-based PLL methods for real-world affective tasks.

Autonomous landing on a 2D moving platform offers the\npossibility to replenish batteries and offload data, thus increasing the\nutility of the vehicle. Classical approaches rely on accurate, complex and\ndifficult-to-derive models of the vehicle and the environment. Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) provides an attractive alternative due to its ability to learn a\nsuitable control policy exclusively from data during a training procedure.\nHowever, current methods require several hours to train, have limited success\nrates and depend on hyperparameters that need to be tuned by trial-and-error.\nWe address all these issues in this work. First, we decompose the landing\nprocedure into a sequence of simpler, but similar learning tasks. This is\nenabled by applying two instances of the same RL based controller trained for\n1D motion for controlling the multi-rotor's movement in both the longitudinal\nand the lateral direction. Second, we introduce a powerful state space\ndiscretization technique that is based on i) kinematic modeling of the moving\nplatform to derive information about the state space topology and ii)\nstructuring the training as a sequential curriculum using transfer learning.\nThird, we leverage the kinematics model of the moving platform to also derive\ninterpretable hyperparameters for the training process that ensure sufficient\nmaneuverability of the multi-rotor vehicle. The training is performed using the\ntabular RL method Double Q-Learning. Through extensive simulations we show that\nthe presented method significantly increases the rate of successful landings,\nwhile requiring less training time compared to other deep RL approaches.\nFinally, we deploy and demonstrate our algorithm on real hardware.

In this\npaper, we propose MoReVis, a visual overview of spatiotemporal data that\nconsiders the objects' spatial extent and strives to show spatial interactions\namong these objects by displaying spatial intersections. Like previous\ntechniques, our method involves projecting the spatial coordinates to 1D to\nproduce compact summaries. However, our solution's core consists of performing\na layout optimization step that sets the size and positions of the visual marks\non the summary to resemble the actual values on the original space. We also\nprovide multiple interactive mechanisms to make interpreting the results more\nstraightforward for the user. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation\nand usage scenarios. Moreover, we evaluated the usefulness of MoReVis in a\nstudy with 9 participants. The results point out the effectiveness and\nsuitability of our method in representing different datasets compared to\ntraditional techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 00:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Observed stable states include both counter-rotating and\nco-rotating states. The stability of each of these states and their dynamics\nwere modeled by stochastic ordinary differential equations of motion in terms\nof the orientation, amplitude, and mean temperature of each convection roll.\nThe form of the interaction terms is predicted based on an effective turbulent\ndiffusion of temperature between the adjacent rolls. Predictions are made for\nstable fixed points of the co- and counter-rotating states. This suggests that\nthe same turbulent thermal diffusivity that describes macroscopically averaged\nheat transport also controls the interactions between neighboring convection\nrolls. The surprising stability of co-rotating states is due to the temperature\ndifference between the neighboring rolls becoming large enough that the heat\nflux between the rolls stabilizes the temperature profile of aligned\nco-rotating states. This temperature difference can be driven by heating the\nplates of the two cells to different mean temperatures. This shifts the\norientations of the rolls of counter-rotating states in opposite directions,\nand for large temperature differences only co-rotating states are stable\nSpontaneous switching between co-rotating and counter-rotating states is also\nobserved. Switching to counter-rotating states occurs mainly due to cessation\n(a significant weakening of a convection roll), which reduces damping on\nchanges in orientation, allowing the orientation to change rapidly due to\ndiffusive fluctuations. Switching to co-rotating states is mainly driven by\nsmaller diffusive fluctuations, which have a positive feedback that\ndestabilizes the counter-rotating state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 00:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

In particular, its anatase\npolymorph plays a major role in photocatalysis, which can also accommodate\ncharged and neutral vacancies. There is, however, scant theoretical work on the\nvacancy charge and associated diffusion from surface to subsurface and bulk in\nthe literature. Here, we aim to understand +2 charge and neutral vacancy\ndiffusion on anatase (101) surface using 72 and 216 atoms surface slabs\nemploying a semi-local density functional and the Hubbard model. The\nactivation-relaxation technique nouveau (ARTn) coupled with Quantum Espresso is\nused to investigate the activated mechanisms responsible for the diffusion of\noxygen vacancies. The small slab model over-stabilizes the +2 charged topmost\nsurface vacancy, which is attributed to the strong Coulomb repulsion between\nvacancy and neighboring Ti+4 ions. The larger slab allows atoms to relax\nparallel to the surface, decreasing the +2 charged topmost surface vacancy\nstability. The calculated surface-to-subsurface barriers for the +2 charged\nvacancy and diffusion of the neutral vacancy on a slab of 216 atoms are 0.82 eV\nand 0.52 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the bulk vacancy prefers to migrate\ntoward the subsurface with relatively low activation barriers 0.19 eV and 0.27\neV and the reverse process has to overcome 0.38 eV and 0.40 eV barriers for the\n+2 charged and the neutral vacancies. This explains the experimentally observed\nhigh concentration of vacancies at the subsurface sites rather than in the\nbulk, and the dynamic diffusion of vacancies from the bulk to the subsurface\nand from the subsurface to the bulk is highly likely on the surface of anatase\n(101). Finally, we provide a plausible explanation for the origin of recently\nobserved subsurface-to-surface diffusion of oxygen vacancy from the calculated\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 01:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

For applications where\nspatial information needs to be collected quickly, for example, when studying\ndynamic processes, standard X-ray tomography is therefore not applicable.\nInspired by stereo vision, in this paper, we develop X-ray imaging methods that\nwork with two X-ray projection images.

However, up to a point, we are\nnevertheless able to extract spatial locations of point and line features. From\nstereo vision, it is well known that, for a known imaging geometry, once the\nsame point is identified in two images taken from different directions, then\nthe point's location in 3D space is exactly specified. The challenge is the\nmatching of points between images. As X-ray transmission images are\nfundamentally different from the surface reflection images used in standard\ncomputer vision, we here develop a different feature identification and\nmatching approach. In fact, once point like features are identified, if there\nare limited points in the image, then they can often be matched exactly. In\nfact, by utilising a third observation from an appropriate direction, matching\nbecomes unique. Once matched, point locations in 3D space are easily computed\nusing geometric considerations.

The classical spin-orbit coupling\nproblem considers a satellite as a single rigid body, but in the case of\nEuropa, the existence of the subsurface ocean enables independent motion of the\nice shell and solid interior. This paper explores the spin-orbit coupling\nproblem for Europa from a dynamical perspective, yielding illuminating\nanalytical and numerical results. We determine that the spin behavior of Europa\nis influenced by processes not captured by the classical single rigid body\nspin-orbit coupling analysis. The tidal locking process for Europa is governed\nby the strength of gravity-gradient coupling between the ice shell and solid\ninterior, with qualitatively different behavior depending on the scale of this\neffect. In this coupled rigid model, the shell can potentially undergo large\nangular displacements from the solid interior, and the coupling plays an\noutsize role in the dynamical evolution of the moon, even without incorporating\nthe dissipative effects of shell non-rigidity. This work extends classical\nspin-orbit coupling analysis to the icy ocean worlds, lending a new perspective\nfor dynamically exploring the rotational history of Europa and other similarly\ndifferentiated bodies in the outer solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 03:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

To render a robust cross-domain CT reconstruction\nperformance, instead of using deterministic models (e.g., convolutional neural\nnetwork), a Bayesian-endowed probabilistic framework is introduced into robust\ncross-domain CT reconstruction task due to its impressive robustness.

However, most existing schemes either consider a\nfixed intermediate time and scale in the training stage or only accept a preset\nnumber of input frames (e.g., two adjacent frames) that fails to exploit\nlong-range temporal information. To address these problems, we propose a\ncontinuous ST-VSR (C-STVSR) method that can convert the given video to any\nframe rate and spatial resolution. To achieve time-arbitrary interpolation, we\npropose a forward warping guided frame synthesis module and an\noptical-flow-guided context consistency loss to better approximate extreme\nmotion and preserve similar structures among input and prediction frames. In\naddition, we design a memory-friendly cascading depth-to-space module to\nrealize continuous spatial upsampling. Meanwhile, with the sophisticated\nreorganization of optical flow, the proposed method is memory friendly, making\nit possible to propagate information from long-range neighboring frames and\nachieve better reconstruction quality.

Our algorithm reuses the information obtained during the initial runs\nof the static algorithm and avoids the recomputations for the nodes unaffected\nby the updates. Besides, motivated from the success of Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) on various graph mining problems, we also design a Graph Neural\nNetwork-based model, GNN-SHS, to discover SHSs in dynamic networks, aiming to\nreduce the computational cost while achieving high accuracy. We provide a\ntheoretical analysis of the Tracking-SHS algorithm, and our theoretical results\nprove that for a particular type of graphs, such as Preferential Attachment\ngraphs [1], Tracking-SHS algorithm achieves 1.6 times of speedup compared with\nthe static algorithm. We perform extensive experiments, and our results\ndemonstrate that the Tracking-SHS algorithm attains a minimum of 3.24 times\nspeedup over the static algorithm. Also, the proposed second model GNN-SHS is\non an average 671.6 times faster than the Tracking-SHS algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 10:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Recent two-stage 3D\ndetectors typically take the point-voxel-based R-CNN paradigm, i.e., the first\nstage resorts to the 3D voxel-based backbone for 3D proposal generation on\nbird-eye-view (BEV) representation and the second stage refines them via the\nintermediate point representation. Their primary mechanisms involve the\nutilization of intermediary keypoints to restore the substantial 3D structure\ncontext from the converted BEV representation. The skilled point-voxel feature\ninteraction, however, makes the entire detection pipeline more complex and\ncompute-intensive. In this paper, we take a different viewpoint -- the\npillar-based BEV representation owns sufficient capacity to preserve the 3D\nstructure. In light of the latest advances in BEV-based perception, we devise a\nconceptually simple yet effective two-stage 3D detection architecture, named\nPillar R-CNN. On top of densified BEV feature maps, Pillar R-CNN can easily\nintroduce the feature pyramid architecture to generate 3D proposals at various\nscales and take the simple 2D R-CNN style detect head for box refinement. Our\nPillar R-CNN performs favorably against state-of-the-art 3D detectors on the\nlarge-scale Waymo Open Dataset but at a small extra cost. It should be\nhighlighted that further exploration into BEV perception for applications\ninvolving autonomous driving is now possible thanks to the effective and\nelegant Pillar R-CNN architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 12:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Application of\nthermo-chronometers to meteorites provides precise dating of the formation age\nof mineralogical components. Nucleosynthetic anomalies indicating a dichotomy\nbetween NC and C meteorites and precise parent body (PB) chronology can be\ncombined with thermal evolution models to constrain the timescale of accretion\nand dynamical processes in the early solar system. Achondrite PBs are\nconsidered to have accreted early and mostly in the NC region, while late\naccretion in the C region produced mostly undifferentiated PBs, such as the CR\nchondrite PB that formed as late as 4 Ma after CAIs. However, presence of more\nevolved CR-related meteorites suggests also an earlier accretion timing.

In particular, the reaction\nterms in the proposed method do not depend on the topological derivatives, and\ntherefore, sensitivity analysis to determine a descent direction for objective\nfunctionals is relaxed. Furthermore, a numerical algorithm for the proposed\nmethod is constructed and applied to typical minimization problems to show\nnumerical validity. This paper is a justification and generalization of the\nmethod using reaction-diffusion equations developed by one of the authors in\nYamada et al. (2010).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 12:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

For decentralised\nVPR applications where the visual data has to be transmitted between several\nagents, the communication channel may restrict the localisation process when\nlimited bandwidth is available. JPEG is an image compression standard that can\nemploy high compression ratios to facilitate lower data transmission for VPR\napplications. However, when applying high levels of JPEG compression, both the\nimage clarity and size are drastically reduced. In this paper, we incorporate\nsequence-based filtering in a number of well-established, learnt and non-learnt\nVPR techniques to overcome the performance loss resulted from introducing high\nlevels of JPEG compression. The sequence length that enables 100% place\nmatching performance is reported and an analysis of the amount of data required\nfor each VPR technique to perform the transfer on the entire spectrum of JPEG\ncompression is provided. Moreover, the time required by each VPR technique to\nperform place matching is investigated, on both uniformly and non-uniformly\nJPEG compressed data. The results show that it is beneficial to use a highly\ncompressed JPEG dataset with an increased sequence length, as similar levels of\nVPR performance are reported at a significantly reduced bandwidth. The results\npresented in this paper also emphasize that there is a trade-off between the\namount of data transferred and the total time required to perform VPR. Our\nexperiments also suggest that is often favourable to compress the query images\nto the same quality of the map, as more efficient place matching can be\nperformed. The experiments are conducted on several VPR datasets, under mild to\nextreme JPEG compression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 13:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

As a\nconsequence, the emission of magnetic dipole radiation (MDR) continuously takes\naway its rotational energy. This process leads to a time decreasing angular\nvelocity of the star that is usually quantified in terms of its braking index.\nWhile this simple mechanism is indeed the main reason for the spin evolution of\nisolated pulsars, it may not be the only cause of this effect. Most of young\nisolated pulsars present braking index values that are consistently lower than\nthat given by the MDR model. Working in the weak field (Newtonian) limit, we\ntake in the present work a step forward in describing the evolution of such a\nsystem by allowing the star's shape to wobble around an ellipsoidal\nconfiguration as a backreaction effect produced by the MDR emission. It is\nassumed that an internal damping of the oscillations occurs, thus introducing\nanother form of energy loss in the system, and this phenomenon may be related\nto the deviation of the braking index from the pure MDR model predictions.\nNumerical calculations suggest that the average braking index for typical\nisolated pulsars can be thus simply explained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 13:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

This unpaired electron is the source of orbital fluctuations in the\nO-{\\pi}* manifold for both cases. In order to reduce this orbital fluctuation,\nboth go through several structural phase transitions. In these plethora of\nstructures, the O2- dimers undergo rotation, leading to a complex linking of\nits orbital degrees of freedom with its spin degrees of freedom.

With\nclassical techniques facing troubles to deal with the irregular (non-Euclidean)\ndomain where the signals are defined, a popular approach at the heart of graph\nsignal processing (GSP) is to: (i) represent the underlying support via a graph\nand (ii) exploit the topology of this graph to process the signals at hand. In\naddition to the irregular structure of the signals, another critical limitation\nis that the observed data is prone to the presence of perturbations, which, in\nthe context of GSP, may affect not only the observed signals but also the\ntopology of the supporting graph. Ignoring the presence of perturbations, along\nwith the couplings between the errors in the signal and the errors in their\nsupport, can drastically hinder estimation performance. While many GSP works\nhave looked at the presence of perturbations in the signals, much fewer have\nlooked at the presence of perturbations in the graph, and almost none at their\njoint effect. While this is not surprising (GSP is a relatively new field), we\nexpect this to change in the upcoming years.

Due to explosion in data, it is helpful for users\nif they are provided relevant summaries of the search results rather than just\nlinks to webpages. Text summarization has become a vital approach to help\nconsumers swiftly grasp vast amounts of information.In this paper, different\npre-trained models for text summarization are evaluated on different datasets.\nSpecifically, we have used three different pre-trained models, namely,\ngoogle/pegasus-cnn-dailymail, T5-base, facebook/bart-large-cnn. We have\nconsidered three different datasets, namely, CNN-dailymail, SAMSum and BillSum\nto get the output from the above three models. The pre-trained models are\ncompared over these different datasets, each of 2000 examples, through ROUGH\nand BLEU metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 16:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-24"}

In this work, we propose a novel\ntime piecewise physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to study complex\ndynamics on the one-dimensional quantum droplets by solving the corresponding\namended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The training effect of this network model in\nthe long time domain is far better than that of the conventional PINNs, and\neach of its subnetworks is independent and highly adjustable. By using time\npiecewise PINNs with scarce training points, we not only study intrinsic\nmodulation of single droplet and collision between two droplets, but also\nexcite the breathers on droplet background. Intriguingly, we obtain an\ninterference pattern from training result of collision between two droplets,\nwhich is a significant feature of the interplay of coherent matter waves. The\nnumerical results showcase that different parameters may lead to completely\ndifferent dynamic behaviors under the same initial condition in a nonlinear\nnon-integrable system. Our results provide the significant guidance for\nintrinsic modulation of single droplet, droplet collision and breathers\nexcitation via deep learning technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 06:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 02:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}
