The approach\ntypically uses short interictal segments of around one minute. However, the\ntemporal stability of findings has not been established.\n  Methods: Here, we generated a normative map of iEEG in non-pathological brain\ntissue from 249 patients. We computed regional band power abnormalities in a\nseparate cohort of 39 patients for the duration of their monitoring period\n(0.92-8.62 days of iEEG data, mean 4.58 days per patient, over 4,800 hours\nrecording). To assess the localising value of band power abnormality, we\ncomputed DRS - a measure of how different the surgically resected and spared\ntissue were in terms of band power abnormalities - over time.\n  Results: In each patient, band power abnormality was relatively consistent\nover time. The median DRS of the entire recording period separated seizure free\n(ILAE = 1) and not seizure free (ILAE > 1) patients well (AUC = 0.69). This\neffect was similar interictally (AUC = 0.69) and peri-ictally (AUC = 0.71).\n  Significance: Our results suggest that band power abnormality DRS, as a\npredictor of outcomes from epilepsy surgery, is a relatively robust metric over\ntime. These findings add further support for abnormality mapping of\nneurophysiology data during presurgical evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 16:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

In this paper, we\ninvestigate three key factors (i.e., inputs, pre-training, and finetuning) in\nViT for multimodal FAS with RGB, Infrared (IR), and Depth. First, in terms of\nthe ViT inputs, we find that leveraging local feature descriptors benefits the\nViT on IR modality but not RGB or Depth modalities. Second, in observation of\nthe inefficiency on direct finetuning the whole or partial ViT, we design an\nadaptive multimodal adapter (AMA), which can efficiently aggregate local\nmultimodal features while freezing majority of ViT parameters.

All of\nthese steps were performed in engagement with medical experts, including a\nfinal evaluation of the dashboard results by an expert medical panel. We show\nthat LLMs, in particular BERT and SciBERT, can be readily deployed to extract\nsome relevant explanations to support clinical usage. To understand the\nvalue-add of the contextual explanations, the expert panel evaluated these\nregarding actionable insights in the relevant clinical setting.

To improve robustness in these scenarios, we propose a\nmethodology called Distortion-Adaptive Learned Invariance for Identification\n(DaliID) models. We contend that distortion augmentations, which degrade image\nquality, can be successfully leveraged to a greater degree than has been shown\nin the literature. Aided by an adaptive weighting schedule, a novel distortion\naugmentation is applied at severe levels during training. This training\nstrategy increases feature-level invariance to distortions and decreases domain\nshift to unconstrained scenarios. At inference, we use a magnitude-weighted\nfusion of features from parallel models to retain robustness across the range\nof images.

Although in principle Particle Tracking Velocimetry\n(PTV) estimates locally a non-modulated particle displacement, to exploit the\nscattered data from PTV it is necessary to interpolate these data on a\nstructured grid, which implies a spatial modulation effect that biases the\nresulting velocity field. This systematic error due to finite spatial\nresolution inevitably depends on the interrogation window size and on the\ninterparticle spacing. It must be observed that all these operations\n(cross-correlation, direct interpolation or averaging in windows) induce\nmodulation on both the mean and the fluctuating part. We introduce a simple\ntrick to reduce this systematic error source of PIV/PTV measurements exploiting\nensemble statistics. Ensemble Particle Tracking Velocimetry (EPTV) can be\nleveraged to obtain the high-resolution mean flow by merging the different\ninstantaneous realisations. The mean flow can be estimated with EPTV, and the\nfluctuating part can be measured from PIV/PTV. The high-resolution mean can\nthen be superposed to the instantaneous fluctuating part to obtain velocity\nfields with lower systematic error.

The satellite systems of Milky-Way-like galaxies offer a useful means by\nwhich to study the galaxy formation process in the cosmological context.

We use high resolution\nhydrodynamical simulations of the formation and evolution of Milky-Way-like\ngalaxy systems to investigate the spatial distribution of the luminous\nsatellites and DM sub-halos around the central galaxy. Results. We find that\nthe satellites and DM sub-halos are indeed anisotropically distributed with a\ndirection roughly along the local DM filament. The observed alignment of the\nsatellites in these systems is likely the result of preferred accretion along\nthe local DM filaments in the galaxy formation process.

However, the bottom-up inference nature of supervised networks\nis a passive process that renders them fallible to noise. In this paper, we\nprovide a thorough background of supervised neural networks, both generative\nand discriminative, and discuss their functionality from the perspective of\nfree energy principle. We then provide a framework for introducing action\nduring inference. We introduce a new measurement called stochastic surprisal\nthat is a function of the network, the input, and any possible action. This\naction can be any one of the outputs that the neural network has learnt,\nthereby lending stochasticity to the measurement. Stochastic surprisal is\nvalidated on two applications: Image Quality Assessment and Recognition under\nnoisy conditions. We show that, while noise characteristics are ignored to make\nrobust recognition, they are analyzed to estimate image quality scores. We\napply stochastic surprisal on two applications, three datasets, and as a\nplug-in on twelve networks. In all, it provides a statistically significant\nincrease among all measures.

The observed asset price is\nmodelled by a geometric Brownian motion (the 'notional price') reflected at a\nlower barrier. The resulting observed price has standard dynamics but with\nlocalised intervention at the barrier, which allows arbitrage with interim\nlosses; this is funded by the government's unlimited powers of intervention,\nand its exploitation is subject to credit constraints. Despite the lack of an\nequivalent martingale measure for the observed price, options on this price can\nbe expressed as compound options on the arbitrage-free notional price, to which\nstandard risk-neutral arguments can be applied. Because option deltas tend to\nzero when the observed price approaches the barrier, hedging with the observed\nprice gives the same results as hedging with the notional price, and so exactly\nreplicates option payoffs. Hedging schemes are not unique, with the cheapest\nscheme for any derivative being the one which best exploits the interventions\nat the barrier. The price of a put is clear: direct replication has a lower\ninitial cost than synthetic replication, and the replication portfolio always\nhas positive value. The price of a call is ambiguous: synthetic replication has\na lower initial cost than direct replication, but the replication portfolio may\ngive interim losses, and so the preferred replication strategy (and hence\nprice) of a call may depend on what margin payments need to be made on these\nlosses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 22:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Their competitive performance is often attributed to a proper\ncapturing of the graph inductive bias. In this work, we introduce this\ninductive bias into GPs to improve their predictive performance for\ngraph-structured data. We show that a prominent example of GNNs, the graph\nconvolutional network, is equivalent to some GP when its layers are infinitely\nwide; and we analyze the kernel universality and the limiting behavior in\ndepth.

An example of such a problem\nwould be to estimate the generalization error of a neural network trained on\n$n$ examples where $f$ is a loss function. Classically, this problem is\napproached through concentration inequalities holding uniformly over compact\nparameter sets of functions $f$, for example as in Rademacher or VC type\nanalysis.

Recently, the \\emph{PAC-Bayes} framework has been proposed\nas a better alternative for this class of problems for its ability to often\ngive numerically non-vacuous bounds. In this paper, we show that we can do even\nbetter: we show how to refine the proof strategy of the PAC-Bayes bounds and\nachieve \\emph{even tighter} guarantees.

Firstly,\nOAMatcher predicts overlapping areas to promote effective and clean global\ncontext aggregation, with the key insight that humans focus on the overlapping\nareas instead of the entire images after multiple observations when matching\nkeypoints in image pairs. Technically, we first perform global information\nintegration across all keypoints to imitate the humans behavior of observing\nthe entire images at the beginning of feature matching. Then, we propose\nOverlapping Areas Prediction Module (OAPM) to capture the keypoints in\nco-visible regions and conduct feature enhancement among them to simulate that\nhumans transit the focus regions from the entire images to overlapping regions,\nhence realizeing effective information exchange without the interference coming\nfrom the keypoints in non overlapping areas. Besides, since humans tend to\nleverage probability to determine whether the match labels are correct or not,\nwe propose a Match Labels Weight Strategy (MLWS) to generate the coefficients\nused to appraise the reliability of the ground-truth match labels, while\nalleviating the influence of measurement noise coming from the data. Moreover,\nwe integrate depth-wise convolution into Tranformer encoder layers to ensure\nOAMatcher extracts local and global feature representation concurrently.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that OAMatcher outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, while exhibiting excellent\nrobustness to extreme appearance variants.

While this is akin to the relationship between\ngeneral aviation aircraft and airports, the conceived location of vertiports\nwithin dense urban environments presents unique challenges in managing the air\ntraffic served by a vertiport. This challenge becomes pronounced within\nincreasing frequency of scheduled landings and take-offs. This paper assumes a\ncentralized air traffic controller (ATC) to explore the performance of a new AI\ndriven ATC approach to manage the eVTOLs served by the vertiport. Minimum\nseparation-driven safety and delays are the two important considerations in\nthis case. The ATC problem is modeled as a task allocation problem, and\nuncertainties due to communication disruptions (e.g., poor link quality) and\ninclement weather (e.g., high gust effects) are added as a small probability of\naction failures. To learn the vertiport ATC policy, a novel graph-based\nreinforcement learning (RL) solution called \"Urban Air Mobility- Vertiport\nSchedule Management (UAM-VSM)\" is developed. This approach uses graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs) to abstract the vertiport space and eVTOL space\nas graphs, and aggregate information for a centralized ATC agent to help\ngeneralize the environment. Unreal Engine combined with Airsim is used as the\nsimulation environment over which training and testing occurs. Uncertainties\nare considered only during testing, due to the high cost of Mc sampling over\nsuch realistic simulations. The proposed graph RL method demonstrates\nsignificantly better performance on the test scenarios when compared against a\nfeasible random decision-making baseline and a first come first serve (FCFS)\nbaseline, including the ability to generalize to unseen scenarios and with\nuncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 04:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Their\npotential for estimating structured regression functions has been recently\nestablished in the literature. However, most of the studies require the input\ndimension to be fixed and consequently ignore the effect of dimension on the\nrate of convergence and hamper their applications to modern big data with high\ndimensionality. In this paper, we bridge this gap by analyzing a $k^{th}$ order\nnonparametric interaction model in both growing dimension scenarios ($d$ grows\nwith $n$ but at a slower rate) and in high dimension ($d \\gtrsim n$). In the\nlatter case, sparsity assumptions and associated regularization are required in\norder to obtain optimal rates of convergence. A new challenge in diverging\ndimension setting is in calculation mean-square error, the covariance terms\namong estimated additive components are an order of magnitude larger than those\nof the variances and they can deteriorate statistical properties without proper\ncare. We introduce a critical debiasing technique to amend the problem. We show\nthat under certain standard assumptions, debiased deep neural networks achieve\na minimax optimal rate both in terms of $(n, d)$. Our proof techniques rely\ncrucially on a novel debiasing technique that makes the covariances of additive\ncomponents negligible in the mean-square error calculation.

Traditional\ncollaborative filtering techniques typically assume that users only have a\nsingle type of behavior with items, making it insufficient to utilize complex\ncollaborative signals to learn informative representations and infer actual\nuser preferences. Consequently, some pioneer studies explore modeling\nmulti-behavior heterogeneity to learn better representations and boost the\nperformance of recommendations for a target behavior. However, a large number\nof auxiliary behaviors (i.e., click and add-to-cart) could introduce irrelevant\ninformation to recommenders, which could mislead the target behavior (i.e.,\npurchase) recommendation, rendering two critical challenges: (i) denoising\nauxiliary behaviors and (ii) bridging the semantic gap between auxiliary and\ntarget behaviors.

There has been an exponential growth in the amount of\ncomputation needed to train the largest models. Therefore, to scale computation\nand data, these models are inevitably trained in a distributed manner in\nclusters of nodes, and their updates are aggregated before being applied to the\nmodel. However, a distributed setup is prone to byzantine failures of\nindividual nodes, components, and software. With data augmentation added to\nthese settings, there is a critical need for robust and efficient aggregation\nsystems. We extend the current state-of-the-art aggregators and propose an\noptimization-based subspace estimator by modeling pairwise distances as\nquadratic functions by utilizing the recently introduced Flag Median problem.\nThe estimator in our loss function favors the pairs that preserve the norm of\nthe difference vector.

Here we develop a novel wind energy workflow that for the first time\ncombines weather patterns derived from unsupervised clustering techniques with\nnumerical weather prediction models (here WRF) to obtain efficient and accurate\nlong-term predictions of power and downstream wakes from an entire wind farm.\nWe use ERA5 reanalysis data clustering not only on low altitude pressure but\nalso, for the first time, on the more relevant variable of wind velocity. We\nalso compare the use of large-scale and local-scale domains for clustering. A\nWRF simulation is run at each of the cluster centres and the results are\naggregated using a novel post-processing technique. By applying our workflow to\ntwo different regions, we show that our long-term predictions agree with those\nfrom a year of WRF simulations but require less than 2% of the computational\ntime. The most accurate results are obtained when clustering on wind velocity.\nMoreover, clustering over the Europe-wide domain is sufficient for predicting\nwind farm power output, but downstream wake predictions benefit from the use of\nsmaller domains. Finally, we show that these downstream wakes can affect the\nlocal weather patterns.\n  Our approach facilitates multi-year predictions of power output and\ndownstream farm wakes, by providing a fast, accurate and flexible methodology\nthat is applicable to any global region. Moreover, these accurate long-term\npredictions of downstream wakes provide the first tool to help mitigate the\neffects of wind energy loss downstream of wind farms, since they can be used to\ndetermine optimum wind farm locations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 10:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

This is in contrast to the two-temperature blackbody or hydrogen\natmospheres that also fit well. Here we investigate the applicability of UTCAs\nto CCOs. We show the following: (i) The phase-averaged spectra of the three\npulsed CCOs can also be fitted with a UTCA of the appropriate NS area, despite\npulsed CCOs manifestly having non-uniform surface temperature. A good spectral\nfit is therefore not strong support for the UTCA model of unpulsed CCOs.

In this article, by using the coupling of neutrinos\nwith dark energy, we investigate the cosmic evolution from the era of matter\ndominated to the era of dark energy dominated and show that neutrinos can play\nan important role in the evolution from radiation dominated to matter dominated\nand the evolution from Matter dominated to dark energy dominated. Also, we\ninvestigate the effect of non-relativistic neutrino on bulk flow and show that\nthe direction of bulk flow has a little difference in scales smaller than 0.1,\nand the more we consider the scales higher than the local universe, the more\ndifference is observed in the direction of bulk flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 12:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

In this paper, we propose a Variational Neural\nNetwork-based TANet 3D object detector to generate 3D object detections with\nuncertainty and introduce these detections to an uncertainty-aware AB3DMOT\ntracker.

Initially, it is difficult to\nextract discriminative features from limited fault data. Moreover, a\nwell-trained model must be retrained from scratch to classify the samples from\nnew classes, thus causing a high computational burden and time consumption.\nFurthermore, the model may suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained\nincrementally. Finally, the model decision is biased toward the new classes due\nto the class imbalance. The problems can consequently lead to performance\ndegradation of fault diagnosis models. Accordingly, we introduce a supervised\ncontrastive knowledge distillation for incremental fault diagnosis under\nlimited fault data (SCLIFD) framework to address these issues, which extends\nthe classical incremental classifier and representation learning (iCaRL)\nframework from three perspectives. Primarily, we adopt supervised contrastive\nknowledge distillation (KD) to enhance its representation learning capability\nunder limited fault data. Moreover, we propose a novel prioritized exemplar\nselection method adaptive herding (AdaHerding) to restrict the increase of the\ncomputational burden, which is also combined with KD to alleviate catastrophic\nforgetting. Additionally, we adopt the cosine classifier to mitigate the\nadverse impact of class imbalance.

In contrast, in the absence of long-range order, as in the case of\nnon-crystalline materials, the electronic states are localized and electronic\ncoherence does not develop. This brings forward the fundamental question\nwhether long range order is necessary condition to establish coherence and\nstructured momentum-dependent electronic state, and how to characterize it in\nthe presence of short-range order. Here we study Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a material that\nexists in its crystalline form with long range order, in amorphous form, with\nshort and medium range order, and in its nanocrystalline form, with reduced\nshort range order. By using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to\ndirectly access the electronic states in a momentum resolved manner, we reveal\nthat, even in the absence of long-range order, a well-defined real-space length\nscale is sufficient to produce dispersive band structures. Moreover, we observe\nfor the first time a repeated Fermi surface structure of duplicated annuli,\nreminiscent of Brillouin zone-like repetitions. These results, together with\nour simulations using amorphous Hamiltonians, reveal that the typical momentum\nscale where coherence occurs is the inverse average nearest-neighbor distance,\nthe direct fingerprint of the local order of the underlying atomic structure.\nThese results, not only lead the way to a new understanding of electronic\ncoherence in solids, but also open the way to the realization of novel\nmomentum-dependent quantum phenomena such as momentum pairing and spin-orbit\ncoupling, in a much broader class of materials than the currently studied ones,\nlacking long range crystalline translational symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 15:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Unfortunately, in\nreal-world scenarios, representation learning is usually fragile to\ntask-irrelevant distractions such as variations in background or viewpoint. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a novel clustering-based approach, namely\nClustering with Bisimulation Metrics (CBM), which learns robust representations\nby grouping visual observations in the latent space. Specifically, CBM\nalternates between two steps: (1) grouping observations by measuring their\nbisimulation distances to the learned prototypes; (2) learning a set of\nprototypes according to the current cluster assignments. Computing cluster\nassignments with bisimulation metrics enables CBM to capture task-relevant\ninformation, as bisimulation metrics quantify the behavioral similarity between\nobservations. Moreover, CBM encourages the consistency of representations\nwithin each group, which facilitates filtering out task-irrelevant information\nand thus induces robust representations against distractions. An appealing\nfeature is that CBM can achieve sample-efficient representation learning even\nif multiple distractions exist simultaneously.Experiments demonstrate that CBM\nsignificantly improves the sample efficiency of popular visual RL algorithms\nand achieves state-of-the-art performance on both multiple and single\ndistraction settings.

For authenticated use and communication, each device must\nsecurely store and apply secret keys without giving a potential attacker the\npossibility to access them neither by software nor hardware attacks. In 2002,\nthe concept of Physical Unclonable Function emerged to counteract the inherent\nthreats, associated with this trend. Physical disordered systems are excited by\nexternal stimuli and can thereby be uniquely identified. 2D materials have\nprofoundly different characteristics when isolated from their bulk form to few-\nor monolayers. Transition metal dichalcogenides represent a potential PUF\ncandidate since, unlike graphene, they feature a bandgap and are thus\nsemiconducting. Furthermore, a random percolation network can be formed from\nthem, which is expected to possess an electrical response that is uniquely\nidentifiable yet unpredictable. This work has built the foundation for\nimplementing a PUF consisting of a TMD, namely tungsten disulfide. The material\nhas been synthesized using chemical vapor deposition in the close proximity\napproach. In order to fabricate a large-scale inter-connected surface\nconsisting of WS2, the growth parameters are selected and enclosed by a\npreliminary trial and error optimization and ultimately optimized by Design of\nExperiments. This yields a potentially available PUF area of several\nmillimeters, which was then patterned and contacted with initial trials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 00:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

There is considerable\nevidence that the right to make this choice, which is usually to kick first,\ngives a team a significant advantage. To make the outcome of a tied game\nfairer, we suggest a rule that handicaps the team that kicks first (A),\nrequiring it to succeed on one more penalty kick than the team that kicks\nsecond (B). We call this the $m - n$ rule and, more specifically, propose $(m,\nn)$ = (5, 4): For A to win, it must successfully kick 5 goals before the end of\nthe round in which B kicks its 4th; for B to win, it must succeed on 4 penalty\nkicks before A succeeds on 5. If both teams reach (5, 4) on the same round --\nwhen they both kick successfully at (4, 3) -- then the game is decided by\nround-by-round \"sudden death,\" whereby the winner is the first team to score in\na subsequent round when the other team does not. We show that this rule is fair\nin tending to equalize the ability of each team to win a tied game in a penalty\nshootout. We also discuss a related rule that precludes the teams from reaching\n(5, 4) at the same time, obviating the need for sudden death and extra rounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 19:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

The axial force of a compliant leg is redirected\nto a point, called the virtual pivot point (VPP), of a 2D biped robot, which is\nlocated above the CoM of the model, to generate a restoring moment for the\ntrunk motion. The resulting behavior of the model would resemble a virtual\npendulum rotating around this VPP, thus aiming for an upright trunk during\nwalking. Inspired by this analysis, we propose a new force redirecting method\nas a controller for robot walking. Then, these key features of the BTSLIP model\nwith a simple force direction controller are mapped into the overall input\ntorques of an articulated body robot via a task space controller. We consider a\nfull dynamic simulation of a 2D articulated body robot to validate the\nperformance of the proposed method under the random initial conditions and the\npresence of force disturbances and moderately rough surfaces. Moreover, with\nour control strategy, the robot achieves a stable walking motion while keeping\nits upper body upright without using optimization methods. We hypothesize by\ntaking the advantage of the properties of mechanical templates, also called the\nreduced-order model, this could enable stable gait for the full model robot\nwithout the need for precise path planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 13:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}
