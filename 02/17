Specifically, we partition\nthese data into statistically homogeneous subsets by identifying possible\nclutter power variations with respect to the cells under test (accounting for\npossible range-spread targets) and/or clutter edges. To this end, we consider\ndifferent situations of practical interest and formulate the classification\nproblem as multiple hypothesis tests comprising several models for the\noperating scenario. Then, we solve the hypothesis testing problems by resorting\nto suitable approximations of the model order selection rules due to the\nintractable mathematics associated with the maximum likelihood estimation of\nsome parameters. Remarkably, the classification results provided by the\nproposed architectures represent an advanced clutter map since, besides the\nestimation of the clutter parameters, they contain a clustering of the range\nbins in terms of homogeneous subsets. In fact, such information can drive the\nconventional detectors towards more reliable estimates of the clutter\ncovariance matrix according to the position of the cells under test. The\nperformance analysis confirms that the conceived architectures represent a\nviable means to recognize the scenario wherein the radar is operating at least\nfor the considered simulation parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 16:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

The\nlater assembly time is confirmed by the bluer average color of the BCG and of\nthe galaxy population with respect to the detected systems. They reside with a\nhigher probability in filaments while X-ray detected low-mass halos favor the\nnodes of the Cosmic Web. Because of the suppressed X-ray central emission, the\nundetected systems tend to be X-ray under-luminous at fixed halo mass, and to\nlie below the $L_X-M_{halo}$ relation. Interestingly, the X-ray detected\nsystems inhabiting the nodes scatter the less around the relation, while those\nin filaments tend to lie below it. We do not observe any strong relation\nbetween the properties of detected and undetected systems with the AGN\nactivity. The fraction of optically selected AGN in the galaxy population is\nconsistent in the two samples.

We formulate\ndecision variants of both problems by interpreting the online problems as a\ngame between the online algorithm (the searcher) and the adversary. The map,\nhowever, is not controllable by the adversary. The question is, whether the\nsearcher is able to explore the graph fully or find the treasure for all\npossible decisions of the adversary.\n  We prove the PSPACE-completeness of these games, whereby we analyze the\nvariations which ask for the mere existence of a tour through the graph or path\nto the treasure and the variations that include costs. Additionally, we analyze\nthe complexity of related problems that ask for a tour in the graph or a s-t\npath.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 17:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

In this paper, we develop a general frequency\ndomain framework to analyze and quantify the level of network coherence that a\nsystem exhibits by relating coherence with a low-rank property of the system's\ninput-output response. More precisely, for a networked system with linear\ndynamics and coupling, we show that, as the network's \\emph{effective algebraic\nconnectivity} grows, the system transfer matrix converges to a rank-one\ntransfer matrix representing the coherent behavior.

It is a lesser-known fact that several\nemerging contaminants, such as bisphenol and perfluoro alkylates adsorbing on\nmicro and nanoplastics, could invade the food chain and cause irreversible\ndamage to human health and the environment. Even though wastewater treatment\nplants (WWTPs) have been around for a long time, their removal strategy needs\nto be improved since this is one of the main routes that micro and nanoplastics\nget into the environment. UV deterioration, mechanical stresses, and biological\nprocesses cause plastics to break apart and turn into smaller pieces. They get\nsmall enough to be called nanoplastics, i.e. 1 um. We studied the removal of\nnanoplastics from synthetic wastewater using an electrocoagulation process. We\nused the polystyrene nanoparticles as nanoplastics synthesized from the\nexpanded polystyrene waste (EPS). For studies on electrocoagulation (EC),\naluminium electrodes were used in parallel combination at low voltage\nconditions. We take advantage of the release of gas bubbles from the process to\nenable the removal from the top by scraping them off.

We show that\none may think of the dynamical states of spiking neurons and spiking neural\nnetworks as {\\it time-matter}. Namely, a structure of spike-events in time\nhaving analogue properties to that of ordinary matter. We can define for neural\nsystems notions equivalent to the equations of state, phase diagrams and their\nphase transitions. For instance, the familiar Ideal Gas Law relation (P$v$ =\nconstant) emerges as analogue of the Ideal Integrate and Fire neuron model\nrelation ($I_{in}$ISI = constant). We define the neural analogue of the spatial\nstructure correlation function, that can characterize spiking states with\ntemporal long-range order, such as regular tonic spiking. We also define the\n``neuro-compressibility'' response function in analogy to the lattice\ncompressibility. We show that similarly to the case of ordinary matter, the\nanomalous behavior of the neuro-compressibility is a precursor effect that\nsignals the onset of changes in spiking states. We propose that the notion of\nneuro-compressibility may open the way to develop novel medical tools for the\nearly diagnose of diseases. It may allow to predict impending anomalous neural\nstates, such as Parkinson's tremors, epileptic seizures, electric\ncardiopathies, and perhaps may even serve as a predictor of the likelihood of\nregaining consciousness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 18:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

An active participation of\n$4f$ states is most likely for PrNiO$_2$ based on an analogy to cuprates where\nPr cuprates differ significantly from other cuprates.

Many previous works assign fixed values to these parameters\neither heuristically or through grid search; however, at different moments\nwithin a single episode of dynamic grasping, the optimal values should vary\ndepending on the current scene. In this work, we learn a meta-controller\nthrough reinforcement learning to control the look-ahead time and time budget\ndynamically. Our extensive experiments show that the meta-controller improves\nthe grasping success rate (up to 12% in the most cluttered environment) and\nreduces grasping time, compared to the strongest baseline. Our meta-controller\nlearns to reason about the reachable workspace and maintain the predicted pose\nwithin the reachable region.

We construct three joint priors encoding empirical constraints of\nredshifts, masses, and star formation histories in the galaxy population within\nthe \\prospector\\ Bayesian inference framework. In contrast with uniform priors,\nour model breaks an age-mass-redshift degeneracy, and thus reduces the mean\nbias error in masses from 0.3 to 0.1 dex, and in ages from 0.6 to 0.2 dex in\ntests done on mock JWST observations.

We approach the problem of optimizing the performance of\nthese biased RACs with both numerical and analytical tools. On the numerical\nfront, we present algorithms that allow a numerical evaluation of the optimal\nperformance over both classical and quantum strategies and provide a Python\npackage designed to implement them, called RAC-tools. We then use this\nnumerical tool to investigate single-parameter families of biased RACs in the\n$n^2 \\mapsto 1$ and $2^d \\mapsto 1$ scenarios. For RACs in the $n^2 \\mapsto 1$\nscenario, we derive a general upper bound for the cases in which the inputs are\nnot correlated, which coincides with the quantum value for $n=2$ and, in some\ncases for $n=3$. Moreover, it is shown that attaining this upper bound\nself-tests pairs or triples of rank-1 projective measurements, respectively. An\nanalogous upper bound is derived for the value of RACs in the $2^d \\mapsto 1$\nscenario which is shown to be always attainable using mutually unbiased\nmeasurements if the distribution of input strings is unbiased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 18:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 17:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

The basic idea involves\nexchanging the roles of space and time and evolving the system using a space\ntransfer matrix. The infinite-volume limit is then described by the fixed\npoints of this operator, also known as influence matrices. To evaluate the\npotential of this method as a numerical scheme, it is important to understand\nwhether the influence matrices can be efficiently encoded in a classical\ncomputer. It is then natural to wonder what is the scaling of their\nentanglement, dubbed temporal entanglement, as a function of time. In this work\nwe study space evolution in chaotic quantum circuits. First, we extend the\nconcept of space-evolution to include evolution in any generic space-like\ndirection, which enables us to use influence matrices on a generic time-like\nsurface, or path, to describe any two-point function. Then we study their\nentanglement, finding that it scales linearly with time for all paths but with\ntwo interesting marginal cases: (i) vertical paths in generic chaotic systems\n(ii) any path in dual-unitary circuits. In these cases R\\'enyi entropies with\nindex larger than one are sub-linear in time, while the von Neumann\nentanglement entropy is linear but grows at a slower rate compared to regular\nstate entanglement. We attribute this behaviour to the existence of a product\nstate with large overlap with the influence matrices, similarly to what has\nbeen observed for regular entanglement in systems with conservation laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 18:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

This new binary-binary force is in\nsome settings of the same order-of-magnitude than the usual 2.5PN force for an\nisolated binary and presents some striking features such as a dependence on\nretarded time even in the post-Newtonian regime where all velocities are\narbitrarily small. Using Effective Field Theory tools, we provide the\nexpression of the force in generic configurations and show that it interpolates\nbetween several intuitive results in different limits.

That UVLF correlates strongly with local reionization redshift:\nearlier-reionizing regions have UVLFs that are higher, more extended to\nbrighter magnitudes, and flatter at the faint end than later-reionizing regions\nobserved at the same $z$. In general, as a region reionizes, the faint-end\nslope of its local UVLF flattens, and, by $z=6$ (when reionization ended), the\nglobal UVLF, too, exhibits a flattened faint-end slope, `rolling-over' at\n$M_\\text{UV}\\gtrsim-17$.

A popular autobidding stategy is value maximization\nsubject to return-on-spend (ROS) constraints.

We have analyzed the properties of a sample of 119\nplanet-host binary stars from the Kepler mission to study the underlying\npopulation of planets in binaries that fall in and around the radius valley,\nwhich is a demographic feature in period-radius space that marks the transition\nfrom predominantly rocky to predominantly gaseous planets. We found no\nstatistically significant evidence for a radius gap for our sample of 122\nplanets in binaries when assuming the primary stars are the planet hosts, with\na low probability ($p < 0.05$) of the binary planet sample radius distribution\nbeing consistent with the single-star small planet population via an\nAnderson-Darling test. These results reveal demographic differences in the\nplanet size distribution between planets in binary and single stars for the\nfirst time, showing that stellar multiplicity may fundamentally alter the\nplanet formation process. A larger sample and further assessment of\ncircumprimary versus circumsecondary transits is needed to either validate this\nnon-detection or explore other scenarios, such as a radius gap with a location\nthat is dependent on binary separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 19:07:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Pioneering work by\nMishima and Stanley [Nature 392, 164 (1998) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 334\n(2000)] sought to shed light on this problem by studying the melting curves of\ndifferent ice polymorphs and their metastable continuation in the vicinity of\nthe expected location of the liquid-liquid transition and its associated\ncritical point. Based on the continuous or discontinuous changes in slope of\nthe melting curves, Mishima suggested that the liquid-liquid critical point\nlies between the melting curves of ice III and ice V. Here, we explore this\nconjecture using molecular dynamics simulations with a purely-predictive\nmachine learning model based on ab initio quantum-mechanical calculations. We\nstudy the melting curves of ices III, IV, V, VI, and XIII using this model and\nfind that the melting lines of all the studied ice polymorphs are supercritical\nand do not intersect the liquid-liquid transition locus. We also find a\npronounced, yet continuous, change in slope of the melting lines upon crossing\nof the locus of maximum compressibility of the liquid. Finally, we analyze\ncritically the literature in light of our findings, and conclude that the\nscenario in which melting curves are supercritical is favored by the most\nrecent computational and experimental evidence. Thus, although the\npreponderance of experimental and computational evidence is consistent with the\nexistence of a second critical point in water, the behavior of the melting\nlines of ice polymorphs does not provide strong evidence in support of this\nviewpoint, according to our calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 19:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

In this\nwork, we investigate the possibility to introduce randomness into artificial\ngauge fields by applying local random phase shifts in the modulation of\nlattices of optical waveguides. We first study the elemental unit consisting of\ntwo coupled single-mode waveguides and determine the effective complex-valued\ncoupling coefficient after one period of the modulation as a function of the\nphase shift, the modulation amplitude and the modulation frequency.

In the ocean,\nself-propelled mesozooplankton generate vortices while swimming within a weakly\nstratified fluid. While large-scale biogenic transport has been observed during\nvertical migration in the wild and lab experiments, little focus has been given\nto the evolution of induced vortex rings as a function of their propagation\ndirection relative to the density gradient. In this study, the evolution of an\nisolated vortex ring crossing the interface of a stable two-layer system is\nexamined as a function of its translation direction with respect to gravity.\nThe vortex ring size and position are visualized using Planar Induced\nFluorescence (PLIF) and the induced vorticity field derived from Particle Image\nVelocimetry (PIV) is examined. It is found that the production of baroclinic\nvorticity significantly affects the propagation of vortex rings crossing the\ndensity interface. As a result, any expected symmetry between vortex rings\ntraveling from dense to light fluids and from light to dense fluids breaks\ndown. In turn, the maximum penetration depth of the vortex ring occurs in the\ncase in which the vortex propagates against the density gradient due to the\nmisalignment of the pressure and density gradients.

Over\nthe recent years, a revolutionary new paradigm has been developed for training\nmodels for NLP. These models are first pre-trained on large collections of text\ndocuments to acquire general syntactic knowledge and semantic information.\nThen, they are fine-tuned for specific tasks, which they can often solve with\nsuperhuman accuracy. When the models are large enough, they can be instructed\nby prompts to solve new tasks without any fine-tuning. Moreover, they can be\napplied to a wide range of different media and problem domains, ranging from\nimage and video processing to robot control learning. Because they provide a\nblueprint for solving many tasks in artificial intelligence, they have been\ncalled Foundation Models. After a brief introduction to basic NLP models the\nmain pre-trained language models BERT, GPT and sequence-to-sequence transformer\nare described, as well as the concepts of self-attention and context-sensitive\nembedding. Then, different approaches to improving these models are discussed,\nsuch as expanding the pre-training criteria, increasing the length of input\ntexts, or including extra knowledge. An overview of the best-performing models\nfor about twenty application areas is then presented, e.g., question answering,\ntranslation, story generation, dialog systems, generating images from text,\netc. For each application area, the strengths and weaknesses of current models\nare discussed, and an outlook on further developments is given. In addition,\nlinks are provided to freely available program code. A concluding chapter\nsummarizes the economic opportunities, mitigation of risks, and potential\ndevelopments of AI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 20:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

Symmetries imply conservation laws,\nwhich partition Hilbert space into invariant subspaces of the time-evolution\noperator, each of which is demarcated according to its conserved quantity. We\nshow that, starting from a chosen basis, any invariant, symmetry-protected\nsubspaces which are diagonal in that basis are discoverable using transitive\nclosure on graphs representing state-to-state transitions under $k$-local\nunitary operations. Importantly, the discovery of these subspaces relies\nneither upon the explicit identification of a symmetry operator or its\neigenvalues nor upon the construction of matrices of the full Hilbert space\ndimension. We introduce two classical algorithms, which efficiently compute and\nelucidate features of these subspaces.

Then, we defined a 12-class\ncomplex daily activity recognition task and evaluated the performance with\ndifferent approaches. We found that even though the generic multi-country\napproach provided an AUROC of 0.70, the country-specific approach performed\nbetter with AUROC scores in [0.79-0.89].

In more detail, one\nsource agent initially holds the correct opinion and remains with this opinion\nthroughout the execution. The goal for non-source agents is to quickly agree on\nthis correct opinion, and do that robustly, i.e., from any initial\nconfiguration. The system evolves in rounds. In each round, one agent chosen\nuniformly at random is activated: unless it is the source, the agent pulls the\nopinions of $\\ell$ random agents and then updates its opinion according to some\nrule. We consider a restricted setting, in which agents have no memory and they\nonly revise their opinions on the basis of those of the agents they currently\nsample. As restricted as it is, this setting encompasses very popular opinion\ndynamics, such as the voter model and best-of-$k$ majority rules.\n  Qualitatively speaking, we show that lack of memory prevents efficient\nconvergence. Specifically, we prove that no dynamics can achieve correct\nconvergence in an expected number of steps that is sub-quadratic in $n$, even\nunder a strong version of the model in which activated agents have complete\naccess to the current configuration of the entire system, i.e., the case\n$\\ell=n$. Conversely, we prove that the simple voter model (in which $\\ell=1$)\ncorrectly solves the problem, while almost matching the aforementioned lower\nbound.\n  These results suggest that, in contrast to symmetric consensus problems (that\ndo not involve a notion of correct opinion), fast convergence on the correct\nopinion using stochastic opinion dynamics may indeed require the use of memory.\nThis insight may reflect on natural information dissemination processes that\nrely on a few knowledgeable individuals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 21:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

However, the protection of image-processing neural\nnetworks remains a challenge, with only a limited number of methods being\ndeveloped. The objective of these techniques is to embed a watermark in the\noutput images of the target generative network, so that the watermark signal\ncan be detected in the output of a surrogate model obtained through model\nextraction attacks. This promising technique, however, has certain limits.\nAnalysis of the frequency domain reveals that the watermark signal is mainly\nconcealed in the high-frequency components of the output. Thus, we propose an\noverwriting attack that involves forging another watermark in the output of the\ngenerative network. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this\nattack in sabotaging existing watermarking schemes for image-processing\nnetworks, with an almost 100% success rate. To counter this attack, we devise\nan adversarial framework for the watermarking network. The framework\nincorporates a specially designed adversarial training step, where the\nwatermarking network is trained to defend against the overwriting network,\nthereby enhancing its robustness. Additionally, we observe an overfitting\nphenomenon in the existing watermarking method, which can render it\nineffective.

The crux of this predicament is that the task is\nnaively treated as a box regression problem, where rare samples might be\ndominated by normal samples, and the composition patterns of rare samples are\nnot well exploited.

The mainstream methods in the graph classification\ntask can extract the long-range dependencies either by designing the pooling\noperations or incorporating the higher-order neighbors, while they have evident\ndrawbacks by modifying the original graph structure, which may result in\ninformation loss in graph structure learning.

The first feature is a compact and sparse DD domain\nparameterization of the wireless channel, where the parameters map directly to\nphysical attributes of the reflectors that comprise the scattering environment,\nand as a consequence these parameters evolve predictably. The second feature is\na novel waveform / modulation technique, matched to the DD channel model, that\nembeds information symbols in the DD domain. The relation between channel\ninputs and outputs is localized, non-fading and predictable, even in the\npresence of significant delay and Doppler spread, and as a consequence the\nchannel can be efficiently acquired and equalized. By avoiding fading, the post\nequalization SNR remains constant across all information symbols in a packet,\nso that bit error performance is superior to contemporary multi-carrier\nwaveforms. Further, the OTFS carrier waveform is a localized pulse in the DD\ndomain, making it possible to separate reflectors along both delay and Doppler\nsimultaneously, and to achieve a high-resolution delay-Doppler radar image of\nthe environment. In other words, the DD parameterization provides a common\nmathematical framework for communication and radar.

Such relation,\nhowever, breaks down when the grains become too small. Experimental studies\nhave circumvented this problem in a set of Ni-Mo alloys by stabilizing the\ngrain boundaries (GB). Here, using atomistic simulations with a machine\nlearning-based interatomic potential (ML-IAP), we demonstrate that the inverse\nHall-Petch relation can be correctly reproduced due to a change in the dominant\ndeformation mechanism as the grain becomes small in the Ni-Mo polycrystals. It\nis found that the atomic von Mises strain can be significantly reduced by\neither solute doping and/or annealing for small-grain-size polycrystals,\nleading to the increased strength of the polycrystals. On the other hand, for\nlarge-grain-size polycrystals, annealing weakens the material due to the large\natomic movements in GB regions. Over a broad range of grain size, the\nsuperposition of the solute and annealing effects on polycrystals enhances the\nstrength of those with small grain size more than those with large ones, giving\nrise to the continuous strengthening at extremely small grain sizes. Overall,\nthis study not only demonstrates the reliability of the ML-IAP, but also\nprovides a comprehensive atomistic view of complex strengthening mechanisms in\nnanocrystals, opening up a new avenue to tailor their mechanical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 05:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

In this paper, we address this\nproblem from the aspect of projection-based 3DQA and develop a no-reference\n(NR) \\underline{E}fficient and \\underline{E}ffective\n\\underline{P}rojection-based \\underline{3D} Model \\underline{Q}uality\n\\underline{A}ssessment (\\textbf{EEP-3DQA}) method. The input projection images\nof EEP-3DQA are randomly sampled from the six perpendicular viewpoints of the\n3D model and are further spatially downsampled by the grid-mini patch sampling\nstrategy. Further, the lightweight Swin-Transformer tiny is utilized as the\nbackbone to extract the quality-aware features. Finally, the proposed EEP-3DQA\nand EEP-3DQA-t (tiny version) achieve the best performance than the existing\nstate-of-the-art NR-3DQA methods and even outperforms most full-reference (FR)\n3DQA methods on the point cloud and mesh quality assessment databases while\nconsuming less inference time than the compared 3DQA methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 06:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

We validate our method on three\ndomains, Mountain Car, a locomotion task of Quadruped-Walk, and a robotic\nmanipulation task of Sweep-Into, and find that using the proposed augmentation\nthe agent not only benefits in the overall performance but does so, quite early\nin the agent's training phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 07:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

Traditional SLAM\napproaches infer the metric state of the robot along with a metric map of the\nenvironment. While existing algorithms exhibit good results, they are still\nsensitive to measurement noise, sensor quality, and data association and are\nstill computationally expensive. Alternatively, some navigation and mapping\nmissions can be achieved using only qualitative geometric information, an\napproach known as qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR). We contribute a novel\nprobabilistic qualitative localization and mapping approach in this work. We\ninfer both the qualitative map and the qualitative state of the camera poses\n(localization). For the first time, we also incorporate qualitative\nprobabilistic constraints between camera poses (motion model), improving\ncomputation time and performance. Furthermore, we take advantage of qualitative\ninference properties to achieve very fast approximated algorithms with good\nperformance. In addition, we show how to propagate probabilistic information\nbetween nodes in the qualitative map, which improves estimation performance and\nenables inference of unseen map nodes - an important building block for\nqualitative active planning. We also conduct a study that shows how well we can\nestimate unseen nodes. Our method particularly appeals to scenarios with few\nsalient landmarks and low-quality sensors.

However, in the case of bosons the occupation number\nis unbounded. If there is a large occupation number, the Bose enhancement needs\nto be taken into consideration for any process involving particles which\ninteract with the dark matter. Because the occupation number scales inversely\nwith the dark matter mass, this effect is most prominent for ultralight dark\nmatter.

This results in the\npropagation of a subsidence, known as a collapse wave or anticrack. The slab\nmay eventually break and detach from the rest of the snowpack, provided that\nthe slope is steep enough to enable gravity to overcome the friction. The only\ntheoretical framework to date (Heierli 2005) proposed an explicit solution for\nthe propagation speed in steady state which could not account for weak layer\nproperties, was not mathematically bounded for certain values of the physical\nconstants involved, and could not explain the newly uncovered supershear\ntransition for steep slopes. Here, a new model for the stationary propagation\nof anticracks is set up, so as to account for the anticrack speed regime on the\none hand, and the supershear regime on the other hand, the existence of which\nhas been recently revealed and ascertained by numerical simulations. The\nresults presented here seem consistent with most of the available data, and\nhighlight the role that the compaction of the weak layer can play in reducing\nthe anticrack speed. On the contrary, by storing energy upon failure and\nsuddenly releasing it at the crack tip, the weak layer elasticity could help\njustify the higher speeds sometimes observed in both regimes.

The measured channel impulse responses are used\nto derive a Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-style propagation\nmodel, used to calculate the Gini index for the comparison of the channel\nsparsity between the measurement and simulation based on the 3GPP model. Our\nresults show that the mean value of the Gini index in measurement is over twice\nthe value in simulation, implying that the 3GPP channel model does not capture\nthe effects of sparsity in the delay domain as frequency increases.

We find that although the voice of AI is considered valuable, AI still\nplays a secondary role in the group because it cannot fully follow the dynamics\nof the discussion and make progressive contributions. Moreover, the divergent\nopinions of our participants regarding an \"equal AI\" shed light on the possible\nfuture of human-AI relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 11:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

However, it\nhas recently been shown that various oscillation protocols can unjam as well as\nreduce viscosity and dissipation.

We show that many\ncruising protocols' dissipation are similar to shear protocols with a steady\nprimary shear and superimposed cross oscillations, even though the latter's\nviscosity reduction is more considerable. Furthermore, we find that alternating\nbetween primary and perpendicular oscillations yields a much higher dissipation\nthan the two protocols mentioned above, yet has similar viscosity as the\ncross-oscillatory one. While self-organization has been shown to minimize\nviscosity, our findings challenge the idea that random organization is the\nunderlying mechanism for reducing dissipation. Instead, shear ``fragility''\ncombined with geometry seems to be the key ingredients, which explains the\ncounter-intuitive decoupling of the minima of viscosity and dissipation for the\ncruising protocol.

An approach that identifies key\nmolecular species for a given input-response relationship and characterises\ndynamic properties of states is therefore highly desirable.

It is shown that, in practical\nfinite-wordlength implementations, the overall system corresponds to a\ntime-varying system that can be represented in essentially two different ways.\nOne way is to represent the system with a distortion function and aliasing\nfunctions, which in this paper is derived from multirate filter bank\nrepresentations. The other way is to use a periodically time-varying\nimpulse-response representation or, equivalently, a set of time-invariant\nimpulse responses and the corresponding frequency responses. The paper provides\nsystematic derivations and analyses of these representations along with filter\nimpulse response properties and design examples. The representations are\nparticularly useful when analyzing the effect of coefficient quantizations as\nwell as the use of shorter DFT lengths than theoretically required. A\ncomprehensive computational-complexity analysis is also provided, and accurate\nformulas for estimating the optimal DFT lengths for given filter lengths are\nderived. Using optimal DFT lengths, it is shown that the frequency-domain\nimplementations have lower computational complexities (multiplication rates)\nthan the corresponding time-domain implementations for filter lengths that are\nshorter than those reported earlier in the literature. In particular, for\ngeneral (unsymmetric) filters, the frequency-domain implementations are shown\nto be more efficient for all filter lengths.

Results: We found strong correlations between the NUV and the OH-band\n(2.7 um) absorptions for primitive asteroids and hydrated meteorites,\nsuggesting the NUV absorption can be indicative of hydrated silicates.\nMoreover, there is a great difference in the NUV absorption between the large\nasteroids (diameter d > 50 km) and small asteroids (d < 10 km) in the taxonomic\ndistribution. The taxonomic distribution of asteroids differs between the inner\nmain belt and middle-outer main belt.

The asteroids beyond the main belt consist mostly of P and\nD types, although P types are common everywhere in the main belt. The peculiar\ndistribution of F types might indicate a different formation reservoir or\ndisplacement process of F types in the early Solar System.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 13:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

An\nETF achieves equality in Donoho and Elad's spark bound if and only if its\nbinder is nonempty. When this occurs, its binder is the set of all linearly\ndependent subsets of it of minimal size. Moreover, if members of the binder\nform a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) then its incidence matrix can be\nphased to produce a sparse representation of its dual (Naimark complement). A\nfew infinite families of ETFs are known to have this remarkable property. In\nthis paper, we relate this property to the recently introduced concept of a\ndoubly transitive equiangular tight frame (DTETF), namely an ETF for which the\nnatural action of its symmetry group is doubly transitive.

This property ensures the security of quantum key\ndistribution. It is therefore an important task in quantum communication to\ndesign and implement strategies to optimally distinguish quantum states. In\ngeneral, when distinguishing multiple copies of quantum states the optimal\nmeasurement will be an entangling collective measurement. However, to date,\ncollective measurements have not been used to enhance quantum state\ndiscrimination. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that, in the usual\nstate discrimination setting, at least three copies of a quantum state are\nrequired to be measured collectively to outperform separable measurements. This\nis very challenging experimentally. In this work, we propose and experimentally\ndemonstrate a protocol for distinguishing two copies of single qubit states\nusing collective measurements which achieves a lower probability of error than\ncan be achieved by any non-entangling measurement.

Here we consider a problem where\nstabilizability or controllability are investigated together with the further\naim of a \"cost regulation\", namely a state-dependent upper bounding of the\nfunctional. This paper is devoted to a crucial step in the program of\nestablishing a chain of equivalences among degree-k stabilizability with\nregulated cost, asymptotic controllability with regulated cost, and the\nexistence of a degree-k Minimum Restraint Function (which is a special kind of\nControl Lyapunov Function). Besides the presence of a cost we allow the\nstabilizing \"feedback\" to give rise to directions that range in the union of\noriginal directions and the family of iterated Lie bracket of length less or\nequal to $k$. In the main result asymptotic controllability [resp. with\nregulated cost] is proved to be necessary for degree-k stabilizability [resp.\nwith regulated cost]. Further steps of the above-mentioned logical chain are\nproved in companion papers, so that also a Lyapunov-type inverse theorem --\ni.e. the possibility of deriving existence of a Minimum Restraint Function from\nstabilizability -- appears as quite likely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 14:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

Specifically, DIDAN first adopts a simple deep regression network\nconsisting of a set of convolutional and fully connected layers to directly\nregress the source speech spectrums into the emotional labels such that the\nproposed DIDAN can own the emotion discriminative ability.

Among the challenges of HE, scheme parametrization (i.e., the\nselection of appropriate parameters within the algorithms) is a relevant\nmulti-faced problem. First, the parametrization needs to comply with a set of\nproperties to guarantee the security of the underlying scheme. Second,\nparametrization requires a deep understanding of the low-level primitives since\nthe parameters have a confronting impact on the precision, performance, and\nsecurity of the scheme.

Due to the coupling of the optimization\nvariables, we use the alternating optimization (AO) method to solve the\nproblem. Given reflecting coefficients, we apply majorization-minimization (MM)\nand semidefinite programming (SDP) to deal with the nonconvex QoS constraints\nand Radar SINR. An initialization method is proposed to obtain a high-quality\nconverged solution, and a sufficient condition of the feasibility of the\noriginal problem is provided. After applying the MM algorithm, the Radar SINR\nand the transmit power of the active RIS can be expressed as quartic functions\nof RIS coefficients, which is solved by a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based\nalgorithm. Finally, simulation results validate the potential of active RIS in\nISAC system compared to the passive RIS, and indicate that the transmit power\nand physical location of the active RIS should be carefully chosen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 15:20:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2023 08:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

The weak gravity regime of this theory, which would\ndescribe solar-system experiments, is studied using the parametrized\npost-Newtonian (PPN) formalism. We derive the expression of the ten parameters\nof this formalism. They are modified with respect to their values in the\ntheories without direct couplings.

Practically,\nthere exist two typical types, \\textit{i.e.}, the fusion-encoder type and the\ndual-encoder type, depending on whether a heavy fusion module is used. The\nformer is superior at multi-modal tasks owing to the sufficient interaction\nbetween modalities; the latter is good at uni-modal and cross-modal tasks due\nto the single-modality encoding ability. To take advantage of these two types,\nwe propose an effective yet straightforward scheme named PTUnifier to unify the\ntwo types. We first unify the input format by introducing visual and textual\nprompts, which serve as a feature bank that stores the most representative\nimages/texts. By doing so, a single model could serve as a \\textit{foundation\nmodel} that processes various tasks adopting different input formats\n(\\textit{i.e.}, image-only, text-only, and image-text-pair). Furthermore, we\nconstruct a prompt pool (instead of static ones) to improve diversity and\nscalability. Experimental results show that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on a broad range of tasks, spanning uni-modal tasks\n(\\textit{i.e.}, image/text classification and text summarization), cross-modal\ntasks (\\textit{i.e.}, image-to-text generation and image-text/text-image\nretrieval), and multi-modal tasks (\\textit{i.e.}, visual question answering),\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

The BGG is comprised of\nmultiple merging components extending ~3.6\" (30kpc) across the sky. The BGG\ncontributes 69% of the group's total galactic stellar mass, with one of the\nmerging components containing 76% of the total mass of the BGG and a\nSFR>1810Msun/yr.

In this paper, we study the problem of\nsynthesizing post-disturbance stability-aware controlled islanding strategies.\nTo ensure post-disturbance stability, our computation of islanding strategies\ntakes load-generation balance and transmission line capacity constraints into\nconsideration, leading to a hybrid optimization problem with both discrete and\ncontinuous variables. To mitigate the computational challenge incurred when\nsolving the hybrid optimization program, we propose the concepts of hybrid\nsubmodularity and hybrid matroid.

Same as other models evolved by metaheuristic algorithms, premature\nconvergence, trapping in local minima, and failure to converge in a reasonable\ntime are three defects MFO confronts in solving problems with high-dimension\nsearch space. Spiral flying is the key component of the MFO as it determines\nhow the moths adjust their positions in relation to flames; thereby, the shape\nof spiral motions can regulate the transition behavior between the exploration\nand exploitation phases. Therefore, this chapter investigates the efficiency of\nseven spiral motions with different curvatures and slopes in the performance of\nthe MFO, especially for underwater target classification tasks. To assess the\nperformance of the customized model, in addition to benchmark Sejnowski &\nGorman's dataset, two experimental sonar datasets, i.e., the passive sonar and\nactive datasets, are exploited. The results of MFO and its modifications are\ncompared to four novel nature-inspired algorithms, including Heap-Based\nOptimizer (HBO), Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA), Ant Lion Optimization\n(ALO), Stochastic Fractals Search (SFS), as well as the classic Particle Swarm\nOptimization (PSO).

For accurate representation of the gapless CVSR, in\naddition to a realistic nonlinear and lossy core, elaborate models of different\nflux leakages are given. Results from analyses for a range of distances between\nthe coils of the ac winding at different bias currents are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 04:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}
