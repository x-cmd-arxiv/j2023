The proposed algorithm capitalizes on an energy-aware\nCartesian impedance controller, which features energy scaling and damping\ninjection, and an augmented energy tank, which limits the power flow from the\ncontroller to the robot. The controller is evaluated in a real-world flawed\nunscrewing task with a Franka Emika Panda and is compared to a standard\nimpedance controller and a hybrid force-impedance controller. The results\ndemonstrate the high potential of the algorithm in human-robot collaborative\ndisassembly tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 16:54:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 09:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

Thus, DRAM has adopted Target-Row-Refresh (TRR) which\nrefreshes victim rows that can possibly lose stored data due to neighboring\naggressor rows. Accordingly, prior works focused on TRR algorithm that can\nidentify the most frequently accessed row, Rowhammer, to detect the victim\nrows. TRR algorithm can be implemented in memory controller, yet it can cause\neither insufficient or excessive number of TRRs due to lack of information of\nRowhammer threshold and it can also degrade system performance due to\nadditional command for Rowhammer mitigation. Therefore, this paper focuses on\nin-DRAM TRR algorithm.\n  In general, counter-based detection algorithms have higher detection accuracy\nand scalability compared to probabilistic detection algorithms. However, modern\nDRAM extremely limits the number of counters for TRR algorithm. This paper\ndemonstrates that decoy-rows are the fundamental reason the state-of-the-art\ncounter-based algorithms cannot properly detect Rowhammer under the area\nlimitation. Decoy-rows are rows whose number of accesses does not exceed the\nnumber of Rowhammer accesses within an observation period. Thus, decoy-rows\nshould not replace Rowhammer which are in a count table.

Therefore, this paper proposes `in-DRAM\nStochastic and Approximate Counting (DSAC) algorithm', which leverages\nStochastic Replacement to filter out decoy-rows and Approximate Counting for\nlow area cost. The key idea is that a replacement occurs if a new row comes in\nmore than a minimum count row in a count table on average so that decoy-rows\ncannot replace Rowhammer in a count table.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 16:58:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 05:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Similar to\nAV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A = K, Cs, Rb), FeGe exhibits the CDW pattern with an\nin-plane 2$\\times $2 structure and the existence of van Hove singularities\n(vHSs) near the Fermi level. However, sharply different from AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$\nwhich has phonon instability at $M$ point, all the theoretically calculated\nphonon frequencies in FeGe remain positive.

Two Fermi pockets\nwith Fe-$d_{xz}$ and Fe-$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$/$d_{xy}$ orbital characters have\nlarge contribution to the Fermi nesting, which evolve significantly with\n$k_{z}$, indicating the highly three-dimensional (3D) feature of FeGe in\ncontrast to AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$. Meanwhile, the vHSs are close to the Fermi\nsurface only in a small $k_{z}$ range, and does not play a leading role in\nnesting function. Considering the effect of local Coulomb interaction, we\nreveal that the Fermi level eigenstates nested by vector $K$ are mainly\ndistributed from unequal sublattice occupancy, thus the instability at $K$\npoint is significantly suppressed. Meanwhile, the wave functions nested by\nvector $M$ have many ingredients located at the same Fe site, thus the\ninstability at $M$ point is enhanced. This indicates that the electron\ncorrelation, rather than electron-phonon interaction, plays a key role in the\nCDW transition at $M$ point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 17:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 17:58:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Using echo tomography we map the\nline-of-sight dust distribution and find evidence for significant column\ndensities at large distances (~> 10kpc). We present analysis of the light\ncurves and spectra at X-ray and UV/optical wavelengths, and find that the X-ray\nafterglow of GRB 221009A is more than an order of magnitude brighter at T0 +\n4.5 ks than any previous GRB observed by Swift.

Previous research has focused on three phases of writing:\nplanning, translation and transcription, and revision. While research has shown\nthese are non-linear, they are often treated linearly when measured. Here, we\nintroduce measures to detect and quantify subcycles of planning (exploration)\nand translation (exploitation) during the writing process.

Interestingly, this representation\nhighlights the phases of \"translation flow\", where authors improve existing\nideas, and exploration, where creative deviations appear as the writer returns\nto the planning phase. These turning points between translation and exploration\nbecome rarer as the writing process progresses and the author approaches the\nfinal version.

However, novel classes\nemerge from time to time in our ever-changing world, requiring a learning\nsystem to acquire new knowledge continually. For example, a robot needs to\nunderstand new instructions, and an opinion monitoring system should analyze\nemerging topics every day. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables the learner\nto incorporate the knowledge of new classes incrementally and build a universal\nclassifier among all seen classes. Correspondingly, when directly training the\nmodel with new class instances, a fatal problem occurs -- the model tends to\ncatastrophically forget the characteristics of former ones, and its performance\ndrastically degrades. There have been numerous efforts to tackle catastrophic\nforgetting in the machine learning community. In this paper, we survey\ncomprehensively recent advances in deep class-incremental learning and\nsummarize these methods from three aspects, i.e., data-centric, model-centric,\nand algorithm-centric.

Here, we theoretically propose and\nexperimentally demonstrate a design strategy for silicon modulators by\nemploying the slow light effect, which shatters the present bandwidth ceiling\nof silicon modulators and pushes its limit beyond 110 GHz in a small footprint.\nThe proposed silicon modulator is built on a coupled-resonator optical\nwaveguide (CROW) architecture, in which a set of Bragg gratings are\nappropriately cascaded to give rise to a slow light effect. By comprehensively\nbalancing a series of merits including the group index, photon lifetime,\nelectrical bandwidth, and losses, we found the modulators can benefit from the\nslow light for better modulation efficiency and compact size while remaining\ntheir bandwidth sufficiently high to support ultra-high-speed data\ntransmission.

Developing a mechanism for battling financial\ncrimes is an impending task that requires in-depth collaboration from multiple\ninstitutions, and yet such collaboration imposed significant technical\nchallenges due to the privacy and security requirements of distributed\nfinancial data. For example, consider the modern payment network systems, which\ncan generate millions of transactions per day across a large number of global\ninstitutions.

Two common - but very different - ways to\nmeasure the satisfaction of a voter consider (i) the number of approved\nprojects and (ii) the total cost of approved projects, respectively. In\ngeneral, it is difficult to decide which measure of satisfaction best reflects\nthe voters' true utilities. In this paper, we study proportionality axioms with\nrespect to large classes of approval-based satisfaction functions. We establish\nlogical implications among our axioms and related notions from the literature,\nand we ask whether outcomes can be achieved that are proportional with respect\nto more than one satisfaction function. We show that this is impossible for the\ntwo commonly used satisfaction functions when considering proportionality\nnotions based on extended justified representation, but achievable for a notion\nbased on proportional justified representation. For the latter result, we\nintroduce a strengthening of priceability and show that it is satisfied by\nseveral polynomial-time computable rules, including the Method of Equal Shares\nand Phragm\\`en's sequential rule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 18:46:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

We design new\nalgorithms for learning the Markov coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) and\nMarkov correlated equilibria (CE) with sample complexity bounds that only scale\npolynomially with each agent's own function class complexity, thus breaking the\ncurse of multiagents. In contrast, existing works for Markov games with\nfunction approximation have sample complexity bounds scale with the size of the\n\\emph{joint action space} when specialized to the canonical tabular Markov game\nsetting, which is exponentially large in the number of agents. Our algorithms\nrely on two key technical innovations: (1) utilizing policy replay to tackle\nnon-stationarity incurred by multiple agents and the use of function\napproximation; (2) separating learning Markov equilibria and exploration in the\nMarkov games, which allows us to use the full-information no-regret learning\noracle instead of the stronger bandit-feedback no-regret learning oracle used\nin the tabular setting. Furthermore, we propose an iterative-best-response type\nalgorithm that can learn pure Markov Nash equilibria in independent linear\nMarkov potential games. In the tabular case, by adapting the policy replay\nmechanism for independent linear Markov games, we propose an algorithm with\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity to learn Markov CCE, which\nimproves the state-of-the-art result $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$ in\nDaskalakis et al. 2022, where $\\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy, and also\nsignificantly improves other problem parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 18:47:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 05:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

Despite\nsignificantly affecting a wide range of downstream applications, the\ndistributions of these generated images are still not fully understood,\nespecially when it comes to the potential stereotypical attributes of different\ngenders. In this work, we propose a paradigm (Gender Presentation Differences)\nthat utilizes fine-grained self-presentation attributes to study how gender is\npresented differently in text-to-image models. By probing gender indicators in\nthe input text (e.g., \"a woman\" or \"a man\"), we quantify the frequency\ndifferences of presentation-centric attributes (e.g., \"a shirt\" and \"a dress\")\nthrough human annotation and introduce a novel metric: GEP. Furthermore, we\npropose an automatic method to estimate such differences. The automatic GEP\nmetric based on our approach yields a higher correlation with human annotations\nthan that based on existing CLIP scores, consistently across three\nstate-of-the-art text-to-image models.

The two dynamics are interrelated; from\nthe dynamics of wealth a complex network emerges and the network in turn\ndictates who interacts with whom. We study the time evolution and the economic\nand topological asymptotic characteristics of the model for different values of\na social protection factor $f$, which favors the poorest agent in each wealth\ntransaction. In the case of $f=0$, our results show condensation of wealth and\nconnections in a few agents, in accordance with the mean field models with\nrespect to wealth. Low values of $f$ favor agents from the middle and upper\nclasses, leading to the formation of hubs in the network.

PAH emission was measured considering both the presence or absence of\nplateau components. The variation in the PAH band intensities as a function of\nthe average number of carbon atoms <N$_{C}$> has the highest dynamic range in\nthe SPR case suggesting that smaller PAHs have higher impact on the PAH band\nstrengths. The plateaus show overall declining emission with <N$_{C}$>, and\ntheir higher dynamic range in the SPR case also suggests that smaller PAHs are\nmainly contributing to the plateau emission. The 7.7/(11.0+11.2) $\\mu$m PAH\nband ratio presents the least amount of variance with the lowest dynamic range,\nrendering this ratio as the better choice for tracing PAH charge. The\n3.3/(11.2+11.0) $\\mu$m PAH band ratio is the only ratio that has both a\nmonotonic variance and fully separated values among the SPR and LPR scenarios,\nhighlighting its efficiency as PAH size tracer but also allowing the\ncharacterization of the dominant scenario of processing or formation in a given\nregion or source.

Within medical imaging, accurate regression models have\nthe potential to automate various tasks, helping to lower costs and improve\npatient outcomes. Such safety-critical deployment does however require reliable\nestimation of model uncertainty, also under the wide variety of distribution\nshifts that might be encountered in practice. Motivated by this, we set out to\ninvestigate the reliability of regression uncertainty estimation methods under\nvarious real-world distribution shifts. To that end, we propose an extensive\nbenchmark of 8 image-based regression datasets with different types of\nchallenging distribution shifts. We then employ our benchmark to evaluate many\nof the most common uncertainty estimation methods, as well as two\nstate-of-the-art uncertainty scores from the task of out-of-distribution\ndetection. We find that while methods are well calibrated when there is no\ndistribution shift, they all become highly overconfident on many of the\nbenchmark datasets. This uncovers important limitations of current uncertainty\nestimation methods, and the proposed benchmark therefore serves as a challenge\nto the research community. We hope that our benchmark will spur more work on\nhow to develop truly reliable regression uncertainty estimation methods.

In this work, we demonstrate a scalable\noptical technique to spatially map graphene NEMS networks and read out the\nfixed-frequency collective response as a single vector. Using the response\nvectors, we introduce an efficient algebraic approach to quantify the\nsite-specific elasticity, mass, damping, and coupling parameters of network\nclusters. We apply this technique to accurately characterize single uncoupled\nresonators and coupled resonator pairs by sampling them at just two\nfrequencies, and without the use of curve fitting or the associated a priori\nparameter estimates.

Traditional threat models of data poisoning center around a single\nmetric, the number of poisoned samples. In consequence, existing defenses are\nessentially vulnerable in practice when poisoning more samples remains a\nfeasible option for attackers. To address this issue, we leverage timestamps\ndenoting the birth dates of data, which are often available but neglected in\nthe past. Benefiting from these timestamps, we propose a temporal threat model\nof data poisoning and derive two novel metrics, earliness and duration, which\nrespectively measure how long an attack started in advance and how long an\nattack lasted. With these metrics, we define the notions of temporal robustness\nagainst data poisoning, providing a meaningful sense of protection even with\nunbounded amounts of poisoned samples. We present a benchmark with an\nevaluation protocol simulating continuous data collection and periodic\ndeployments of updated models, thus enabling empirical evaluation of temporal\nrobustness. Lastly, we develop and also empirically verify a baseline defense,\nnamely temporal aggregation, offering provable temporal robustness and\nhighlighting the potential of our temporal modeling of data poisoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 18:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

On the other hand, the existence of\nmassive white dwarfs (WDs), even violating Chandrasekhar mass-limit, was\ninferred from the peak luminosities of type Ia supernovae. Hence, there is a\ngeneric question of the origin of massive compact objects. Here we explore the\nexistence of massive, magnetized, rotating NSs with soft and steep equation of\nstates (EoSs) by solving axisymmetric stationary stellar equilibria in general\nrelativity. For our purpose, we consider the Einstein equation solver for\nstellar structure XNS code. Such rotating NSs with magnetic field and rotation\naxes misaligned, hence with non-zero obliquity angle, can emit continuous\ngravitational waves (GW), which can be detected by upcoming detectors, e.g.,\nEinstein Telescope, etc. We discuss the decays of magnetic field, angular\nvelocity and obliquity angle with time, due to angular momentum extraction by\nGW and dipole radiation, which determine the timescales related to the GW\nemission. Further, in the Alfv\\'en timescale, a differentially rotating,\nmassive proto-NS rapidly settles into an uniformly rotating, less massive NS\ndue to magnetic braking and viscosity. These explorations suggest that\ndetecting massive NSs is challenging and sets a timescale for detection. We\ncalculate the signal-to-noise ratio of GW emission, which confirms that any\ndetector cannot detect them immediately, but detectable by Einstein Telescope,\nCosmic Explorer over months of integration time, leading to direct detection of\nNSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 19:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

We\nfocus on integer solutions given the discrete nature of time in real-time\ncomputer systems.\n  We first express this problem of assigning harmonic periods to a task set as\na discrete piecewise optimization problem.

In turbulent flows a key contribution arises from\ncross-stream ``vorticity cascade'' by nonlinear advection and stretching of\nvorticity. We study this process using numerical simulation data of turbulent\nchannel flow at $Re_\\tau=1000$. The net transfer from the wall of fresh\nspanwise vorticity created by downstream pressure drop is due to two large\nopposing fluxes, one which is ``down-gradient'' or outward from the wall, where\nmost vorticity concentrates, and the other which is ``up-gradient'' or toward\nthe wall and acting against strong viscous diffusion in the near-wall region.\nWe present evidence that the up-gradient transport occurs by a mechanism of\ncorrelated inflow and spanwise vortex stretching that was proposed by\nLighthill. This mechanism is essentially Lagrangian, but we explicate its\nrelation to the Eulerian anti-symmetric vorticity flux tensor. As evidence for\nthe mechanism we study (i) statistical correlations of the wall-normal velocity\nand of wall-normal flux of spanwise vorticity, (ii) vorticity flux cospectra\nthat identify eddies involved in nonlinear vorticity transport in the two\nopposing directions, and (iii) visualizations of coherent vortex structures\nwhich contribute dominantly to the transport.

This operator can be extended to a simplicial complex\n$K$ and therefore offers a way to perform ``signal processing\" on\n$p$-(co)chains of $K$. Recently, the concept of persistent Laplacian was\nproposed and studied for a pair of simplicial complexes $K\\hookrightarrow L$\nconnected by an inclusion relation, further broadening the use of Laplace-based\noperators.\n  In this paper, we expand the scope of the persistent Laplacian by\ngeneralizing it to a pair of simplicial complexes connected by a simplicial map\n$f: K \\to L$. Such simplicial map setting arises frequently, e.g., when\nrelating a coarsened simplicial representation with an original representation,\nor the case when the two simplicial complexes are spanned by different point\nsets i.e. cases in which it does not hold that $K\\subset L$. However, the\nsimplicial map setting is more challenging than the inclusion setting since the\nunderlying algebraic structure is more complicated.\n  We present a natural generalization of the persistent Laplacian to the\nsimplicial setting. To shed insight on the structure behind it, as well as to\ndevelop an algorithm to compute it, we exploit the relationship between the\npersistent Laplacian and the Schur complement of a matrix. A critical step is\nto view the Schur complement as a functorial way of restricting a self-adjoint\nPSD operator to a given subspace. As a consequence, we prove that persistent\nBetti numbers of a simplicial map can be recovered by persistent Laplacians. We\nthen propose an algorithm for finding the matrix representations of persistent\nLaplacians which in turn yields a new algorithm for computing persistent Betti\nnumbers of a simplicial map. Finally, we study the persistent Laplacian on\nsimplicial towers under simplicial maps and establish monotonicity results for\ntheir eigenvalues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 22:04:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 03:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

In this\npaper, we investigate how diverse representation across multiple stages of the\nAI development pipeline affects the distribution of benefits from AI-assisted\nfact-checking for different online communities. We simulate information\npropagation through the network using our novel Topic-Aware, Community-Impacted\nTwitter (TACIT) simulator on a large Twitter followers network, tuned to\nproduce realistic cascades of true and false information across multiple\ntopics.

(2) We design an $O(n^2)$ time algorithm for a special 2-balanced\ncase of {\\em SMSR(A,B)}, where chromosomes $A$ and $B$ both have duplication\nnumber 2 and every repeat appears twice in different orientations in $A$ and\n$B$. (3) We show that SMSR is NP-hard even if the duplication number of the\ninput chromosomes are at most 2, hence showing that the above positive\noptimization result is the best possible. As a by-product, we show that the\n\\emph{minimum Steiner tree} problem on \\emph{circle graphs} is NP-hard,\nsettling the complexity status of a 38-year old open problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 23:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

However, many\nreal-world problems involve balancing multiple, sometimes conflicting,\nobjectives whose relative priority will vary according to the preferences of\neach user. Consequently, a policy that is optimal for one user might be\nsub-optimal for another. In this work, we propose a multi-objective decision\nmaking framework that accommodates different user preferences over objectives,\nwhere preferences are learned via policy comparisons. Our model consists of a\nMarkov decision process with a vector-valued reward function, with each user\nhaving an unknown preference vector that expresses the relative importance of\neach objective. The goal is to efficiently compute a near-optimal policy for a\ngiven user. We consider two user feedback models. We first address the case\nwhere a user is provided with two policies and returns their preferred policy\nas feedback. We then move to a different user feedback model, where a user is\ninstead provided with two small weighted sets of representative trajectories\nand selects the preferred one. In both cases, we suggest an algorithm that\nfinds a nearly optimal policy for the user using a small number of comparison\nqueries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 23:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

In each layer\nthe dust density decreases exponentially with increasing distance from the\nmidplane of the layer. In addition, there are sinusoidal longitudinal\nextinction variations along the midplane of each layer. We have found the most\nprobable values of 29 parameters of our model using four data sets: the 3D\nstellar reddening maps by Gontcharov (2017), Lallement et al. (2019), and Green\net al. (2019) and the extinctions inferred by Anders et al. (2022) for 993291\ngiants from the Gaia EDR3. All of the data give similar estimates of the model\nparameters.

In light of this, this paper\nintroduces a new guided learning from demonstration paradigm where an\ninteractive graphical user interface (GUI) guides the user during\ndemonstration, preventing them from demonstrating non-reproducible motions. The\nkey aspect of our approach is determining the space of reproducible motions\nbased on a motion planning framework which finds regions in the task space\nwhere trajectories are guaranteed to be of bounded length. We evaluate our\nmethod on two different setups with a six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) UR5 as the\ntarget system. First our method is validated using a seven-DOF Sawyer as the\ndemonstration system. Then an extensive user study is carried out where several\nparticipants are asked to demonstrate, with and without guidance, a mock weld\ntask using a hand held tool tracked by a VICON system. With guidance users were\nable to always carry out the task successfully in comparison to only 44% of the\ntime without guidance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 06:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

In this work, we\nreview and compare four different fast CWT algorithms for the 1D signals,\nincluding the FFTCWT, the V97CWT, the M02CWT, and the A19CWT. The FFTCWT\nalgorithm implements the CWT using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with a\ncomputational complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log_2N)$ per scale. The rest\nalgorithms achieve the complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ per scale by simplifying\nthe CWT into some smaller convolutions.

To examine the actual\nperformance of these algorithms, we use them to perform the CWT of signals with\ndifferent wavelets. From the aspect of accuracy, we find that the FFTCWT is the\nmost accurate algorithm, though its accuracy degrades a lot when processing the\nnon-periodic signal with zero boundaries. The accuracy of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$\nalgorithms is robust to signals with different boundaries, and the M02CWT is\nmore accurate than the V97CWT and A19CWT.

Unsupervised\nlearning utilizes unpaired data and is highly desirable for LDCT denoising. As\nan example, an artifact disentanglement network (ADN) relies on unparied images\nand obviates the need for supervision but the results of artifact reduction are\nnot as good as those through supervised learning.An important observation is\nthat there is often hidden similarity among unpaired data that can be utilized.\nThis paper introduces a new learning mode, called quasi-supervised learning, to\nempower the ADN for LDCT image denoising.For every LDCT image, the best matched\nimage is first found from an unpaired normal-dose CT (NDCT) dataset.

In a DMUSS problem, multiple secret messages are\ndeployed and the shares are offloaded to the storage nodes. Moreover, the\naccess structure is extremely incomplete, as the decoding collection of each\nsecret message has only one set, and by the perfect privacy condition such\ncollection is also the colluding collection of all other secret messages. The\nsecret message rate is defined as the size of the secret message normalized by\nthe size of a share. We characterize the capacity region of the DMUSS problem\nwhen given an access structure, defined as the set of all achievable rate\ntuples.\n  In the achievable scheme, we assume all shares are mutually independent and\nthen design the decoding function based on the fact that the decoding\ncollection of each secret message has only one set. Then it turns out that the\nperfect privacy condition is equivalent to the full rank property of some\nmatrices consisting of different indeterminates and zeros. Such a solution does\nexist if the field size is bigger than the number of secret messages. Finally\nwith a matching converse saying that the size of the secret is upper bounded by\nthe sum of sizes of non-colluding shares, we characterize the capacity region\nof DMUSS problem under the perfect privacy condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 07:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

Errors in this predictive model\ncan degrade the performance of model-based controllers, and complex Markov\ndecision processes (MDPs) can present exceptionally difficult prediction\nproblems. To mitigate this issue, we propose predictable MDP abstraction (PMA):\ninstead of training a predictive model on the original MDP, we train a model on\na transformed MDP with a learned action space that only permits predictable,\neasy-to-model actions, while covering the original state-action space as much\nas possible. As a result, model learning becomes easier and more accurate,\nwhich allows robust, stable model-based planning or model-based RL. This\ntransformation is learned in an unsupervised manner, before any task is\nspecified by the user. Downstream tasks can then be solved with model-based\ncontrol in a zero-shot fashion, without additional environment interactions. We\ntheoretically analyze PMA and empirically demonstrate that PMA leads to\nsignificant improvements over prior unsupervised model-based RL approaches in a\nrange of benchmark environments.

Intuitively, the quality of code change\nrepresentations is crucial for the effectiveness of automated approaches. Prior\nwork on code changes usually designs and evaluates code change representation\napproaches for a specific task, and little work has investigated code change\nencoders that can be used and jointly trained on various tasks. To fill this\ngap, this work proposes a novel Code Change Representation learning approach\nnamed CCRep, which can learn to encode code changes as feature vectors for\ndiverse downstream tasks. Specifically, CCRep regards a code change as the\ncombination of its before-change and after-change code, leverages a pre-trained\ncode model to obtain high-quality contextual embeddings of code, and uses a\nnovel mechanism named query back to extract and encode the changed code\nfragments and make them explicitly interact with the whole code change. To\nevaluate CCRep and demonstrate its applicability to diverse code-change-related\ntasks, we apply it to three tasks: commit message generation, patch correctness\nassessment, and just-in-time defect prediction. Experimental results show that\nCCRep outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques on each task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 07:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

For\ndifferent frames of the fisheye video, the existing image correction methods\nignore the correlation of sequences, resulting in temporal jitter in the\ncorrected video. To solve this problem, we propose a temporal weighting scheme\nto get a plausible global optical flow, which mitigates the jitter effect by\nprogressively reducing the weight of frames. Subsequently, we observe that the\ninter-frame optical flow of the video is facilitated to perceive the local\nspatial deformation of the fisheye video. Therefore, we derive the spatial\ndeformation through the flows of fisheye and distorted-free videos, thereby\nenhancing the local accuracy of the predicted result. However, the independent\ncorrection for each frame disrupts the temporal correlation. Due to the\nproperty of fisheye video, a distorted moving object may be able to find its\ndistorted-free pattern at another moment. To this end, a temporal deformation\naggregator is designed to reconstruct the deformation correlation between\nframes and provide a reliable global feature.

However, most motion\nprediction models ignore the influence of the AV's actions and the planning\nmodule has to treat other agents as unalterable moving obstacles. To address\nthis problem, this paper proposes an interaction-aware motion prediction model\nthat is able to predict other agents' future trajectories according to the ego\nagent's future plan, i.e., their reactions to the ego's actions. Specifically,\nwe employ Transformers to effectively encode the driving scene and incorporate\nthe AV's plan in decoding the predicted trajectories. To train the model to\naccurately predict the reactions of other agents, we develop an online learning\nframework, where the ego agent explores the environment and collects other\nagents' reactions to itself. We validate the decision-making and learning\nframework in three highly interactive simulated driving scenarios. The results\nreveal that our decision-making method significantly outperforms the\nreinforcement learning methods in terms of data efficiency and performance. We\nalso find that using the interaction-aware model can bring better performance\nthan the non-interaction-aware model and the exploration process helps improve\nthe success rate in testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 08:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

Worker anonymity motivates participation since\nit protects their privacy. Anonymity with unlinkability is an enhanced version\nof anonymity because it makes it impossible to ``link'' workers across the\ntasks they participate in. Another core feature of crowdsourcing systems is\nworker quality which expresses a worker's trustworthiness and quantifies their\nhistorical performance. Notably, worker quality depends on the participation\nhistory, revealing information about it, while unlinkability aims to\ndisassociate the workers' identities from their past activity. In this work, we\npresent AVeCQ, the first crowdsourcing system that reconciles these properties,\nachieving enhanced anonymity and verifiable worker quality updates. AVeCQ\nrelies on a suite of cryptographic tools, such as zero-knowledge proofs, to (i)\nguarantee workers' privacy, (ii) prove the correctness of worker quality scores\nand task answers, and (iii) commensurate payments. AVeCQ is developed\nmodularly, where the requesters and workers communicate over a platform that\nsupports pseudonymity, information logging, and payments.

To reduce complexity and CPU time, a common approach while\nperforming these analyses consists in replacing electric vehicles and their\ncharging stations with constant PQ loads.

By considering all these aspects, this article develops a novel static\nload model and a vector fitting-based dynamic load model for electric vehicles\nconnected to fast charging stations. These computationally efficient\nrepresentations can replace the standard constant PQ load model of electric\nvehicles to assess more accurately their impact in static and dynamic grid\nstudies.

The optimal distribution of byproduct gases in an iron and steel\nplant can significantly reduce energy costs and carbon emissions. However, the\nbalance between supply and demand is easily threatened by the quantity- and\nquality-related uncertainties from manufacturing processes. Following the\nsupply-storage-conversion-demand network, this study developed an optimal gas\ndistribution model considering uncertain supply and proposed a two-stage robust\noptimization (TSRO) model including \"here-and-now\" decisions, which minimize\nthe start-stop cost of conversion units, and making \"wait-and-see\" decisions,\nwhich minimize the operating costs of gasholders and demand penalties.

Oxygen atom or molecule is important dopant to influence the\nstability of structural, electronic and optical properties as well as the\nperformance of perovskite solar cells. RbPbX3-type perovskites have fantastic\nchemical stability and good power conversion efficiency. Here for the first\ntime, we have studied the effect of interstitial oxygen atom (O1) and molecule\n(O2) on the structural properties, and hence the electronic structure of RbPbI3\nfrom first principles. A significant reduction of the band gap from ~2.6 eV to\n~ 1.0 eV, which is close to the optimal band gap, has been predicted when\nincorporating oxygen. This could in turn be applied to improve the optical\nproperties for harvesting light if we can control the oxygen level\nappropriately. In addition, an exotic metallic state has been found in our\ncalculations for interstitial oxygen molecule when there are strong O-O, O-Pb,\nand O-I bonds, indicating the complex nature of oxygen-doped perovskite solar\ncells. The comparison between oxygen atom and molecules is consistent with the\nprevious report about oxygen-molecule passivation of perovskite solar cells.\nThis indicated oxygen incorporation can not only improve efficiency and\nstability but also facilitate the optimal band-gap engineering. Our work has\ntherefore provided an important and timely theoretical insight to the effect of\noxygen dopants in perovskite solar cells.

One of\nthe effective solutions is the sequential recommendation that relies on click\nbehaviors, but this is not elegant in the video feed recommendation where users\nare passive in receiving the streaming contents and return skip or no-skip\nbehaviors. Here skip and no-skip behaviors can be treated as negative and\npositive feedback, respectively. With the mixture of positive and negative\nfeedback, it is challenging to capture the transition pattern of behavioral\nsequence. To do so, FeedRec has exploited a shared vanilla Transformer, which\nmay be inelegant because head interaction of multi-heads attention does not\nconsider different types of feedback. In this paper, we propose Dual-interest\nFactorization-heads Attention for Sequential Recommendation (short for DFAR)\nconsisting of feedback-aware encoding layer, dual-interest disentangling layer\nand prediction layer. In the feedback-aware encoding layer, we first suppose\neach head of multi-heads attention can capture specific feedback relations.\nThen we further propose factorization-heads attention which can mask specific\nhead interaction and inject feedback information so as to factorize the\nrelation between different types of feedback.

Recently, Unified Open-set Recognition\n(UOSR) has been proposed to reject not only unknown samples but also known but\nwrongly classified samples, which tends to be more practical in real-world\napplications. The UOSR draws little attention since it is proposed, but we find\nsometimes it is even more practical than OSR in the real world applications, as\nevaluation results of known but wrongly classified samples are also wrong like\nunknown samples. In this paper, we deeply analyze the UOSR task under different\ntraining and evaluation settings to shed light on this promising research\ndirection. For this purpose, we first evaluate the UOSR performance of several\nOSR methods and show a significant finding that the UOSR performance\nconsistently surpasses the OSR performance by a large margin for the same\nmethod. We show that the reason lies in the known but wrongly classified\nsamples, as their uncertainty distribution is extremely close to unknown\nsamples rather than known and correctly classified samples. Second, we analyze\nhow the two training settings of OSR (i.e., pre-training and outlier exposure)\ninfluence the UOSR. We find although they are both beneficial for\ndistinguishing known and correctly classified samples from unknown samples,\npre-training is also helpful for identifying known but wrongly classified\nsamples while outlier exposure is not. In addition to different training\nsettings, we also formulate a new evaluation setting for UOSR which is called\nfew-shot UOSR, where only one or five samples per unknown class are available\nduring evaluation to help identify unknown samples.

Overdispersion in Poisson data is treated as an\nintrinsic model variance that can be estimated from the best-fit model, using\nthe maximum-likelihood Cmin statistic.

In recent years the method has been applied to great effect on a host\nof interesting computer vision tasks, especially for tasks with image or\nimage-like outputs. Many applications of the method use pretrained networks,\noften convolutional networks, for loss calculation. Despite the increased\ninterest and broader use, more effort is needed toward exploring which networks\nto use for calculating deep perceptual loss and from which layers to extract\nthe features.\n  This work aims to rectify this by systematically evaluating a host of\ncommonly used and readily available, pretrained networks for a number of\ndifferent feature extraction points on four existing use cases of deep\nperceptual loss. The four use cases are implementations of previous works where\nthe selected networks and extraction points are evaluated instead of the\nnetworks and extraction points used in the original work. The experimental\ntasks are dimensionality reduction, image segmentation, super-resolution, and\nperceptual similarity. The performance on these four tasks, attributes of the\nnetworks, and extraction points are then used as a basis for an in-depth\nanalysis. This analysis uncovers essential information regarding which\narchitectures provide superior performance for deep perceptual loss and how to\nchoose an appropriate extraction point for a particular task and dataset.\nFurthermore, the work discusses the implications of the results for deep\nperceptual loss and the broader field of transfer learning.

These deep learning models are usually pre-trained through a\nself-supervised objective, meant to provide the model with basic knowledge\nabout a language of interest (e.g., Java). A classic pre-training objective is\nthe masked language model (MLM), in which a percentage of tokens from the input\n(e.g., a Java method) is masked, with the model in charge of predicting them.\nOnce pre-trained, the model is then fine-tuned to support the specific\ndownstream task of interest (e.g., code summarization). While there is evidence\nsuggesting the boost in performance provided by pre-training, little is known\nabout the impact of the specific pre-training objective(s) used. Indeed, MLM is\njust one of the possible pre-training objectives and recent work from the\nnatural language processing field suggest that pre-training objectives tailored\nfor the specific downstream task of interest may substantially boost the\nmodel's performance. In this study, we focus on the impact of pre-training\nobjectives on the performance of transformers when automating code-related\ntasks. We start with a systematic literature review aimed at identifying the\npre-training objectives used in SE.

Due to computational constraints, the\nforward model is constructed using a restricted field-of-view (FoV) in the\nimage domain. When the only EoR contaminants are noise and foregrounds, we\ndemonstrate that BayesEoR can accurately recover the 21 cm power spectrum when\nthe component of sky emission outside this forward-modelled region is\ndownweighted by the beam at the level of the dynamic range between the\nforeground and 21 cm signals.

The latter is\nespecially important in medical applications, where decisions have a direct\nimpact on the patient's health. The proposed model is validated experimentally\nas follows. First, its behavior is illustrated in two synthetic MIL experiments\nbased on the well-known MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Then, it is\nevaluated in three different real-world cancer detection experiments. AGP\noutperforms state-of-the-art MIL approaches, including deterministic deep\nlearning ones. It shows a strong performance even on a small dataset with less\nthan 100 labels and generalizes better than competing methods on an external\ntest set. Moreover, we experimentally show that predictive uncertainty\ncorrelates with the risk of wrong predictions, and therefore it is a good\nindicator of reliability in practice. Our code is publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 13:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

This can be addressed by using\nadaptive data-driven approaches. The idea of using behavioral systems theory\nfor this purpose has recently found traction in the academic community. In this\nstudy, we compare variations thereof with different amounts of data used,\ndifferent regularization weights, and different methods of data selection.\nAutoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) are used as a\nwell-established reference. All methods are evaluated by performing iterative\nsystem identification on two long-term data sets from real occupied buildings,\nneither of which include artificial excitation for the purpose of system\nidentification.

A cycloidal spiral rather than helical spiral order is\nessential ingredient for the existence of ferroelectricity in this material.\nMotivated by a recent experimental work on Mn-doped YBCFO where the spiral\nplane is observed to cant more towards the crystallographic $c$ axis upon Mn\ndoping at Fe sites compared to that in the parent compound, we performed a\ndetailed theoretical investigation using the density functional theory\ncalculations to understand the mechanism behind such spin reorientation.

Largest exchange interaction (Cu-Cu in the\n$ab$-plane) is observed to decrease systematically with Mn doping concentration\nreflecting the lowering of transition temperature seen in experiment. Further,\nthe inter-bilayer Cu-Mn exchange interaction becomes ferromagnetic in the doped\ncompound whereas the corresponding Cu-Fe exchange was antiferromagnetic in the\nparent compound giving rise to frustration in the commensurate magnetic order.\nMost importantly, our electronic structure calculations reveal that in the\ndoped compounds because of hybridization with the d$_{z^2}$ orbital of Mn, the\nhighest occupied Cu orbital becomes d$_{z^2}$ as opposed to the parent compound\nwhere the highest occupied Cu orbital is d$_{x^2-y^2}$.

Most existing backdoor attacks,\nsuch as data poisoning, require further (re)training or fine-tuning language\nmodels to learn the intended backdoor patterns.

Several simple\ntests problems treating different physical phenomena such as one dimensional\nheat diffusion with source term, two dimensional forced convection with\ndeveloped and developing flow in a channel under an oscillating and constant\nheat flux, two-phase stationary bubble in a liquid phase and two-phase dynamic\nlayered Poiseuille flow, both under very high density and viscosity ratios, are\nsimulated. All the numerical solutions were compared with analytical solutions,\nwhen available, or with finite difference solutions, otherwise, showing a very\ngood agreement. The proposed method was also compared with the traditional LBM\nfor the treated problems, showing the same accuracy. Besides the simulation of\nthe applied problems employing physical units directly, the proposed LBM\nallowed the solution of transport phenomena for more severe operational\nconditions. This includes the simulation of the two multiphase problems with\nliquid/gas density and gas/liquid kinematic viscosity ratios of about 43300 and\n470 respectively, employing the Allen-Canh phase field model. With base on the\nobtained results it is estimated that the proposed method could enhance the LBM\nuse as simulation tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 15:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

In the case of two skyrmions, once one is pinned in one\nconfinement, the second one stabilizes in the nearest available empty state and\nno more than one skyrmion could be seen in single confinement.

As a byproduct, our approach also yields\nexplicit expressions for the spectrum of the Laplacian on all compact connected\nsimple Lie groups, providing also a number of sharp results for Strichartz\nestimates in the borderline case $p=2.$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 15:37:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 17:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

According to Neumann's principle, to achieve\nanisotropic responses, the material unit cell should possess less symmetry.\nBased on such guidelines, we present a triclinic metamaterial system of minimal\nsymmetry, which is originated from a Trimorph origami pattern with a simple and\ninsightful geometry: a basic unit cell with four tilted panels and four\ncorresponding creases. The intrinsic geometry of the Trimorph origami, with its\nchanging tilting angles, dictates a folding motion that varies the primitive\nvectors of the unit cell, couples the shear and normal strains of its extrinsic\nbulk, and leads to an unusual Poisson's effect. Such effect, associated to\nreversible auxeticity in the changing triclinic frame, is observed\nexperimentally, and predicted theoretically by elegant math formulae. The\nnonlinearities of the folding motions allow the unit cell to display three\nrobust stable states, connected through snapping instabilities. When the\ntristable unit cells are tessellated, phenomena that resembles linear and point\ndefects emerge as a result of geometric frustration. The frustration is\nreprogrammable into distinct stable and inhomogeneous states by arbitrarily\nselecting the location of a single or multiple point defects. The Trimorph\norigami demonstrates the possibility of creating origami metamaterials with\nsymmetries that were hitherto non-existent, leading to triclinic metamaterials\nwith tunable anisotropy for potential applications such as wave propagation\ncontrol and compliant microrobots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2023 02:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

The automation of this process makes porting the code much easier\nand faster. The key aspect in this case is how efficient the generated parallel\ncode will be. The paper describes J-Parallelio, the framework for automatic\nanalysis of the bytecode source codes and its parallelisation on multicore\nprocessors. The process consists of a few steps. First step is a process of\ndecompilation of JVM and its translation to internal abstract syntax tree, the\ndependency extraction and memory analysis is performed. Finally, the mapping\nprocess is performed which consists of a set of rules responsible for\ntranslating the input virtual machine source code to its parallel version. The\nmain novelty is that it can deal with pure Java virtual machine and can\ngenerate parallel code for multicore processors. This makes the system portable\nand it can work with different languages based on JVM after some small\nmodifications. The efficiency of automatically translated source codes were\ncompared with their manually written counterparts on chosen benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 19:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

Although the practice is illegal with traditional assets, lack of\nsupervision in the non-fungible token market enables criminals to wash trade\nand scam unsuspecting buyers while operating under regulators radar. AnChain.AI\ndesigned an algorithm that flags transactions within an NFT collection history\nas wash trades when a wallet repurchases a token within 30 days of previously\nselling it. The algorithm also identifies intermediate transactions within a\nwash trade cycle. Testing on 7 popular NFT collections reveals that on average,\n0.14% of transactions, 0.11% of wallets, and 0.16% of tokens in each collection\nare involved in wash trading. These wash trades generate an overall total price\nmanipulation, sales, and repurchase profit of \\$900K, \\$1.1M, and negative\n\\$1.6M respectively. The results draw attention to the prevalent market\nmanipulation taking place and inform unsuspecting buyers which tokens and\nsellers may be involved in criminal activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 23:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}
