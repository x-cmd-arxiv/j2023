It is known that nowhere dense graph classes are\nmonadically stable; these encompass most of the studied concepts of sparsity in\ngraphs, including graph classes that exclude a fixed topological minor. On the\nother hand, monadic stability is a property expressed in purely model-theoretic\nterms and hence it is also suited for capturing structure in dense graphs.\n  For several years, it has been suspected that one can create a structure\ntheory for monadically stable graph classes that mirrors the theory of nowhere\ndense graph classes in the dense setting. In this work we provide a step in\nthis direction by giving a characterization of monadic stability through the\nFlipper game: a game on a graph played by Flipper, who in each round can\ncomplement the edge relation between any pair of vertex subsets, and Connector,\nwho in each round localizes the game to a ball of bounded radius.

By inducing targeted faults into the CPU, the\nsoftware's call graph can be escaped and the control-flow can be redirected to\narbitrary functions inside the program. To protect the control-flow from these\nattacks, dedicated fault control-flow integrity (CFI) countermeasures are\ncommonly deployed. However, these schemes either have high detection latencies\nor require intrusive hardware changes. In this paper, we present EC-CFI, a\nsoftware-based cryptographically enforced CFI scheme with no detection latency\nutilizing hardware features of recent Intel platforms. Our EC-CFI prototype is\ndesigned to prevent an adversary from escaping the program's call graph using\nfaults by encrypting each function with a different key before execution. At\nruntime, the instrumented program dynamically derives the decryption key,\nensuring that the code only can be successfully decrypted when the program\nfollows the intended call graph. To enable this level of protection on Intel\ncommodity systems, we introduce extended page table (EPT) aliasing allowing us\nto achieve function-granular encryption by combing Intel's TME-MK and\nvirtualization technology. We open-source our custom LLVM-based toolchain\nautomatically protecting arbitrary programs with EC-CFI. Furthermore, we\nevaluate our EPT aliasing approach with the SPEC CPU2017 and Embench-IoT\nbenchmarks and discuss and evaluate potential TME-MK hardware changes\nminimizing runtime overheads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 16:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 10:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

Smart contracts are distributed applications, which govern\nfinancial assets and, hence, can implement advanced financial instruments, such\nas decentralized exchanges or autonomous organizations (DAOs). Their financial\nnature makes smart contracts an attractive attack target, as demonstrated by\nnumerous exploits on popular contracts resulting in financial damage of\nmillions of dollars. This omnipresent attack hazard motivates the need for\nsound static analysis tools, which assist smart contract developers in\neliminating contract vulnerabilities a priori to deployment. Vulnerability\nassessment that is sound and insightful for EVM contracts is a formidable\nchallenge because contracts execute low-level bytecode in a largely unknown and\npotentially hostile execution environment. So far, there exists no provably\nsound automated analyzer that allows for the verification of security\nproperties based on program dependencies, even though prevalent attack classes\nfall into this category.

HoRStify grounds its soundness proof on a formal proof\nframework for static program slicing that we instantiate to the semantics of\nEVM bytecode.

Recent\napproaches gravitate towards machine learning techniques to construct such\nmodels. However, the stability of machine-learned closure models and their\nabidance by physical structure (e.g. symmetries, conservation laws) are still\nopen problems. To tackle both issues, we take the `discretize first, filter\nnext' approach, in which we apply a spatial averaging filter to existing\nenergy-conserving (fine-grid) discretizations. The main novelty is that we\nextend the system of equations describing the filtered solution with a set of\nequations that describe the evolution of (a compressed version of) the energy\nof the subgrid scales. Having an estimate of this energy, we can use the\nconcept of energy conservation and derive stability. The compressed variables\nare determined via a data-driven technique in such a way that the energy of the\nsubgrid scales is matched. For the extended system, the closure model should be\nenergy-conserving, and a new skew-symmetric convolutional neural network\narchitecture is proposed that has this property. Stability is thus guaranteed,\nindependent of the actual weights and biases of the network. Importantly, our\nframework allows energy exchange between resolved scales and compressed subgrid\nscales and thus enables backscatter. To model dissipative systems (e.g. viscous\nflows), the framework is extended with a diffusive component. The introduced\nneural network architecture is constructed such that it also satisfies momentum\nconservation.

This\npaper provides theoretical support for this encouraging observation.\nSpecifically, we derive a novel central limit theorem for two-way clustered\ntriangular arrays that justifies the use of the TWCR under very mild and\ninterpretable conditions. We, therefore, hope that this paper will provide a\ntheoretical justification for the legitimacy of most, if not all, of the\nthousands of those empirical papers that have used the TWCR standard errors.

Differently from previous, we\nconsider the case in which the seller is an interested party, as the action\nchosen by the buyer does not only influence their utility, but also seller's\none. This happens in many real-world settings, where the way in which\nbusinesses use acquired information may positively or negatively affect the\nseller, due to the presence of externalities on the information market. The\nutilities of both the seller and the buyer depend on a random state of nature,\nwhich is revealed to the seller, but it is unknown to the buyer. Thus, the\nseller's goal is to (partially) sell their information about the state of\nnature to the buyer, so as to concurrently maximize revenue and induce the\nbuyer to take a desirable action. We study settings in which buyer's budget and\nutilities are determined by a random buyer's type that is unknown to the\nseller. In such settings, an optimal protocol for the seller must propose to\nthe buyer a menu of information-revelation policies to choose from, with the\nlatter acquiring one of them by paying its corresponding price. Moreover, since\nin our model the seller is an interested party, an optimal protocol must also\nprescribe the seller to pay back the buyer contingently on their action. First,\nwe show that the problem of computing a seller-optimal protocol can be solved\nin polynomial time. Next, we switch the attention to the case in which a\nseller's protocol employs a single information-revelation policy, rather than\nproposing a menu, deriving both positive and negative results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 17:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

The key idea is to\npick the IHR zones so that the power loss effects within the IHRs can be\nneglected. This simplifies the overall matching problem into independent\nIHR-level matching problems, and an upper-level optimal power flow problem to\nmeet the IHR-level upstream flow requirements while respecting the grid\nconstraints. Within each IHR, the agent employs a scalable Deep Reinforcement\nLearning algorithm to identify matching solutions such that the customer's\nservice constraints are met. The central agent then solves an optimal power\nflow problem with the IHRs as the nodes, with their active power flow and\nreactive power limits, and grid constraints to determine the final flows such\nthat matched power can be delivered to the extent the grid constraints are\nsatisfied. The proposed framework is implemented on a test power distribution\nsystem, and multiple case studies are presented to substantiate the welfare\nefficiency of the proposed solution and the satisfaction of the grid and\ncustomers' servicing constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 17:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

This has motivated the research of new\ncompute and network systems capable of handling such tasks.

However, such studies\nomit explicit consideration of how much a job should be distributed, usually\nassuming that maximum distribution is desirable. In this work, we show that\nmaximum parallelisation is sub-optimal in relation to user-critical metrics\nsuch as throughput and blocking rate.

A priority can be\nnaturally represented as a ranking and an uncertain priority as a distribution\nover rankings. For example, this models the problem of assigning student\napplicants to university seats or job applicants to job openings when the\nadmitting body is uncertain about the true priority over applicants. This\nuncertainty can express the possibility of bias in the generation of the\npriority ranking. We believe we are the first to explicitly formulate and study\nthe assignment problem with uncertain priorities.

However, determining\nsuch hazard boundary for an ML component is challenging. This is due to the\nspace combining system contexts (i.e., scenarios) and MLC behaviors (i.e.,\ninputs and outputs) being far too large for exhaustive exploration and even to\nhandle using conventional metaheuristics, such as genetic algorithms.\nAdditionally, the high computational cost of simulations required to determine\nany MLAS safety violations makes the problem even more challenging.\nFurthermore, it is unrealistic to consider a region in the problem space\ndeterministically safe or unsafe due to the uncontrollable parameters in\nsimulations and the non-linear behaviors of ML models (e.g., deep neural\nnetworks) in the MLAS under analysis.

To address this limitation, we propose\nPPOCoder, a new framework for code generation that combines pretrained PL\nmodels with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) deep reinforcement learning and\nemploys execution feedback as the external source of knowledge into the model\noptimization. PPOCoder is transferable across different code generation tasks\nand PLs. Extensive experiments on three code generation tasks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed approach compared to SOTA methods, improving the\nsuccess rate of compilation and functional correctness over different PLs.

We propose Patch Gradient Descent (PatchGD), an\neffective learning strategy that allows to train the existing CNN architectures\non large-scale images in an end-to-end manner. PatchGD is based on the\nhypothesis that instead of performing gradient-based updates on an entire image\nat once, it should be possible to achieve a good solution by performing model\nupdates on only small parts of the image at a time, ensuring that the majority\nof it is covered over the course of iterations. PatchGD thus extensively enjoys\nbetter memory and compute efficiency when training models on large scale\nimages. PatchGD is thoroughly evaluated on two datasets - PANDA and UltraMNIST\nwith ResNet50 and MobileNetV2 models under different memory constraints. Our\nevaluation clearly shows that PatchGD is much more stable and efficient than\nthe standard gradient-descent method in handling large images, and especially\nwhen the compute memory is limited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 18:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

Using type II radio\nbursts in a frequency range 20 to 200MHz observed by CALLISTO from 2010 to\n2017, it was discovered that the analyzed type II shock height, magnetic field\nstrength, CME shock speed, and Alfven speed synchronize with the trajectory of\nthe solar cycle 24. Also, the study revealed that the onset of the declining\nphase of solar cycle 24 has the highest electron density. The analysis\nascertained that the frequency of type II bursts depicts a bimodal distribution\nduring the study period, with peaks in 2012 and 2015. Further, a good\ncorrelation(with correlation factor R=0.87) was obtained between the estimated\nCME shock speeds from the dynamic spectra, and the associated CME speeds from\nSOHO-LASCO. Moreover, the study confirmed a significant correlation(R=0.8)\nbetween the absolute drift rates and the plasma frequency. Additionally, the\nstudy explored that 60% of the type II radio bursts considered in this study\nemanated from the western longitudes. Hence, these findings emphasize that the\ntemporal dynamics of the physical conditions of band-splitting type II radio\nare essential parameters in space weather monitoring and forecasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 18:32:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 23:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

For some applications, the synopsis should accurately\n\\emph{synthesize} inputs with respect to a key property or aspect. For example,\na synopsis of film reviews all written about a particular movie should reflect\nthe average critic consensus. As a more consequential example, consider\nnarrative summaries that accompany biomedical \\emph{systematic reviews} of\nclinical trial results. These narratives should fairly summarize the\npotentially conflicting results from individual trials.\n  In this paper we ask: To what extent do modern multi-document summarization\nmodels implicitly perform this type of synthesis? To assess this we perform a\nsuite of experiments that probe the degree to which conditional generation\nmodels trained for summarization using standard methods yield outputs that\nappropriately synthesize inputs. We find that existing models do partially\nperform synthesis, but do so imperfectly. In particular, they are\nover-sensitive to changes in input ordering and under-sensitive to changes in\ninput compositions (e.g., the ratio of positive to negative movie reviews). We\npropose a simple, general method for improving model synthesis capabilities by\ngenerating an explicitly diverse set of candidate outputs, and then selecting\nfrom these the string best aligned with the expected aggregate measure for the\ninputs, or \\emph{abstaining} when the model produces no good candidate. This\napproach improves model synthesis performance. We hope highlighting the need\nfor synthesis (in some summarization settings), motivates further research into\nmulti-document summarization methods and learning objectives that explicitly\naccount for the need to synthesize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 18:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-01"}

The vanishing of the spectral gap is\noften linked to the localisation of the ground state in a local minimum,\nrequiring the system to tunnel into the global minimum at a later stage of the\nannealing.

In JJs based on\ntwo-dimensional topological insulators (2DTIs), the electrons/holes forming a\nCooper pair (CP) can either propagate along the same edge or be split into the\ntwo edges. The former leads to a SQUID-like interference pattern, with the\nsuperconducting flux quantum $\\phi_0$ (where $\\phi_0=h/2e$) as a fundamental\nperiod. If CPs' splitting is additionally included, the resultant periodicity\ndoubles. Since the edge states are typically considered to be strongly\nlocalized, the critical current does not decay as a function of the magnetic\nfield. The present paper goes beyond this approach and inspects a topological\nJJ in the tunneling regime featuring extended edge states. It is here\nconsidered the possibility that the two electrons of a CP propagate and explore\nthe junction independently over length scales comparable to the superconducting\ncoherence length. As a consequence of the spatial extension, a decaying pattern\nwith different possible periods is obtained.

The\nliterature suggests that some of these frequencies are important to reproduce\nkey qualities of eye-movements (``signal'') and some of these frequencies are\nnot important (``noise''). To understand what is signal and what is noise, we\nanalyzed our dataset in three ways: (1) visual inspection of plots of saccade,\nmicrosaccade and smooth pursuit exemplars; (2) an analysis of the percentage of\nvariance accounted for (PVAF) in each of 1,033 unfiltered saccade trajectories\nby each frequency cutoff; (3) an analysis of saccade peak velocity in the\nunfiltered and various filtered conditions.

To understand and predict properties of materials containing heavy\nelements, such as the transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), relativistic\neffects must be taken into account in first-principles calculations. We present\nan all-electron method based on the four-component Dirac Hamiltonian and\nGaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) that overcomes complications associated with\nlinear dependencies and ill-conditioned matrices that arise when diffuse\nfunctions are included in the basis. Until now, there has been no systematic\nstudy of the convergence of GTO basis sets for periodic solids either at the\nnonrelativistic or the relativistic level. Here we provide such a study of\nrelativistic band structures of the 2D TMDs in the hexagonal (2H), tetragonal\n(1T), and distorted tetragonal (1T') structures, along with a discussion of\ntheir SOC-driven properties (Rashba splitting and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological\ninvariants). We demonstrate the viability of our approach even when large basis\nsets with multiple basis functions involving various valence orbitals (denoted\ntriple- and quadruple-$\\zeta$) are used in the relativistic regime. Our method\ndoes not require the use of pseudopotentials and provides access to all\nelectronic states within the same framework.

A common indicator of diversity\nconsideration is the representation of different social groups among software\nengineering (SE) researchers, developers, and students. However, this does not\nnecessarily entail that diversity is considered in the SE research itself.\n  In our study, we examine how diversity is embedded in SE research,\nparticularly research that involves participant studies. To this end, we have\nselected 79 research papers containing 105 participant studies spanning three\nyears of ICSE technical tracks. Using a content analytical approach, we\nidentified how SE researchers report the various diversity categories of their\nstudy participants and investigated: 1) the extent to which participants are\ndescribed, 2) what diversity categories are commonly reported, and 3) the\nfunction diversity serves in the SE studies.\n  We identified 12 different diversity categories reported in SE participant\nstudies. Our results demonstrate that even though most SE studies report on the\ndiversity of participants, SE research often emphasizes professional diversity\ndata, such as occupation and work experience, over social diversity data, such\nas gender or location of the participants. Furthermore, our results show that\nparticipant diversity is seldom analyzed or reflected upon when SE researchers\ndiscuss their study results, outcome or limitations. To help researchers\nself-assess their study diversity awareness, we propose a diversity awareness\nmodel and guidelines that SE researchers can apply to their research. With this\nstudy, we hope to shed light on a new approach to tackling the diversity and\ninclusion crisis in the SE field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 19:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

However, early NAS methods based on reinforcement learning or\nevolutionary algorithms suffered from ludicrous computational and memory costs.\nIn contrast, differentiable NAS, a gradient-based approach, has the advantage\nof being much more efficient and has thus retained most of the attention in the\npast few years. In this article, we present NASiam, a novel approach that uses\nfor the first time differentiable NAS to improve the multilayer perceptron\nprojector and predictor (encoder/predictor pair) architectures inside\nsiamese-networks-based contrastive learning frameworks (e.g., SimCLR, SimSiam,\nand MoCo) while preserving the simplicity of previous baselines.

However,\nsuccessfully training adversarial nets using first-order methods remains a\nmajor challenge. Typically, careful choices of the learning rates are needed to\nmaintain the delicate balance between the competing networks. In this paper, we\ndesign a novel learning rate scheduler that dynamically adapts the learning\nrate of the adversary to maintain the right balance. The scheduler is driven by\nthe fact that the loss of an ideal adversarial net is a constant known a\npriori. The scheduler is thus designed to keep the loss of the optimized\nadversarial net close to that of an ideal network. We run large-scale\nexperiments to study the effectiveness of the scheduler on two popular\napplications: GANs for image generation and adversarial nets for domain\nadaptation. Our experiments indicate that adversarial nets trained with the\nscheduler are less likely to diverge and require significantly less tuning. For\nexample, on CelebA, a GAN with the scheduler requires only one-tenth of the\ntuning budget needed without a scheduler. Moreover, the scheduler leads to\nstatistically significant improvements in model quality, reaching up to $27\\%$\nin Frechet Inception Distance for image generation and $3\\%$ in test accuracy\nfor domain adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 20:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

Prefetching and\ncache hierarchies mitigate this in applications with easily predictable memory\naccesses or those with high locality. In other applications like sparse linear\nalgebra or graph-based applications, these strategies do not achieve effective\nutilization of memory. This is the case for the von Neumann model of\ncomputation, but other program execution models (PXM) provide different\nopportunities. Furthermore, the problem is complicated by increasing levels of\nheterogeneity and devices' varying memory subsystems. The Codelet PXM presented\nin this paper provides a program structure that allows for well-defined\nprefetching, streaming, and recoding operations to improve memory utilization\nand efficiently coordinate data movement with respect to computation. We\npropose the Memory Codelet, an extension to the original Codelet Model, to\nprovide users these functionalities in a well-defined manner within the Codelet\nPXM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 21:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

We first define\nAbstractCube, a data type defined as a function from RegionFeatures space to\nrelational tables. AbstractCube provides a logical form of data for HoCA\noperators and their compositions to operate on to analyze the data. This\nfunction-as-data modeling allows us to simultaneously capture a space of\nnon-uniform tables on the co-domain of the function, and region space structure\non the domain of the function. We describe two HoCA operators, cube crawling\nand cube join, which are cube-to-cube transformations (i.e., higher-order\nfunctions). Cube crawling explores a region subspace, and outputs a cube\nmapping regions to signal vectors. Cube join, in turn, allows users to meld\ninformation in different cubes, which is critical for composition. The cube\ncrawling interface introduces two novel features: (1) Region Analysis Models\n(RAMs), which allows one to program and organize analysis on a set of data\nfeatures into a module. (2) Multi-Model Crawling, which allows one to apply\nmultiple models, potentially on different feature sets, during crawling. These\ntwo features, together with cube join and a rich RAM library, allows us to\nconstruct succinct HoCA programs to capture a wide variety of data-insight\nproblems in system monitoring, experimentation analysis, and business\nintelligence. HoCA poses a rich algorithmic design space, such as optimizing\ncrawling performance leveraging region space structure, optimizing cube join\nperformance, and physical designs of cubes. We describe several cube crawling\nimplementations leveraging different foundations (an in-house relational query\nengine, and Apache Beam), and evaluate their performance characteristics.\nFinally, we discuss avenues in extending the framework, such as devising more\nuseful HoCA operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 21:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 03:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

By studying gas in galaxies in this way, it is\npossible to investigate the small and faint galaxies, which are the most\nnumerous in the universe. In particular, the chemical distribution of gas in\nabsorbing systems gives us insight into cycles of gas in and around galaxies.\nHere we study chemical enrichment within 64 Damped Lyman-alpha Absorption (DLA)\nsystems between $1.7 < z < 4.2$. We use high-resolution spectra from VLT/UVES\nto infer dust depletion from relative abundances of several metals. We perform\na component-by-component analysis within DLAs, and characterise variations in\ntheir chemical enrichment. Unlike hydrogen, the metal columns can be\ncharacterised for individual components. We use them to derive the dust\ndepletion ([Zn/Fe]fit), as an indicator for chemical enrichment. We find that\nsome DLAs are chemically diverse within themselves, with [Zn/Fe]fit ranging up\nto 0.62 dex within a single system. This suggests that absorbing gas within\nthese galaxies is chemically diverse. Although we do not find a clear trend of\ndecreasing dust depletion with redshift, we do see that the most chemically\nenriched systems are at lower redshifts. We also observe evidence for dust-poor\ncomponents at all redshifts, which may be due to the accretion of pristine gas\nonto galaxies. We combine the chemical and kinematic properties of the\nindividual gas components and observe potential signatures of infalling gas,\nwith low depletion at velocities below $\\sim$100km/s, and outflows, with high\ndepletion and velocities of $\\sim$600km/s. We find over-abundances of\nalpha-elements (an enhancement of $\\sim$0.3dex) and under-abundances of Mn in\nseveral components, which is likely a signature of core-collapse SNe\nnucleosythesis in the ISM.

This\nis so far the best approximation we can have in terms of $m$, since no\npolynomial time approximation better than $\\tfrac{4}{3}$ exists when $m =\n\\tfrac{n}{3}$ unless P=NP. %the problem cannot be approximated within a factor\nof $\\tfrac{4}{3}$ when $m = \\tfrac{n}{3}$ even if all jobs have equal\nprocessing time. The algorithms are then extended to the more general problem\nwhere the largest $\\alpha n$ jobs have no more than $c$ factor difference. %\nfor some constant $0 < \\alpha \\le 1$. We also develop the first sublinear time\nalgorithms for both problems. For the more general problem, when $ m \\le \\tfrac\n{ \\alpha n \\epsilon}{20 c^2 \\cdot h } $, our algorithm is a randomized\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation scheme that runs in sublinear time. This work not\nonly provides an algorithmic solution to the studied problem under big data %\nand cloud computing environment, but also gives a methodological framework for\ndesigning sublinear approximation algorithms for other scheduling problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 22:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

When\nthe layer number of the neural network is large, it is computationally\nchallenging to carry out such a task efficiently. Inspired by the human\neducation process which arranges learning in grades, we propose a multi-grade\nlearning model: We successively solve a number of optimization problems of\nsmall sizes, which are organized in grades, to learn a shallow neural network\nfor each grade. Specifically, the current grade is to learn the leftover from\nthe previous grade. In each of the grades, we learn a shallow neural network\nstacked on the top of the neural network, learned in the previous grades, which\nremains unchanged in training of the current and future grades. By dividing the\ntask of learning a deep neural network into learning several shallow neural\nnetworks, one can alleviate the severity of the nonconvexity of the original\noptimization problem of a large size. When all grades of the learning are\ncompleted, the final neural network learned is a stair-shape neural network,\nwhich is the superposition of networks learned from all grades. Such a model\nenables us to learn a deep neural network much more effectively and\nefficiently. Moreover, multi-grade learning naturally leads to adaptive\nlearning. We prove that in the context of function approximation if the neural\nnetwork generated by a new grade is nontrivial, the optimal error of the grade\nis strictly reduced from the optimal error of the previous grade. Furthermore,\nwe provide several proof-of-concept numerical examples which demonstrate that\nthe proposed multi-grade model outperforms significantly the traditional\nsingle-grade model and is much more robust than the traditional model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 00:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

The question of whether Brunerie's proof could be\nformalized in a proof assistant, either by computing this number or by\nformalizing the pen-and-paper proof, has since remained open. In this paper, we\npresent a complete formalization in the Cubical Agda system, following\nBrunerie's pen-and-paper proof. We do this by modifying Brunerie's proof so\nthat a key technical result, whose proof Brunerie only sketched in his thesis,\ncan be avoided. We also present a formalization of a new and much simpler proof\nthat $\\beta$ is $\\pm 2$. This formalization provides us with a sequence of\nsimpler Brunerie numbers, one of which normalizes very quickly to $-2$ in\nCubical Agda, resulting in a fully formalized computer assisted proof that\n$\\pi_4(\\mathbb{S}^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 00:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

The manifold is essentially defined by the data set itself\nand, typically, designed so that the data is dense on the manifold in some\nsense. The notion of a data space is an abstraction of a manifold encapsulating\nthe essential properties that allow for function approximation. The problem of\ntransfer learning (meta-learning) is to use the learning of a function on one\ndata set to learn a similar function on a new data set. In terms of function\napproximation, this means lifting a function on one data space (the base data\nspace) to another (the target data space). This viewpoint enables us to connect\nsome inverse problems in applied mathematics (such as inverse Radon transform)\nwith transfer learning. In this paper we examine the question of such lifting\nwhen the data is assumed to be known only on a part of the base data space.

Unfortunately, robots\noften lack access to key information on which these predictions may hinge, such\nas opponent's goals, attention, and willingness to cooperate. Dual control\ntheory addresses this challenge by treating unknown parameters of a predictive\nmodel as hidden states and inferring their values at runtime using information\ngathered during system operation. While able to optimally and automatically\ntrade off exploration and exploitation, dual control is computationally\nintractable for general interactive motion planning. In this paper, we present\na novel algorithmic approach to enable active uncertainty reduction for\ninteractive motion planning based on the implicit dual control paradigm. Our\napproach relies on sampling-based approximation of stochastic dynamic\nprogramming, leading to a model predictive control problem. The resulting\npolicy is shown to preserve the dual control effect for a broad class of\npredictive models with both continuous and categorical uncertainty. To ensure\nthe safe operation of the interacting agents, we leverage a supervisory control\nscheme, oftentimes referred to as ``shielding'', which overrides the ego\nagent's dual control policy with a safety fallback strategy when a\nsafety-critical event is imminent. We then augment the dual control framework\nwith an improved variant of the recently proposed shielding-aware robust\nplanning scheme, which proactively balances the nominal planning performance\nwith the risk of high-cost emergency maneuvers triggered by low-probability\nopponent's behaviors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with both\nsimulated driving examples and hardware experiments using 1/10 scale autonomous\nvehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 01:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

Apart from basic content generation, a bunch of\ndownstream applications hopefully benefit from this task, such as low-data\ndetection and few-shot classification. To achieve this goal, the generated\nimages should guarantee category retention for classification beyond the visual\nquality and diversity. In our preliminary work, we present an ``editing-based''\nframework Attribute Group Editing (AGE) for reliable few-shot image generation,\nwhich largely improves the generation performance. Nevertheless, AGE's\nperformance on downstream classification is not as satisfactory as expected.\nThis paper investigates the class inconsistency problem and proposes Stable\nAttribute Group Editing (SAGE) for more stable class-relevant image generation.\nSAGE takes use of all given few-shot images and estimates a class center\nembedding based on the category-relevant attribute dictionary. Meanwhile,\naccording to the projection weights on the category-relevant attribute\ndictionary, we can select category-irrelevant attributes from the similar seen\ncategories. Consequently, SAGE injects the whole distribution of the novel\nclass into StyleGAN's latent space, thus largely remains the category retention\nand stability of the generated images. Going one step further, we find that\nclass inconsistency is a common problem in GAN-generated images for downstream\nclassification. Even though the generated images look photo-realistic and\nrequires no category-relevant editing, they are usually of limited help for\ndownstream classification. We systematically discuss this issue from both the\ngenerative model and classification model perspectives, and propose to boost\nthe downstream classification performance of SAGE by enhancing the pixel and\nfrequency components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 01:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

In this\npaper, we present the observed properties of 125 flare stars identified by the\nTMTS within the first two years, with an attempt to constrain their eruption\nphysics. As expected, most of these flares were recorded in late-type red stars\nwith $G_{\\rm BP}-G_{\\rm RP}$ > 2.0 mag, however, the flares associated with\nbluer stars tend to be on average more energetic and have broader profiles. The\npeak flux (F_peak) of the flare is found to depend strongly on the equivalent\nduration (ED) of the energy release, i.e., $F_{{\\rm peak}} \\propto {\\rm\nED}^{0.72\\pm0.04}$, which is consistent with results derived from the Kepler\nand Evryscope samples. This relation is likely related to the magnetic loop\nemission, while -- for the more popular non-thermal electron heating model -- a\nspecific time evolution may be required to generate this relation.

We start with the canonical case of a single sequence with\nconstant change-point intensities. We consider two measures of a change-point\nalgorithm. The first is the probability of estimating the change-point with no\nerror. The second is the expected distance between the true and estimated\nchange-points.

However, heavy-duty diesel trucks that deliver goods\ncontribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions within many large\nmetropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. To\nfacilitate freight electrification, this paper proposes joint routing and\ncharging (JRC) scheduling for electric trucks. The objective of the associated\noptimization problem is to minimize the cost of transportation, charging, and\ntardiness. As a result of a large number of combinations of road segments,\nelectric trucks can take a large number of combinations of possible charging\ndecisions and charging duration as well. The resulting mixed-integer linear\nprogramming problem (MILP) is extremely challenging because of the\ncombinatorial complexity even in the deterministic case. Therefore, a\nLevel-Based Surrogate Lagrangian Relaxation method is employed to decompose and\ncoordinate the overall problem into truck subproblems that are significantly\nless complex. In the coordination aspect, each truck subproblem is solved\nindependently of other subproblems based on charging cost, tardiness, and the\nvalues of Lagrangian multipliers. In addition to serving as a means of guiding\nand coordinating trucks, multipliers can also serve as a basis for transparent\nand explanatory decision-making by trucks. Testing results demonstrate that\neven small instances cannot be solved using the over-the-shelf solver CPLEX\nafter several days of solving. The new method, on the other hand, can obtain\nnear-optimal solutions within a few minutes for small cases, and within 30\nminutes for large ones. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that as battery\ncapacity increases, the total cost decreases significantly; moreover, as the\ncharging power increases, the number of trucks required decreases as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 04:38:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 02:03:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 04:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Cut\nselection -- which aims to select a proper subset of the candidate cuts to\nimprove the efficiency of solving MILPs -- heavily depends on (P1) which cuts\nshould be preferred, and (P2) how many cuts should be selected. Although many\nmodern MILP solvers tackle (P1)-(P2) by manually designed heuristics, machine\nlearning offers a promising approach to learn more effective heuristics from\nMILPs collected from specific applications. However, many existing\nlearning-based methods focus on learning which cuts should be preferred,\nneglecting the importance of learning the number of cuts that should be\nselected. Moreover, we observe from extensive empirical results that (P3) what\norder of selected cuts should be preferred has a significant impact on the\nefficiency of solving MILPs as well. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel hierarchical sequence model (HEM) to learn cut selection policies via\nreinforcement learning. Specifically, HEM consists of a two-level model: (1) a\nhigher-level model to learn the number of cuts that should be selected, (2) and\na lower-level model -- that formulates the cut selection task as a sequence to\nsequence learning problem -- to learn policies selecting an ordered subset with\nthe size determined by the higher-level model. To the best of our knowledge,\nHEM is the first method that can tackle (P1)-(P3) in cut selection\nsimultaneously from a data-driven perspective. Experiments show that HEM\nsignificantly improves the efficiency of solving MILPs compared to\nhuman-designed and learning-based baselines on both synthetic and large-scale\nreal-world MILPs, including MIPLIB 2017. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that\nHEM well generalizes to MILPs that are significantly larger than those seen\nduring training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 04:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

This\nvariant is based on Fisher divergence and the Hyv\\\"arinen score and is called\nthe Score-based CUSUM (SCUSUM) algorithm. The SCUSUM algorithm allows the\napplications of change detection for unnormalized statistical models, i.e.,\nmodels for which the probability density function contains an unknown\nnormalization constant. The asymptotic optimality of the proposed algorithm is\ninvestigated by deriving expressions for average detection delay and the mean\nrunning time to a false alarm. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate\nthe performance of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 05:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

In this paper, a\ncertificateless authentication-based trustworthy federated learning (CATFL)\nframework is proposed, which mutually authenticates the identity of clients and\nserver.

Its antenna was strategically positioned and appeared to be in the\ncenter of the CALLISTO network of spectrometers. Moreover, in the northern\nsection of Africa, the Egypt-Alexandria CALLISTO and ALGERIA-CRAAG stations are\nthe only ones operating. There are no stations in the West African region,\nwhile stations in the eastern part of Africa are not working. Thus, Egypt-\nAlexandria station serves as a reference for other stations within the\ne-CALLISTO network. Despite the low solar activity, the instrument detected\nseveral solar radio bursts not limited to type II, type III, and type V. A\nvigorous case study was conducted on two selected radio burst events to\nvalidate the authenticity of the recorded events. Other solar radio stations at\ndifferent geographical locations recorded all the radio bursts detected by the\nspectrometer. The case study included brief analyses that indicated a type II\nradio burst observed on October 09, 2021, between 06:30 and 07:00 UT, was\nassociated with an M1.6 solar flare located at N18E08 within NOAA-AR 12882 and\na CME with a shock front speed of ~978 km/s. However, the type III radio burst\nis neither CME nor solar flare associated. These analyses examine the\ninstrument's capacity to provide real-time solar radio transient data 24 hours\na day to mitigate the challenges of data gaps faced in the African continent.\nHence, the instrument has become an integral part of space weather monitoring\nand forecasting over the region and other parts of the globe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 07:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

The simulation, which includes neutrino transport in\ngeneral relativity is performed from core-collapse, bounce, explosion and\ncooling of protoneutron stars (PNSs) up to 20 s after the bounce\nself-consistently. Based on the hydrodynamics background, we calculate\neigenmodes of the PNS oscillation through a perturbation analysis on fluid and\nmetric. We classify the modes by the number of nodes and find that there are\nseveral eigenmodes. In the early phase before 1 s, there are a low-frequency\ng-mode around 0.5 kHz, a mid-frequency f-modes around 1 kHz, and high-frequency\np-modes above them. Beyond 1 s, the g-modes drop too low in frequency and the\np-modes become too high to be detected by ground-based interferometers.\nHowever, the f-mode persists at 1 kHz.

We measure three phenomena and find\nqualitative agreement with an interacting TLS model, where near-resonant TLSs\nexperience substantial frequency jitter from the state switching of far-detuned\nlow-frequency TLSs.

Instead, an earlier pioneering work by Hill\n[Ann. Probab., 1987] proposed for a share the worst-case MaxMinShare over all\nvaluations with the same largest possible single-object value. Although Hill's\nshare is more conservative than the MaxMinShare, it is an actual guarantee and\nits computation is elementary, unlike that of the MaxMinShare which involves\nsolving an NP-hard problem. We apply Hill's approach to the allocation of\nindivisible bads (objects with disutilities or costs), and characterise the\ntight closed form of the worst-case MinMaxShare for a given value of the worst\nbad. We argue that Hill's share for allocating bads is effective in the sense\nof being close to the original MinMaxShare value, and there is much to learn\nabout the guarantee an agent can be offered from the disutility of her worst\nsingle bad. Furthermore, we prove that the monotonic cover of Hill's share is\nthe best guarantee that can be achieved in Hill's model for all allocation\ninstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 08:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

A key question is: how to\ndetermine the ideal order of collecting and executing speech test cases to\nuncover more errors as early as possible? Each speech test case consists of a\npiece of audio and the corresponding reference text. In this work, we propose\nPROPHET (PRiOritizing sPeecH tEsT), a tool that predicts potential\nerror-uncovering speech test cases only based on their reference texts.

An evil twin is a\nrogue AP installed by a malicious user to impersonate legitimate APs. It\nintends to attract victims in order to intercept their credentials, to steal\ntheir sensitive information, to eavesdrop on their data, etc. In this paper, we\nstudy the security mechanisms of wireless networks and we introduce the\ndifferent authentication methods, including 802.1X authentication. We show that\n802.1X has improved security through the use of digital certificates but does\nnot define any practical technique for the user to check the network\ncertificate. Therefore, it remains vulnerable to the evil twin attack. To\nrepair this vulnerability, we introduce Robust Certificate Management System\n(RCMS) which takes advantage of the digital certificates of 802.1X to protect\nthe users against rogue APs. RCMS defines a new verification code to allow the\nuser device to check the network certificate. This practical verification\ncombined with the reliability of digital certificates provides a perfect\nprotection against rogue APs. RCMS requires a small software update on the user\nterminal and does not need any modification of IEEE 802.11. It has a\nsignificant flexibility since trusting a single AP is enough to trust all the\nAPs of the extended network. This allows the administrators to extend their\nnetworks easily without the need to update any database of trusted APs on the\nuser devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 09:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

Members of this family\nare called flag-accurate. One relevance of this new notion is that it entails\ndivisional freeness. There are a number of important natural classes which are\nflag-accurate, the most prominent one among them is the one consisting of\nCoxeter arrangements. This warrants a systematic study which is put forward in\nthe present paper. More specifically, let $\\mathscr A$ be a free arrangement of\nrank $\\ell$.

In order to predict a continuous\nsurface over a spatial domain a grid representation is most often used. Kriging\npredictions and prediction variances are computed in the nodes of a grid\ncovering the spatial domain, and the continuous surface is assessed from this\ngrid representation. A precise representation usually requires the number of\ngrid nodes to be considerably larger than the number of observations. For a\nGaussian random field model the Kriging predictor coinsides with the\nconditional expectation of the spatial variable given the observation set. An\nalternative expression for this conditional expectation provides a spatial\npredictor on functional form which does not rely on a spatial grid\ndiscretization. This functional predictor, called the Kernel predictor, is\nidentical to the asymptotic grid infill limit of the Kriging-based grid\nrepresentation, and the computational demand is primarily dependent on the\nnumber of observations - not the dimension of the spatial reference domain nor\nany grid discretization. We explore the potential of this Kernel predictor with\nassociated prediction variances. The predictor is valid for Gaussian random\nfields with any eligible spatial correlation function, and large computational\nsavings can be obtained by using a finite-range spatial correlation function.\nFor studies with a huge set of observations, localized predictors must be used,\nand the computational advantage relative to Kriging predictors can be very\nlarge. Moreover, model parameter inference based on a huge observation set can\nbe efficiently made. The methodology is demonstrated in a couple of examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 10:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

In this paper, we deal with the problem of\nenumerating maximal cliques in link streams. A clique is a pair\n$(C,[t_0,t_1])$, where $C$ is a set of vertices that all interact pairwise\nduring the full interval $[t_0,t_1]$. It is maximal when neither its set of\nvertices nor its time interval can be increased. Some of the main works solving\nthis problem are based on the famous Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for enumerating\nmaximal cliques in graphs. We take this idea as a starting point to propose a\nnew algorithm which matches the cliques of the instantaneous graphs formed by\nlinks existing at a given time $t$ to the maximal cliques of the link stream.\nWe prove its validity and compute its complexity, which is better than the\nstate-of-the art ones in many cases of interest. We also study the\noutput-sensitive complexity, which is close to the output size, thereby showing\nthat our algorithm is efficient. To confirm this, we perform experiments on\nlink streams used in the state of the art, and on massive link streams, up to\n100 million links. In all cases our algorithm is faster, mostly by a factor of\nat least 10 and up to a factor of $10^4$. Moreover, it scales to massive link\nstreams for which the existing algorithms are not able to provide the solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 10:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

Thereby, efficient processing of 3D\npoint clouds is crucial in these systems. In this work we propose K-D Bonsai, a\ntechnique to cut down memory usage during radius search, a critical building\nblock of point cloud processing. K-D Bonsai exploits value similarity in the\ndata structure that holds the point cloud (a k-d tree) to compress the data in\nmemory. K-D Bonsai further compresses the data using a reduced floating-point\nrepresentation, exploiting the physically limited range of point cloud values.\nFor easy integration into nowadays systems, we implement K-D Bonsai through\nBonsai-extensions, a small set of new CPU instructions to compress, decompress,\nand operate on points. To maintain baseline safety levels, we carefully craft\nthe Bonsai-extensions to detect precision loss due to compression, allowing\nre-computation in full precision to take place if necessary. Therefore, K-D\nBonsai reduces data movement, improving performance and energy efficiency,\nwhile guaranteeing baseline accuracy and programmability. We evaluate K-D\nBonsai over the euclidean cluster task of Autoware.ai, a state-of-the-art\nsoftware stack for AD. We achieve an average of 9.26% improvement in end-to-end\nlatency, 12.19% in tail latency, and a reduction of 10.48% in energy\nconsumption. Differently from expensive accelerators proposed in related work,\nK-D Bonsai improves radius search with minimal area increase (0.36%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 10:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

Given how bumblebee behavioral models are\ndesigned to support adaptation in complex and highly time-varying environments,\nthese models can be employed by connected vehicles to enable their operation\nwithin a dynamically changing network topology and support their selection of\noptimal channels possessing low levels of congestion to achieve high\nthroughput. As a result, the proposed VDSA-based optimal channel selection\nemploys fundamental concepts from the bumblebee foraging model. In the proposed\napproach, the Channel Busy Ratio (CBR) of all channels is computed and stored\nin memory to be accessed by the MEB algorithm to make the necessary channel\nswitching decisions.

While existing bot detection literature\nmostly focuses on identifying individual bots, it remains underexplored how to\nestimate the proportion of bots within specific communities and social\nnetworks, which has great implications for both content moderators and\nday-to-day users. In this work, we propose community-level bot detection, a\nnovel approach to estimating the amount of malicious interference in online\ncommunities by estimating the percentage of bot accounts. Specifically, we\nintroduce BotPercent, an amalgamation of Twitter bot-detection datasets and\nfeature-, text-, and graph-based models that overcome generalization issues in\nexisting individual-level models, resulting in a more accurate community-level\nbot estimation. Experiments demonstrate that BotPercent achieves\nstate-of-the-art community-level bot detection performance on the TwiBot-22\nbenchmark while showing great robustness towards the tampering of specific user\nfeatures. Armed with BotPercent, we analyze bot rates in different Twitter\ngroups and communities, such as all active Twitter users, users that interact\nwith partisan news media, users that participate in Elon Musk's content\nmoderation votes, and the political communities in different countries and\nregions. Our experimental results demonstrate that the existence of Twitter\nbots is not homogeneous, but rather a spatial-temporal distribution whose\nheterogeneity should be taken into account for content moderation, social media\npolicy making, and more.

However, existing approaches for\njamming rely on knowledge of the legitimate users' (LUs') channels, extra\njamming power, or both. To raise concerns about the potential threats posed by\nillegitimate intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), we propose an alternative\nmethod to launch jamming attacks on LUs without either LU channel state\ninformation (CSI) or jamming power. The proposed approach employs an\nadversarial IRS with random phase shifts, referred to as a \"disco\" IRS (DIRS),\nthat acts like a \"disco ball\" to actively age the LUs' channels. Such active\nchannel aging (ACA) interference can be used to launch jamming attacks on\nmulti-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems. The proposed\nDIRS-based fully-passive jammer (FPJ) can jam LUs with no additional jamming\npower or knowledge of the LU CSI, and it can not be mitigated by classical\nanti-jamming approaches. A theoretical analysis of the proposed DIRS-based FPJ\nthat provides an evaluation of the DIRS-based jamming attacks is derived. Based\non this detailed theoretical analysis, some unique properties of the proposed\nDIRS-based FPJ can be obtained. Furthermore, a design example of the proposed\nDIRS-based FPJ based on one-bit quantization of the IRS phases is demonstrated\nto be sufficient for implementing the jamming attack. In addition, numerical\nresults are provided to show the effectiveness of the derived theoretical\nanalysis and the jamming impact of the proposed DIRS-based FPJ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 13:01:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 08:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Reducing the number of observations needed for model\ndevelopment alleviates both the computational burden required for training and\nthe operational expenses related to labeling. Online active learning, in\nparticular, is useful in high-volume production processes where the decision\nabout the acquisition of the label for a data point needs to be taken within an\nextremely short time frame.

The microwave emission is caused by mildly\nrelativistic electrons which occupy a layer within the oscillating slab and\nradiate via the gyrosynchrotron (GS) mechanism. Light curves of the microwave\nemission were simulated in the optically thin part of the GS spectrum, and\ntheir typical Fourier spectra were analysed. It is shown that the microwave\nresponse to a linear kink magnetohydrodynamic wave is non-linear. It is found\nthat, while the microwave light curves at the node oscillate with the same\nfrequency as the frequency of the perturbing kink mode, the frequency of the\nmicrowave oscillations at the anti-node is two times higher than the kink\noscillation frequency. Gradual transformation the one type of the light curves\nto another occurs when sliding from the node to the anti-node. This result does\nnot depend on the width of the GS-emitting layer inside the oscillating slab.\nThis finding should be considered in the interpretation of microwave\nquasi-periodic pulsations in solar and stellar flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 13:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

This\npaper aims to develop an innovative framework of pricing catastrophic bonds\ntriggered by multiple events with extreme dependence structure. Given the low\ncontingency of the bond's cash flows and high return, the multiple-event CAT\nbond may successfully transfer the catastrophe risk to the big financial\nmarkets meeting the diversification of capital allocations for most potential\ninvestors. The designed hybrid trigger mechanism helps reduce moral hazard and\nimprove bond attractiveness with CIR stochastic rate, displaying the\nco-movement of the wiped-off coupon, payout principal, the occurrence and\nintensity of the natural disaster involved. As different triggered indexes of\nmultiple-event catastrophic bonds are heavy-tailed with a variety of dependence\nrelationship, nested Archimedean copulas are introduced with marginal\ndistributions modeled by POT-GP distribution for excess data and common\nparametric models for moderate risks.

The extracted\nknowledge can be used in the design of controllers for optimizing the\ntransparency and fidelity of force fields in human-robot interaction and in\nhaptic systems. In this paper, for the first time, we investigate the frequency\nbehavior of the passivity map for the upper limb when the muscle co-activation\nwas controlled in real-time through visual electromyographic feedback. Five\nhealthy subjects (age: 27 +/- 5) were included in this study.

It is well\nknown that if these ratios are much larger than one then the dominant process\ngoverning quarkonium evolution is dissociation by thermal gluons\n(gluo-dissociation). On the other hand, if this ratio is much smaller than one\nthen quarkonium dynamics is dominated by screening and Landau damping of the\nexchanged gluons.

The cross sections are measured as functions of the photon\ntransverse energy in different regions of photon pseudorapidity. The photons\nare required to be isolated by means of a fixed-cone method with two different\ncone radii. The dependence of the inclusive-photon production on the photon\nisolation is investigated by measuring the fiducial cross sections as functions\nof the isolation-cone radius and the ratios of the differential cross sections\nwith different radii in different regions of photon pseudorapidity. The results\npresented in this paper constitute an improvement with respect to those\npublished by ATLAS earlier: the measurements are provided for different\nisolation radii and with a more granular segmentation in photon pseudorapidity\nthat can be exploited in improving the determination of the proton parton\ndistribution functions.

Next-to-leading-order QCD predictions from JETPHOX and\nSHERPA and next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD predictions from NNLOJET are\ncompared to the measurements, using several parameterisations of the proton\nparton distribution functions.

The host galaxy ages are examined in conjunction with other\nproperties such as the galaxy stellar mass, and star-formation rate as well as\nthe AGN Eddington ratio. Our sample consists of 50 unobscured or mildly\nobscured (logN_H (cm-2) < 23) and 23 heavily obscured AGN (log N_H (cm-2) >23)\nin the redshift range z=0.6-1. We take specific caution to create control\nsamples in order to match the exact luminosity and redshift distributions for\nthe obscured and unobscured AGN. The majority of unobscured AGN appear to live\nin young galaxies in contrast to the obscured AGN which appear to live in\ngalaxies located between the young and old galaxy populations. This finding may\nbe in contrast to those evolutionary AGN unification models which postulate\nthat the AGN begin their life in a heavy obscuration phase. The host galaxies\nof the obscured AGN have significantly lower levels of specific star-formation.\nAt the same time the obscured AGN have lower Eddington ratios indicating a link\nbetween the star-formation and the black hole accretion.

Our\nresults on the relative age of obscured AGN are valid when we match our\nobscured and unobscured AGN samples according to the stellar mass of their host\ngalaxies.

To make\npredictions, methods have been developed to derive the true CME speed, size and\nposition, among others. Difficulties in determining input parameters for CME\nforecasting arise from the lack of direct measurements of the coronal magnetic\nfields and uncertainties in estimating the CME 3D geometric and kinematic\nparameters. White-light coronagraph images are usually employed by a variety of\nCME reconstruction techniques.

Different AOD products are retrieved from various satellite\nsensors, like MODIS and VIIRS, by various algorithms, such as Deep Blue and\nDark Target. Therefore, they do not have the same accuracy and spatial\nresolution. Additionally, the weakness of algorithms in AOD retrieval reduces\nthe spatial coverage of products, particularly in cloudy or snowy areas.\nConsequently, for the first time, the present study investigated the\npossibility of fusing AOD products from observations of MODIS and VIIRS sensors\nretrieved by Deep Blue and Dark Target algorithms to estimate PM2.5 more\naccurately. For this purpose, AOD products were fused by machine learning\nalgorithms using different fusion strategies at two levels: the data level and\nthe decision level. First, the performance of various machine learning\nalgorithms for estimating PM2.5 using AOD data was evaluated. After that, the\nXGBoost algorithm was selected as the base model for the proposed fusion\nstrategies. Then, AOD products were fused. The fusion results showed that the\nestimated PM2.5 accuracy at the data level in all three metrics, RMSE, MAE, and\nR2, was improved (R2=0.64). Despite the simplicity and lower computational cost\nof the data level fusion method, the spatial coverage did not improve\nconsiderably due to eliminating poor quality data through the fusion process.\nAfterward, the fusion of products at the decision level was followed in eleven\nscenarios.

Modern chatbots like Open AIs ChatGPT3 not only have the\nability to answer basic questions but can write code and movie scripts and\nimitate well-known people. In this paper, we analyze ChatGPTs' responses to\nvarious questions from a dataset of queries from the popular Quora forum. We\nsubmitted sixty questions to ChatGPT and scored the answers based on three\nindustry-standard metrics for grading machine translation: BLEU, METEOR, and\nROUGE. These metrics allow us to compare the machine responses with the most\nupvoted human answer to the same question to assess ChatGPT's ability to submit\na humanistic reply. The results showed that while the responses and translation\nabilities of ChatGPT are remarkable, they still fall short of what a typical\nhuman reaction would be.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 02:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

We survey tooling from Spark ML,\nApache Kafka, Chameleon Cloud, Ansible, Vagrant, Python Flask, Docker, and\nKubernetes in order to realize this machine learning pipeline. Through our\ncloud-based approach, we are able to demonstrate benchmark performance on the\nMNIST dataset with a deep learning model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 05:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}
