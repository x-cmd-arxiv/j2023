For some simulations, a single data point takes seconds, minutes, or\neven hours to compute from first principles. Since the necessary number of data\npoints per simulation is on the order of $10^9$ - $10^{12}$, machine learning\nregressors can be used in place of physics simulators to significantly reduce\nthis computational burden. However, this task requires high-precision\nregressors that can deliver data with relative errors of less than $1\\%$ or\neven $0.1\\%$ over the entire domain of the function. In this paper, we develop\noptimal training strategies and tune various machine learning regressors to\nsatisfy the high-precision requirement. We leverage symmetry arguments from\nparticle physics to optimize the performance of the regressors. Inspired by\nResNets, we design a Deep Neural Network with skip connections that outperform\nfully connected Deep Neural Networks. We find that at lower dimensions, boosted\ndecision trees far outperform neural networks while at higher dimensions neural\nnetworks perform significantly better. We show that these regressors can speed\nup simulations by a factor of $10^3$ - $10^6$ over the first-principles\ncomputations currently used in Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, using\nsymmetry arguments derived from particle physics, we reduce the number of\nregressors necessary for each simulation by an order of magnitude. Our work can\nsignificantly reduce the training and storage burden of Monte Carlo simulations\nat current and future collider experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 16:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

In such situations it is often difficult to design a learning process\ncapable of evading distraction by poor local optima long enough to stumble upon\nthe best available niche. In this work we propose a generic reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithm that performs better than baseline deep Q-learning\nalgorithms in such environments with multiple variably-valued niches. The\nalgorithm we propose consists of two parts: an agent architecture and a\nlearning rule. The agent architecture contains multiple sub-policies. The\nlearning rule is inspired by fitness sharing in evolutionary computation and\napplied in reinforcement learning using Value-Decomposition-Networks in a novel\nmanner for a single-agent's internal population. It can concretely be\nunderstood as adding an extra loss term where one policy's experience is also\nused to update all the other policies in a manner that decreases their value\nestimates for the visited states. In particular, when one sub-policy visits a\nparticular state frequently this decreases the value predicted for other\nsub-policies for going to that state. Further, we introduce an artificial\nchemistry inspired platform where it is easy to create tasks with multiple\nrewarding strategies utilizing different resources (i.e. multiple niches).

At all conditions, both strength and hardening rate increase with\ndecreasing grain size. Flow stress scales with the inverse of grain size to a\npower between 1/3 and 2/3. Hardening rate decreases linearly with the logarithm\nof grain size. In-situ ultrasonic monitoring reveals that P-wave speed tends to\ndecrease with increasing strain, and that this decrease is more marked at room\ntemperature than at 200 and 400 $^\\circ$C. The decrease in wave speed is\nconsistent with microcracking, which is more prevalent at low temperature and\nlow pressure. Microstructural observations reveal high twin densities in all\ndeformed samples. Twin density increases with stress, consistent with previous\ndatasets. Spatial distributions of intragranular misorientation indicate that\ntwins are sometimes obstacles to dislocation motion, but this effect is not\nubiquitous. Computed slip-transfer statistics indicate that that twins are\ntypically weaker barriers to dislocation glide than grain boundaries, so that\ntheir effect on dislocation accumulation and hardening rates is likely smaller\nthan the effect of grain size. Indeed, our data reveal that grain size exerts a\nfirst-order control on flow stress and hardening in calcite, whereas twinning\nmay only have a secondary impact on these behaviours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 16:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

We overcome both limitations by introducing a semi-parametric model of\nsensory discrimination that applies traditional psychophysical models along a\nstimulus intensity dimension, but puts Gaussian process (GP) priors on the\nparameters of these models with respect to the remaining dimensions. By\ncombining the flexibility of the GP with the deep literature on parametric\npsychophysics, our semi-parametric models achieve good performance with much\nless data than baselines on both synthetic and real-world high-dimensional\npsychophysics datasets.

In this paper, we focus on change point\ndetection in dynamic graphs and address three main challenges associated with\nthis problem: i). how to compare graph snapshots across time, ii). how to\ncapture temporal dependencies, and iii). how to combine different views of a\ntemporal graph. To solve the above challenges, we first propose Laplacian\nAnomaly Detection (LAD) which uses the spectrum of graph Laplacian as the low\ndimensional embedding of the graph structure at each snapshot. LAD explicitly\nmodels short term and long term dependencies by applying two sliding windows.\nNext, we propose MultiLAD, a simple and effective generalization of LAD to\nmulti-view graphs.

Indeed, with the bandit lens\ncomes the promise of direct optimisation for the metrics we care about.\n  Nevertheless, the road to successfully applying bandits in production is not\nan easy one. Even when the action space and rewards are well-defined,\npractitioners still need to make decisions regarding multi-arm or contextual\napproaches, on- or off-policy setups, delayed or immediate feedback, myopic or\nlong-term optimisation, etc. To make matters worse, industrial platforms\ntypically give rise to large action spaces in which existing approaches tend to\nbreak down. The research literature on these topics is broad and vast, but this\ncan overwhelm practitioners, whose primary aim is to solve practical problems,\nand therefore need to decide on a specific instantiation or approach for each\nproject.

The statement of\nenrichment is a quantitative analogue of being a preorder. Towards seeking a\nlogic for quantitative metric reasoning, we investigate three (closely related)\nmany-valued propositional logics over the Lawvere quantale. The basic logical\nconnectives shared by all three logics are those that can be interpreted in any\nquantale, viz finite conjunctions and disjunctions, tensor (addition for the\nLawvere quantale) and linear implication (here a truncated subtraction); to\nthese we add, in turn, the constant 1 to express integer values, and scalar\nmultiplication by a non-negative real to express general affine combinations.\nPropositional Boolean logic can already be interpreted in the first of these\nlogics; {\\L}ukasiewicz logic can be interpreted in the second; Ben Yaacov's\ncontinuous propositional logic can be interpreted in the third; and\nquantitative equational logic can be interpreted in the third if we allow\ninference systems instead of axiomatic systems.

Whistler waves are electromagnetic waves produced by electron-driven\ninstabilities, that in turn can reshape the electron distributions via\nwave-particle interactions. In the solar wind, they are one of the main\ncandidates for explaining the scattering of the strahl electron population into\nthe halo at increasing radial distances from the Sun and for subsequently\nregulating the solar wind heat flux. However, it is unclear what type of\ninstability dominates to drive whistlers in the solar wind. Aims. Our goal is\nto study whistler wave parameters in the young solar wind sampled by Parker\nSolar Probe (PSP). The wave normal angle (WNA) in particular is a key parameter\nto discriminate between the generation mechanisms of these waves. Methods. We\nanalyze the cross-spectral matrices of magnetic fieldfluctuations measured by\nthe Search-Coil Magnetometer (SCM) and processed by the Digital Fields Board\n(DFB) from the FIELDS suite during PSP's first perihelion. Results. Among the\n2701 wave packets detected in the cross spectra, namely individual bins in time\nand frequency, most were quasi-parallel to the background magnetic field but a\nsignificant part (3%) of observed waves had oblique (> 45{\\deg}) WNA. The\nvalidation analysis conducted with the time-series waveforms reveal that this\npercentage is a lower limit. Moreover, we find that about 64% of the whistler\nwaves detected in the spectra are associated with at least one magnetic dip.\nConclusions. We conclude that magnetic dips provides favorable conditions for\nthe generation of whistler waves. We hypothesize that the whistlers detected in\nmagnetic dips are locally generated by the thermal anisotropy as quasi-parallel\nand can gain obliqueness during their propagation. We finally discuss the\nimplication of our results for the scattering of the strahl in the solar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 17:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

To reduce the impact of the biological carry-over effect, a wash-out\nperiod is often designed. However, the carry-over effect remains an outstanding\nconcern when a wash-out period is unethical or cannot sufficiently diminish the\nimpact of the carry-over effect. The latter can occur in comparative\neffectiveness research where the carry-over effect is often non-biological but\nbehavioral. In this paper, we investigate the crossover design under a\npotential outcomes framework with and without the carry-over effect. We find\nthat when the carry-over effect exists and satisfies a sign condition, the\nbasic estimator underestimates the treatment effect, which does not inflate the\ntype I error of one-sided tests but negatively impacts the power. This leads to\na power trade-off between the crossover design and the parallel-group design,\nand we derive the condition under which the crossover design does not lead to\ntype I error inflation and is still more powerful than the parallel-group\ndesign. We also develop covariate adjustment methods for crossover trials.

However,\nseveral groups have noted that introducing a secondary heating source within\nthe wind can change the hydrodynamic conditions sufficiently for a strong\nr-process to proceed. One possible secondary heating source is gravito-acoustic\nwaves, generated by convection inside the proto-neutron star. As these waves\npropagate into the wind, they can both accelerate the wind and shock and\ndeposit energy into the wind.

Weather data for the days in which peak demand occurred were\nalso compiled to investigate the relationship between peak heating and cooling\nloads and ambient temperature. This relationship was then applied along with\npopulation projections and a climate scenario with medium to high radiative\nforcing to create winter and summer peak demand growth scenarios for 2025\nthrough 2050. This analysis informs resource planners about how ERCOT peak\ndemand might change in the future and provides new insight into how electric\nload growth and non-flexible electrified heating demand could have contributed\nto the February 2021 ERCOT blackouts. We found that historically, summer peak\ndemand growth has been generally stable and approximately linear with time. The\nstable summer peak load is likely a consequence of fairly constant temperatures\nobserved on summer peak demand days. Conversely, the winter peak demand growth\nhas been less consistent, varying much more around the broader trend. This\nphenomenon is likely a consequence of high residential electrical heating load\non winter peak demand days, which saw temperatures that varied widely from the\nmean value. Future peak winter and summer electricity demand scenarios\nindicated that while average temperatures on winter peak demand days will\nremain fairly constant, they will be more erratic than temperatures on summer\npeak demand days. As a result, winter peak demand will remain more erratic and\nwill sporadically surpass summer peak demand between 2025 and 2050. Thus,\nresource planners in ERCOT should place less certainty on winter peak demand\nprojections and an increased level of winter preparedness on both the supply\nand demand sectors appears warranted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 18:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

This framework, which subsumes beyond the Standard Model\nparadigms as generally as possible, is meant to extend recent successful\nimplementations of bSM EFTs and complement e.g. the Standard Model Effective\nField Theory (SMEFT), which can capture the off-shell effects of exotic fields.\nIn this work, we review a general method for the construction of a complete\nlist of gauge-invariant operators involving SM interactions with light exotics\nvia iterative tensor product decomposition, up to the desired order in mass\ndimension.

We present\nMultiCAM, a generalization of traditional abundance matching frameworks, which\ncan simultaneously connect the full MAH of a halo with multiple halo and/or\ngalaxy properties. As a first case study, we apply MultiCAM to the problem of\nconnecting dark matter halo properties to their MAHs in the context of a dark\nmatter-only simulation. While some halo properties, such as concentration, are\nmore strongly correlated to the early-time mass growth of a halo, others, like\nthe virial ratio, have stronger correlations with late-time mass growth. This\nhighlights the necessity of considering the impact of the entire MAH on halo\nproperties. For most of the halo properties we consider, we find that MultiCAM\nmodels that use the full MAH achieve higher accuracy than conditional abundance\nmatching models which use a single epoch. We also demonstrate an extension of\nMultiCAM that captures the covariance between predicted halo properties. This\nextension provides a baseline model for applications where the covariance\nbetween predicted properties is important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

We focus on the magnetically-arrested disk (MAD) state in the\nsub- and super-Eddington regimes, when the accretion disk is\nradiatively-inefficient and geometrically-thick, and the system launches strong\nBH-powered jets. Using a suite of 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\n(GRMHD) simulations, we find that for any initial spin, a MAD rapidly spins\ndown the BH to the equilibrium spin of $0 < a_{\\rm eq} \\lesssim 0.1$, very low\ncompared to $a_{\\rm eq} = 1$ for the standard thin luminous (Novikov-Thorne)\ndisks. This implies that rapidly accreting (super-Eddington) BHs fed by MADs\ntend to lose most of their rotational energy to magnetized relativistic\noutflows. In a MAD, a BH only needs to accrete $10\\%$ of its own mass to spin\ndown from $a=1$ to $a=0.2$. We construct a semi-analytic model of BH spin\nevolution in MADs by taking into account the torques on the BH due to both the\nhydrodynamic disk and electromagnetic jet components, and find that the low\nvalue of $a_{\\rm eq}$ is due to both the jets slowing down the BH rotation and\nthe disk losing a large fraction of its angular momentum to outflows.

In this\npaper, we present new space- and ground-based photometric data of WASP-47b and\nWASP-47-d, including 11 unpublished light curves from the ESA mission CHEOPS.\nWe analyzed the light curves in a homogeneous way together with all the\npublicly available data to carry out a global $N$-body dynamical modeling of\nthe TTV and RV signals.

However, a clear picture of this coevolution is far from\nbeing understood. We select an X-ray sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) up\nto $z=2.5$ in the miniJPAS footprint. Their X-ray to infrared spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) have been modeled with CIGALE, constraining the emission\nto 68 bands. For a final sample of 308 galaxies, we derive their physical\nproperties (e.g., $M_\\star$, $\\rm{SFR}$, $\\rm{SFH}$, and $L_\\rm{AGN}$). We also\nfit their optical spectra for a subsample of 113 sources to estimate the\n$M_\\rm{BH}$. We calculate the BHAR depending on two radiative efficiency\nregimes. We find that the Eddington ratios ($\\lambda$) and its popular proxy\n($L_\\rm{X}$/$M_\\star$) have 0.6 dex of difference, and a KS-test indicates that\nthey come from different distributions. Our sources exhibit a considerable\nscatter on the $M_\\rm{BH}$-$M_\\star$ relation, which can explain the difference\nbetween $\\lambda$ and its proxy. We also model three evolution scenarios to\nrecover the integral properties at $z=0$. Using the SFR and BHAR, we show a\nnotable diminution in the scattering between $M_\\rm{BH}$-$M_\\star$. For the\nlast scenario, we consider the SFH and a simple energy budget for the AGN\naccretion, obtaining a relation similar to the local Universe. Our study covers\n$\\sim 1$ deg$^2$ in the sky and is sensitive to biases in luminosity.\nNevertheless, we show that, for bright sources, the link between SFR and BHAR,\nand their decoupling based on an energy limit is the key that leads to the\nlocal $M_\\rm{BH}$-$M_\\star$ scaling relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 19:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

To\nunderstand the power of quantum machine learning, it is therefore crucial to\nidentify the types of data structures that lend themselves naturally to quantum\nmodels. In this work we look to quantum contextuality -- a form of\nnonclassicality with links to computational advantage -- for answers to this\nquestion. We introduce a framework for studying contextuality in machine\nlearning, which leads us to a definition of what it means for a learning model\nto be contextual. From this, we connect a central concept of contextuality,\ncalled operational equivalence, to the ability of a model to encode a linearly\nconserved quantity in its label space. A consequence of this connection is that\ncontextuality is tied to expressivity: contextual model classes that encode the\ninductive bias are generally more expressive than their noncontextual\ncounterparts. To demonstrate this, we construct an explicit toy learning\nproblem -- based on learning the payoff behaviour of a zero-sum game -- for\nwhich this is the case. By leveraging tools from geometric quantum machine\nlearning, we then describe how to construct quantum learning models with the\nassociated inductive bias, and show through our toy problem that they\noutperform their corresponding classical surrogate models. This suggests that\nunderstanding learning problems of this form may lead to useful insights about\nthe power of quantum machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 19:07:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 17:06:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 08:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Recent work has sought to train fair models without\nsensitive attributes on training data.

However, this assumption too might not\nbe practical. Here, we propose Antigone, a framework to train fair classifiers\nwithout access to sensitive attributes on either training or validation data.\nInstead, we generate pseudo sensitive attributes on the validation data by\ntraining a biased classifier and using the classifier's incorrectly (correctly)\nlabeled examples as proxies for minority (majority) groups.

The proposed alignment is general and can\nbe combined with any existing scene graph generation framework, where it is\ntrained alongside the original model's objective.

In this work we propose a generic framework for\nhigher-order effects, generalizing algebraic effects & handlers: a generic free\nmonad with higher-order effect signatures and a corresponding interpreter.\nSpecializing this higher-order syntax leads to various definitions of\npreviously defined (scoped, parallel, latent) and novel (writer, bracketing)\neffects. Furthermore, we formally show our framework theoretically correct,\nalso putting different effect instances on formal footing; a significant\ncontribution for parallel, latent, writer and bracketing effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 21:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

Identifying the\nmechanism responsible for accretion is a long-standing problem, dating back\nseveral decades. The common picture is that accretion is a consequence of\nturbulence, with several instabilities proposed for its origin. While\ntraditionally this field used to be a purely theoretical endeavour, the\nlandscape is now changing thanks mainly to new observational facilities such as\nthe ALMA radio interferometer. Thanks to large improvements in spatial and\nspectral resolution and sensitivity (which have enabled the study of disc\nsubstructure, kinematics and surveys of large disc populations), multiple\ntechniques have been devised to observationally measure the amount of\nturbulence in discs. This review summarises these techniques, ranging from\nattempts at direct detection of turbulence from line broadening, to more\nindirect approaches that rely on properties of the dust or consider the\nevolution of global disc properties (such as masses, radii and accretion rates)\nfor large samples, and what their findings are. Multiple lines of evidence\nsuggest that discs are in fact not as turbulent as thought one decade ago.

A main barrier for this is the scarcity of the\nhigh-quality training data. To tackle the issue, we propose a novel machine\nlearning based peptide design architecture, called Latent Space Approximate\nTrajectory Collector (LSATC). It consists of a series of samplers on an\noptimization trajectory on a highly non-convex energy landscape that\napproximates the distributions of peptides with desired properties in a latent\nspace. The process involves little human intervention and can be implemented in\nan end-to-end manner. We demonstrate the model by the design of peptide\nextensions targeting Beta-catenin, a key nuclear effector protein involved in\ncanonical Wnt signalling. When compared with a random sampler, LSATC can sample\npeptides with $36\\%$ lower binding scores in a $16$ times smaller interquartile\nrange (IQR) and $284\\%$ less hydrophobicity with a $1.4$ times smaller IQR.\nLSATC also largely outperforms other common generative models. Finally, we\nutilized a clustering algorithm to select 4 peptides from the 100 LSATC\ndesigned peptides for experimental validation. The result confirms that all the\nfour peptides extended by LSATC show improved Beta-catenin binding by at least\n$20.0\\%$, and two of the peptides show a $3$ fold increase in binding affinity\nas compared to the base peptide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 21:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

There are, however, special\narrangements of atoms, such as twisted graphene bilayers or lattices which\nresemble woven bamboo \"kagome\" mats, so that particle motion with strong\nhopping between neighbours becomes nearly or even completely dispersionless.\nSuch flat bands are interesting because the interactions between the heavy\nparticles inhabiting them will become much more important than for strong\ndispersion, resulting in novel quantum solid and liquid states, particularly\nwhen topology enters on account of significant spin-orbit coupling for the\nunderlying electrons. Nonetheless, spectroscopic evidence for flat bands\nengendered by lattice geometry rather than weak hopping is rare, particularly\nfor metallic single crystals. Here we report the discovery, using circularly\npolarized X-Rays in resonant absorption and inelastic scattering (RIXS) for the\nunambiguous isolation of magnetic signals, of a flat spin wave band and large\norbital moment for the metallic kagome ferromagnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, which has a\ntopologically non-trivial electronic band structure controllable by modest\nexternal magnetic fields.

In\naddition to recent successes of the current classification approaches relying\non feature engineering and deep learning, several shortcomings of them, such as\nthe lack of robustness, generalizability, and interpretability, have also been\nobserved. These methods often require extensive training data, are\ncomputationally expensive, and are vulnerable to out-of-distribution samples,\ne.g., adversarial attacks. Recently, an accurate, data-efficient,\ncomputationally efficient, and robust transport-based classification approach\nhas been proposed, which describes a generative model-based problem formulation\nand closed-form solution for a specific category of classification problems.\nHowever, all these approaches lack mechanisms to detect test samples outside\nthe class distributions used during training.

A standard method learns a\nunique embedding vector for each user and item. However, such a method has two\nimportant limitations in real-world applications: 1) it is hard to learn\nembeddings that generalize well for users and items with rare interactions on\ntheir own; and 2) it may incur unbearably high memory costs when the number of\nusers and items scales up. Existing approaches either can only address one of\nthe limitations or have flawed overall performances. In this paper, we propose\nClustered Embedding Learning (CEL) as an integrated solution to these two\nproblems. CEL is a plug-and-play embedding learning framework that can be\ncombined with any differentiable feature interaction model. It is capable of\nachieving improved performance, especially for cold users and items, with\nreduced memory cost. CEL enables automatic and dynamic clustering of users and\nitems in a top-down fashion, where clustered entities jointly learn a shared\nembedding. The accelerated version of CEL has an optimal time complexity, which\nsupports efficient online updates. Theoretically, we prove the identifiability\nand the existence of a unique optimal number of clusters for CEL in the context\nof nonnegative matrix factorization. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness\nof CEL on three public datasets and one business dataset, showing its\nconsistently superior performance against current state-of-the-art methods.

Test oracles rely on a ground-truth that can distinguish\nbetween the correct and buggy behavior to determine whether a test fails\n(detects a bug) or passes. What makes the oracle problem challenging and\nundecidable is the assumption that the ground-truth should know the exact\nexpected, correct, or buggy behavior. However, we argue that one can still\nbuild an accurate oracle without knowing the exact correct or buggy behavior,\nbut how these two might differ. This paper presents SEER, a learning-based\napproach that in the absence of test assertions or other types of oracle, can\ndetermine whether a unit test passes or fails on a given method under test\n(MUT). To build the ground-truth, SEER jointly embeds unit tests and the\nimplementation of MUTs into a unified vector space, in such a way that the\nneural representation of tests are similar to that of MUTs they pass on them,\nbut dissimilar to MUTs they fail on them. The classifier built on top of this\nvector representation serves as the oracle to generate \"fail\" labels, when test\ninputs detect a bug in MUT or \"pass\" labels, otherwise. Our extensive\nexperiments on applying SEER to more than 5K unit tests from a diverse set of\nopen-source Java projects show that the produced oracle is (1) effective in\npredicting the fail or pass labels, achieving an overall accuracy, precision,\nrecall, and F1 measure of 93%, 86%, 94%, and 90%, (2) generalizable, predicting\nthe labels for the unit test of projects that were not in training or\nvalidation set with negligible performance drop, and (3) efficient, detecting\nthe existence of bugs in only 6.5 milliseconds on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 01:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 23:32:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

Clinical trials have been developed\nin multiple institutions to investigate whether dose-sparing to the\ninternal-pudendal-arteries (IPA) will improve retention of sexual potency. The\nIPA is usually not considered a conventional organ-at-risk (OAR) due to\nsegmentation difficulty. In this work, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based\nauto-segmentation model for the IPA that utilizes CT and MRI or CT alone as the\ninput image modality to accommodate variation in clinical practice. Materials\nand methods: 86 patients with CT and MRI images and noisy IPA labels were\nrecruited in this study. We split the data into 42/14/30 for model training,\ntesting, and a clinical observer study, respectively. There were three major\ninnovations in this model: 1) we designed an architecture with\nsqueeze-and-excite blocks and modality attention for effective feature\nextraction and production of accurate segmentation, 2) a novel loss function\nwas used for training the model effectively with noisy labels, and 3) modality\ndropout strategy was used for making the model capable of segmentation in the\nabsence of MRI.

We set up novel evaluation benchmarks based on a\nseries of testing sets with evolving distributions. A corpus of metrics are\ndesigned for measuring the accuracy, robustness, and bounds of algorithms for\nlearning with long-tailed distribution. Based on our benchmarks, we re-evaluate\nthe performance of existing methods on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, which is\nvaluable for guiding the selection of data rebalancing techniques. We also\nrevisit existing methods and categorize them into four types including data\nbalancing, feature balancing, loss balancing, and prediction balancing,\naccording the focused procedure during the training pipeline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 02:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

Define a\nfocused research question, then plan sampling and analysis to answer it; 2.\nDevelop a model that accounts for the distribution and dependence of your data;\n3.

However, they are inherently unsuitable for interactive\nstreaming scenarios (e.g. video conferencing, telepresence) because have an\ninevitable lag even if the training is instantaneous. This is because these\napproaches consume videos and thus have to buffer chunks of frames (often\nseconds) before processing. In this work, we take a step towards interactive\nstreaming via a frame-by-frame approach naturally free of lag. Conventional\nwisdom believes that per-frame NeRFs are impractical due to prohibitive\ntraining costs and storage. We break this belief by introducing Incremental\nNeural Videos (INV), a per-frame NeRF that is efficiently trained and\nstreamable. We designed INV based on two insights: (1) Our main finding is that\nMLPs naturally partition themselves into Structure and Color Layers, which\nstore structural and color/texture information respectively. (2) We leverage\nthis property to retain and improve upon knowledge from previous frames, thus\namortizing training across frames and reducing redundant learning. As a result,\nwith negligible changes to NeRF, INV can achieve good qualities (>28.6db) in\n8min/frame. It can also outperform prior SOTA in 19% less training time.\nAdditionally, our Temporal Weight Compression reduces the per-frame size to\n0.3MB/frame (6.6% of NeRF). More importantly, INV is free from buffer lag and\nis naturally fit for streaming. While this work does not achieve real-time\ntraining, it shows that incremental approaches like INV present new\npossibilities in interactive 3D streaming. Moreover, our discovery of natural\ninformation partition leads to a better understanding and manipulation of MLPs.\nCode and dataset will be released soon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 04:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

Recent\nstudies have made encouraging progress, but they are still suffering from a\nlack of overall understanding of scenes and generating inaccurate captions. One\npossible reason is that current studies mainly focus on constructing the\nplane-level geometric relationship of scene text without depth information.\nThis leads to insufficient scene text relational reasoning so that models may\ndescribe scene text inaccurately. The other possible reason is that existing\nmethods fail to generate fine-grained descriptions of some visual objects. In\naddition, they may ignore essential visual objects, leading to the scene text\nbelonging to these ignored objects not being utilized. To address the above\nissues, we propose a DEpth and VIsual ConcEpts Aware Transformer (DEVICE) for\nTextCaps.

However, the\nperformance of the existing works heavily relies on the quality of the employed\ndata augmentation (DA) functions, which are typically hand picked from a\nrestricted set of choices. While exploiting a diverse set of data augmentations\nis appealing, the intricacies of DAs and representation learning may lead to\nperformance degradation. To address this challenge and allow for a systemic use\nof large numbers of data augmentations, this paper proposes Contrastive\nLearning with Consistent Representations (CoCor). At the core of CoCor is a new\nconsistency measure, DA consistency, which dictates the mapping of augmented\ninput data to the representation space such that these instances are mapped to\noptimal locations in a way consistent to the intensity of the DA applied.\nFurthermore, a data-driven approach is proposed to learn the optimal mapping\nlocations as a function of DA while maintaining a desired monotonic property\nwith respect to DA intensity. The proposed techniques give rise to a\nsemi-supervised learning framework based on bi-level optimization, achieving\nnew state-of-the-art results for image recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 04:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

A numerical framework based on the method of fundamental solutions is\ndeveloped and employed to solve the CCR model in two dimensions.

To effectively represent the drop in\nperformance of a faulty propeller, a variation of the deep neural network, a\nLSTM network is proposed. With the RPM of the propeller as input and based on\nthe fault condition of the propeller, the proposed propeller model estimates\nthe resultant torque and thrust. Then, flight datasets of the UAV under various\nfault scenarios are generated via simulation using the developed\ndata-generative model.

That is,\nreal-time AV apps should share the limited on-board resources with other\nconcurrent apps without missing their deadlines dictated by the frame rate of a\ncamera that generates and provides input images to the apps.

We then generalize the\nconcept to achieve a multiple-level quantum emitter through a suitable design\nof cavity modes, allowing for deterministic photon-pair generation and even a\nquantum SWAP gate between a cavity photon and a free-electron qubit. An\nincrease in coupling strength by a factor of \\sqrt(N) can be achieved when an\nentangled symmetric state of N electrons is used to drive the cavity. Tunable\nby their kinetic energy and phase-matching to light waves, quantum\nfree-electrons are inherently versatile emitters with an engineerable emission\nwavelength. As such, they pave the way towards new possibilities for quantum\ninterconnects between photonic platforms at disparate spectral regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 07:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

In addition to effective laboratory assays, various bi-clustering\nalgorithms for detection of the co-expressed genes have been developed.\nBi-clustering methods are used to discover subgroups of genes with similar\nexpression patterns under to-be-identified subsets of experimental conditions\nwhen applied to gene expression data. By building two fuzzy partition matrices\nof the gene expression data with the Axiomatic Fuzzy Set (AFS) theory, this\npaper proposes a novel fuzzy bi-clustering algorithm for identification of\nco-regulated genes. Specifically, the gene expression data is transformed into\ntwo fuzzy partition matrices via sub-preference relations theory of AFS at\nfirst. One of the matrices is considering the genes as the universe and the\nconditions as the concept, the other one is considering the genes as the\nconcept and the conditions as the universe. The identification of the\nco-regulated genes (bi-clusters) is carried out on the two partition matrices\nat the same time. Then, a novel fuzzy-based similarity criterion is defined\nbased on the partition matrixes, and a cyclic optimization algorithm is\ndesigned to discover the significant bi-clusters at expression level. The above\nprocedures guarantee that the generated bi-clusters have more significant\nexpression values than that of extracted by the traditional bi-clustering\nmethods. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated with the\nperformance of the three well-known bi-clustering algorithms on publicly\navailable real microarray datasets. The experimental results are in agreement\nwith the theoretical analysis and show that the proposed algorithm can\neffectively detect the co-regulated genes without any prior knowledge of the\ngene expression data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 08:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

In the laminar regime, it has been shown that trace amounts of\nsurfactant can negate this drag reduction, at times rendering these surfaces no\nbetter than solid walls (Peaudecerf et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 114(28),\n7254-9, 2017). However, surfactant effects on the drag-reducing properties of\nSHSs have not yet been studied under turbulent flow conditions, where\npredicting the effects of surfactant in direct numerical simulations remains\nexpensive by today's standards. We present a model for turbulent flow inclusive\nof surfactant, in either a channel or boundary-layer configuration, over long\nbut finite-length streamwise ridges that are periodic in the spanwise\ndirection, with period $P$ and gas fraction $\\varphi$. We adopt a technique\nbased on a shifted log law to acquire an expression for the drag reduction. The\naverage streamwise and spanwise slip lengths are derived by introducing a local\nlaminar model within the viscous sublayer, whereby the effect of surfactant is\nmodelled by modifying the average streamwise and spanwise slip lengths. Our\nmodel agrees with available laboratory experimental data from the literature\nwhen conditions are clean (surfactant-free), or when there are low surfactant\nlevels. However, we find an appreciable drag increase for larger background\nsurfactant concentrations that are characteristic of turbulent flows over SHSs\nfor marine applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 10:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

After a fusion event, both the release site and the\nvesicle undergo a recovery process before becoming available for reuse again.\nOf central interest is the question which of the two restoration steps acts as\nthe limiting factor during neurotransmission under high-frequency sustained\nstimulation. In order to investigate this question, we introduce a novel\nnon-linear reaction network which involves explicit recovery steps for both the\nvesicles and the release sites, and includes the induced time-dependent output\ncurrent. The associated reaction dynamics are formulated by means of ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs), as well as via the associated stochastic jump\nprocess. While the stochastic jump model describes a single release site, the\naverage over many release sites is close to the ODE solution and shares its\nperiodic structure. The reason for this can be traced back to the insight that\nrecovery dynamics of vesicles and release sites are statistically almost\nindependent. A sensitivity analysis on the recovery rates based on the ODE\nformulation reveals that neither the vesicle nor the release site recovery step\ncan be identified as the essential rate-limiting step but that the\nrate-limiting feature changes over the course of stimulation. Under sustained\nstimulation the dynamics given by the ODEs exhibit transient changes leading\nfrom an initial depression of the postsynaptic response to an asymptotic\nperiodic orbit, while the individual trajectories of the stochastic jump model\nlack the oscillatory behavior and asymptotic periodicity of the ODE-solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 10:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

The acyclic chromatic index of a graph $G$ denoted\nby $a'(G)$, is the minimum positive integer $k$ such that $G$ has an acyclic\nedge coloring with $k$ colors. It has been conjectured by Fiam\\v{c}\\'{\\i}k that\n$a'(G) \\le \\Delta+2$ for any graph $G$ with maximum degree $\\Delta$. Linear\narboricity of a graph $G$, denoted by $la(G)$, is the minimum number of linear\nforests into which the edges of $G$ can be partitioned. A graph is said to be\nchordless if no cycle in the graph contains a chord. Every $2$-connected\nchordless graph is a minimally $2$-connected graph. It was shown by Basavaraju\nand Chandran that if $G$ is $2$-degenerate, then $a'(G) \\le \\Delta+1$. Since\nchordless graphs are also $2$-degenerate, we have $a'(G) \\le \\Delta+1$ for any\nchordless graph $G$. Machado, de Figueiredo and Trotignon proved that the\nchromatic index of a chordless graph is $\\Delta$ when $\\Delta \\ge 3$. They also\nobtained a polynomial time algorithm to color a chordless graph optimally. We\nimprove this result by proving that the acyclic chromatic index of a chordless\ngraph is $\\Delta$, except when $\\Delta=2$ and the graph has a cycle, in which\ncase it is $\\Delta+1$. We also provide the sketch of a polynomial time\nalgorithm for an optimal acyclic edge coloring of a chordless graph.

To obtain the result on acyclic chromatic\nindex, we prove a structural result on chordless graphs which is a refinement\nof the structure given by Machado, de Figueiredo and Trotignon for this class\nof graphs.

In contrast, gradient-free CAMs can avoid computing gradients to\nproduce more understandable results.

In our work, we improve the coincidence time\nresolution (CTR) of positron emission tomography (PET) detectors. PET enables\nimaging of metabolic processes by detecting {\\gamma}-photons with scintillation\ndetectors. Current research exploits light-sharing detectors, where the\nscintillation light is distributed over and digitized by an array of readout\nchannels. While these detectors demonstrate excellent performance parameters,\ne.g., regarding spatial resolution, extracting precise timing information for\ntime-of-flight (TOF) becomes more challenging due to deteriorating effects\ncalled time skews. Conventional correction methods mainly rely on analytical\nformulations, theoretically capable of covering all time skew effects, e.g.,\ncaused by signal runtimes or physical effects. However, additional effects are\ninvolved for light-sharing detectors, so finding suitable analytical\nformulations can become arbitrarily complicated.

To bridge this gap, we propose the first systematic AR approach using\noptical see-through (OST) head mounted displays (HMDs) with comparative\nevaluation for domain users towards IPT visualization analysis. The\nproof-of-concept was demonstrated by a within-subject user study (n=20) with\ncounterbalancing design. Both qualitative and quantitative measurements were\ninvestigated. The results showed that our AR approach outperformed conventional\nsettings for IPT data visualization analysis in bringing higher\nunderstandability, reduced task completion time, lower error rates for domain\ntasks, increased usability with enhanced user experience, and a better\nrecommendation level. We summarize the findings and suggest future research\ndirections for benefiting IPT users with AR/MR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 12:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

They are trained to generate an\nobject $x$ through a sequence of steps with probability proportional to some\nreward function $R(x)$ (or $\\exp(-\\mathcal{E}(x))$ with $\\mathcal{E}(x)$\ndenoting the energy function), given at the end of the generative trajectory.\nLike for other RL settings where the reward is only given at the end, the\nefficiency of training and credit assignment may suffer when those trajectories\nare longer. With previous GFlowNet work, no learning was possible from\nincomplete trajectories (lacking a terminal state and the computation of the\nassociated reward). In this paper, we consider the case where the energy\nfunction can be applied not just to terminal states but also to intermediate\nstates. This is for example achieved when the energy function is additive, with\nterms available along the trajectory. We show how to reparameterize the\nGFlowNet state flow function to take advantage of the partial reward already\naccrued at each state. This enables a training objective that can be applied to\nupdate parameters even with incomplete trajectories. Even when complete\ntrajectories are available, being able to obtain more localized credit and\ngradients is found to speed up training convergence, as demonstrated across\nmany simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 12:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

A parametric study\nwas conducted to examine the effects of wave properties and initial conditions\non breaking features. According to research on the Bond number ($Bo$, the ratio\nof gravitational to surface tension forces), a larger surface tension produces\nmore significant parasitic capillaries at the forward face of the wave profile\nand a thicker plunging jet, which causes a delayed breaking time and is tightly\ncorrelated with the main cavity size.

Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a paradigm which allows to\ndistributedly train machine learning model with clients possessing unique\nfeatures pertaining to the same individuals, where the tabular data learning is\nthe primary use case. However, it is unknown if tabular GANs can be learned in\nVFL. Demand for secure data transfer among clients and GAN during training and\ndata synthesizing poses extra challenge. Conditional vector for tabular GANs is\na valuable tool to control specific features of generated data. But it contains\nsensitive information from real data - risking privacy guarantees. In this\npaper, we propose GTV, a VFL framework for tabular GANs, whose key components\nare generator, discriminator and the conditional vector. GTV proposes an unique\ndistributed training architecture for generator and discriminator to access\ntraining data in a privacy-preserving manner. To accommodate conditional vector\ninto training without privacy leakage, GTV designs a mechanism\ntraining-with-shuffling to ensure that no party can reconstruct training data\nwith conditional vector. We evaluate the effectiveness of GTV in terms of\nsynthetic data quality, and overall training scalability. Results show that GTV\ncan consistently generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data of comparable\nquality to that generated by centralized GAN algorithm.

But in many real-world applications, this may not hold, that is, the\ntraining dataset may be contaminated by a proportion of undesired instances.\nWhen training on such datasets, existing GANs will learn a mixture distribution\nof desired and contaminated instances, rather than the desired distribution of\ndesired data only (target distribution). To learn the target distribution from\ncontaminated datasets, two purified generative adversarial networks (PuriGAN)\nare developed, in which the discriminators are augmented with the capability to\ndistinguish between target and contaminated instances by leveraging an extra\ndataset solely composed of contamination instances.

Two local nonlinear gates break the symmetry and linearity of\nthe waveguide, yielding strong global non-reciprocal acoustics, in the way that\nextremely different acoustical responses occur depending on the side of\napplication of harmonic excitation. To the authors' best knowledge that the\npresent two-gated waveguide is capable of extremely high acoustic\nnon-reciprocity, at a much higher level to what is reported by active or\npassive devices in the current literature; moreover, this extreme performance\ncombines with acceptable levels of transmissibility in the desired direction of\nwave propagation. Machine learning is utilized for predictive design of this\ngated waveguide in terms of the measures of transmissibility and\nnon-reciprocity, with the aim of reducing the required computational time for\nhigh-dimensional parameter space analysis. The study sheds new light into the\nphysics of these media and considers the advantages and limitations of using\nneural networks to analyze this type of physical problems. In the predicted\ndesirable parameter space for intense non-reciprocity, the maximum\ntransmissibility reaches as much as 40%, and the transmitted energy from\nupstream to downstream varies up to nine orders of magnitude, depending on the\ndirection of wave transmission.

The target selection\nis based on the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (the Legacy Surveys) DR9\nphotometry, combined with the Pan-STARRS1 data and $J$-band photometry from\npublic surveys. A first quasar sample has been constructed from the DESI Survey\nValidation 3 (SV3) and first-year observations until May 2022. This sample\nincludes more than 400 new quasars at redshift 4.7 <= $z$ < 6.6, down to 21.5\nmagnitude in the $z$ band, discovered from 35% of the entire target sample.\nRemarkably, there are 220 new quasars identified at $z$ >= 5, more than one\nthird of existing quasars previously published at this redshift. The\nobservations so far result in an average success rate of 23% at $z$ > 4.7. The\ncurrent spectral dataset has already allowed analysis of interesting individual\nobjects (e.g., quasars with damped Ly$\\alpha$ absorbers and broad absorption\nline features), and statistical analysis will follow the survey's completion. A\nset of science projects will be carried out leveraging this program, including\nquasar luminosity function, quasar clustering, intergalactic medium, quasar\nspectral properties, intervening absorbers, and properties of early\nsupermassive black holes.

Although\nsuch a solution reduces the computational cost, it naturally suffers from small\nattended receptive fields, which may limit the performance. In this work, we\nexplore effective Vision Transformers to pursue a preferable trade-off between\nthe computational complexity and size of the attended receptive field.

With a pyramid\narchitecture, we construct a Multi-Scale Dilated Transformer (DilateFormer) by\nstacking MSDA blocks at low-level stages and global multi-head self-attention\nblocks at high-level stages. Our experiment results show that our DilateFormer\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision tasks. On ImageNet-1K\nclassification task, DilateFormer achieves comparable performance with 70%\nfewer FLOPs compared with existing state-of-the-art models. Our\nDilateFormer-Base achieves 85.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification\ntask, 53.5% box mAP/46.1% mask mAP on COCO object detection/instance\nsegmentation task and 51.1% MS mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 14:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-09"}

Subsequently named Lord's 'paradox', the puzzle\ncentres on the observation that two common approach to analyses of 'change'\nbetween two time-points can produce radically different results. Approach 1\ninvolves analysing the follow-up minus baseline (i.e., 'change score') and\nApproach 2 involves analysing the follow-up conditional on baseline. METHODS:\nAt the heart of Lord's 'paradox' lies another puzzle concerning the use of\n'change scores' in observational data. Using directed acyclic graphs and data\nsimulations, we introduce, explore, and explain the 'paradox', consider the\nphilosophy of change, and discuss the warnings and lessons of this 50-year\npuzzle. RESULTS: Understanding Lord's 'paradox' starts with recognising that a\nvariable may change for three reasons: (A) 'endogenous change', which\nrepresents simple changes in scale, (B) 'random change', which represents\nchange due to random processes, and (C) 'exogenous change', which represents\nall non-endogenous, non-random change. Unfortunately, in observational data,\nneither Approach 1 nor Approach 2 are able to reliably estimate the causes of\n'exogenous change'. Approach 1 evaluates obscure estimands with little, if any,\nreal-world interpretation. Approach 2 is susceptible to mediator-outcome\nconfounding and cannot distinguish exogenous change from random change. Valid\nand precise estimates of a useful causal estimand instead require appropriate\nmultivariate methods (such as g-methods) and more than two measures of the\noutcome. CONCLUSION: Lord's 'paradox' reiterates the dangers of analysing\nchange scores in observational data and highlights the importance of\nconsidering causal questions within a causal framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 15:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

In this paper, we propose CAB, a novel\nframework that takes a comprehensive perspective of cognition, affection and\nbehavior to generate empathetic responses. For cognition, we build paths\nbetween critical keywords in the dialogue by leveraging external knowledge.\nThis is because keywords in a dialogue are the core of sentences. Building the\nlogic relationship between keywords, which is overlooked by the majority of\nexisting works, can improve the understanding of keywords and contextual logic,\nthus enhance the cognitive ability. For affection, we capture the emotional\ndependencies with dual latent variables that contain both interlocutors'\nemotions.

It is also one of the main contributors to disability\nworldwide. Recently it is becoming popular for individuals to use social media\nplatforms (e.g., Reddit) to express their difficulties and health issues (e.g.,\ndepression) and seek support from other users in online communities. It opens\ngreat opportunities to automatically identify social media users with\ndepression by parsing millions of posts for potential interventions. Deep\nlearning methods have begun to dominate in the field of machine learning and\nnatural language processing (NLP) because of their ease of use, efficient\nprocessing, and state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks. In this work, we\npropose a hybrid deep learning model which combines a pretrained sentence BERT\n(SBERT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect individuals with\ndepression with their Reddit posts. The sentence BERT is used to learn the\nmeaningful representation of semantic information in each post. CNN enables the\nfurther transformation of those embeddings and the temporal identification of\nbehavioral patterns of users. We trained and evaluated the model performance to\nidentify Reddit users with depression by utilizing the Self-reported Mental\nHealth Diagnoses (SMHD) data. The hybrid deep learning model achieved an\naccuracy of 0.86 and an F1 score of 0.86 and outperformed the state-of-the-art\ndocumented result (F1 score of 0.79) by other machine learning models in the\nliterature. The results show the feasibility of the hybrid model to identify\nindividuals with depression. Although the hybrid model is validated to detect\ndepression with Reddit posts, it can be easily tuned and applied to other text\nclassification tasks and different clinical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 06:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

These reviews are often treated as the highest form\nof evidence in evidence-based medicine, and are the key strategy to answer\nresearch questions in the medical field. To create a high-quality systematic\nreview, complex Boolean queries are often constructed to retrieve studies for\nthe review topic. However, it often takes a long time for systematic review\nresearchers to construct a high quality systematic review Boolean query, and\noften the resulting queries are far from effective. Poor queries may lead to\nbiased or invalid reviews, because they missed to retrieve key evidence, or to\nextensive increase in review costs, because they retrieved too many irrelevant\nstudies. Recent advances in Transformer-based generative models have shown\ngreat potential to effectively follow instructions from users and generate\nanswers based on the instructions being made. In this paper, we investigate the\neffectiveness of the latest of such models, ChatGPT, in generating effective\nBoolean queries for systematic review literature search.

Such a boundary condition can force\nthe solution to have a singular behaviour at the boundary when $t\\to \\infty$.\nThe planar version of this problem has been investigated in an existing\nliterature, where the curve shortening flow in $2$-dimensional band with Robin\nboundary conditions is shown to converge to a translating Grim Reaper with\nfinite speed and fixed profile. By considering a radially symmetric mean\ncurvature flow, denoted by $u(|x|,t)$, in $(N+1)$-dimensional cylinder ($N\\geq\n2$), we find in the present paper a new feature of the flow: both the interior\ngradients and the propagating speed of the flow increase to infinity\nexponentially, $Du/u\\sim x$ and $ u\\sim C_0 e^{(N-1)t}e^{\\frac{|x|^2}{2}}$ as\n$t\\to \\infty$ for some $C_0>0$, which is completely different from the\n2-dimensional case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 02:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

The Existing Causal Inference Theory (ECIT) can make the\noverall conclusion consistent with the grouping conclusion by removing the\nconfounder's influence to eliminate the paradox. The ECIT uses relative risk\ndifference Pd = max(0, (R - 1)/R) (R denotes the risk ratio) as the probability\nof causation. In contrast, Philosopher Fitelson uses confirmation measure D\n(posterior probability minus prior probability) to measure the strength of\ncausation. Fitelson concludes that from the perspective of Bayesian\nconfirmation, we should directly accept the overall conclusion without\nconsidering the paradox. The author proposed a Bayesian confirmation measure b*\nsimilar to Pd before. To overcome the contradiction between the ECIT and\nBayesian confirmation, the author uses the semantic information method with the\nminimum cross-entropy criterion to deduce causal confirmation measure Cc = (R\n-1)/max(R, 1). Cc is like Pd but has normalizing property (between -1 and 1)\nand cause symmetry. It especially fits cases where a cause restrains an\noutcome, such as the COVID-19 vaccine controlling the infection. Some examples\n(about kidney stone treatments and COVID-19) reveal that Pd and Cc are more\nreasonable than D; Cc is more useful than Pd.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 02:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Unsupervised methods such as variational\nautoencoders (VAEs) can extract styles that are usually mixed with other\nfeatures. Conditional VAEs (CVAEs) can isolate styles using class labels;\nhowever, there are no established methods to extract only styles using\nunlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a CVAE-based method that extracts\nstyle features using only unlabeled data. The proposed model consists of a\ncontrastive learning (CL) part that extracts style-independent features and a\nCVAE part that extracts style features. The CL model learns representations\nindependent of data augmentation, which can be viewed as a perturbation in\nstyles, in a self-supervised manner. Considering the style-independent features\nfrom the pretrained CL model as a condition, the CVAE learns to extract only\nstyles. Additionally, we introduce a constraint based on mutual information\nbetween the CL and VAE features to prevent the CVAE from ignoring the\ncondition. Experiments conducted using two simple datasets, MNIST and an\noriginal dataset based on Google Fonts, demonstrate that the proposed method\ncan efficiently extract style features. Further experiments using real-world\nnatural image datasets were also conducted to illustrate the method's\nextendability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 08:38:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 08:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}
