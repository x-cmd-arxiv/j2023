In this work, we investigate the effect of global core-periphery\nnetwork structure on the speed and quality of cultural innovation. Drawing on\ndiffering notions of core-periphery structure from [arXiv:1808.07801] and\n[doi:10.1016/S0378-8733(99)00019-2], we distinguish decentralized\ncore-periphery, centralized core-periphery, and affinity network structure. We\ngenerate networks of these three classes from stochastic block models (SBMs),\nand use them to run an agent-based model (ABM) of collective cultural\ninnovation, in which agents can only directly interact with their network\nneighbors. In order to discover the highest-scoring innovation, agents must\ndiscover and combine the highest innovations from two completely parallel\ntechnology trees. We find that decentralized core-periphery networks outperform\nthe others by finding the final crossover innovation more quickly on average.\nWe hypothesize that decentralized core-periphery network structure accelerates\ncollective problem-solving by shielding peripheral nodes from the local optima\nknown by the core community at any given time. We then build upon the \"Two\nTruths\" hypothesis regarding community structure in spectral graph embeddings,\nfirst articulated in [arXiv:1808.07801], which suggests that the adjacency\nspectral embedding (ASE) captures core-periphery structure, while the Laplacian\nspectral embedding (LSE) captures affinity. We find that, for core-periphery\nnetworks, ASE-based resampling best recreates networks with similar performance\non the innovation SBM, compared to LSE-based resampling. Since the Two Truths\nhypothesis suggests that ASE captures core-periphery structure, this result\nfurther supports our hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 16:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

Owing to its good\nscalability and interpretability, a Symmetric and Nonnegative Matrix\nFactorization (SNMF) model is commonly used to tackle this issue. However, it\nadopts a unique Latent Factor (LF) matrix for precisely representing an LUN's\nsymmetry, which leads to a reduced LF space that impairs its representational\nlearning ability. Motivated by this discovery, this study proposes a Symmetry\nand Graph-regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SGNMF) method that\nadopts three-fold ideas: a) leveraging multiple LF matrices to represent an\nLUN, thereby enhancing its representation learning ability; b) introducing a\nsymmetry regularization term that implies the equality constraint between its\nmultiple LF matrices, thereby illustrating an LUN's symmetry; and c)\nincorporating graph regularization into its learning objective, thereby\nillustrating an LUN's intrinsic geometry. A theoretical proof is provided to\nensure SGNMF's convergence on an LUN. Extensive experiment results on ten LUNs\nfrom real applications demonstrate that our proposed SGNMF-based community\ndetector significantly outperforms several baseline and state-of-the-art models\nin achieving highly-accurate results for community detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 16:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

Nevertheless, electrical\ninterconnects between driving electronics and the electro-optic components,\nsome of which require cryogenic operating conditions, can introduce parasitic\neffects.

To this end, we employ {\\em continuous model\nselection} on the basis of the notion of {\\em descriptive\ndimensionality}~(Ddim).

In the context of collective\ndecision-making, this axiom is known as strategyproofness and turns out to be\nrather prohibitive, even when allowing for randomization. In particular,\nGibbard's random dictatorship theorem shows that only rather unattractive\nsocial decision schemes (SDSs) satisfy strategyproofness on the full domain of\npreferences. In this paper, we obtain more positive results by investigating\nstrategyproof SDSs on the Condorcet domain, which consists of all preference\nprofiles that admit a Condorcet winner. In more detail, we show that, if the\nnumber of voters $n$ is odd, every strategyproof and non-imposing SDS on the\nCondorcet domain can be represented as a mixture of dictatorial SDSs and the\nCondorcet rule (which chooses the Condorcet winner with probability $1$).\nMoreover, we prove that the Condorcet domain is a maximal connected domain that\nallows for attractive strategyproof SDSs if $n$ is odd as only random\ndictatorships are strategyproof and non-imposing on any sufficiently connected\nsuperset of it. We also derive analogous results for even $n$ by slightly\nextending the Condorcet domain. Finally, we also characterize the set of\ngroup-strategyproof and non-imposing SDSs on the Condorcet domain and its\nsupersets. These characterizations strengthen Gibbard's random dictatorship\ntheorem and establish that the Condorcet domain is essentially a maximal domain\nthat allows for attractive strategyproof SDSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 16:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

Disruptions in electricity\ninfrastructures has a negative impact on every sector of a region, such as\neducation, medical services, financial, recreation. In this study, we introduce\na novel approach to investigate the factors which can be associated with longer\nrestoration time of power service after a hurricane. We consider three types of\nfactors (hazard characteristics, built-environment characteristics, and\nsocio-demographic factors) that might be associated with longer restoration\ntimes of power outages during a hurricane. Considering restoration time as the\ndependent variable and utilizing a comprehensive set of county-level data, we\nhave estimated a Generalized Accelerated Failure Time (GAFT) that accounts for\nspatial dependence among observations for time to event data. Considering\nspatial correlation in time to event data has improved the model fit by 12%.\nUsing GAFT model and Hurricane Irma as a case study, we examined: (1)\ndifferences in electric power outages and restoration rates among different\ntypes of power companies: investor-owned power companies, rural and municipal\ncooperatives; (2) the relationship between the duration of power outage and\npower system variables, and socioeconomic attributes. We have found that\nfactors such as maximum sustained wind speed, percentage of customers facing\npower outage, percentage of customers served by investor-owned power company,\nmedian household income, and number of power plants are strongly associated\nwith restoration time. This paper identifies the key factors in predicting the\nrestoration time of hurricane-induced power outages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 16:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

Most existing deep-learning methods consider a protein as a\n3D image by spatially clustering its atoms into voxels and then feed the\nvoxelized protein into a 3D CNN for prediction. However, the CNN-based methods\nencounter several critical issues: 1) defective in representing irregular\nprotein structures; 2) sensitive to rotations; 3) insufficient to characterize\nthe protein surface; 4) unaware of data distribution shift. To address the\nabove issues, this work proposes EquiPocket, an E(3)-equivariant Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) for binding site prediction. In particular, EquiPocket consists\nof three modules: the first one to extract local geometric information for each\nsurface atom, the second one to model both the chemical and spatial structure\nof the protein, and the last one to capture the geometry of the surface via\nequivariant message passing over the surface atoms.

However, non-stationary bandits lack a formal definition. Loosely\nspeaking, non-stationary bandits have typically been characterized in the\nliterature as those for which the reward distribution changes over time. We\ndemonstrate that this informal definition is ambiguous. Further, a widely-used\nnotion of regret -- the dynamic regret -- is motivated by this ambiguous\ndefinition and thus problematic. In particular, even for an optimal agent,\ndynamic regret can suggest poor performance. The ambiguous definition also\nmotivates a measure of the degree of non-stationarity experienced by a bandit,\nwhich often overestimates and can give rise to extremely loose regret bounds.\nThe primary contribution of this paper is a formal definition that resolves\nambiguity. This definition motivates a new notion of regret, an alternative\nmeasure of the degree of non-stationarity, and a regret analysis that leads to\ntighter bounds for non-stationary bandit learning. The regret analysis applies\nto any bandit, stationary or non-stationary, and any agent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 17:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

Nucleation\nwas determined to be neither homogeneous nor heterogeneous but secondary, and\nthus dependent on the cooling rate and not on the degree of supercooling. It\nwas likely initiated by aerosolized ice particles from the air or from droplets\nthat had already nucleated and broken up.

Notably, this meant that the presence of interfacial rupture at an\nadjacent droplet could influence the crystallization behaviour of another.\nAfter the formation of an initial ice shell around the individual droplets,\ndendritic protrusions grew from the droplet surface, likely seeded by the same\nice particles that caused nucleation, but at a quasi-liquid layer.

First, a clear behavioral understanding is lacking as to\nthe perceived concern about AV safety and the consequent effect on AV\nacceptance behavior. Second, how people appraise the benefits of enhanced\nautomated mobility to meet their current (pre-AV era) travel behavior and\nneeds, along with the resulting impacts on AV acceptance and perceived safety\nconcern, remain equivocal.

The majority of the experiments thus far have\nfocused on the CDW states in AV3Sb5 and FeGe, characterized by the 2a0 by 2a0\nperiod. Recently, a bulk CDW phase (T* ~ 92 K) with a different wave length and\norientation has been reported in ScV6Sn6, as the first realization of a CDW\nstate in the broad RM6X6 structure. Here, using a combination of scanning\ntunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy, we reveal the microscopic structure and the spectroscopic\nsignatures of this charge ordering phase in ScV6Sn6. Differential conductance\ndI/dV spectra show a partial gap opening in the density-of-states of about 20\nmeV at the Fermi level. This is much smaller than the spectral gaps observed in\nAV3Sb5 and FeGe despite the comparable T* temperatures in these systems,\nsuggesting substantially weaker coupling strength in ScV6Sn6. Surprisingly,\ndespite the three-dimensional bulk nature of the charge order, we find that the\ncharge modulation is only observed on the kagome termination.\nTemperature-dependent band structure evolution suggests a modulation of the\nsurface states as a consequence of the emergent charge order, with an abrupt\nspectral weight shift below T* consistent with the first-order phase\ntransition. The similarity of the electronic band structures of ScV6Sn6 and\nTbV6Sn6 (where charge ordering is absent), together with the first-principle\ncalculations, suggests that charge ordering in ScV6Sn6 may not be primarily\nelectronically driven. Interestingly, in contrast to the CDW state of cousin\nAV3Sb5, we find no evidence supporting rotation symmetry breaking.

It provides a number of\nadvantages over the extremes of full-teleoperation and full-autonomy in many\nsettings. Traditional approaches to shared autonomy rely on knowledge of the\nenvironment dynamics, a discrete space of user goals that is known a priori, or\nknowledge of the user's policy -- assumptions that are unrealistic in many\ndomains. Recent works relax some of these assumptions by formulating shared\nautonomy with model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, they\nno longer need knowledge of the goal space (e.g., that the goals are discrete\nor constrained) or environment dynamics. However, they need knowledge of a\ntask-specific reward function to train the policy. Unfortunately, such reward\nspecification can be a difficult and brittle process. On top of that, the\nformulations inherently rely on human-in-the-loop training, and that\nnecessitates them to prepare a policy that mimics users' behavior. In this\npaper, we present a new approach to shared autonomy that employs a modulation\nof the forward and reverse diffusion process of diffusion models. Our approach\ndoes not assume known environment dynamics or the space of user goals, and in\ncontrast to previous work, it does not require any reward feedback, nor does it\nrequire access to the user's policy during training. Instead, our framework\nlearns a distribution over a space of desired behaviors. It then employs a\ndiffusion model to translate the user's actions to a sample from this\ndistribution. Crucially, we show that it is possible to carry out this process\nin a manner that preserves the user's control authority.

Our framework adopts a two-stage design where we\nstart from a sparse set of visible and occupied voxel queries from depth\nestimation, followed by a densification stage that generates dense 3D voxels\nfrom the sparse ones. A key idea of this design is that the visual features on\n2D images correspond only to the visible scene structures rather than the\noccluded or empty spaces. Therefore, starting with the featurization and\nprediction of the visible structures is more reliable. Once we obtain the set\nof sparse queries, we apply a masked autoencoder design to propagate the\ninformation to all the voxels by self-attention. Experiments on SemanticKITTI\nshow that VoxFormer outperforms the state of the art with a relative\nimprovement of 20.0% in geometry and 18.1% in semantics and reduces GPU memory\nduring training to less than 16GB. Our code is available on\nhttps://github.com/NVlabs/VoxFormer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 18:59:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 07:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

One significant but sometimes misunderstood\ncomponent of the covariance is the so-called super-sample covariance (SSC). The\nSSC is regularly defined as the covariance part capturing all impact of modes\noutside of a survey area. However, we show here that this intuition is\nincorrect for real-space statistics. We derive the covariance of second-order\nshear statistics from first principles. For this, we use an estimator in real\nspace without relying on an estimator for the power spectrum. All parts of the\ncovariance, not only the SSC, depend on the power- and trispectrum at all\nmodes, including those larger than the survey. The defining feature of the SSC\nis not its dependence on ``super-survey modes'' but its behaviour under the\n`large-field approximation', i.e., the limiting case of a very large survey\narea. While the non-SSC parts of the covariance scale with the inverse survey\narea in this limit, the SSC completely vanishes. We also show that it is\ngenerally impossible to transform an estimate for the power spectrum covariance\nto the covariance of a real-space statistic. Such a transformation is only\npossible in the limiting case of the `large-field approximation'. Additionally,\nwe find that the total covariance of a real-space statistic can be completely\nestimated using correlation functions measured only inside the survey area.\nConsequently, estimating covariances of real-space statistics, in principle,\ndoes not require information outside the survey boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 19:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

Total variation distance is the information-theoretically strongest\npossible notion of distance in our setting and our recovery guarantees in this\ndistance are optimal up to the absolute constant factor multiplying $\\epsilon$.\nIn particular, if the columns of $A$ are normalized to be unit length, our\ntotal variation distance guarantee implies a bound on the sum of the $\\ell_2$\ndistances between the column vectors of $A$ and $A'$, $\\sum_{i =1}^d\n\\|a_i-\\hat{a}_i\\|_2 = O(\\epsilon)$. In contrast, the strongest known prior\nresults only yield a $\\epsilon^{O(1)}$ (relative) bound on the distance between\nindividual $a_i$'s and their estimates and translate into an $O(d\\epsilon)$\nbound on the total variation distance. Our key innovation is a new approach to\nICA (even to outlier-free ICA) that circumvents the difficulties in the\nclassical method of moments and instead relies on a new geometric certificate\nof correctness of an affine transformation. Our algorithm is based on a new\nmethod that iteratively improves an estimate of the unknown affine\ntransformation whenever the requirements of the certificate are not met.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 19:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

One of the classical solution methods in NRO is an outer\napproximation method that iteratively solves a sample-based nonlinear problem\nand updates the sample set by solving an auxiliary problem subject to the\nuncertainty set. Although it guarantees convergence under certain assumptions,\nits solution iterates are generally infeasible in the original NRO problem, and\nit provides only a lower bound on the optimal objective value. We propose a new\nalgorithm for a class of NRO problems that generates feasible solution iterates\nand provides both lower and upper bounds to the optimal objective value.

In this paper, simple\nestimates are employed to extend the scaling of the confinement time into the\nrelativistic regime. By asymptotically matching this scaling to known solutions\nin the non-relativistic limit, accurate forms for the confinement time (and\nthus the the ambipolar potential) are obtained. These forms are verified using\nfinite-element-based Fokker-Planck simulations over a wide range of parameters.\nComparing relativistic and nonrelativistic mirror-confined plasmas with the\nsame ratio of confining potential $|e\\phi|$ to electron temperature $T_e$ and\nthe same mirror ratio $R$, the net result is a decrease in the confinement time\ndue to relativistic effects by a factor of $S \\equiv\n(1+15T_e/8m_ec^2)/(1+2|e\\phi|/m_ec^2)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 21:32:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 20:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

To date, automated heterophilic\ngraph learning with NAS is still a research blank to be filled in.

Although adversarial\ntraining (AT) is currently one of the most effective methodologies to robustify\nDNNs, it is computationally very expensive (e.g., 5-10X costlier than standard\ntraining). To address this challenge, existing approaches focus on single-step\nAT, referred to as Fast AT, reducing the overhead of adversarial example\ngeneration.

Although there exist Hamiltonians introduced for\nquasi-incompressible elastodynamics based on different variational\nformulations, the one in the fully incompressible regime has yet been\nidentified in the literature. The adopted mixed formulation naturally provides\na new Hamiltonian for fully incompressible elastodynamics. Invoking the\ndiscrete gradient formula, we are able to design fully-discrete schemes that\npreserve the Hamiltonian and momenta. The scaled mid-point formula, another\npopular option for constructing algorithmic stresses, is analyzed and\ndemonstrated to be non-robust numerically. The generalized Taylor-Hood element\nbased on the spline technology conveniently provides a higher-order, robust,\nand inf-sup stable spatial discretization option for finite strain analysis. To\nenhance the element performance in volume conservation, the grad-div\nstabilization, a technique initially developed in computational fluid dynamics,\nis introduced here for elastodynamics.

One of the factors driving this widespread phenomenon is the\nability of the parasites to remain dormant in the liver. Known as hypnozoites,\nthey reside in the liver following an initial exposure, before activating later\nto cause further infections, referred to as relapses. As around 79-96$\\%$ of\ninfections are attributed to relapses, we expect it will be highly impactful to\napply treatment to target the hypnozoite reservoir to eliminate \\textit{P.\nvivax}. Treatment with a radical cure to target the hypnozoite reservoir is a\npotential tool to control or eliminate \\textit{P. vivax}. We have developed a\nmultiscale mathematical model as a system of integro-differential equations\nthat captures the complex dynamics of \\textit{P. vivax} hypnozoites and the\neffect of hypnozoite relapse on disease transmission. Here, we use our model to\nstudy the anticipated effect of radical cure treatment administered via a mass\ndrug administration (MDA) program. We implement multiple rounds of MDA with a\nfixed interval between rounds, starting from different steady-state disease\nprevalences. We then construct an optimisation model to obtain the optimal MDA\ninterval. We also incorporate mosquito seasonality in our model to study its\neffect on the optimal treatment regime. We find that the effect of MDA\ninterventions is temporary and depends on the pre-intervention disease\nprevalence (and choice of model parameters) as well as the number of MDA rounds\nunder consideration. We find radical cure alone may not be enough to lead to\n\\textit{P. vivax} elimination under our mathematical model (and choice of model\nparameters) since the prevalence of infection eventually returns to pre-MDA\nlevels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 00:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

However, their\nobservational features are diverse, with a few extremely peculiar features\nwhose origins have not been clarified; strong and persisting C II lines,\nlate-time accelerated luminosity decline and red spectra, and a sub-day\ntime-scale initial flash clearly identified so far at least for three\nover-luminous SNe Ia.

The scenario thus can explain some of the key diverse observational\nproperties by a different amount of the envelope, but additional factors are\nalso required; we argue that the envelope is distributed in a disc-like\nstructure, and also the ejecta properties, e.g., the mass of the WD, plays a\nkey role.

In early decision support systems, we assumed\nthat we could give people recommendations and that they would consider them,\nand then follow them when required. However, research found that people often\nignore recommendations because they do not trust them; or perhaps even worse,\npeople follow them blindly, even when the recommendations are wrong.\nExplainable artificial intelligence mitigates this by helping people to\nunderstand how and why models give certain recommendations. However, recent\nresearch shows that people do not always engage with explainability tools\nenough to help improve decision making. The assumption that people will engage\nwith recommendations and explanations has proven to be unfounded. We argue this\nis because we have failed to account for two things. First, recommendations\n(and their explanations) take control from human decision makers, limiting\ntheir agency. Second, giving recommendations and explanations does not align\nwith the cognitive processes employed by people making decisions. This position\npaper proposes a new conceptual framework called Evaluative AI for explainable\ndecision support. This is a machine-in-the-loop paradigm in which decision\nsupport tools provide evidence for and against decisions made by people, rather\nthan provide recommendations to accept or reject.

However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is\noften a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the\nreal world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model\nperformance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch\nsizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite\ncommon in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find\nthat the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability.\nConversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie,\ngroup or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms\ndoes not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into\nthe failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients\nmay disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie,\nassigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse\nissue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method,\ncalled SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial\nnoisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat\nminimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising\nresults demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is\ncomputationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 02:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

This paper\npresents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art ML techniques used in\nmalware detection, including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep\nlearning, and reinforcement learning. We also examine the challenges and\nlimitations of ML-based malware detection, such as the potential for\nadversarial attacks and the need for large amounts of labeled data.\nFurthermore, we discuss future directions in ML-based malware detection,\nincluding the integration of multiple ML algorithms and the use of explainable\nAI techniques to enhance the interpret ability of ML-based detection systems.\nOur research highlights the potential of ML-based techniques to improve the\nspeed and accuracy of malware detection, and contribute to enhancing\ncybersecurity\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 02:42:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 20:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

The Side-Scan Sonar (SSS) is a widely used imaging sensor in\nthis regard. It produces high-resolution seafloor maps by logging the\nintensities of sound waves reflected back from the seafloor. In this work, we\nleverage these acoustic intensity maps to produce pixel-wise categorization of\ndifferent seafloor types. We propose a novel architecture adapted from the\nVision Transformer (ViT) in an encoder-decoder framework. Further, in doing so,\nthe applicability of ViTs is evaluated on smaller datasets. To overcome the\nlack of CNN-like inductive biases, thereby making ViTs more conducive to\napplications in low data regimes, we propose a novel feature extraction module\nto replace the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) block within transformer layers and\na novel module to extract multiscale patch embeddings. A lightweight decoder is\nalso proposed to complement this design in order to further boost multiscale\nfeature extraction.

The previous works\nusually extract the emotion-cause pairs from two perspectives of emotion and\ncause. However, emotion extraction is more crucial to the ECPE task than cause\nextraction. Motivated by this analysis, we propose an end-to-end emotion-cause\nextraction approach oriented toward emotion prediction (EPO-ECPE), aiming to\nfully exploit the potential of emotion prediction to enhance emotion-cause pair\nextraction. Considering the strong dependence between emotion prediction and\nemotion-cause pair extraction, we propose a synchronization mechanism to share\ntheir improvement in the training process. That is, the improvement of emotion\nprediction can facilitate the emotion-cause pair extraction, and then the\nresults of emotion-cause pair extraction can also be used to improve the\naccuracy of emotion prediction simultaneously. For the emotion-cause pair\nextraction, we divide it into genuine pair supervision and fake pair\nsupervision, where the genuine pair supervision learns from the pairs with more\npossibility to be emotion-cause pairs. In contrast, fake pair supervision\nlearns from other pairs. In this way, the emotion-cause pairs can be extracted\ndirectly from the genuine pair, thereby reducing the difficulty of extraction.\nExperimental results show that our approach outperforms the 13 compared systems\nand achieves new state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 02:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

Because of the geometric dilution of the\ntorus, the MIR response to optical continuum variations has suppressed\nvariability with respect to the optical that depends on the geometry (e.g.,\nsize, orientation, opening angle) of the torus. More extended tori have steeper\nMIR SFs with respect to the optical SFs. We demonstrate the feasibility of this\nSF approach using simulated AGN light curves and a geometric torus model. While\nit is difficult to use SFs to constrain the orientation and opening angle due\nto insensitivity of the SF on these parameters, the size of the torus can be\nwell determined. Applying this method to the ensemble SFs measured for 587 SDSS\nquasars, we measure a torus $R-L$ relation of ${\\rm log}\\,R_{\\rm eff}\\, {(\\rm\npc)} = 0.51_{-0.04}^{+0.04} \\times {\\rm log}\\,(L_{\\rm bol}/10^{46}\\,\\rm\nerg\\,s^{-1}) -0.38_{-0.01}^{+0.01}$ in the WISE $W1$ band, and sizes $\\sim1.4$\ntimes larger in the $W2$ band, which are in good agreement with dust\nreverberation mapping measurements. Compared with the reverberation mapping\ntechnique, the SF method is much less demanding in data quality and can be\napplied to any optical+MIR light curves for which a lag measurement may not be\npossible, as long as the variability process and torus structure are\nstationary. While this SF method does not extract all information contained in\nthe light curves (i.e., the transfer function), it provides an intuitive\ninterpretation for the observed trends of AGN MIR SFs compared with optical\nSFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 03:55:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 22:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

Another challenge is discovering SHSs across different\ntypes of networks for which the traditional one-model-fit-all approach fails to\ncapture the inter-graph difference, particularly in the case of diverse\nnetworks.

One of the reasons is that the\nlearned representations (i.e. features) from the imbalanced datasets are less\neffective than those from balanced datasets. Specifically, the learned\nrepresentation under class-balanced distribution will present the Neural\nCollapse (NC) phenomena. NC indicates the features from the same category are\nclose to each other and from different categories are maximally distant,\nshowing an optimal linear separable state of classification. However, the\npattern differs on imbalanced datasets and is partially responsible for the\nreduced performance of the model. In this work, we propose two explicit feature\nregularization terms to learn high-quality representation for class-imbalanced\ndata.

For a general symmetry group, such as SU(d), the locality of\ninteractions imposes different types of constraints on the realizable\nunitaries. For instance, the unitary realized in a subspace with one\nirreducible representation (charge) of the symmetry dictates the realized\nunitaries in multiple other sectors with inequivalent representations of the\nsymmetry.

Since different patients may respond differently to the\nsame dosage of medication, the therapeutic dose interval needs to be\npersonalized based on each patient's unique characteristics. However, this\nproblem is challenging as it requires jointly learning the lower and upper\nbound functions for personalized dose intervals.

This paper empirically suggests a\nsurprisingly simple answer: linearly - by straightforward model weight\narithmetic! We start by drawing several key observations: (1)assuming that we\ntrain the same model architecture on both a clean dataset and its corrupted\nversion, resultant weights mostly differ in shallow layers; (2)the weight\ndifference after projection, which we call \"Robust Weight Signature\" (RWS),\nappears to be discriminative and indicative of different corruption types;\n(3)for the same corruption type, the RWSs obtained by one model architecture\nare highly consistent and transferable across different datasets.\n  We propose a minimalistic model robustness \"patching\" framework that carries\na model trained on clean data together with its pre-extracted RWSs. In this\nway, injecting certain robustness to the model is reduced to directly adding\nthe corresponding RWS to its weight. We verify our proposed framework to be\nremarkably (1)lightweight. since RWSs concentrate on the shallowest few layers\nand we further show they can be painlessly quantized, storing an RWS is up to\n13 x more compact than storing the full weight copy; (2)in-situ adjustable.\nRWSs can be appended as needed and later taken off to restore the intact clean\nmodel.

Using this, we derive\nclosed-form expressions for the optimal choice of the censor threshold which\nmaximizes the throughput while achieving zero PLR among uncensored users.\nThrough extensive numerical simulations, we show that C-IRSA can achieve a\n4$\\times$ improvement in the peak throughput compared to conventional IRSA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 07:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

A large-eddy simulation (LES) was performed\nfor a leading-edge separation flow around a NACA0015 airfoil at the chord\nReynolds number of $63,000$ and the angle of attack of $12^\\circ$. The present\nLES resolves a turbulent structure inside a deforming SJ cavity by a\nsixth-order compact difference scheme with a deforming grid. An optimal\nactuation-frequency band is identified between $F^+=6.0$ and $20$ (normalised\nby the chord length and the freestream velocity), which suppresses the\nseparation and drastically improves the lift-to-drag ratio. It was found that\nin the controlled flows, the laminar separation bubble near the leading edge\nperiodically releases multiple spanwise-uniform vortex structures, which\ndiffuse and merge to generate a single coherent vortex in the period of $F^+$.\nSuch a coherent vortex plays a significant role in exchanging a chordwise\nmomentum between a near-wall surface and the freestream away from the wall.

Linear\nstability theory (LST) was subsequently compared with the LES result, which\nclarifies the limitations and applicability of the LST to controlled flows with\nthe present SJ condition. It is also revealed that in the optimal $F^+$ regime,\nboth linear and nonlinear modes are excited in a well-balanced manner, where\nthe first mode is associated with the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and\ncontributes to a quick and smooth turbulent transition, while the second mode\nshows a frequency lower than that of the linear mode and encourages a formation\nof the coherent vortex structure that eventually entrains smaller turbulent\nvortices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 07:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

Aims. The analysis of these light variations can be\nused to derive the mass and radius of the companion and hence determine its\nnature.

Analyzing the dynamics of these electromechanical systems\nrequires precise modeling tools that properly consider the coupling between the\npiezoelectric elements and the host structure. This paper presents a\nmethodology for separately shunted piezoelectric patches for achieving higher\nperformance on vibration attenuation. The Rayleigh-Ritz method is used for\nperforming the modal analysis and obtaining the frequency response functions of\nthe electro-mechanical system. The effectiveness of the method is investigated\nfor a broader range of frequencies, and it was shown that separately shunted\npiezoelectric patches are more effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 09:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

When stars explode as SNe,\nthe light-curve luminosity is typically sustained by a central engine\n(radioactive decay, magnetar spin-down, or fallback accretion). However, since\nmassive stars eject considerable amounts of material during their evolution,\nthere may be a significant contribution coming from interactions with the\npreviously ejected circumstellar medium (CSM). Reconstructing the progenitor\nconfiguration at the time of explosion requires a detailed analysis of the\nlong-term photometric and spectroscopic evolution of the related transient. In\nthis paper, we present the results of our follow-up campaign of SN 2020faa.\nGiven the high luminosity and peculiar slow light curve, it is purported to\nhave a massive progenitor. We present the spectro-photometric dataset and\ninvestigate different options to explain the unusual observed properties that\nsupport this assumption. We computed the bolometric luminosity of the supernova\nand the evolution of its temperature, radius, and expansion velocity.

Following this\nline of thinking, one can come to the Schrodinger equation for matter fields in\ncurved spacetime with quantum-gravitational corrections. In the present paper,\nwe study the semiclassical limit in the case of a closed isotropic model with a\nscalar field decomposed into modes. We analyse calculations made within\nframeworks of three approaches. The first approach was proposed by Kiefer and\nSingh. Since the Wheeler - DeWitt equation does not contain a time derivative,\nit is constructed by means of a special mathematical procedure, time variable\nbeing a parameter along a classical trajectory of gravitational field. The\nsecond method was suggested in the paper of Maniccia and Montani who introduced\nthe Kuchar - Torre reference fluid as an origin of time. And the third is the\nextended phase space approach to quantization of gravity. In this approach, the\ntemporal Schrodinger equation is argued to be more fundamental than the Wheeler\n- DeWitt equation, and there is no problem of time. The origin of time is\nfixing of a reference frame of some observer, who can register macroscopic\nconsequences of quantum gravitational phenomena in the Very Early Universe. To\ngo to the semiclassical limit, the Born - Oppenheimer approximation for gravity\nis used. In each of the approaches, in the order ${\\cal O}(1/M)$, a temporal\nSchrodinger equation for matter fields in curved spacetime with quantum\ngravitational corrections is obtained.

Because some of them are very\nactive stars, they are often subject to frequent and powerful flaring, which\ncan be a double-edged sword in regard of exoplanet habitability. On one hand,\nthe increased flux during flare events can trigger the chemical reactions that\nare necessary to build the basis of prebiotic chemistry. On the other hand,\nsufficiently strong flares may erode exoplanets' atmospheres and reduce their\nUV protection. Recent observations of flares have shown that the flaring flux\ncan be x100 times stronger in UV than in the optical. UV is also preferable to\nconstrain more accurately both the prebiotic abiogenesis and the atmospheric\nerosion. For these reasons, we are developing a CubeSat payload concept to\ncomplement current flare surveys operating in the optical. This CubeSat will\nobserve a high number of flaring M dwarfs, following an all-sky scanning law\ncoverage, both in the UV and the optical to better understand the different\neffective temperatures as wavelengths and flaring status go. This will\ncomplement the bright optical flares data acquired from the current\nground-based, high-cadence, wide FoV surveys.

In recent years,\nCNN-based segmentation methods have been extensively investigated. However,\nthese methods often give inaccurate segmentation results, such as\nover-segmentation and under-segmentation. Therefore, to address such issues, we\npropose a post-processing method based on a graph convolutional neural network\n(GCN) to refine inaccurate segmentation parts and improve the overall\nsegmentation accuracy. Firstly, nnUNet is used as an initial segmentation\nframework, and the uncertainty in the segmentation results is analyzed.\nCertainty and uncertainty nodes establish the nodes of a graph neural network.\nEach node and its 6 neighbors form an edge, and 32 nodes are randomly selected\nfor uncertain nodes to form edges.

Unfortunately, sharing data can be\nobstructed by the risk of violating data privacy, impeding research in fields\nlike healthcare. Synthetic data is a potential solution. It aims to generate\ndata that has the same distribution as the original data, but that does not\ndisclose information about individuals. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are\na common privacy attack, in which the attacker attempts to determine whether a\nparticular real sample was used for training of the model. Previous works that\npropose MIAs against generative models either display low performance -- giving\nthe false impression that data is highly private -- or need to assume access to\ninternal generative model parameters -- a relatively low-risk scenario, as the\ndata publisher often only releases synthetic data, not the model. In this work\nwe argue for a realistic MIA setting that assumes the attacker has some\nknowledge of the underlying data distribution. We propose DOMIAS, a\ndensity-based MIA model that aims to infer membership by targeting local\noverfitting of the generative model. Experimentally we show that DOMIAS is\nsignificantly more successful at MIA than previous work, especially at\nattacking uncommon samples. The latter is disconcerting since these samples may\ncorrespond to underrepresented groups. We also demonstrate how DOMIAS' MIA\nperformance score provides an interpretable metric for privacy, giving data\npublishers a new tool for achieving the desired privacy-utility trade-off in\ntheir synthetic data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 11:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

The prediction of\nductile solid materials which exhibit dominant plastic deformation is an\nintriguingly challenging task and plays an extremely important role in various\nengineering applications. Here, we rely on the phase-field approach to fracture\nwhich is a widely adopted framework for modeling and computing the fracture\nfailure phenomena in solids. The first objective is to optimize the topology of\nthe structure in order to minimize its mass, while accounting for structural\ndamage. To do so, the topological phase transition function (between solid and\nvoid phases) is introduced, thus resulting in an extension of all the governing\nequations. Our second objective is to additionally enhance the fracture\nresistance of the structure. Accordingly, two different formulations are\nproposed. One requires only the residual force vector of the deformation field\nas a constraint, while in the second formulation, the residual force vector of\nthe deformation and phase-field fracture simultaneously have been imposed. An\nincremental minimization principles for a class of gradient-type dissipative\nmaterials are used to derive the governing equations. Here, the level-set-based\ntopology optimization is employed to seek an optimal layout with smooth and\nclear boundaries. Sensitivities are derived using the analytical gradient-based\nadjoint method to update the level-set surface for both formulations. Here, the\nevolution of the level-set surface is realized by the reaction-diffusion\nequation to maximize the strain energy of the structure while a certain volume\nof design domain is prescribed. Several three-dimensional numerical examples\nare presented to substantiate our algorithmic developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 11:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

In this work, high quality factor optical cavities\nin hyperuniform disordered architectures are fabricated through semiconductor\nslabs and experimentally addressed by scanning near-field optical microscopy.\nThe wide range of confined cavity modes that we detect arise from carefully\ndesigned local modifications of the dielectric structure. Previous works on\nhyperuniform disordered photonic systems have previously identified several\nAnderson localized states spectrally located at the PBG edges with relatively\nhigh quality factors. In this work, by engineering the structural parameters of\nthe cavity, we achieve an experimental quality factor of order 6000 (higher\nthan the one of the Anderson states) and we demonstrate that three types of\nlocalized modes of different nature coexist within a small area and in a\nrelatively narrow spectral window of the disordered correlated system. Their\ncompatibility with general boundary constraints, in contrast with ordered\narchitectures that suffer strict layout constraints imposed by photonic\ncrystals' axes orientation, makes optical cavities in disordered hyperuniform\npatterns a flexible optical insulator platform for planar optical circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 12:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

However, the\nassessment of multiple damage grades is challenging due to the variety in\ndamage patterns and limited transferability of existing methods to other\ngeographic regions or data sources. We present a novel approach to\nautomatically assess multi-class building damage from real-world multi-temporal\npoint clouds using a machine learning model trained on virtual laser scanning\n(VLS) data. We (1) identify object-specific change features, (2) separate\nchanged and unchanged building parts, (3) train a random forest machine\nlearning model with VLS data based on object-specific change features, and (4)\nuse the classifier to assess building damage in real-world point clouds from\nphotogrammetry-based dense image matching (DIM). We evaluate classifiers\ntrained on different input data with respect to their capacity to classify\nthree damage grades (heavy, extreme, destruction) in pre- and post-event DIM\npoint clouds of a real earthquake event. Our approach is transferable with\nrespect to multi-source input point clouds used for training (VLS) and\napplication (DIM) of the model. We further achieve geographic transferability\nof the model by training it on simulated data of geometric change which\ncharacterises relevant damage grades across different geographic regions. The\nmodel yields high multi-target classification accuracies (overall accuracy:\n92.0% - 95.1%). Its performance improves only slightly when using real-world\nregion-specific training data (< 3% higher overall accuracies) and when using\nreal-world region-specific training data (< 2% higher overall accuracies). We\nconsider our approach relevant for applications where timely information on the\ndamage situation is required and sufficient real-world training data is not\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 12:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

One of the key problems to handle GEPs is that the memory usage and\ncomputational complexity explode as the system of interest grows. This paper\naims at extending sequential quantum optimizers for GEPs. Sequential quantum\noptimizers are a family of algorithms that iteratively solve the analytical\noptimization of single-qubit gates in a coordinate descent manner.

The correctness of the parameters of\neach stream included in the SD was checked by comparing them with the values\ngiven in the source publications. We developed a set of criteria for nominating\nshowers to be established. We objectified rules for the temporary and permanent\nremoval of meteor showers from the Working list. Both of our proposed new\nprocedures were approved by a vote of the commission F1 of the IAU in July\n2022. We verified more than $1350$ data records of the MDC SD and introduced\n$\\sim$1700 corrections. We included new parameters for shower characterisation.\nAs a result of our verification procedure, 117 showers have been moved to the\nList of removed showers. As of October 2022, the SD contains 923 showers, 110\nof which are in the List of established Showers and 813 are in the Working\nlist. We also improved the user area of the SD and added a simple tool to allow\na quick check of the similarity of a new shower to those in the database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 12:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

However, from a\ncellular service provider's point of view, a concern with the use of an IRS is\nits effect on out-of-band (OOB) quality of service. Specifically, if there are\ntwo operators, say X and Y, providing services in a given geographical area\nusing non-overlapping frequency bands, and if operator X uses an IRS to\noptimally enhance the throughput of it's users, does the IRS degrade the\nperformance of operator Y? We study this scenario by analyzing the ergodic\nsum-rates achieved by both the operators under round-robin scheduling. We also\nderive the complementary cumulative distribution function of the change in the\neffective channel gain at an OOB user with and without the IRS, which provides\ndeeper insights into the effect of the IRS on the overall channel quality.\nSurprisingly, we find that even though the IRS is randomly configured from\noperator Y's point of view, the OOB operator still benefits from the presence\nof the IRS, witnessing a performance enhancement for free. This happens because\nthe IRS introduces additional paths between the transmitter and receiver,\nincreasing the overall signal power arriving at the receiver and providing\ndiversity benefits. We verify our findings via numerical simulations, and\nconclude that an IRS is always beneficial to every operator, even when the IRS\nis deployed to optimally serve only one operator in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 13:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

This is to be contrasted with the single model returned by\npenalised regression procedures, effective for prediction but potentially\nmisleading for subject-matter understanding. The proposed construction of such\nsets relied on preliminary reduction of the full set of variables, and while\nvarious possibilities could be considered for this, [9] proposed a succession\nof regression fits based on incomplete block designs. The purpose of the\npresent paper is to provide insight on both aspects of that work. For an\nunspecified reduction strategy, we begin by characterising models that are\nlikely to be retained in the model confidence set, emphasising geometric\naspects. We then evaluate possible reduction schemes based on penalised\nregression or marginal screening, before theoretically elucidating the\nreduction of [9]. We identify features of the covariate matrix that may reduce\nits efficacy, and indicate improvements to the original proposal.

The weak observed X-ray emission is instead produced mainly\nby scattering of the intrinsic radiation from highly ionised gas surrounding\nthe source, the ADC. However, the origin of this scattering material is still\nunder debate. We use the ADC source 2S 0921-630 (V395 Car) to test whether it\nis consistent with a thermal-radiative wind produced by the central X-ray\nsource illuminating and puffing up the outer disc. This wind is clearly visible\nin blueshifted absorption lines in less highly inclined systems, where the\nsource is seen directly through this material. Using the phenomenological\nphotoionised plasma model, we first characterise the parameter that drives\nemission lines observed in 2S0921 in XMM-Newton and Chandra data. Following\nthis, we run the Monte Carlo radiation transfer simulation to get\nscattered/reprocessed emissions in the wind, with the density and velocity\nstructure obtained from the previous work. Our model agrees with all the wind\nemission lines in the Chandra high and medium energy grating spectra for an\nintrinsic source luminosity of L > 0.2 LEdd.

This has made the large-scale electrification\nof ride-sourcing operations a practical viability, providing an opportunity for\na leap toward urban sustainability goals. Despite having a similar driving\nrange to fossil-fuel vehicles, EVs are disadvantaged by their long charging\ntimes which compromises the total fleet service time. To efficiently manage an\nEV fleet, the operator needs to address the charge scheduling problem as part\nof the dispatch strategy. This paper introduces a probabilistic matching method\nwhich evaluates the optimal trip and charging decisions for a fully electrified\ne-hailing fleet, with the goal of maximising the operator's expected market\nprofit. In the midst of the technological transition towards autonomous\nvehicles, it is also critical to include stochastic driver behaviours in\ntransport models as presented in this paper. Since drivers may either comply\nwith trip dispatching or choose to reject a charging trip order considering the\nadditional fees, contrary to the commonly assumed fleet autonomy, the proposed\nmethod designs an incentivisation scheme (charging discounts) to encourage\ndriver compliance so that the planned charging trips and the associated profit\ncan be realised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 14:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

Deep learning-based models have achieved superior\nperformance but centralized training with data centralization suffers from the\nprivacy leakage problem. Federated learning (FL) can safeguard privacy by\nkeeping training samples locally, but existing FL-based frameworks require a\nlarge number of well-annotated training samples and numerous rounds of\ncommunication which hinder their practicability in the real-world clinical\nscenario. In this paper, we propose a universal and lightweight federated\nlearning framework, named Federated Deep-Broad Learning (FedDBL), to achieve\nsuperior classification performance with limited training samples and only\none-round communication. By simply associating a pre-trained deep learning\nfeature extractor, a fast and lightweight broad learning inference system and a\nclassical federated aggregation approach, FedDBL can dramatically reduce data\ndependency and improve communication efficiency. Five-fold cross-validation\ndemonstrates that FedDBL greatly outperforms the competitors with only\none-round communication and limited training samples, while it even achieves\ncomparable performance with the ones under multiple-round communications.\nFurthermore, due to the lightweight design and one-round communication, FedDBL\nreduces the communication burden from 4.6GB to only 276.5KB per client using\nthe ResNet-50 backbone at 50-round training.

One such popular mechanism is based on actual causality, and it\nassigns (causal) responsibility based on the actions that were found to be\npivotal for the considered outcome. However, the inherent problem of\npinpointing actual causes and consequently determining the exact responsibility\nassignment has shown to be computationally intractable.

Despite\nits prevalence in use for reducing statistical uncertainty, such averaging\ntechniques so far remain comparatively undeveloped for application to light.

The problem can be approached by looking at different protected\nattributes (e.g., ethnicity, gender, etc) independently, but fairness for\nindividual protected attributes does not imply intersectional fairness. In this\nwork, we frame the problem of intersectional fairness within a geometrical\nsetting. We project our data onto a hypercube, and split the analysis of\nfairness by levels, where each level encodes the number of protected attributes\nwe are intersecting over. We prove mathematically that, while fairness does not\npropagate \"down\" the levels, it does propagate \"up\" the levels. This means that\nensuring fairness for all subgroups at the lowest intersectional level (e.g.,\nblack women, white women, black men and white men), will necessarily result in\nfairness for all the above levels, including each of the protected attributes\n(e.g., ethnicity and gender) taken independently. We also derive a formula\ndescribing the variance of the set of estimated success rates on each level,\nunder the assumption of perfect fairness. Using this theoretical finding as a\nbenchmark, we define a family of metrics which capture overall intersectional\nbias. Finally, we propose that fairness can be metaphorically thought of as a\n\"fractal\" problem. In fractals, patterns at the smallest scale repeat at a\nlarger scale. We see from this example that tackling the problem at the lowest\npossible level, in a bottom-up manner, leads to the natural emergence of fair\nAI.

For Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents, they answer \"Why\nnot?\" or \"What if?\" questions by illustrating what minimal change to a state is\nneeded such that an agent chooses a different action. Generating counterfactual\nexplanations for RL agents with visual input is especially challenging because\nof their large state spaces and because their decisions are part of an\noverarching policy, which includes long-term decision-making. However, research\nfocusing on counterfactual explanations, specifically for RL agents with visual\ninput, is scarce and does not go beyond identifying defective agents. It is\nunclear whether counterfactual explanations are still helpful for more complex\ntasks like analyzing the learned strategies of different agents or choosing a\nfitting agent for a specific task. We propose a novel but simple method to\ngenerate counterfactual explanations for RL agents by formulating the problem\nas a domain transfer problem which allows the use of adversarial learning\ntechniques like StarGAN.

BPINNs are a popular framework for data assimilation,\ncombining the constraints of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Partial\nDifferential Equation (PDE). The relative weights of the BPINN target\ndistribution terms are directly related to the inherent uncertainty in the\nrespective learning tasks. Yet, they are usually manually set a-priori, that\ncan lead to pathological behavior, stability concerns, and to conflicts between\ntasks which are obstacles that have deterred the use of BPINNs for inverse\nproblems with multi-scale dynamics. The present weighting strategy\nautomatically tunes the weights by considering the multi-task nature of target\nposterior distribution. We show that this remedies the failure modes of BPINNs\nand provides efficient exploration of the optimal Pareto front. This leads to\nbetter convergence and stability of BPINN training while reducing sampling\nbias.

Magnetohydrodynamic models have been successful in exploring the\ndependence of this \"wind-braking torque\" on various stellar properties, however\nthe influence of surface differential rotation is largely unexplored. As the\nwind-braking torque depends on the rotation rate of the escaping wind, the\ninclusion of differential rotation should effectively modulate the angular\nmomentum-loss rate based on the latitudinal variation of wind source regions.\nIn order to quantify the influence of surface differential rotation on the\nangular momentum-loss rate of the Sun, we exploit the dependence of the\nwind-braking torque on the effective rotation rate of the coronal magnetic\nfield. This quantity is evaluated by tracing field lines through a Potential\nField Source Surface (PFSS) model, driven by ADAPT-GONG magnetograms. The\nsurface rotation rates of the open magnetic field lines are then used to\nconstruct an open-flux weighted rotation rate, from which the influence on the\nwind-braking torque can be estimated. During solar minima, the rotation rate of\nthe corona decreases with respect to the typical solid-body rate (the\nCarrington rotation period is 25.4 days), as the sources of the solar wind\nshift towards the slowly-rotating poles. With increasing activity, more solar\nwind emerges from the Sun's active latitudes which enforces a Carrington-like\nrotation. The effect of differential rotation on the Sun's current wind-braking\ntorque is found to be small. The wind-braking torque is ~10-15% lower during\nsolar minimum, than assuming solid body rotation, and a few percent larger\nduring solar maximum. For more rapidly-rotating Sun-like stars, differential\nrotation may play a more significant role, depending on the configuration of\nthe large-scale magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 15:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

By identifying and counting the\nnumber of absorbances in IR spectra, carbon resonances in NMR, or molecular\nfragments in tandem MS, the molecular assembly index of an unknown molecule can\nbe reliably estimated from experimental data. This represents the first\nexperimentally quantifiable approach to defining molecular assembly, a reliable\nmetric for complexity, as an intrinsic property of all molecules and can also\nbe performed on complex mixtures. This paves the way to use spectroscopic\ntechniques to unambiguously detect alien life in the solar system, and beyond\non exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 12:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Comparing\nvon Neumann's account with the Compton-Simon paper, we find that von Neumann\nhad misinterpreted the experiment as consisting of two successive measurements\n(which gave identical results), whereas the experiment only measured two angles\non the same photographic plate. Note, however, that the state vector must\ncollapse upon measurement of an additively-conserved quantity; otherwise the\nconservation law could be violated. Next, it turns out that the mathematical\nproblem of explaining collapse is not fully defined until one specifies the\nnature of the apparatus. If the apparatus does not have a `classical\ndescription', the problem is insoluble, even if the measurement is only\napproximate (Fine, Simony, Brown, Simony and Busch); but if it does, the\nproblem is soluble within Schroedinger dynamics (with a time-dependent\nhamiltonian) for additively-conserved observables. The solution, a modification\nof Sewell's, shows that the state vector has collapsed, but it does not reveal\nthe eigenvalue of the collapsed state. The collapse is irreversible, and\nresults from the interplay of additive conservation laws with the quantum\nmeasurement postulate. Indeed, the quantum measurement problem - as expounded\nby Wigner - may be better understood as the problem of establishing that the\ntwo are compatible with each other; it has little relevance to actual\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 12:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Assisted by a small fraction of net charges in a cosmic plasma, zero\npoint energy can condense on mass concentrations. No longer participating in\nthe cosmic expansion, they constitute ``electro-zero-point energy'' (EZPE),\nwhich offers a solution to the dark matter riddle without new physics. An\nelectric field of 1 kV/m pointing from the center of the Galaxy is\npredicted.EZPE can cover the results deduced with MOND. Instability of linear\nperturbations motivates a speedy filling of a constant-density dark matter\ncore. EZPE solves the hydrostatic equilibrium puzzle in galaxy clusters. Cool\ncluster cores may result from expanding cores. Flowing in of EZPE explains why\nearly black holes can become supermassive, why they can have any mass and\novercome the final parsec problem when merging. EZPE implies rupture of clouds,\ne.g., reducing the primordial baryon cloud to the cosmic web. The large\ncoherence scale of the electric field acts as a scaffold for gentle galaxy\nformation and their vast polar structures. In galaxy merging and galactic bars,\nEZPE does not cause dynamical friction. At cosmological scales, it acts as\npressureless dark matter. Its energy density increases in time, which softens\nthe Hubble tension by late time physics. Of the large cosmological constant\ninjected at the big bang, a small part remains. At early times, inflation\noccurs automatically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 23:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

Most of them are based on\nsupervised learning, requiring plenty of annotated data; however, to support\nsegmentation, a label for each pixel is required, which is obviously expensive.\nAs a result, the issue of lacking annotated segmentation data commonly exists.\nContinuous learning is a promising way to deal with this issue; however, it\nstill has high demands on human labor for annotation. What's more, privacy is\nhighly required in segmentation data for real-world applications, which further\ncalls for on-device learning. In this paper, we aim to resolve the above issue\nin an alternative way: Instead of supervised segmentation, we propose to\ndevelop efficient unsupervised segmentation that can be executed on edge\ndevices. Based on our observation that segmentation can obtain high performance\nwhen pixels are mapped to a high-dimension space, we for the first time bring\nbrain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to the segmentation task. We\nbuild the HDC-based unsupervised segmentation framework, namely \"SegHDC\". In\nSegHDC, we devise a novel encoding approach that follows the Manhattan\ndistance. A clustering algorithm is further developed on top of the encoded\nhigh-dimension vectors to obtain segmentation results. Experimental results\nshow SegHDC can significantly surpass neural network-based unsupervised\nsegmentation. On a standard segmentation dataset, DSB2018, SegHDC can achieve a\n28.0% improvement in Intersection over Union (IoU) score; meanwhile, it\nachieves over 300x speedup on Raspberry PI. What's more, for a larger size\nimage in the BBBC005 dataset, the existing approach cannot be accommodated to\nRaspberry PI due to out of memory; on the other hand, SegHDC can obtain\nsegmentation results within 3 minutes while achieving a 0.9587 IoU score.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 00:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}
