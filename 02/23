It is not always easy to identify\nthe factors that may influence the SPI, or their inter-relations (including\nfeedback loops). Here, we aim to study the complex dynamics that SPI has with\nthe SST, NINO 3.4 and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), using a machine learning\napproach. Our findings are: (i) IOD was negatively correlated to SPI till 2008;\n(ii) until 2004, SST was negatively correlated with SPI; (iii) from 2005 to\n2014, the SST had swung between negative and positive correlations; (iv) since\n2014, we observed that the regression coefficient ($\\delta$) corresponding to\nSST has always been positive; (v) the SST has an upward trend, and the positive\nupward trend of $\\delta$ implied that SPI has been positively correlated with\nSST in recent years; and finally, (vi) the current value of SPI has a\nsignificant positive correlation with a past SPI value with a periodicity of\nabout 7.5 years. Examining the complex dynamics, we used a statistical machine\nlearning approach to construct an inferential network of these climate\nvariables, which revealed that SST and NINO 3.4 directly couples with SPI,\nwhereas IOD indirectly couples with SPI through SST and NINO 3.4. The system\nalso indicated that Nino 3.4 has a significant negative effect on SPI.\nInterestingly, there seems to be a structural change in the complex dynamics of\nthe four climate variables, some time in 2008. Though a simple 12-month moving\naverage of SPI has a negative trend towards drought, the complex dynamics of\nSPI with other climate variables indicate a wet season for western Australia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 16:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

This idea proved fruitful in the development of\nscalable algorithms for machine learning and statistical data analysis\napplications.

We expand on\nprevious work by addressing observation biases such as the orientation,\napparent size of the galaxies and noise before extracting features, thus\nreducing the number of clusters and forcing the network to learn meaningful\nfeatures. We then compare the extracted clusters' physical properties, to\ninvestigate the separation between the groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 16:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

To bridge the knowledge gap, we integrated animal\nexperiments and robotic studies in three representative environments: a large\nsmooth step, an uneven arena of blocks of large height variation, and large\nbumps.\n  We discovered that vertical body bending induces stability challenges but can\ngenerate large propulsion. When traversing a large smooth step, a snake robot\nis challenged by roll instability that increases with the amplitude of vertical\nbending. The instability can be reduced by body compliance that statistically\nimproves body-terrain contact. Despite this, vertical body bending can\npotentially allow snakes to push against terrain for propulsion, as\ndemonstrated by corn snakes traversing an uneven arena. A snake robot can\ngenerate large propulsion like this if contact is well maintained.

However,\nstoring experiences from all previous tasks make lifelong learning using\nselective experience replay computationally very expensive and impractical as\nthe number of tasks increase.

Recently, Singhal et al.

In this paper, we empirically\nstudy when and how in-context examples improve prompt tuning by measuring the\neffectiveness of ICL, PT, and IPT on five text generation tasks with multiple\nbase language models.

At first sight the electromagnetic (EM) gas assumed by Boltzmann and\nidentifiable as an ensemble of $N$ classical normal-modes, looks like an\nextension of the classical model of the massive ideal-gas. Accordingly, for\nthis EM gas the internal total energy, $U$, was taken to be function of volume\n$V$ and temperature $T$ as $U=U(V,T)$, and the equation of state was given by\n$U=3PV$, with $P$ the radiation pressure. In addition, Boltzmann implicitly\nassumed that, for given values of $V$ and $T$, $U$ and $N$ would take finite\nvalues. However, from one hand these assumptions are not justified by Maxwell\nequations since, in vacuum (i.e. far from the EM sources), according to\nclassical statistics, the values of $U$and $N$ diverge. From another hand,\nBoltzmann derivation of Stefan law is found to be macroscopically compatible\nwith its derivation from quantum statistics announced by Planck in 1901.\nAccordingly, this letter presents a solution of this puzzling classical/quantum\ncompatibility by noticing that the implicit assumption made by Boltzmann is\nfully justified by quantum statistics. Furthermore, we shed new light on the\ninterpretation of recent classical simulations of a black-body carried out by\nWang, Casati, and Benenti in 2022 who found an analogous puzzling compatibility\nto induce speculations on classical physics and black-body radiation that are\nclaimed to require a critical reconsideration of the role of classical physics\nfor the understanding of quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 17:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

In\ncontrast to prior works using open-loop cutting actions to cut through\nsingle-material objects (e.g., slicing a cucumber), RoboNinja aims to remove\nthe soft part of an object while preserving the rigid core, thereby maximizing\nthe yield. To achieve this, our system closes the perception-action loop by\nutilizing an interactive state estimator and an adaptive cutting policy. The\nsystem first employs sparse collision information to iteratively estimate the\nposition and geometry of an object's core and then generates closed-loop\ncutting actions based on the estimated state and a tolerance value. The\n\"adaptiveness\" of the policy is achieved through the tolerance value, which\nmodulates the policy's conservativeness when encountering collisions,\nmaintaining an adaptive safety distance from the estimated core. Learning such\ncutting skills directly on a real-world robot is challenging. Yet, existing\nsimulators are limited in simulating multi-material objects or computing the\nenergy consumption during the cutting process. To address this issue, we\ndevelop a differentiable cutting simulator that supports multi-material\ncoupling and allows for the generation of optimized trajectories as\ndemonstrations for policy learning. Furthermore, by using a low-cost force\nsensor to capture collision feedback, we were able to successfully deploy the\nlearned model in real-world scenarios, including objects with diverse core\ngeometries and soft materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 18:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

However, these models may misrepresent\ncertain social groups and present bias. Understanding bias in these models\nremains an important research question, especially for tasks that support\ncritical decision-making and could affect minorities. The contribution of this\nwork is a novel analysis covering architectures and embedding spaces for\nfine-grained understanding of bias over three approaches: generators, attribute\nmodifier, and post-processing bias mitigators. This work shows that generators\nsuffer from bias across all social groups with attribute preferences such as\nbetween 75%-85% for whiteness and 60%-80% for the female gender (for all\ntrained CelebA models) and low probabilities of generating children and older\nmen. Modifier and mitigators work as post-processor and change the generator\nperformance. For instance, attribute channel perturbation strategies modify the\nembedding spaces. We quantify the influence of this change on group fairness by\nmeasuring the impact on image quality and group features. Specifically, we use\nthe Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID), the Face Matching Error and the\nSelf-Similarity score. For Interfacegan, we analyze one and two attribute\nchannel perturbations and examine the effect on the fairness distribution and\nthe quality of the image.

This growth is\ntraditionally quantified by finding the initial disturbance that generates the\nmaximum response, in terms of energy gain, at the peak time of its evolution.\nWhile this bounds the growth, it can vastly overstate the growth of a real\ndisturbance. In this paper, we introduce a statistical perspective on transient\ngrowth that models statistics of the energy amplification of the disturbances.\nWe derive a formula for the mean energy amplification in terms of the two-point\nspatial correlation of the initial disturbance. We also derive an accurate\napproximation of the probability density function of the energy of the growing\ndisturbance, from which confidence bounds on the growth can be obtained.\nApplying our analysis to Poisseuille flow yields a number of observations.\nFirst, the mean gain can be drastically smaller than the maximum, especially\nwhen the disturbances are broadband in wavenumber content. In these cases, it\nis exceedingly unlikely to achieve near-optimal growth due to the exponential\nbehavior which we observe in the probability density function. Second, the\ncharacteristic length scale of the initial disturbances has a significant\nimpact on the expected growth; specifically, large-scale initial disturbances\nproduce orders-of-magnitude-larger expected growth than smaller scales,\nindicating that the length scale of incoming disturbances may be key in\ndetermining whether transient growth leads to transition for a particular flow.\nFinally, while the optimal growth scales quadratically with Reynolds number, we\nobserve that the mean energy amplification scales only linearly for certain\nreasonable choices of the initial correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 18:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

So far, the focus of\nlaboratory studies has been mainly on the impact of energetic ultraviolet (UV)\nphotons on ices, but direct vibrational excitation by infrared (IR) photons is\nexpected to influence the morphology and content of interstellar ices as well.\nHowever, little is still known about the mechanisms through which this excess\nvibrational energy is dissipated, and its implications on the structure and ice\nphotochemistry. In this work, we present a systematic investigation of the\nbehavior of interstellar relevant CO and CH3OH ice analogues upon resonant\nexcitation of vibrational modes using tunable infrared radiation, leading to\nboth the quantification of infrared-induced photodesorption and insights in the\nimpact of vibrational energy dissipation on ice morphology. We utilize an\nultrahigh vacuum setup at cryogenic temperatures to grow pure CO and CH3OH\nices, as well as mixtures of the two. We expose the ices to intense,\nnear-monochromatic mid-infrared free-electron-laser radiation to selectively\nexcite the species. The dissipation of vibrational energy is observed to be\nhighly dependent on the excited mode and the chemical environment of the ice.\nAll amorphous ices undergo some degree of restructuring towards a more\norganized configuration upon on-resonance irradiation. Moreover, IR-induced\nphotodesorption is observed to occur for both pure CO and CH3OH ices, with\ninterstellar photodesorption efficiencies of the order of 10 molecules cm-2 s-1\n(i.e., comparable to or higher than UV-induced counterparts).

Our work is motivated by the application of\nMonge-Ampere geometry to the Poisson equation for the pressure that arises for\nincompressible Navier-Stokes flows. Whilst this equation constitutes an\nelliptic problem for the pressure, it can also be viewed as a non-linear\npartial differential equation connecting the pressure, the vorticity, and the\nrate-of-strain. As such, it is a key diagnostic relation in the quest to\nunderstand the formation of vortices in turbulent flows. We study this equation\nvia the (higher) Lagrangian submanifold it defines in the cotangent bundle to\nthe configuration space of the fluid. Using our definition of a (higher)\nMonge-Ampere structure, we study an associated metric on the cotangent bundle\ntogether with its pull-back to the (higher) Lagrangian submanifold. The\nsignatures of these metrics are dictated by the relationship between vorticity\nand rate-of-strain, and their scalar curvatures can be interpreted in a\nphysical context in terms of the accumulation of vorticity, strain, and their\ngradients.

These characterizations play a key role in graph\ntheory, but they rarely lead to efficient algorithms to recognize these\nclasses. In contrast, many essential graph classes can be recognized\nefficiently thanks to characterizations of the following form: there must exist\nan ordering of the vertices such that some ordered pattern does not appear,\nwhere a pattern is basically an ordered subgraph. These pattern\ncharacterizations have been studied for decades, but there have been recent\nefforts to better understand them systematically. In this paper, we focus on a\nsimple problem at the core of this topic: given an ordered graph of size $n$,\nhow fast can we detect whether a fixed pattern of size $k$ is present?\n  Following the literature on graph classes recognition, we first look for\npatterns that can be detected in linear time. We prove, among other results,\nthat almost all patterns on three vertices (which capture many interesting\nclasses, such as interval, chordal, split, bipartite, and comparability graphs)\nfall in this category. Then, in a finer-grained complexity perspective, we\nprove conditional lower bounds for this problem. In particular we show that for\na large family of patterns on four vertices it is unlikely that subquadratic\nalgorithm exist. Finally, we define a parameter for patterns, the merge-width,\nand prove that for patterns of merge-width $t$, one can solve the problem in\n$O(n^{ct})$ for some constant~$c$. As a corollary, we get that detecting\nouterplanar patterns and other classes of patterns can be done in time\nindependent of the size of the pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 19:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

In our framework, each liquidity\nprovider (LP) submits to the exchange a downward-sloping demand curve,\nspecifying the quantity of the risky asset it wishes to hold at each price; the\nexchange buys and sells the risky asset so as to satisfy the aggregate\nsubmitted demand. In general, such a mechanism is budget-balanced and enables\nprice discovery. Different exchange mechanisms correspond to different\nrestrictions on the set of acceptable demand curves. The primary goal of this\npaper is to formalize an approximation-complexity trade-off that pervades the\ndesign of exchange mechanisms. For example, CFMMs give up expressiveness in\nfavor of simplicity: the aggregate demand curve of the LPs can be described\nusing constant space, but most demand curves cannot be well approximated by any\nfunction in the corresponding single-dimensional family. LOBs, intuitively,\nmake the opposite trade-off: any downward-slowing demand curve can be well\napproximated by a collection of limit orders, but the space needed to describe\nthe state of a LOB can be large. This paper introduces a general measure of\n{\\em exchange complexity}, defined by the minimal set of basis functions that\ngenerate, through their conical hull, all of the demand functions allowed by an\nexchange. With this complexity measure in place, we investigate the design of\n{\\em optimally expressive} exchange mechanisms, meaning the lowest complexity\nmechanisms that allow for arbitrary downward-sloping demand curves to be well\napproximated.

In the causal inference literature, the Conditional Average\nTreatment Effect (CATE) is a commonly used metric designed to characterize the\nheterogeneity of a treatment effect based on some population characteristics.\nIn this work, we introduce a novel modeling approach, called\nConfounder-Dependent Bayesian Mixture Model (CDBMM), to characterize causal\neffect heterogeneity.

It\ntransforms images from one domain to images in another domain so that they have\nparticular domain-specific characteristics. Most prior works train a generative\nmodel to learn the mapping from a source domain to a target domain. However,\nlearning such mapping between domains is challenging because data from\ndifferent domains can be highly unbalanced in terms of both quality and\nquantity. To address this problem, we propose a new approach to extract image\nfeatures by learning the similarities and differences of samples within the\nsame data distribution via a novel contrastive learning framework, which we\ncall Auto-Contrastive-Encoder (ACE). ACE learns the content code as the\nsimilarity between samples with the same content information and different\nstyle perturbations. The design of ACE enables us to achieve zero-shot\nimage-to-image translation with no training on image translation tasks for the\nfirst time.\n  Moreover, our learning method can learn the style features of images on\ndifferent domains effectively. Consequently, our model achieves competitive\nresults on multimodal image translation tasks with zero-shot learning as well.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate the potential of our method in transfer learning.\nWith fine-tuning, the quality of translated images improves in unseen domains.\nEven though we use contrastive learning, all of our training can be performed\non a single GPU with the batch size of 8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 23:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

The proposed infrastructure\nwould (i) increase the resilience of the customers in case the utility grid\nbecomes unavailable, (ii) reduce AC/DC conversion losses since a majority of\nthe DER generation is in DC, and (iii) with the help of BESS, the customers\nwill have a lesser impact on the utility grid in terms of California 'duck\ncurve.' The exchange of resources and further utilization of economies of scale\nwould significantly reduce the cost of this new infrastructure. Customers will\nbe able to fall back on the utility AC grid in case of a cyber-attack on the\ncommunity DC grid, improving cyber-security further. The proposed P2P\ntransactive energy scheme is based on cooperation among the homeowners, using\nadditional metering nodes to allow the sale or purchase of energy among\nresidents.

Besides, the fixed-wing UAV is modelled by a 3-D nonholonomic\nconstrained rigid body instead of a particle agent. The main results of this\npaper include proposing the formation feasibility conditions and designing the\nformation controller. Firstly, we define the RTI formation and propose the\nconditions to guarantee that the formations are feasible for the fixed-wing\nUAVs under the nonholonomic and input saturation constraints. Secondly, given\nfeasible formations, we design a formation controller by introducing a virtual\nleader and employing the compensation of rotation, followed by proving the\nstability of the closed-loop system. Finally, simulation examples are presented\nto verify the theoretical results.al with the motion coupling among multiple\nrobots.

To this end, we define a suitable extension of Pearl's notion\nof a \"classical structural causal model\", which we denote analogously by\n\"quantum structural causal model\". We show that every classical (probabilistic)\nstructural causal model can be extended to a quantum structural causal model,\nand prove that counterfactual queries that can be formulated within a classical\nstructural causal model agree with their corresponding queries in the quantum\nextension - but the latter is more expressive. Counterfactuals in quantum\ncausal models come in different forms: we distinguish between active and\npassive counterfactual queries, depending on whether or not an intervention is\nto be performed in the action step. This is in contrast to the classical case,\nwhere counterfactuals are always interpreted in the active sense. As a\nconsequence of this distinction, we observe that quantum causal models break\nthe connection between causal and counterfactual dependence that exists in the\nclassical case: (passive) quantum counterfactuals allow counterfactual\ndependence without causal dependence. This illuminates an important distinction\nbetween classical and quantum causal models, which underlies the fact that the\nlatter can reproduce quantum correlations that violate Bell inequalities while\nbeing faithful to the relativistic causal structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 05:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), have been extremely successful in achieving excellent performances in\nthis domain. However, mobile application, such as autonomous driving, demand\nreal-time processing of incoming stream of images. Hence, achieving efficient\narchitectures along with enhanced accuracy is of paramount importance. Since,\naccuracy and model size of CNNs are intrinsically contentious in nature, the\nchallenge is to achieve a decent trade-off between accuracy and model size. To\naddress this, we propose a novel Factorized Pyramidal Learning (FPL) module to\naggregate rich contextual information in an efficient manner. On one hand, it\nuses a bank of convolutional filters with multiple dilation rates which leads\nto multi-scale context aggregation; crucial in achieving better accuracy. On\nthe other hand, parameters are reduced by a careful factorization of the\nemployed filters; crucial in achieving lightweight models. Moreover, we\ndecompose the spatial pyramid into two stages which enables a simple and\nefficient feature fusion within the module to solve the notorious checkerboard\neffect. We also design a dedicated Feature-Image Reinforcement (FIR) unit to\ncarry out the fusion operation of shallow and deep features with the\ndownsampled versions of the input image. This gives an accuracy enhancement\nwithout increasing model parameters. Based on the FPL module and FIR unit, we\npropose an ultra-lightweight real-time network, called FPLNet, which achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off. More specifically, with only\nless than 0.5 million parameters, the proposed network achieves 66.93\\% and\n66.28\\% mIoU on Cityscapes validation and test set, respectively.

This has immediate relevance to tasks such as\nentropic causal inference for causal graph discovery and bounding mutual\ninformation between variables that we observe separately. Since finding the\nminimum entropy coupling is NP-Hard, various works have studied approximation\nalgorithms. The work of [Compton, ISIT 2022] shows that the greedy coupling\nalgorithm of [Kocaoglu et al., AAAI 2017] is always within $log_2(e) \\approx\n1.44$ bits of the optimal coupling. Moreover, they show that it is impossible\nto obtain a better approximation guarantee using the majorization lower-bound\nthat all prior works have used: thus establishing a majorization barrier. In\nthis work, we break the majorization barrier by designing a stronger\nlower-bound that we call the profile method. Using this profile method, we are\nable to show that the greedy algorithm is always within $log_2(e)/e \\approx\n0.53$ bits of optimal for coupling two distributions (previous best-known bound\nis within 1 bit), and within $(1 + log_2(e))/2 \\approx 1.22$ bits for coupling\nany number of distributions (previous best-known bound is within 1.44 bits). We\nalso examine a generalization of the minimum entropy coupling problem: Concave\nMinimum-Cost Couplings. We are able to obtain similar guarantees for this\ngeneralization in terms of the concave cost function. Additionally, we make\nprogress on the open problem of [Kova\\v{c}evi\\'c et al., Inf.

For the two models, the maximum mutual\ninformation achieving distribution, instead of the maximum input entropy\nachieving distribution, is numerically computed by the iterative Blahut-Arimoto\n(BA) algorithm. For the IM-DD system under peak power constraint (PPC), a\ndynamic-assignment BA algorithm is applied to find the capacity-achieving\ndistribution with minimum cardinality. It is observed that the maximum\ndifference between the minimum input cardinality and capacity is around 0.8\nbits. For a fixed support input cardinality, although the observed shaping gain\nis small and only appears in low peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) regions in\nthe PPC IM-DD system, the probabilistic shaping technique can also be used to\nintroduce rate adaptation to the system by adjusting the shaping and FEC\noverheads since the capacity-achieving distribution is symmetric.

The survey is enabled by the advent of the\nPhase II MWA's compact configuration, which offers an enormous efficiency in\nbeam-forming and processing costs, thereby making an all-sky survey of this\nmagnitude tractable with the MWA. Even with the long dwell times of the survey\n(4800 s), data collection can be completed in < 100 hours of telescope time,\nwhile still retaining the ability to reach a limiting sensitivity of ~2-3 mJy.\nEach observation is processed to generate ~5000-8000 tied-array beams that\ntessellate the full ~610 square degree field of view, which are then processed\nto search for pulsars. The voltage-capture recording allows a multitude of post\nhoc processing options including the reprocessing of data for higher time\nresolution. Due to the substantial computational cost in pulsar searches at low\nfrequencies, processing is undertaken in multiple passes: in the first pass, a\nshallow survey is performed, where 10 minutes of each observation is processed,\nreaching about one-third of the full search sensitivity.

Existing works mainly force on designing DNNs with higher\nembedding rates or fancy functionalities. In this paper, we want to answer some\nfundamental questions: how to increase and what determines the embedding rate\nof deep hiding. To this end, we first propose a novel Local Deep Hiding (LDH)\nscheme that significantly increases the embedding rate by hiding large secret\nimages into small local regions of cover images. Our scheme consists of three\nDNNs: hiding, locating, and revealing. We use the hiding network to convert a\nsecret image in a small imperceptible compact secret code that is embedded into\na random local region of a cover image. The locating network assists the\nrevealing process by identifying the position of secret codes in the stego\nimage, while the revealing network recovers all full-size secret images from\nthese identified local regions. Our LDH achieves an extremely high embedding\nrate, i.e., $16\\times24$ bpp and exhibits superior robustness to common image\ndistortions. We also conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate our scheme\nunder various system settings.

Over the\npast few years, by taking advantage of multiple windows of opportunity when the\ncompact configuration was available, we have advanced the survey to 75%\ncompletion. To date, about 10% of the data collected thus far have been\nprocessed for a first-pass search, where 10 minutes of observation is processed\nfor dispersion measures out to 250 ${\\rm pc\\,cm^{-3}}$, to realise a shallow\nsurvey for long-period pulsars.

The transition from RWTM to RWM occurs smoothly at q_a =\nm/n, where m,n are poloidal and toroidal mode numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 11:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

Detailed interpretations of\nthese features have nevertheless remained controversial. Based on 15 spectra\nobtained from 2003 to 2018, we revisit the microlensing effect that distorts\nthe CIV broad emission line profile. We show that the microlensing-induced line\nprofile distortions in image A, although variable, are remarkably similar over\na period of 15 years. They are characterized by a strong magnification of the\nblue part of the line profile, a strong demagnification of the red part of the\nline profile, and a small-to-negligible demagnification of the line core. We\nused the microlensing effect to constrain the broad emission-line region (BLR)\nsize, geometry, and kinematics. For this purpose, we modeled the deformation of\nthe emission lines considering three simple, representative BLR models: a\nKeplerian disk, an equatorial wind, and a biconical polar wind, with various\ninclinations with respect to the line of sight. We find that the observed\nmagnification profile of the CIV emission line can be reproduced with the\nsimple BLR models we considered, without the need for more complex BLR\nfeatures. The magnification appears dominated by the position of the BLR with\nrespect to the caustic network -- and not by the velocity-dependent size of the\nBLR. The favored models for the CIV BLR are either the Keplerian disk or the\nequatorial wind, depending on the orientation of the BLR axis with respect to\nthe caustic network. We also find that the polar wind model can be discarded.\nWe measured the CIV BLR half-light radius as $r_{1/2} = 2.8^{+2.0}_{-1.7}$\nlight-days. This value is smaller than the BLR radius expected from the\nradius-luminosity relation derived from reverberation mapping, but it is still\nin reasonable agreement given the large uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 11:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Explicit\nconstruction of these representations is a non-trivial task due to the\nnon-linearity of the polynomial algebras. Our method has similarities with the\ninduced module construction approach in the context of Lie algebras and allows\nthe construction of states of the superintegrable systems beyond the reach of\nseparation of variables.

By\nengineering the resonance of a nanoantenna, one can selectively enhance\nspecific vibronic transitions of a dye molecule, thus shaping its emission\nspectrum. Since interactions between emitters and nanoantennas are known to be\nposition dependent, we make here use of DNA origami to precisely place an\nindividual dye at different positions around a gold nanorod. We show how this\nrelative position between the nanorod and the emitter affects the emission\nspectrum of the latter. In particular, we observe the appearance of a second\nfluorescence peak whose wavelength and intensity are correlated with the\nfundamental plasmonic resonance of the nanorod, which we extract from its\nphotoluminescence spectrum. This second peak results from the selective\nenhancement of transitions to different vibrational levels of the excitonic\nground state, whose energies are in resonance with the plasmonic one.\nFurthermore, we argue that the drastic alteration of the fluorescence spectrum\nin some of our samples cannot be accounted for with Kasha's rule, which\nindicates that radiative and vibrational relaxation dye lifetimes can become\ncomparable through the coupling to the gold nanorods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 12:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

Here we present a study of the giant (750 kpc) radio\ngalaxy 103025+052430 located at the centre of a protocluster at redshift z=1.7,\nwith a focus on its interaction with the external medium. We present new LOFAR\nobservations at 144 MHz, which we combine with VLA 1.4 GHz and 0.5-7 keV\nChandra archival data. The new map at 144 MHz confirms that the source has a\ncomplex morphology, possibly consistent with the `hybrid morphology'\nclassification. The large size of the source gave us the possibility to perform\na resolved radio spectral index analysis, a very unique opportunity for a\nsource at such high redshift. This reveals a tentative flattening of the radio\nspectral index at the edge of the backflow in the Western lobe, which might be\nindicating plasma compression. The spatial coincidence between this region and\nthe thermal X-ray bubble C suggests a causal connection between the two.\nContrary to previous estimates for the bright X-ray component A, we find that\ninverse Compton scattering between the radio-emitting plasma of the Eastern\nlobe and the CMB photons can account for a large fraction (~45%-80%) of its\ntotal 0.5-7 keV measured flux. Finally, the X-ray bubble C, which is consistent\nwith a thermal origin, is found to be significantly overpressurised with\nrespect to the ambient medium. This suggests that it will tend to expand and\nrelease its energy in the surroundings, contributing to the overall\nintracluster medium heating.

This result\nis a first fundamental step for a possible classification of the\nnon-holomorphic Kaehler submanifolds lying with low codimension in Euclidean\nspace. A counterexample shows that our proof does not work for higher\ncodimension, indicating that proposing $p=11$ in the conjecture as the largest\ncodimension is appropriate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 14:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

A core\nchallenge with designing HBF systems stems from the fact their application\noften involves a non-convex, highly complex optimization of large dimensions.\nIn this paper, we propose HBF schemes that leverage data to enable efficient\ndesigns for both the fully-connected HBF (FC-HBF) and dynamic sub-connected HBF\n(SC-HBF) architectures. We develop a deep unfolding framework based on\nfactorizing the optimal fully digital beamformer into analog and digital terms\nand formulating two corresponding equivalent least squares (LS) problems. Then,\nthe digital beamformer is obtained via a closed-form LS solution, while the\nanalog beamformer is obtained via ManNet, a lightweight sparsely-connected deep\nneural network based on unfolding projected gradient descent. Incorporating\nManNet into the developed deep unfolding framework leads to the ManNet-based\nFC-HBF scheme. We show that the proposed ManNet can also be applied to SC-HBF\ndesigns after determining the connections between the radio frequency chain and\nantennas. We further develop a simplified version of ManNet, referred to as\nsubManNet, that directly produces the sparse analog precoder for SC-HBF\narchitectures. Both networks are trained with an unsupervised training\nprocedure. Numerical results verify that the proposed ManNet/subManNet-based\nHBF approaches outperform the conventional model-based and deep unfolded\ncounterparts with very low complexity and a fast run time. For example, in a\nsimulation with 128 transmit antennas, it attains a slightly higher spectral\nefficiency than the Riemannian manifold scheme, but over 1000 times faster and\nwith a complexity reduction of more than by a factor of six (6).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 14:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

In these games\nagents of different types each strategically select a node on a given graph\nthat models the residential area to maximize their individual utility. The\nlatter solely depends on the types of the agents on neighboring nodes and it\nhas been a standard assumption to consider utility functions that are monotone\nin the number of same-type neighbors. This simplifying assumption has recently\nbeen challenged since sociological poll results suggest that real-world agents\nactually favor diverse neighborhoods.\n  We contribute to the recent endeavor of investigating residential segregation\nmodels with realistic agent behavior by studying Jump Schelling Games with\nagents having a single-peaked utility function. In such games, there are empty\nnodes in the graph and agents can strategically jump to such nodes to improve\ntheir utility.

Last but not least, we show that\ncomputing a beneficial state with high integration is NP-complete and, as a\nnovel conceptual contribution, we also show that it is NP-hard to decide if an\nequilibrium state can be found via improving response dynamics starting from a\ngiven initial state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 15:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

A symmetric and non-negative matrix\nfactorization (SNMF) model is frequently adopted to address this issue owing to\nits great interpretability and scalability. However, it adopts a single latent\nfactor matrix to represent an undirected network for precisely representing its\nsymmetry, which leads to loss of representation learning ability due to the\nreduced latent space. Motivated by this discovery, this paper proposes a novel\nConstraints Fusion-induced Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CFS)\nmodel that adopts three-fold ideas: a) Representing a target undirected network\nwith multiple latent factor matrices, thus preserving its representation\nlearning capacity; b) Incorporating a symmetry-regularizer that preserves the\nsymmetry of the learnt low-rank approximation to the adjacency matrix into the\nloss function, thus making the resultant detector well-aware of the target\nnetwork's symmetry; and c) Introducing a graph-regularizer that preserves local\ninvariance of the network's intrinsic geometry, thus making the achieved\ndetector well-aware of community structure within the target network.\nExtensively empirical studies on eight real-world social networks from\nindustrial applications demonstrate that the proposed CFS model significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art models in achieving highly-accurate community\ndetection results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 15:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

To further improve the\nproduction of negative ions, cesium is usually evaporated inside the source and\ndeposited onto the plasma walls, reducing the work function of the surfaces.\nThis dramatically increases the density of negative hydrogen ions near the\nsurfaces, causing the transition to an electronegative plasma in the vicinity\nof the plasma grid. This condition can be observed with Langmuir probes.\n  In this paper we use the measurements provided by the Langmuir probe system\nembedded in the plasma grid of SPIDER, the prototype ion source of ITER NBIs,\nto determine the the density of negative ions. A fitting method based on the\ndetermination of the collection area of the different plasma species is\nproposed and adapted to SPIDER experimental condition, taking into account the\nshape of the probes and the local topology of the magnetic field. The method is\nthen applied to the experimental data, determining the densities of the\npositive and negative ions and of the electrons during a plasma pulse. Finally,\na vertical array of four probes in the plasma grid is used to assess the\nvertical profile of plasma parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 15:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

This thesis proposes\nIntrinsic Diffusion Modeling, a novel approach to this problem based on\ncombining diffusion generative models with scientific knowledge about the\nflexibility of biological complexes. The knowledge of these degrees of freedom\nis translated into the definition of a manifold over which the diffusion\nprocess is defined.

With the widespread use of social\nnetworks as a means of communication, it is becoming increasingly important to\ndevelop models that can automatically and accurately read the essence of\nindividuals based solely on their writing.

The objective\nis to identify an adequate semantic space that allows for defining the\npersonality of the object to which a certain text refers.

The microwave sensor\ncircuit employs a cylindrical dielectric resonator proximity coupled to a pair\nof orthogonal microstrip lines formed on a microwave substrate. The DR rests on\nthe substrate and is free to be displaced between the strips on the 2D plane of\nthe substrate. The strips excite the particular resonant mode of the DR, the\nintensity of which varies with the DRs proximity to the strips. The DRs\nposition can thus be read out in terms of the 2 port S parameters of the\ncircuit, at a fixed frequency determined by the resonant mode of DR. Such fixed\nfrequency sensors are robust in operation and cost effective in realization, an\nimportant aspect of this sensor. Initial one-dimensional positioning\nsimulations of the sensor through three fixed representative paths on the\nsubstrate reveal that the S parameters vary monotonically with the\ndisplacement. Prototype measurements reveal a dynamic range of 23 mm for\nhorizontal or vertical displacement, and 30 mm for diagonal displacement at the\nresonant frequency of 3.67 GHz. Next, 2D positioning test is conducted and a\ntechnique for one to one mapping from the S parameters to the 2D position is\ndemonstrated. To conclude, the proposed sensors performance is compared with\nthat of existing 2D sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 11:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

However, the quality of the multi-organ Finite\nElement Method (FEM)-based simulations is dependent on the patient-specific\nexternal forces and mechanical properties assigned to the organs.
