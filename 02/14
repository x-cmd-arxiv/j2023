Whereas humans reason about\nbroader phenomena of interest in a decision -- including latent constructs that\nare not directly observable, such as disease status, the \"toxicity\" of online\ncomments, or future \"job performance\" -- predictive models target proxy labels\nthat are readily available in existing datasets.

In this paper, we identify five sources of target variable bias that can\nimpact the validity of proxy labels in human-AI decision-making tasks.

However, a fundamental limitation is that their\nsampling process is slow due to a need for many (\\eg, $2000$) iterations of\nsequential computations. An intuitive acceleration method is to reduce the\nsampling iterations which however causes severe performance degradation. We\nassault this problem to the ill-conditioned issues of the Langevin dynamics and\nreverse diffusion in the sampling process. Under this insight, we propose a\nmodel-agnostic {\\bf\\em preconditioned diffusion sampling} (PDS) method that\nleverages matrix preconditioning to alleviate the aforementioned problem. PDS\nalters the sampling process of a vanilla SGM at marginal extra computation\ncost, and without model retraining. Theoretically, we prove that PDS preserves\nthe output distribution of the SGM, no risk of inducing systematical bias to\nthe original sampling process. We further theoretically reveal a relation\nbetween the parameter of PDS and the sampling iterations,easing the parameter\nestimation under varying sampling iterations. Extensive experiments on various\nimage datasets with a variety of resolutions and diversity validate that our\nPDS consistently accelerates off-the-shelf SGMs whilst maintaining the\nsynthesis quality.

We studied the\nflux and polarization of the scattered stellar radiation as a function of\nplanetary phase angle and wavelength from the optical to the near-infrared. For\nthe chosen grain size distribution, the dust particles in the ring show strong\nforward scattering at the considered wavelengths.

One of the emerging solutions\nfor this challenge is synthetic histological images. However, debiasing real\ndatasets require not only generating photorealistic images but also the ability\nto control the features within them. A common approach is to use generative\nmethods that perform image translation between semantic masks that reflect\nprior knowledge of the tissue and a histological image. However, unlike other\nimage domains, the complex structure of the tissue prevents a simple creation\nof histology semantic masks that are required as input to the image translation\nmodel, while semantic masks extracted from real images reduce the process's\nscalability.

The bias\ncan jeopardize the validity of the study and sensitivity analyses for assessing\nthe effect of the selection are desired. One method of sensitivity analysis is\nto construct bounds for the bias. In this work, we present an R package that\ncan be used to calculate two previously proposed bounds for selection bias for\nthe causal relative risk and causal risk difference for both the total and the\nselected population. The first bound, derived by Smith and VanderWeele (SV), is\nbased on values of sensitivity parameters that describe parts of the joint\ndistribution of the outcome, treatment, selection indicator and unobserved\nvariables. The second bound is based solely on the observed data, and is\ntherefore referred to as an assumption free (AF) bound. In addition to a\ntutorial for the bounds and the R package, we derive additional properties for\nthe SV bound.

However, they require some sort of\nadditional support to guarantee memory reclamation. The Optimistic Access (OA)\nmethod has most of the desired properties for memory reclamation, but since it\nallows memory to be accessed after being reclaimed, it is incompatible with the\ntraditional memory management model. This renders it unable to release memory\nto the memory allocator/operating system, and, as such, it requires a complex\nmemory recycling mechanism. In this paper, we extend the lock-free general\npurpose memory allocator LRMalloc to support the OA method. By doing so, we are\nable to simplify the memory reclamation method implementation and also allow\nmemory to be reused by other parts of the same process. We further exploit the\nvirtual memory system provided by the operating system and hardware in order to\nmake it possible to release reclaimed memory to the operating system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 17:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Recent work in IfO has focused on this problem in the case of\nobservations of low-dimensional environment states, however, access to these\nhighly-specific observations is unlikely in practice. In this paper, we adopt a\nchallenging, but more realistic problem formulation, learning control policies\nthat operate on a learned latent space with access only to visual\ndemonstrations of an expert completing a task. We present BootIfOL, an IfO\nalgorithm that aims to learn a reward function that takes an agent trajectory\nand compares it to an expert, providing rewards based on similarity to agent\nbehavior and implicit goal. We consider this reward function to be a distance\nmetric between trajectories of agent behavior and learn it via contrastive\nlearning. The contrastive learning objective aims to closely represent expert\ntrajectories and to distance them from non-expert trajectories. The set of\nnon-expert trajectories used in contrastive learning is made progressively more\ncomplex by bootstrapping from roll-outs of the agent learned through RL using\nthe current reward function. We evaluate our approach on a variety of control\ntasks showing that we can train effective policies using a limited number of\ndemonstrative trajectories, greatly improving on prior approaches that consider\nraw observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 17:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Here, a new approach is proposed to address the process of\nrapid heat dissipation in ceramic films and to detect the electrically induced\ntemperature change before it thermally bonds with the surrounding elements. By\nusing a polymer substrate that slows heat dissipation to the substrate and fast\ninfrared imaging, a substantial part of the adiabatic electrocaloric effect in\nPb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-based ceramic films is captured.

To start resolving this, we formulate a\nproblem setting in reinforcement learning called the $\\textit{extremely noisy\nenvironment}$ (ENE), where up to $99\\%$ of the input features are pure noise.\nAgents need to detect which features provide task-relevant information about\nthe state of the environment.

However, the increasing availability of large amounts of\ndatasets as well as the increasing available computational power of modern\ncomputers lead to a steady growth in the complexity and size of DNN and CNN\nmodels, and thus, to longer training times. Hence, various methods and attempts\nhave been developed to accelerate and parallelize the training of complex\nnetwork architectures. In this work, a novel CNN-DNN architecture is proposed\nthat naturally supports a model parallel training strategy and that is loosely\ninspired by two-level domain decomposition methods (DDM). First, local CNN\nmodels, that is, subnetworks, are defined that operate on overlapping or\nnonoverlapping parts of the input data, for example, sub-images. The\nsubnetworks can be trained completely in parallel. Each subnetwork outputs a\nlocal decision for the given machine learning problem which is exclusively\nbased on the respective local input data. Subsequently, an additional DNN model\nis trained which evaluates the local decisions of the local subnetworks and\ngenerates a final, global decision. With respect to the analogy to DDM, the DNN\ncan be interpreted as a coarse problem and hence, the new approach can be\ninterpreted as a two-level domain decomposition. In this paper, solely image\nclassification problems using CNNs are considered. Experimental results for\ndifferent 2D image classification problems are provided as well as a face\nrecognition problem, and a classification problem for 3D computer tomography\n(CT) scans. The results show that the proposed approach can significantly\naccelerate the required training time compared to the global model and,\nadditionally, can also help to improve the accuracy of the underlying\nclassification problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 18:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Thus fine-tuning allows the model to quickly\npick up task-specific ``skills,'' but there has been limited study of where\nthese newly-learnt skills reside inside the massive model. This paper\nintroduces the term skill localization for this problem and proposes a\nsolution. Given the downstream task and a model fine-tuned on that task, a\nsimple optimization is used to identify a very small subset of parameters\n($\\sim0.01$% of model parameters) responsible for ($>95$%) of the model's\nperformance, in the sense that grafting the fine-tuned values for just this\ntiny subset onto the pre-trained model gives performance almost as well as the\nfine-tuned model. While reminiscent of recent works on parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning, the novel aspects here are that: (i) No further re-training is\nneeded on the subset (unlike, say, with lottery tickets). (ii) Notable\nimprovements are seen over vanilla fine-tuning with respect to calibration of\npredictions in-distribution ($40$-$90$% error reduction) as well as the quality\nof predictions out-of-distribution (OOD).

Among the most remarkable findings of recent works is\nthat including a large number of overtones not only reduces the mismatch of the\nfitted ringdown but also allows one to extract black hole parameters from a\nringdown analysis that goes well within the non-linear merger part. At the same\ntime, it is well understood that several details of the ringdown analysis have\nimportant consequences for the question of whether overtones are present or\nnot, and subsequently, to what extent one can claim to perform black hole\nspectroscopy. To clarify and tackle some aspects of overtone fitting, we\nrevisit the clearer problem of wave propagation in the scalar Regge-Wheeler and\nP\\\"oschl-Teller potentials. This set-up, which is to some extent qualitatively\nvery similar to the non-linear merger-ringdown regime, indicates that using\neven an approximate model for the overtones yields an improved extraction of\nthe black hole mass at early ringdown times. We find that the relevant\nparameter is the number of included modes rather than using the correct model\nfor the overtones themselves. This further adds evidence to the proposal that\nlarge overtone numbers may instead remove non-quasi-normal mode contributions\nthat are relevant at early times of a ringdown, but do not necessarily\ncorrespond to the physical excitation of modes of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 19:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

In response, some civic tech groups\norganize around issues of shared concern to explore new forms of democratic\ntechnologies. How does their work affect the relationship between publics and\npublic servants?\n  This paper explores how a Civic Tech Toronto creates a platform for civic\nengagement through the maintenance of an autonomous community for civic\nengagement and participation that is casual, social, nonpartisan, experimental,\nand flexible. Based on two years of action research, including community\norganizing, interviews, and observations, this paper shows how this grassroots\ncivic tech group creates a civic platform that places a diverse range of\nparticipants in contact with the work of public servants, helping to build\ncapacities and relationships that prepare both publics and public servants for\nthe work of participatory democracy.\n  The case shows that understanding civic tech requires a lens beyond the mere\nanalysis or production of technical artifacts. As a practice for making\ntechnologies that is social and participatory, civic tech creates alternative\nmodes of technology development and opportunities for experimentation and\nlearning, and it can reconfigure the roles of democratic participants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 19:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a quantum\nalgorithm that tackles the molecular groundstate problem and is regarded as one\nof the flagships of quantum computing. Yet, to date, only very small molecules\nwere computed via VQE, due to high noise levels in current quantum devices.\nHere we present an alternative variational quantum scheme that requires\nsignificantly less qubits. The reduction in qubit number allows for shallower\ncircuits to be sufficient, rendering the method more resistant to noise. The\nproposed algorithm, termed variational quantum\nselected-configuration-interaction (VQ-SCI), is based on: (a) representing the\ntarget groundstate as a superposition of Slater determinant configurations,\nencoded directly upon the quantum computational basis states; and (b) selecting\na-priory only the most dominant configurations. This is demonstrated through a\nset of groundstate calculations of the H$_2$, LiH, BeH$_2$, H$_2$O, NH$_3$ and\nC$_2$H$_4$ molecules in the sto-3g basis set, performed on IBM quantum devices.\nWe show that the VQ-SCI reaches the full-CI (FCI) energy within chemical\naccuracy using the lowest number of qubits reported to date. Moreover, when the\nSCI matrix is generated ``on the fly\", the VQ-SCI requires exponentially less\nmemory than classical SCI methods. This offers a potential remedy to a severe\nmemory bottleneck problem in classical SCI calculations. Finally, the proposed\nscheme is general and can be straightforwardly applied for finding the\ngroundstate of any Hermitian matrix, outside the chemical context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 21:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

The calculated energies and the forces are therefore only\napproximate, which may lead to an unphysical energy drift and instabilities.\nHere we discuss an alternative shadow BOMD approach that is based on a backward\nerror analysis. Instead of calculating approximate solutions for an underlying\nexact regular BO potential, we do the opposite. Instead, we calculate the exact\nelectron density, energies, and forces, but for an underlying approximate\nshadow BO potential. In this way the calculated forces are conservative with\nrespect to the shadow potential and generate accurate molecular trajectories\nwith long-term energy stability. We show how such shadow BO potentials can be\nconstructed at different levels of accuracy as a function of the integration\ntime step, dt, from the minimization of a sequence of systematically\nimprovable, but approximate, shadow energy density functionals.

The model accounts for Knudsen transition transport\neffects, which become significant when the particle size is comparable to, or\nsmaller than, the molecular mean free path of the surrounding gas. Two kinetic\nmodels for the high-temperature solid-phase oxidation of iron are analyzed. The\nfirst model (parabolic kinetics) considers the inhibiting effect of the iron\noxide layers at the particle surface on the rate of oxidation, and a kinetic\nrate independent of the gaseous oxidizer concentration. The ignition\ntemperature is solved as a function of particle size and initial oxide layer\nthickness with an unsteady analysis considering the growth of the oxide layers.\nIn the small-particle limit, the thermal insulating effect of transition heat\ntransport can lead to a decrease of ignition temperature with decreasing\nparticle size. However, the presence of the oxide layer slows the reaction\nkinetics and its increasing proportion in the small-particle limit can lead to\nan increase of ignition temperature with decreasing particle size. This effect\nis observed for sufficiently large initial oxide layer thicknesses. The\ncontinuum transport model is shown to predict the ignition temperature of iron\nparticles exceeding an initial diameter of 30 $\\mu$m to a difference of 3% (30\nK) or less when compared to the transition transport model. The second kinetic\nmodel (first-order kinetics) considers a porous, non-hindering oxide layer, and\na linear dependence of the kinetic rate of oxidation on the gaseous oxidizer\nconcentration. The ignition temperature is resolved as a function of particle\nsize with the transition and continuum transport models, and the differences\nbetween the ignition characteristics predicted by the two models are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 21:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

It has been extensively studied for various queueing\nmodels based on the probabilistic approaches, where the analyses heavily depend\non the properties of specific distributions (e.g., the memoryless property of\nthe exponential distribution or the i.i.d. assumption). In this work, we take\nan alternative new approach, the robust queueing approach, to analyze the Peak\nAge-of-Information (PAoI). Specifically, we first model the uncertainty in the\nstochastic arrival and service processes using uncertainty sets. This enables\nus to approximate the expected PAoI performance for very general arrival and\nservice processes, including those exhibiting heavy-tailed behaviors or\ncorrelations, where traditional probabilistic approaches cannot be applied. We\nthen derive a new bound on the PAoI in the single-source single-server setting.\nFurthermore, we generalize our analysis to two-source single-server systems\nwith symmetric arrivals, which involves new challenges (e.g., the service times\nof the updates from two sources are coupled in one single uncertainty set).\nFinally, through numerical experiments, we show that our new bounds provide a\ngood approximation for the expected PAoI. Compared to some well-known bounds in\nthe literature (e.g., one based on Kingman's bound under the i.i.d. assumption)\nthat tends to be inaccurate under light load, our new approximation is accurate\nunder both light and high loads, both of which are critical scenarios for the\nAoI performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 22:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 22:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

The steady-state model\nconsiders: a constant oxidizer mass flow rate; a combustion chamber in chemical\nequilibrium; a one-dimensional isentropic nozzle; and a one-dimensional\nconstant-thrust rocket ascent. The steady-state model is used to conduct\nparametric studies on engine performance as a function of design parameters\nsuch as: oxidizer mass flow rate, fuel grain dimensions, and nozzle dimensions.\nThe engine design point is selected to optimize specific impulse, given\nphysical and structural constraints of the system.

The transient performance profile of the\nengine is established, and the unsteady model is used to predict propellant\nrequirements for the launch vehicle, given a target apogee of 3048 m (10,000\nft).

While prior work has derived various notions of\nomniprediction from multigroup fairness guarantees of varying strength, it was\nunknown whether the connection goes in both directions.\n  In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative, establishing\nequivalences between notions of multicalibration and omniprediction. The new\ndefinitions that hold the key to this equivalence are new notions of swap\nomniprediction, which are inspired by swap regret in online learning. We show\nthat these can be characterized exactly by a strengthening of multicalibration\nthat we refer to as swap multicalibration. One can go from standard to swap\nmulticalibration by a simple discretization; moreover all known algorithms for\nstandard multicalibration in fact give swap multicalibration. In the context of\nomniprediction though, introducing the notion of swapping results in provably\nstronger notions, which require a predictor to minimize expected loss at least\nas well as an adaptive adversary who can choose both the loss function and\nhypothesis based on the value predicted by the predictor.\n  Building on these characterizations, we paint a complete picture of the\nrelationship between the various omniprediction notions in the literature by\nestablishing implications and separations between them.

In some cases, one\nmight be able to find a population-level doubly (or possibly multiply) robust\nestimating equation which has zero mean provided one of the nuisance parameters\nis correctly specified, without knowing which. This property is appealing in\npractice because it suggests \"model doubly robust\" estimators that entail extra\nprotection against model misspecification. Typically asymptotic inference of\nsuch a doubly robust estimator is relatively simple through classical\nZ-estimation theory under standard regularity conditions. In other cases,\nmachine learning techniques are leveraged to achieve \"rate double robustness\",\nwith cross fitting.

It is crucial to\nunderstand the effects of wax impregna-tion on contact resistivity (Rct). We\ndesigned and built an appa-ratus to use short REBCO samples which simulates the\nbehavior of Rct in a pancake coil during the wax impregnation process. Rct was\nmeasured at 77 K before and after the wax impregnation. In addition, a single\npancake coil was wound to test the effect of wax impregnation. This coil\nsimulates the NHMFL 32 T magnet Coil A in winding stresses. Rct was measured at\n77 K and 4.2 K before and after wax impregnation. We found that wax\nimpregnation does not significantly change contact resistivity. This means that\nwax impregnation can be used in coils without compromising the current sharing\nability between turns. The experimental process and results are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 23:54:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

This achievement is crucial for the\nmeasurements of many magnetic and superconducting materials. Furthermore, we\nhave devised a method that allows us to measure five small area samples mounted\ntogether on the same sample plate. We expect this method to further improve the\nefficient use of beam time at LEM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 01:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Moreover, this nonlinear decay process can\nstrongly suppress transitions to higher-excited superradiant states, and\nconvert residual transitions into an effective decay from the single-excitation\nsuperradiant state to the ground state. Our method does not require Rydberg\ndipole blockade and, thus, strong atom-atom interactions, compared to previous\nwork.

As the slope is universal and the\nparameters $c_{fl}=c_{fn_r}=1$, we find the relative errors of the estimated\nvalues are about $2\\%$. The values estimated by the universal relation agree\nwell with the experimental and theoretical data.

To avoid the above\ntwo issues, this paper proposes a novel method to estimate these three CMs by\nthe so-called quantiled CMs (QCMs). The QCM method first adopts the idea of\nCornish-Fisher expansion to construct a linear regression model, based on $n$\ndifferent estimated conditional quantiles. Next, it computes the QCMs simply\nand simultaneously by using the ordinary least squares estimator of this\nregression model, without any prior estimation of the conditional mean.

The stacked REBCO tapes, no\nmatter whether they are twisted or not, however, have a nature of\nnon-transposing and therefore could result in current unbalance. In this\nmanuscript, the current unbalance and the related electrical characteristics of\na cable made of 40 stacked REBCO tapes are studied with an electrical circuit\nsimulation. The differences in splice resistances and tape inductances that are\nboth related to the non-transposed structure of a REBCO stack are considered.\nResults show that for a 40 cm long termination, a proper method to keep the\ncontact resistivity between each tape and the copper termination around 1e-8\nohmm is crucial to totally avoid current unbalance lowering the cable\nperformance. Surprisingly, the inter-tape current transfer is found to be able\nto further exacerbate local high current though it does make the overall\ndistribution more balanced. The inductance difference induced current unbalance\nis only important if local defects exist at long REBCO tapes, which on the\nother hand can be cured by good inter-tape current transfer. For a\nfast-charging rate of 1 kA/s, the inter-tape contact resistivity should also be\nlow to a level of 1e-8 ohmm to ensure a short current transfer length of around\n1 m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 04:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

To develop effective numerical algorithms, it is generally necessary\nto transform the bilevel program into a single-level optimization problem. The\nmost popular approach is to replace the lower-level program by its KKT\nconditions and then the bilevel program can be reformulated as a mathematical\nprogram with equilibrium constraints (MPEC for short). However, since the MPEC\ndoes not satisfy the Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification at any\nfeasible point, the well-developed nonlinear programming theory cannot be\napplied to MPECs directly. In this paper, we apply the Wolfe duality to show\nthat, under very mild conditions, the bilevel program is equivalent to a new\nsingle-level reformulation (WDP for short) in the globally and locally optimal\nsense.

In this paper, we propose a novel real-time action\ndetection framework, YOWOv2. In this new framework, YOWOv2 takes advantage of\nboth the 3D backbone and 2D backbone for accurate action detection. A\nmulti-level detection pipeline is designed to detect action instances of\ndifferent scales. To achieve this goal, we carefully build a simple and\nefficient 2D backbone with a feature pyramid network to extract different\nlevels of classification features and regression features. For the 3D backbone,\nwe adopt the existing efficient 3D CNN to save development time. By combining\n3D backbones and 2D backbones of different sizes, we design a YOWOv2 family\nincluding YOWOv2-Tiny, YOWOv2-Medium, and YOWOv2-Large. We also introduce the\npopular dynamic label assignment strategy and anchor-free mechanism to make the\nYOWOv2 consistent with the advanced model architecture design. With our\nimprovement, YOWOv2 is significantly superior to YOWO, and can still keep\nreal-time detection. Without any bells and whistles, YOWOv2 achieves 87.0 %\nframe mAP and 52.8 % video mAP with over 20 FPS on the UCF101-24. On the AVA,\nYOWOv2 achieves 21.7 % frame mAP with over 20 FPS.

Here a transient yet intense particle and energy sources are\napplied at the pedestal top to mimic the plasma power drive at the edge induced\nby a core thermal collapse, which flattens core temperature profile.\nInteresting features such as surging of divertor heat load (up to 50 times),\nand broadening of heat flux width (up to 4 times) on the outer divertor target\nplate, are observed in the simulation, in qualitative agreement with\nexperimental observations. The dramatic changes of divertor heat load and width\nare due to the enhanced plasma turbulence activities inside the separatrix.

Problems such as deciding the satisfiability of the FM and\neliminating inconsistent parts of the FM have been well resolved by translating\nthe FM into a conjunctive normal form (CNF) formula, and then feeding the CNF\nto a SAT solver. However, this approach has some limits for other important\nreasoning issues about the FM, such as counting or enumerating configurations.\nTwo mainstream approaches have been investigated in this direction: (i) direct\napproaches, using tools based on the CNF representation of the FM at hand, or\n(ii) compilation-based approaches, where the CNF representation of the FM has\nfirst been translated into another representation for which the reasoning\nqueries are easier to address. Our contribution is twofold. First, we evaluate\nhow both approaches compare when dealing with common reasoning operations on\nFM, namely counting configurations, pointing out one or several configurations,\nsampling configurations, and finding optimal configurations regarding a utility\nfunction. Our experimental results show that the compilation-based is efficient\nenough to possibly compete with the direct approaches and that the cost of\ntranslation (i.e., the compilation time) can be balanced when addressing\nsufficiently many complex reasoning operations on large configuration spaces.\nSecond, we provide a Java-based automated reasoner that supports these\noperations for both approaches, thus eliminating the burden of selecting the\nappropriate tool and approach depending on the operation one wants to perform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 07:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

This task has been extensively studied within the framework of\ncooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), and value decomposition\nmethods are among those cutting-edge solutions. However, traditional methods\nthat learn the value function as a monotonic mixing of per-agent utilities\ncannot solve the tasks with non-monotonic returns. This hinders their\napplication in generic scenarios. Recent methods tackle this problem from the\nperspective of implicit credit assignment by learning value functions with\ncomplete expressiveness or using additional structures to improve cooperation.\nHowever, they are either difficult to learn due to large joint action spaces or\ninsufficient to capture the complicated interactions among agents which are\nessential to solving tasks with non-monotonic returns. To address these\nproblems, we propose a novel explicit credit assignment method to address the\nnon-monotonic problem. Our method, Adaptive Value decomposition with Greedy\nMarginal contribution (AVGM), is based on an adaptive value decomposition that\nlearns the cooperative value of a group of dynamically changing agents. We\nfirst illustrate that the proposed value decomposition can consider the\ncomplicated interactions among agents and is feasible to learn in large-scale\nscenarios. Then, our method uses a greedy marginal contribution computed from\nthe value decomposition as an individual credit to incentivize agents to learn\nthe optimal cooperative policy. We further extend the module with an action\nencoder to guarantee the linear time complexity for computing the greedy\nmarginal contribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nachieves significant performance improvements in several non-monotonic domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 07:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

While exhibiting superiority in some\nbenchmarks, their deficiencies, e.g., unstable performance, high training cost,\nand slow model updating, stem from the inherent hardness of predicting the cost\nor latency of execution plans using machine learning models. In this paper, we\nintroduce a learning-to-rank query optimizer, called Lero, which builds on top\nof a native query optimizer and continuously learns to improve the optimization\nperformance. The key observation is that the relative order or rank of plans,\nrather than the exact cost or latency, is sufficient for query optimization.\nLero employs a pairwise approach to train a classifier to compare any two plans\nand tell which one is better. Such a binary classification task is much easier\nthan the regression task to predict the cost or latency, in terms of model\nefficiency and accuracy. Rather than building a learned optimizer from scratch,\nLero is designed to leverage decades of wisdom of databases and improve the\nnative query optimizer. With its non-intrusive design, Lero can be implemented\non top of any existing DBMS with minimal integration efforts. We implement Lero\nand demonstrate its outstanding performance using PostgreSQL. In our\nexperiments, Lero achieves near optimal performance on several benchmarks. It\nreduces the plan execution time of the native optimizer in PostgreSQL by up to\n70% and other learned query optimizers by up to 37%.

Employing a standard observer-based state feedback\ncontrol law, a self-triggering mechanism that dictates the next sampling time\nbased on quantized output is co-developed with an output encoding scheme. If,\nin addition, the transmission protocols at the controller-to-actuator (C-A) and\nsensor-to-controller (S-C) channels can be adapted, the self-triggered control\narchitecture can be considerably simplified, leveraging a delicate\nobserver-based deadbeat controller to eliminate the need for running the\ncontroller in parallel at the encoder side. To account for denial-of-service\n(DoS) in the S-C channel, the proposed output encoding and self-triggered\ncontrol schemes are further made resilient.

But\nstandard radiometric methods can only be applied if the orbit of an object is\nknown, hence its position at the time of the observation. We present MIRI\nobservations of the outer-belt asteroid 10920 and an unknown object, detected\nin all 9 MIRI bands in close proximity to 10920. We developed a new method\n\"STM-ORBIT\" to interpret the multi-band measurements without knowing the\nobject's true location. The method leads to a confirmation of radiometric\nsize-albedo solution for 10920 and puts constraints on the asteroid's location\nand orbit in agreement with its true orbit. Groundbased lightcurve observations\nof 10920, combined with Gaia data, indicate a very elongated object (a/b >=\n1.5), with a spin-pole at (l, b) = (178{\\deg}, 81{\\deg}), and a rotation period\nof 4.861191 h. A thermophysical study leads to a size of 14.5 - 16.5 km, a\ngeometric albedo between 0.05 and 0.10, and a thermal inertia in the range 9 to\n35 Jm-2s-0.5K-1. For the newly discovered MIRI object, the STM-ORBIT method\nrevealed a size of 100-230 m. The new asteroid must be on a very\nlow-inclination orbit and it was located in the inner main-belt region during\nJWST observations. A beaming parameter {\\eta} larger than 1.0 would push the\nsize even below 100 meter, a main-belt regime which escaped IR detections so\nfar. These kind of MIRI observations can therefore contribute to formation and\nevolution studies via classical size-frequency studies which are currently\nlimited to objects larger than about one kilometer in size. We estimate that\nMIRI frames with pointings close to the ecliptic and only short integration\ntimes of a few seconds will always include a few asteroids, most of them will\nbe unknown objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 09:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Estimating such curves is a difficult task because for most\nstructures of interest, few data are available, whether they come from complex\nnumerical simulations or experimental campaigns. For this reason, a wide range\nof the methods of the literature rely on a parametric log-normal model.\nBayesian approaches allow for efficient learning of the model parameters.\nHowever, for small data set sizes, the choice of the prior distribution has a\nnon-negligible influence on the posterior distribution, and therefore on any\nresulting estimate. We propose a thorough study of this parametric Bayesian\nestimation problem when the data are binary (i.e. data indicate the state of\nthe structure, failure or non-failure).

To address these limitations,\nthis study proposes an improved YOLOv7 network (YOLOv7-AC) for underwater\ntarget detection. The proposed network utilizes an ACmixBlock module to replace\nthe 3x3 convolution block in the E-ELAN structure, and incorporates jump\nconnections and 1x1 convolution architecture between ACmixBlock modules to\nimprove feature extraction and network reasoning speed. Additionally, a\nResNet-ACmix module is designed to avoid feature information loss and reduce\ncomputation, while a Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) is inserted in the\nbackbone and head parts of the model to improve feature extraction.\nFurthermore, the K-means++ algorithm is used instead of K-means to obtain\nanchor boxes and enhance model accuracy. Experimental results show that the\nimproved YOLOv7 network outperforms the original YOLOv7 model and other popular\nunderwater target detection methods. The proposed network achieved a mean\naverage precision (mAP) value of 89.6% and 97.4% on the URPC dataset and\nBrackish dataset, respectively, and demonstrated a higher frame per second\n(FPS) compared to the original YOLOv7 model.

This study involves heterogeneous samples of nearby\nSeyfert and LINER galaxies as well as QSOs that have been observed at low radio\nfrequencies (few ~100 MHz) with the GMRT and ~GHz frequencies with the VLA and\nVLBA. These multi-frequency, multi-resolution observations detect a range of\narcsecond-scale radio spectral indices that are consistent with the presence of\nmultiple contributors including starburst winds and AGN jets or winds; steep\nspectrum ``relic'' emission is observed as well. Polarization-sensitive data\nfrom the VLA and GMRT suggest that the radio outflows are stratified (e.g., in\nIIIZw2, Mrk231); distinct polarization signatures suggest that there could\neither be a ``spine + sheath'' structure in the radio outflow, or there could\nbe a ``jet + wind'' structure. Similar nested biconical outflows can also\nexplain the VLBA and SDSS emission-line data in the KISSR sample of\ndouble-peaked emission-line Seyfert and LINER galaxies. Furthermore, the\nmodeling of the emission-lines with plasma modeling codes such as MAPPINGS\nindicates that parsec-scale jets and winds in these sources can disturb or move\nthe narrow-line region gas clouds via the ``shock + precursor'' mechanism.\nApart from the presence of ``relic'' emission, several Seyfert and LINER\ngalaxies show clear morphological signatures of episodic jet activity. In one\nsuch source, NGC2639, at least four distinct episodes of jets are observed, the\nlargest one of which was only detectable at 735 MHz with the GMRT.\nAdditionally, a ~6 kpc hole in the CO molecular gas along with a dearth of\nyoung stars in the center of its host galaxy is observed.

Our work extends the result obtained in \\cite{MR3927089} for the\na priori unstable case $m_1/m_0\\ll1$, to the case of arbitrary masses\n$m_0,m_1>0$, where the model displays features of the so-called \\textit{a\npriori stable} setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 11:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

In this\npaper, we investigate the MA-enhanced multiple-access channel (MAC) for the\nuplink transmission from multiple users each equipped with a single MA to a\nbase station (BS) with a fixed-position antenna (FPA) array. A field-response\nbased channel model is used to characterize the multi-path channel between the\nantenna array of the BS and each user's MA with a flexible position. To\nevaluate the MAC performance gain provided by MAs, we formulate an optimization\nproblem for minimizing the total transmit power of users, subject to a\nminimum-achievable-rate requirement for each user, where the positions of MAs\nand the transmit powers of users, as well as the receive combining matrix at\nthe BS are jointly optimized. To solve this non-convex optimization problem\ninvolving intricately coupled variables, we develop two algorithms based on\nzero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) combining methods,\nrespectively. Specifically, for each algorithm, the combining matrix of the BS\nand the total transmit power of users are expressed as a function of the MAs'\nposition vectors, which are then optimized by using the gradient descent method\nin an iterative manner. It is shown that the proposed ZF-based and MMSE-based\nalgorithms can converge to high-quality suboptimal solutions with low\ncomputational complexities.

The\nconcept of $r$-grouped dominating sets generalizes several well-studied\nvariants of dominating sets with requirements for connected component sizes,\nsuch as the ordinary dominating sets ($r=1$), paired dominating sets ($r=2$),\nand connected dominating sets ($r$ is arbitrary and $k=1$). In this paper, we\ninvestigate the computational complexity of $r$-Grouped Dominating Set, which\nis the problem of deciding whether a given graph has an $r$-grouped dominating\nset with at most $k$ units. For general $r$, the problem is hard to solve in\nvarious senses because the hardness of the connected dominating set is\ninherited. We thus focus on the case in which $r$ is a constant or a parameter,\nbut we see that the problem for every fixed $r>0$ is still hard to solve. From\nthe hardness, we consider the parameterized complexity concerning well-studied\ngraph structural parameters. We first see that it is fixed-parameter tractable\nfor $r$ and treewidth, because the condition of $r$-grouped domination for a\nconstant $r$ can be represented as monadic second-order logic (mso2).

For\nexample, this mechanism is relevant to an alternative solution of the monopole\nproblem proposed by Stojkovic and Freese, in which magnetic monopoles produced\nin the early universe are captured by PBHs, thus freeing inflation from having\nto occur during or after the corresponding phase transitions that produced the\nmonopoles. In this work, we reanalyze the solution by modelling the capture\nprocess in the same way as the coexisting monopole annihilation, which exhibits\ntypical features of a diffusive capture. A monochromatic PBH mass function and\na radiation-dominated era before PBH evaporation are assumed. We found that for\nPati-Salam monopoles corresponding to a symmetry breaking scale between\n$10^{10}\\,\\text{GeV}$ and $10^{15}\\,\\text{GeV}$, the capture rate is many\norders of magnitude below what is needed to cause a significant reduction of\nthe monopole density. The difference with respect to previous literature can be\nattributed to both the modelling of the capture process and also the assumption\non the PBH mass function. Within our assumptions, we also found that the\nmagnetic charge that is large enough to make an extremal magnetic black hole\ncosmologically stable cannot be obtained from magnetic charge fluctuation via\nmonopole capture. The large magnetic charged required by cosmological stability\ncan nevertheless be obtained from magnetic charge fluctuation at PBH formation,\nand if later the monopole abundance can be reduced significantly by some\nnon-inflationary mechanism, long-lived near-extremal magnetic black holes of\nobservational relevance might result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 12:17:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2023 14:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Meanwhile,\nthe intense turbulence provides abundant kinetic energy, accelerating the\nmixing of the diffusion flame with a contribution to higher strain rate and\nlarger curvatures of the flame. Considering the effects of non-unity Lewis\nnumber, it is revealed that the flame strength is more intense in the cases\nwith mixture averaged model. However, this effect is relatively suppressed\nunder the impacts of the intense turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 12:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

The analysis is done in two limits; in the short time\nscale where the final state of each sub-system is close to its initial thermal\nstate and in a longer time scale where each sub-system's final state can be\narbitrary. The results indicate that the conventional flow of particles from a\nhigher chemical potential to a lower one occurs when the correlation which is\nquantified by mutual information increases. In contrast, an anomalous flow of\nparticles in the reverse direction has a chance to happen when the correlation\ngoes down.

We find, that resonant pulses are more confined in a transverse\ndirection by the interaction than off-resonant pulses are and that the plasma\nchannels they create are more sharply bounded. Off-resonant pulses leave a\nwider layer of partially ionized atoms and thus lose more energy per unit\npropagation distance. Using experimental data, we estimate the energy required\nto generate a 20-meter-long plasma column and conclude that resonant pulses are\nmuch more suitable for creating a long, homogeneous plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 13:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Flow properties are universally determined in a unified way in terms\nof the Reynolds number ${\\cal R}$ (dimensionless, ratio of inertial to viscous\nforces in incompressible fluids). For example, the drag coefficient $c_D$ of\nobjects with similar shapes moving in fluids is expressed by a universal\nfunction of ${\\cal R}$.

To improve the\nfeasibility of fault-tolerant quantum computing it is then crucial to minimize\nthe number of $T$ gates.

However, it has two\nlimitations: 1) it gets stuck easily in spurious local minima, and 2) the\nnumber of clusters k has to be given a priori. To solve these two issues, a\nmulti-prototypes convex merging based K-Means clustering algorithm (MCKM) is\npresented. First, based on the structure of the spurious local minima of the\nK-Means problem, a multi-prototypes sampling (MPS) is designed to select the\nappropriate number of multi-prototypes for data with arbitrary shapes. A\ntheoretical proof is given to guarantee that the multi-prototypes selected by\nMPS can achieve a constant factor approximation to the optimal cost of the\nK-Means problem. Then, a merging technique, called convex merging (CM), merges\nthe multi-prototypes to get a better local minima without k being given a\npriori. Specifically, CM can obtain the optimal merging and estimate the\ncorrect k. By integrating these two techniques with K-Means algorithm, the\nproposed MCKM is an efficient and explainable clustering algorithm for escaping\nthe undesirable local minima of K-Means problem without given k first.\nExperimental results performed on synthetic and real-world data sets have\nverified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 13:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

The best constraints on the morphology of\ndisks are often obtained from spatially resolved observations in scattered\nlight. Here, we investigate the young (~16 Myr) bright gas-rich debris disk\naround HD121617. We use new scattered-light observations with VLT/SPHERE to\ncharacterize the morphology and the dust properties of this disk. From these\nproperties we can then derive constraints on the physical and dynamical\nenvironment of this system, for which significant amounts of gas have been\ndetected. The disk morphology is constrained by linear-polarimetric\nobservations in the J band. Based on our modeling results and archival\nphotometry, we also model the SED to put constraints on the total dust mass and\nthe dust size distribution. We explore different scenarios that could explain\nthese new constraints. We present the first resolved image in scattered light\nof the debris disk HD121617. We fit the morphology of the disk, finding a\nsemi-major axis of 78.3$\\pm$0.2 au, an inclination of 43.1$\\pm$0.2{\\deg} and a\nposition angle of the major axis with respect to north, of 239.8$\\pm$0.3{\\deg},\ncompatible with the previous continuum and CO detection with ALMA. Our analysis\nshows that the disk has a very sharp inner edge, possibly sculpted by a\nyet-undetected planet or gas drag. While less sharp, its outer edge is steeper\nthan expected for unperturbed disks, which could also be due to a planet or gas\ndrag, but future observations probing the system farther from the main belt\nwould help explore this further. The SED analysis leads to a dust mass of\n0.21$\\pm$0.02 M$_{\\oplus}$ and a minimum grain size of 0.87$\\pm$0.12 $\\mu$m,\nsmaller than the blowout size by radiation pressure, which is not unexpected\nfor very bright col...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 14:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Data\nharmonization at the semantic level by means of ontologies is essential for\nmaking these applications interoperable. Since geo-modeling is currently part\nof multidisciplinary projects, semantic harmonization is required to model not\nonly geological knowledge but also to integrate other domain knowledge at a\ngeneral level. For this reason, the domain ontologies used for describing\ngeological knowledge must be based on a sound ontology background to ensure the\ndescribed geological knowledge is integratable. This paper presents a domain\nontology: GeoFault, resting on the Basic Formal Ontology BFO (Arp et al., 2015)\nand the GeoCore ontology (Garcia et al., 2020). It models the knowledge related\nto geological faults. Faults are essential to various industries but are\ncomplex to model. They can be described as thin deformed rock volumes or as\nspatial arrangements resulting from the different displacements of geological\nblocks. At a broader scale, faults are currently described as mere surfaces,\nwhich are the components of complex fault arrays. The reference to the BFO and\nGeoCore package allows assigning these various fault elements to define\nontology classes and their logical linkage within a consistent ontology\nframework. The GeoFault ontology covers the core knowledge of faults 'strico\nsensu,' excluding ductile shear deformations. This considered vocabulary is\nessentially descriptive and related to regional to outcrop scales, excluding\nmicroscopic, orogenic, and tectonic plate structures. The ontology is molded in\nOWL 2, validated by competency questions with two use cases, and tested using\nan in-house ontology-driven data entry application. The work of GeoFault\nprovides a solid framework for disambiguating fault knowledge and a foundation\nof fault data integration for the applications and the users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 14:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

However, FCM and its\nmany accelerated variants have low efficiency in the mid-to-late stage of the\nclustering process. In this stage, all samples are involved in the update of\ntheir non-affinity centers, and the fuzzy membership grades of the most of\nsamples, whose assignment is unchanged, are still updated by calculating the\nsamples-centers distances. All those lead to the algorithms converging slowly.\nIn this paper, a new affinity filtering technique is developed to recognize a\ncomplete set of the non-affinity centers for each sample with low computations.\nThen, a new membership scaling technique is suggested to set the membership\ngrades between each sample and its non-affinity centers to 0 and maintain the\nfuzzy membership grades for others. By integrating those two techniques, FCM\nbased on new affinity filtering and membership scaling (AMFCM) is proposed to\naccelerate the whole convergence process of FCM. Many experimental results\nperformed on synthetic and real-world data sets have shown the feasibility and\nefficiency of the proposed algorithm.

The\nexposition concludes with the equivalence of some of the traditional calculus\ntheorems to the completeness of an ordered field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 14:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Such duality is already practiced in software engineering, in\nwhich the current dominant modeling thesis is object orientation. This work\nembraces an anti-thesis that centers solely on the process rather than\nemphasizing the object. The approach is called occurrence-only modeling, in\nwhich an occurrence means an event or process where a process is defined as an\norchestrated net of events that form a semantical whole. In contrast to object\norientation, in this occurrence-only modeling objects are nothing more than\nlong events. We apply this paradigm to (1) a UML/BPMN inventory system in\nsimulation engineering and (2) an event-based system that represents medical\noccurrences that occur on a timeline. The aim of such a venture is to enhance\nthe field of conceptual modeling by adding yet a new alternative methodology\nand clarifying differences among approaches. Conceptual modeling s importance\nhas been recognized in many research areas. An active research community in\nsimulation engineering demonstrates the growing interest in conceptual\nmodeling.

In this\nwork, we combine two reachability analysis techniques, i.e., backward reachable\nset (BRS) and stochastic forward reachable set (FRS), and propose an integrated\nprobabilistic collision detection framework in highway driving. Within the\nframework, we can firstly use a BRS to formally check whether a two-vehicle\ninteraction is safe; otherwise, a prediction-based stochastic FRS is employed\nto estimate a collision probability at each future time step.

To\nconstruct the stochastic FRS, we develop a neural network-based acceleration\nmodel for surrounding vehicles, and further incorporate confidence-aware\ndynamic belief to improve the prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments are\nconducted to validate the performance of the acceleration prediction model\nbased on naturalistic highway driving data, and the efficiency and\neffectiveness of the framework with the infused confidence belief are tested\nboth in naturalistic and simulated highway scenarios.

Taking both passive and active\nattacks into account, we propose the ITSBFT-QKD networks to defend against\nuntrusted nodes and achieve end-to-end key distribution. In end-to-end key\ndistribution, multiple participating nodes are required to establish trust\nrelationships and cooperate with each other. To prevent attackers from breaking\ntrust relationship and gaining an unreasonable advantage, we incorporate a\nbyzantine consensus scheme to establish and transmit trust relationships in a\nglobal QKD network perspective. Moreover, since the security of traditional\nconsensus schemes is lower than the security requirement of QKD networks, we\ndevise a byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) signature scheme to ensure the\ninformation-theoretic security of consensus. It provides a new way to construct\nsignature schemes with point-to-point QKD keys in the presence of untrusted\nrelays or nodes. The security of our scheme is analyzed thoroughly from\nmultiple aspects. Our scheme can accommodate up to $ MIN\\left( C-1,\\lfloor\n\\frac{N-1}{3} \\rfloor \\right) $ untrusted nodes, where $C$ is the node\nconnectivity of the network and $N$ is the number of nodes in the network. Our\nscheme provides the highest level of security in currently relay-based QKD\nnetworks and will significantly promote the application of QKD networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 11:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

In this\nletter, a time-dependent collective Hamiltonian model is constructed in the\nframework of the microscopic frozen Hartree-Fock approximation. The model\npresents a formalism to treat the generation of the angular momenta in the\nfission fragments due to the quantum uncertainty principle as well as the\ndynamics of the collective wave function during scission and the Coulomb\nreorientation phase. The model is able to describe a large part of the angular\nmomentum found in experimental data.

We applied Neural Style Transfer\n(NST) to generate 360$^\\circ$ VR environments that elicited users' varied\nvalence and arousal responses. From a user study with 30 participants, findings\nsuggested that generative VR environments changed participants' arousal\nresponses but not their valence levels. The generated visual features, e.g.,\ntextures and colors, also altered participants' affective perceptions. Our work\ncontributes novel insights about how users respond to generative VR\nenvironments and provided a strategy for creating affective VR environments\nwithout altering content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 10:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}

In this investigation, a novel approach of combining\ntwo-photon absorption, SLM and vector path guided by scalable vector graphics\n(SVG) has been developed and tested preliminarily, for fast, flexible and\nparallel nanofabrication. Three laser focuses are independently controlled with\ndifferent paths, which are according to SVG, to optimize fabrication and\npromote time efficiency. The minimum structure width can be as low as 74 nm.\nAccompanied with a translation stage, a carp structure of 18.16 $\\mu$m by 24.35\n$\\mu$m has been fabricated. This method shows the possibility of developing LDW\ntechniques towards full-electrical system, and provides a potential way to\nefficiently engrave complex structures on nanoscales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 01:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}
