In this paper, we\nsystematically explore LLMs capacity to augment cross-domain analogical\nreasoning. Across three studies, we found: 1) LLM-generated cross-domain\nanalogies were frequently judged as helpful in the context of a problem\nreformulation task (median 4 out of 5 helpfulness rating), and frequently (~80%\nof cases) led to observable changes in problem formulations, and 2) there was\nan upper bound of 25% of outputs bring rated as potentially harmful, with a\nmajority due to potentially upsetting content, rather than biased or toxic\ncontent.

However, this approach forces the model\nto distribute non-zero (sometimes large) probability mass to all training\nsamples regardless of their quality. Moreover, in the attempt to cover the\nlow-probability regions in the data distribution, the model systematically\noverestimates the probability of corrupted text sequences, which we conjecture\nis one of the main reasons for text degeneration during autoregressive\ndecoding. To remedy this problem, we leverage the total variation distance\n(TVD) with its robustness to outliers, and develop practical bounds to apply it\nto language generation.

For nodal discontinuous spectral element approximations of these\nunder-resolved flows, the collocation projection of the nonlinear flux onto the\nspace spanned by the solution approximation can introduce aliasing errors which\ncan result in numerical instabilities, leading to nonphysical solutions or the\nfailure of the scheme altogether. In Dzanic and Witherden (J. Comput.

At the\nheart of the intelligent control of these AEPs is the policy guiding the\nsequential experiments, which is to choose the location to carry out the next\nexperiment. In such cases, a balance between exploitation and exploration must\nbe achieved. A Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework with Expected Improvement\nbased (EI-based) acquisition function can effectively search the MDS and guide\nwhere to conduct the next experiments so that the underlying relationship can\nbe identified with a smaller number of experiments. The traditional BO\nframework tries to optimize a black box objective function in a sequential\nmanner by relying on a single model. However, this single-model approach does\nnot account for model uncertainty. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) addresses\nthis issue by working with multiple models and thus considering the uncertainty\nin the models. In this work, we first apply the conventional BO algorithm with\nthe most popular EI-based experiment policy in a real-life fatigue dataset for\nsteel to predict the fatigue strength of steel.

We find that the\ncontent of such theories can be encoded in graphs, which generalize plumbing\ngraphs, and various operations in these theories can be represented in terms of\ntransformations of such graphs. The operations in question include gauging\nglobal symmetries, integrating out gauge nodes, which for theories without\nchiral multiplets corresponds to Kirby moves, and ST-transformations that\ninvolve chiral multiplets. The dualities such as mirror triality and SQED-XYZ\nduality can be also represented in terms of graphs, and enable us to find many\nnew dual theories by gauging global symmetries.

Computational models of CPGs have been widely used for\ninvestigating the spinal cord contribution to animal locomotion control in\ncomputational neuroscience and in bio-inspired robotics. However, the\ncontribution of supraspinal drive to anticipatory behavior, i.e. motor behavior\nthat involves planning ahead of time (e.g. of footstep placements), is not yet\nproperly understood. In particular, it is not clear whether the brain modulates\nCPG activity and/or directly modulates muscle activity (hence bypassing the\nCPG) for accurate foot placements. In this paper, we investigate the\ninteraction of supraspinal drive and a CPG in an anticipatory locomotion\nscenario that involves stepping over gaps. By employing deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL), we train a neural network policy that replicates the\nsupraspinal drive behavior. This policy can either modulate the CPG dynamics,\nor directly change actuation signals to bypass the CPG dynamics. Our results\nindicate that the direct supraspinal contribution to the actuation signal is a\nkey component for a high gap crossing success rate. However, the CPG dynamics\nin the spinal cord are beneficial for gait smoothness and energy efficiency.\nMoreover, our investigation shows that sensing the front feet distances to the\ngap is the most important and sufficient sensory information for learning gap\ncrossing. Our results support the biological hypothesis that cats and horses\nmainly control the front legs for obstacle avoidance, and that hind limbs\nfollow an internal memory based on the front limbs' information.

Conventional\ntechniques with lower PRF had a single pulse-in-air (SPIA) zone, large enough\nto avoid a mismatch among pulse pairs at the receiver.

WAL flushes log entries to persistent\nmemory before making the actual data persistent to ensure that a consistent\nstate can be recovered if a crash occurs. Performing WAL in hardware is\nattractive because it makes most aspects of log management transparent to\nsoftware, and it completes log persist operations (LPs) and data persist\noperations (DPs) in the background, overlapping them with the execution of\nother instructions.\n  Prior hardware logging solutions commit atomic regions synchronously. Once\nthe end of a region is reached, all outstanding persist operations required for\nthe region to commit must be completed before instruction execution may\nproceed. For undo logging, LPs and DPs are both performed synchronously to\nensure that the region commits synchronously. For redo logging, DPs can be\nperformed asynchronously, but LPs are performed synchronously to ensure that\nthe region commits synchronously. In both cases, waiting for synchronous\npersist operations (LP or DP) at the end of an atomic region causes atomic\nregions to incur high latency.\n  To tackle this limitation, we propose ASAP, a hardware logging solution that\nallows atomic regions to commit asynchronously. That is, once the end of an\natomic region is reached, instruction execution may proceed without waiting for\noutstanding persist operations to complete. As such, both LPs and DPs can be\nperformed asynchronously. The challenge with allowing atomic regions to commit\nasynchronously is that it can lead to control and data dependence violations in\nthe commit order of the atomic regions, leaving data in an unrecoverable state\nin case of a crash. To address this issue, ASAP tracks and enforces control and\ndata dependencies between atomic regions in hardware to ensure that the regions\ncommit in the proper order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 19:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

However, real-world time-series data\noften include missing values, and the existing approaches require imputing\nmissing values before clustering, which may cause extensive computations and\nnoise and result in invalid interpretations. To address these challenges, we\npresent a Self-supervised Learning-based Approach to Clustering multivariate\nTime-series data with missing values (SLAC-Time). SLAC-Time is a\nTransformer-based clustering method that uses time-series forecasting as a\nproxy task for leveraging unlabeled data and learning more robust time-series\nrepresentations. This method jointly learns the neural network parameters and\nthe cluster assignments of the learned representations.

Despite rapid development in this field, very few have studied how to\nefficiently boost synchronization. Homodyne measurement emerges as one of the\nsuccessful candidates for this task, but preferably in the semi-classical\nregime. In our work, we focus on the phase synchronization of a harmonic-driven\nquantum Stuart-Landau oscillator, and show that the enhancement induced by\nhomodyne measurement persists into the quantum regime. Interestingly, optimal\ntwo-photon damping rates exist when the oscillator and driving are at resonance\nand with a small single-photon damping rate.

To focus only on\nthe important letters, the $n^{th}$ spellings of each semantic unit are aligned\nin $n^{th}$ attention heads, then concatenated back into original forms\ncreating unique embedding representations; they are jointly projected thereby\ndetermining own contextual importance. Technically, this framework is achieved\nby passing a sequence of materials, each consists of $v$ elements, to a\ntransformer having $h=v$ attention heads.

Unfortunately, FL faces two critical challenges\nthat hinder its actual performance: data distribution heterogeneity and high\nresource costs brought by large foundation models. Specifically, the non-IID\ndata in different clients make existing FL algorithms hard to converge while\nthe high resource costs, including computational and communication costs that\nincrease the deployment difficulty in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we\npropose an effective yet simple method, named FedCLIP, to achieve fast\ngeneralization and personalization for CLIP in federated learning. Concretely,\nwe design an attention-based adapter for the large model, CLIP, and the rest\noperations merely depend on adapters. Lightweight adapters can make the most\nuse of pretrained model information and ensure models be adaptive for clients\nin specific tasks. Simultaneously, small-scale operations can mitigate the\ncomputational burden and communication burden caused by large models. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on three datasets with distribution shifts.\nQualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that FedCLIP significantly\noutperforms other baselines (9% overall improvements on PACS) and effectively\nreduces computational and communication costs (283x faster than FedAVG).

We discuss several issues that need to be\nresolved before one can declare victory: (1) delta-function normalizable\neigenmodes of the kinetic operator do not form a representation of the\nsupersymmetry algebra since the Killing spinors grow exponentially as we\napproach the asymptotic boundary of the near horizon geometry, (2) the\nlogarithmic contributions coming from various one loop determinants are\nsensitive to the ultraviolet cut-off and therefore without detailed knowledge\nof the ultraviolet cut-off one cannot determine the order one correction to the\nentropy that could depend on the ratios of the charges, (3) the results of\nindex theorem indicate that there are additional flat directions of the\nlocalization action, at least at the quadratic order, than what has been\nconsidered so far.

Existing policy models usually\nimitate action combinations from the labeled multi-action dialog examples. Due\nto data limitations, they generalize poorly toward unseen dialog flows. While\nreinforcement learning-based methods are proposed to incorporate the service\nratings from real users and user simulators as external supervision signals,\nthey suffer from sparse and less credible dialog-level rewards. To cope with\nthis problem, we explore to improve multi-action dialog policy learning with\nexplicit and implicit turn-level user feedback received for historical\npredictions (i.e., logged user feedback) that are cost-efficient to collect and\nfaithful to real-world scenarios. The task is challenging since the logged user\nfeedback provides only partial label feedback limited to the particular\nhistorical dialog actions predicted by the agent. To fully exploit such\nfeedback information, we propose BanditMatch, which addresses the task from a\nfeedback-enhanced semi-supervised learning perspective with a hybrid objective\nof semi-supervised learning and bandit learning. BanditMatch integrates\npseudo-labeling methods to better explore the action space through constructing\nfull label feedback. Extensive experiments show that our BanditMatch\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods by generating more concise and\ninformative responses.

However, the question of the efficient tuning\nof ensemble parameters has received relatively little attention. In this paper,\nwe propose a cross-validation method, ECV (Extrapolated Cross-Validation), for\ntuning the ensemble and subsample sizes of randomized ensembles. Our method\nbuilds on two main ingredients: two initial estimators for small ensemble sizes\nusing out-of-bag errors and a novel risk extrapolation technique leveraging the\nstructure of the prediction risk decomposition. By establishing uniform\nconsistency over ensemble and subsample sizes, we show that ECV yields\n$\\delta$-optimal (with respect to the oracle-tuned risk) ensembles for squared\nprediction risk. Our theory accommodates general ensemble predictors, requires\nmild moment assumptions, and allows for high-dimensional regimes where the\nfeature dimension grows with the sample size. As an illustrative example, we\nemploy ECV to predict surface protein abundances from gene expressions in\nsingle-cell multiomics using random forests. Compared to sample-split\ncross-validation and K-fold cross-validation, ECV achieves higher accuracy\navoiding sample splitting.

To mitigate such threats, a batch of defense\nmethods are proposed, focusing on the untargeted scenarios. Unfortunately, they\neither require extra trustworthy applications or make models more vulnerable to\ntargeted BFAs. Countermeasures against targeted BFAs, stealthier and more\npurposeful by nature, are far from well established.\n  In this work, we propose Aegis, a novel defense method to mitigate targeted\nBFAs. The core observation is that existing targeted attacks focus on flipping\ncritical bits in certain important layers. Thus, we design a dynamic-exit\nmechanism to attach extra internal classifiers (ICs) to hidden layers. This\nmechanism enables input samples to early-exit from different layers, which\neffectively upsets the adversary's attack plans. Moreover, the dynamic-exit\nmechanism randomly selects ICs for predictions during each inference to\nsignificantly increase the attack cost for the adaptive attacks where all\ndefense mechanisms are transparent to the adversary. We further propose a\nrobustness training strategy to adapt ICs to the attack scenarios by simulating\nBFAs during the IC training phase, to increase model robustness.

Additionally, datasets used to train\nGNNs need to offer flexibility to enable a thorough study of the impact of\nvarious factors while training GNN models.\n  In this work, we introduce the Illinois Graph Benchmark (IGB), a research\ndataset tool that the developers can use to train, scrutinize and\nsystematically evaluate GNN models with high fidelity. IGB includes both\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous graphs of enormous sizes, with more than 40% of\ntheir nodes labeled. Compared to the largest graph datasets publicly available,\nthe IGB provides over 162X more labeled data for deep learning practitioners\nand developers to create and evaluate models with higher accuracy. The IGB\ndataset is designed to be flexible, enabling the study of various GNN\narchitectures, embedding generation techniques, and analyzing system\nperformance issues. IGB is open-sourced, supports DGL and PyG frameworks, and\ncomes with releases of the raw text that we believe foster emerging language\nmodels and GNN research projects. An early public version of IGB is available\nat https://github.com/IllinoisGraphBenchmark/IGB-Datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 05:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

However, current studies mainly focus on\ncombining the exclusively learned representations of different modalities,\ninstead of exploring the modal relationships during each respective modeling.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel visual modality enhanced end-to-end KWS\nframework (VE-KWS), which fuses audio and visual modalities from two aspects.\nThe first one is utilizing the speaker location information obtained from the\nlip region in videos to assist the training of multi-channel audio beamformer.\nBy involving the beamformer as an audio enhancement module, the acoustic\ndistortions, caused by the far field or noisy environments, could be\nsignificantly suppressed.

This leaves it to the\nsecurity mechanism to discover and account for API proxies, i.e., groups of\nAPIs which together approximate the functionality of some other API. Lacking a\ncomplete view of the structure of the API-proxy relationship, current security\nmechanisms address it in an ad-hoc and reactive manner, by updating the\nimplementation when new API proxies are uncovered and abused by attackers.\n  We analyze the problem of discovering API-proxy relationships and show that\nits complexity makes it NP-complete, which makes computing exact information\nabout API proxies prohibitively expensive for modern API surfaces that consist\nof tens of thousands of APIs.

In this paper, we propose the first\nstereo SSC method named OccDepth, which fully exploits implicit depth\ninformation from stereo images (or RGBD images) to help the recovery of 3D\ngeometric structures.

In this\nwork, we explore whether this widely applicable paradigm can be implemented on\nquantum computers that will be available immediately after the current NISQ\nstage. To this end, we develop three variants of LCU and apply each, to quantum\nalgorithms of practical interest.\n  First, we develop a physically motivated, continuous-time analogue of LCU\n(``Analog LCU''). This technique, implementable on hybrid qubit-qumode systems,\nis simpler than its discrete-time counterpart. We use this method to develop\nanalog quantum algorithms for ground state preparation and quantum linear\nsystems. We also develop a randomized quantum algorithm to sample from\nfunctions of Hamiltonians applied to quantum states (``Single-Ancilla LCU'').\nThis approach repeatedly samples from a short-depth quantum circuit and uses\nonly a single ancilla qubit. We use this to estimate expectation values of\nobservables in the ground states of a Hamiltonian, and in the solution of\nquantum linear systems. This method is suitable for early fault-tolerant\nquantum computers. Our third approach stems from the observation that for\nseveral applications, it suffices to replace LCU with randomized sampling of\nunitaries according to the distribution of the LCU coefficients (``Ancilla-free\nLCU''). This is particularly useful when one is interested in the projection of\na quantum state implemented by an LCU procedure in some subspace of interest.\nWe demonstrate that this technique applies to the spatial search problem and\nhelps establish a relationship between discrete and continuous-time quantum\nwalks with their classical counterparts.

We reveal that such 1D chiral anomaly leads to the\nhalf-integer quantization of topological Thouless pump and the anomalous\ndynamics of chiral displacement. Moreover, we investigate the evolution of 1D\nchiral anomaly with respect to two typical types of disorder, i.e., on-site\ndisorder and bond disorder. The results show that the on-site disorder tends to\nsmear the gapless Dirac cone.

Thus, 3SFC can achieve an extremely low\ncompression rate when the constructed dataset contains only one data sample.\nMoreover, 3SFC's compressing phase utilizes a similarity-based objective\nfunction so that it can be optimized with just one step, thereby considerably\nimproving its performance and robustness. In addition, to minimize the\ncompressing error, error feedback (EF) is also incorporated into 3SFC.\nExperiments on multiple datasets and models suggest that 3SFC owns\nsignificantly better convergence rates compared to competing methods with lower\ncompression rates (up to 0.02%).

Based on our findings, we propose a reweighting\nframework that down-weights the losses incurred by abrupt changes and\nup-weights those by normal states.

However, it is still a challenge for robots\nto detect in-hand object slip through visuo-tactile fusion. To address this\nissue, a novel visuo-tactile fusion deep neural network is proposed to detect\nslip, which is a time-dependent continuous action. By using the multi-scale\ntemporal convolution network (MS-TCN) to extract the temporal features of\nvisual and tactile data, the slip can be detected effectively. In this paper, a\n7-dregree-of-freedom (7-DoF) robot manipulator equipped with a camera and a\ntactile sensor is used for data collection on 50 daily objects with different\nshapes, materials, sizes, and weights. Therefore, a dataset is built, where the\ngrasping data of 40 objects and 10 objects are used for network training and\ntesting, respectively. The detection accuracy is 96.96% based on the proposed\nmodel. Also, the proposed model is compared with a visuo-tactile fusion deep\nneural network (DNN) based on long short-term memory network (LSTM) on the\ncollected dataset and a public dataset using the GelSight tactile sensor.

There is a short\ntimescale on which enzymes bind to substrate molecules to produce bound\ncomplexes, and a comparatively long timescale on which the complex is\ntransformed into a product. The rate at which the substrate is converted into\nproduct is characteristically non-linear and is traditionally derived by\napplying of singular perturbation theory to the system's governing equations.\nCentral to this analysis is the assumption that complex formation is\neffectively instantaneous on the timescale over which significant substrate\ndegradation occurs.

Recently, huge interest has been devoted to the design of mechanisms\nfor imperfectly rational agents, i.e., mechanisms for which agents are able to\neasily grasp that there is no action different from following the protocol that\nwould satisfy their interests better. This work has culminated in the\ndefinition of Obviously Strategyproof (OSP) Mechanisms, that have been shown to\ncapture the incentives of agents without contingent reasoning skills.\n  Without an understanding of the algorithmic nature of OSP mechanisms, it is\nhard to assess how well these mechanisms can satisfy the goals of the planner.\nFor the case of binary allocation problems and agents whose private type is a\nsingle number, recent work has shown that a generalization of greedy completely\ncharacterizes OSP. In this work, we strengthen the connection between greedy\nand OSP by providing a characterization of OSP mechanisms for all optimization\nproblems involving these single-parameter agents. Specifically, we prove that\nOSP mechanisms must essentially work as follows: they either greedily look for\nagents with ``better'' types and allocate them larger outcomes; or reverse\ngreedily look for agents with ``worse'' types and allocate them smaller\noutcomes; or, finally, split the domain of agents in ``good'' and ``bad''\ntypes, and subsequently proceed in a reverse greedy fashion for the former and\ngreedily for the latter. We further demonstrate how to use this\ncharacterization to give bounds on the approximation guarantee of OSP\nmechanisms for the well known scheduling related machines problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 10:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

HESS J1809$-$193 is an unassociated very-high-energy $\\gamma$-ray\nsource located on the Galactic plane. While it has been connected to the nebula\nof the energetic pulsar PSR J1809$-$1917, supernova remnants and molecular\nclouds present in the vicinity also constitute possible associations. Recently,\nthe detection of $\\gamma$-ray emission up to energies of $\\sim$100 TeV with the\nHAWC observatory has led to renewed interest in HESS J1809$-$193.\n  Aims. We aim to understand the origin of the $\\gamma$-ray emission of HESS\nJ1809$-$193.\n  Methods. We analysed 93.2 h of data taken on HESS J1809$-$193 above 0.27 TeV\nwith the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), using a multi-component,\nthree-dimensional likelihood analysis. In addition, we provide a new analysis\nof 12.5 yr of Fermi-LAT data above 1 GeV within the region of HESS J1809$-$193.\nThe obtained results are interpreted in a time-dependent modelling framework.\n  Results. For the first time, we were able to resolve the emission detected\nwith H.E.S.S. into two components: an extended component that exhibits a\nspectral cut-off at $\\sim$13 TeV, and a compact component that is located close\nto PSR J1809$-$1917 and shows no clear spectral cut-off. The Fermi-LAT analysis\nalso revealed extended $\\gamma$-ray emission, on scales similar to that of the\nextended H.E.S.S. component.\n  Conclusions. Our modelling indicates that based on its spectrum and spatial\nextent, the extended H.E.S.S. component is likely caused by inverse Compton\nemission from old electrons that form a halo around the pulsar wind nebula. The\ncompact component could be connected to either the pulsar wind nebula or the\nsupernova remnant and molecular clouds. Due to its comparatively steep\nspectrum, modelling the Fermi-LAT emission together with the H.E.S.S.\ncomponents is not straightforward.

The sub-antennas can in their turn be implemented like\n(regular) 2D arrays of simple radiating elements, realizing an overall\n(distributed) antenna architecture that we call \"Formation of Arrays\" (FoA).\nThe satellites that implement this radiating architecture need to be relatively\nclose to each other and constitute a formation of flying objects, to be\ncoordinated and controlled as a whole. In this paper, we develop a theoretical\nanalysis of an FoA antenna, and we show how to take advantage of this new\ntechnology to improve network throughput in a multi-beam S-band mobile\ncommunication network with low-earth or geostationary orbiting satellites\ndirectly providing 5G-like communication services to hand-held user terminals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 11:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

However, the memory kernel is often unknown, and accurately\npredicting or measuring it via e.g. a numerical inverse Laplace transform\nremains a herculean task.

We re-examine the Fornax Cluster\ndwarf population from the point of view of isomass-radius--stellar mass\nrelations (IRSMRs) using the Fornax Deep Survey Dwarf galaxy Catalogue, with\nthe centrally located (among dwarfs) $3.63 \\mathcal{M}_{\\odot}$~pc$^{-2}$\nisodensity radius defining our fiducial relation. This relation is a powerful\ndiagnostic tool for identifying dwarfs with unusual structure, as dwarf\ngalaxies' remarkable monotonicity in light profile shapes, as a function of\nstellar mass, reduces the relation's scatter tremendously. By examining how\ndifferent dwarf properties (colour, tenth-nearest-neighbour distance, etc.)\ncorrelate with distance from our fiducial relation, we find a significant\npopulation of structural outliers with comparatively lower central mass surface\ndensity and larger half-light-radii, residing in locally denser regions in the\ncluster, albeit with similar red colours.

Considering many applications of Euclidean clustering\nalgorithms are in small dimensions and the lack of systematic studies in the\ncurrent literature, this paper investigates coresets for $k$-Median in small\ndimensions. For small $d$, a natural question is whether existing near-optimal\ndimension-independent bounds can be significantly improved.

A standard approach is training recurrent models\non measurement data. While these models typically provide exact short-term\npredictions, accumulating errors yield deteriorated long-term behavior. In\ncontrast, models with reliable long-term predictions can often be obtained,\neither by training a robust but less detailed model, or by leveraging\nphysics-based simulations. In both cases, inaccuracies in the models yield a\nlack of short-time details. Thus, different models with contrastive properties\non different time horizons are available. This observation immediately raises\nthe question: Can we obtain predictions that combine the best of both worlds?\nInspired by sensor fusion tasks, we interpret the problem in the frequency\ndomain and leverage classical methods from signal processing, in particular\ncomplementary filters. This filtering technique combines two signals by\napplying a high-pass filter to one signal, and low-pass filtering the other.\nEssentially, the high-pass filter extracts high-frequencies, whereas the\nlow-pass filter extracts low frequencies. Applying this concept to dynamics\nmodel learning enables the construction of models that yield accurate long- and\nshort-term predictions.

To\nthis end, we propose a simple and novel Self Correspondence Distillation (SCD)\nmethod to refine pseudo-labels without introducing external supervision. Our\nSCD enables the network to utilize feature correspondence derived from itself\nas a distillation target, which can enhance the network's feature learning\nprocess by complementing semantic information. In addition, to further improve\nthe segmentation accuracy, we design a Variation-aware Refine Module to enhance\nthe local consistency of pseudo-labels by computing pixel-level variation.\nFinally, we present an efficient end-to-end Transformer-based framework (TSCD)\nvia SCD and Variation-aware Refine Module for the accurate WSSS task.

Despite active DA methods address this by\nfurther proposing targetness to measure the representativeness of target domain\ncharacteristics, their predictive uncertainty is usually based on the\nprediction of deterministic models, which can easily be miscalibrated on data\nwith distribution shift. Considering this, we propose a \\textit{Dirichlet-based\nUncertainty Calibration} (DUC) approach for active DA, which simultaneously\nachieves the mitigation of miscalibration and the selection of informative\ntarget samples. Specifically, we place a Dirichlet prior on the prediction and\ninterpret the prediction as a distribution on the probability simplex, rather\nthan a point estimate like deterministic models. This manner enables us to\nconsider all possible predictions, mitigating the miscalibration of unilateral\nprediction. Then a two-round selection strategy based on different uncertainty\norigins is designed to select target samples that are both representative of\ntarget domain and conducive to discriminability. Extensive experiments on\ncross-domain image classification and semantic segmentation validate the\nsuperiority of DUC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 14:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

However, the standard version of\nRB is limited because it only benchmarks a processor's native gates indirectly,\nby using them in composite $n$-qubit Clifford gates. Standard RB's reliance on\n$n$-qubit Clifford gates restricts it to the few-qubit regime, because the\nfidelity of a typical composite $n$-qubit Clifford gate decreases rapidly with\nincreasing $n$. Furthermore, although standard RB is often used to infer the\nerror rate of native gates, by rescaling standard RB's error per Clifford to an\nerror per native gate, this is an unreliable extrapolation. Direct RB is a\nmethod that addresses these limitations of standard RB, by directly\nbenchmarking a customizable gate set, such as a processor's native gates. Here\nwe provide a detailed introduction to direct RB, we discuss how to design\ndirect RB experiments, and we present two complementary theories for direct RB.\nThe first of these theories uses the concept of error propagation or scrambling\nin random circuits to show that direct RB is reliable for gates that experience\nstochastic Pauli errors. We prove that the direct RB decay is a single\nexponential, and that the decay rate is equal to the average infidelity of the\nbenchmarked gates, under broad circumstances. This theory shows that group\ntwirling is not required for reliable RB. Our second theory proves that direct\nRB is reliable for gates that experience general gate-dependent Markovian\nerrors, using similar techniques to contemporary theories for standard RB. Our\ntwo theories for direct RB have complementary regimes of applicability, and\nthey provide complementary perspectives on why direct RB works. Together these\ntheories provide comprehensive guarantees on the reliability of direct RB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 14:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

In\ncontrast, the current attention to certain extent still focus on the\ndescription of critical phenomena and the classification of the associated\nphase transition along with the Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson paradigm, where the key\nissue is to identify phenomenologically order parameters and related\nsymmetries. This brings the question to topological phase transitions (TPTs),\nwhere no obvious order parameter and the broken symmetry are identified. Here\nwe present a unified pattern description of the second-order quantum phase\ntransition (QPT) and TPT, both involved in the one-dimensional anisotropic\nquantum XY model in a transverse field, which contains the transverse Ising\nmodel (TIM) as a limit case. Away from the TIM, the XY model enters the\nferromagnetic phase (marked by a second-order QPT or a direct TPT) as\nincreasing ferromagentic exchange coupling, a series of TPTs occur, which are\nabsent in the TIM. The TPTs behave like the first-order QPTs. In the isotropic\nand large exchange coupling cases, the ground state of the XY model is\ndominated by two topologically different vortices along positive and negative\ndirection of the transverse field. We confirm the above conclusion by analyzing\nthe energy contributions of the patterns to the ground state and calculating\nthe ground state pattern occupations of the XY model.

In practice, patient-donor pairs register with so-called kidney\nexchange platforms which determine exchange cycles in a centralized fashion.\nSuch a centralized approach raises numerous security concerns. Thus, several\nprivacy-preserving protocols for solving the KEP have been proposed recently.\nHowever, the protocols known to date lack scalability in practice since the KEP\nis an NP-complete problem. We address this issue by proposing a novel\nprivacy-preserving protocol which computes an approximate solution to the KEP\nthat scales well for the large numbers of patient-donor pairs encountered in\npractice. In contrast to the only other existing protocol that computes an\napproximate solution to the KEP, our protocol is entirely data oblivious and it\nexhibits a far superior run time performance without suffering a loss in the\nquality of the approximation. As a second contribution, we simulate the\napplication of our novel protocol as part of a kidney exchange platform, where\npatient-donor pairs register and de-register over time and exchanges are\ndetermined on a regular basis. In this dynamic setting, the application of our\nnovel privacy-preserving approximation protocol yields a larger number of\ntransplants over time than using the best known privacy-preserving protocol for\nsolving the KEP. Our simulation further shows that the difference between the\nnumber of transplants found when using our novel protocol in this dynamic\nsetting compared to the non-privacy-preserving state-of-the-art approach is\nnegligible in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 15:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

A\nflat-universe prior gives slightly an improved $H_0 = 70.9^{+4.2}_{-2.9}$~km\ns$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. When combining Lensing+GRB+SN Ia, the error bar $\\Delta\nH_0$ falls by 25\\%, whereas $\\Omega_{K,0}$ is not improved due to the\ndegeneracy between SN Ia absolute magnitude, $M_B$, and $H_0$ along with the\nmismatch between the SN Ia and GRB Hubble diagrams at $z\\gtrsim 1.4$. Future\nincrement of GRB observations can help to moderately eliminate the $M_B-H_0$\ndegeneracy in SN Ia distances and ameliorate the restrictions on cosmographic\nparameters along with $\\Omega_{K,0}$ when combining Lensing+SN Ia+GRB. We\nconclude that there is no evidence of significant deviation from a (an) flat\n(accelerating) universe and $H_0$ is currently determined at 3\\% precision. The\nmeasurements show great potential to arbitrate the $H_0$ tension between the\nlocal distance ladder and cosmic microwave background measurements and provide\na relevant consistency test of the FLRW metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 15:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

The bump is\nlocated at the impingement position of the shock wave and is moved at different\nspeeds. This study determines the suitable speed that achieves the minimum\nentropy change, which is the representation parameter of the transition period.\nThe two-dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes equations are solved using OpenFOAM\nto simulate the flow field variables, while the motion of the bump is tracked\nusing the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) technique. The results show that\na spatial lag on the shock system from the steady-state solution occurs due to\nthe movement of the bump. Further, the spatial lag increases with the increase\nin the bump's speed. This causes a high increase in the flow parameters and\nconsequently the total entropy changes on the bump surface. Generally, it is\ncommon to move the bump over the longest possible time to approximate a\nquasi-steady flow during the motion. However, this causes a deviation in the\nflow parameters between the final time of transition and the steady-state case\nof bump existence.

The critical advantage of HGNNs is their ability to handle\ndiverse node and edge types in HINs by extracting and utilizing the abundant\nsemantic information for effective representation learning. However, as a\nwidespread phenomenon in many real-world scenarios, the class-imbalance\ndistribution in HINs creates a performance bottleneck for existing HGNNs. Apart\nfrom the quantity imbalance of nodes, another more crucial and distinctive\nchallenge in HINs is semantic imbalance. Minority classes in HINs often lack\ndiverse and sufficient neighbor nodes, resulting in biased and incomplete\nsemantic information. This semantic imbalance further compounds the difficulty\nof accurately classifying minority nodes, leading to the performance\ndegradation of HGNNs. To tackle the imbalance of minority classes and\nsupplement their inadequate semantics, we present the first method for the\nsemantic imbalance problem in imbalanced HINs named Semantic-aware Node\nSynthesis (SNS). By assessing the influence on minority classes, SNS adaptively\nselects the heterogeneous neighbor nodes and augments the network with\nsynthetic nodes while preserving the minority semantics. In addition, we\nintroduce two regularization approaches for HGNNs that constrain the\nrepresentation of synthetic nodes from both semantic and class perspectives to\neffectively suppress the potential noises from synthetic nodes, facilitating\nmore expressive embeddings for classification. The comprehensive experimental\nstudy demonstrates that SNS consistently outperforms existing methods by a\nlarge margin in different benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 00:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Observability is a concept\nintroduced here to measure the distinguishability (or traceability) that a\nphysical object exhibits during its dynamics. To quantify observability, we\nassume that the Planck constant defines the discrete amount of action a\nphysical object needs to exhibit in order to be observable. Then, observability\nis calculated by 1.) dividing the action variable along the classical path by\nthe Planck constant, and 2.) adding information metrics on distinguishability\ndue to vacuum fluctuations. The least observability principle not only recovers\nquantum formulations including the uncertainty relation and the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation in both position and momentum representations, but also brings in new\nresults on two fronts. At the conceptual level, we find that the information\nmetrics for vacuum fluctuations are responsible for manifesting entanglement\neffects without underlying physical interactions, implying that entanglement\neffects are non-causal. At the mathematical level, defining the information\nmetrics for vacuum fluctuations using more general definitions of relative\nentropy results in a generalized Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation that depends on the\norder of relative entropy.

However, as the forced alignment\ntechnologies have developed using speech audio, they might fail in alignment\nwhen the input speech audio is noise-corrupted or is not accessible. We focus\non that there is another component that the speech can be inferred from, the\nspeech video (i.e., talking face video). Since the drawbacks of audio-based\nforced alignment can be complemented using the visual information when the\naudio signal is under poor condition, we try to develop a novel video-based\nforced alignment method. However, different from audio forced alignment, it is\nchallenging to develop a reliable visual forced alignment technology for the\nfollowing two reasons: 1) Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) has a much lower\nperformance compared to audio-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and 2)\nthe translation from text to video is not reliable, so the method typically\nused for building audio forced alignment cannot be utilized in developing\nvisual forced alignment. In order to alleviate these challenges, in this paper,\nwe propose a new method that is appropriate for visual forced alignment, namely\nDeep Visual Forced Alignment (DVFA). The proposed DVFA can align the input\ntranscription (i.e., sentence) with the talking face video without accessing\nthe speech audio. Moreover, by augmenting the alignment task with anomaly case\ndetection, DVFA can detect mismatches between the input transcription and the\ninput video while performing the alignment. Therefore, we can robustly align\nthe text with the talking face video even if there exist error words in the\ntext.

Nevertheless, we were able to find multiple memory errors,\nfour soundness bugs in the original (which were not being exploited in MML), in\naddition to one non-critical bug which was being exploited in 46 different MML\narticles. We hope to use this checker as a base for proof export tooling, as\nwell as revitalizing development of the language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 02:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}
