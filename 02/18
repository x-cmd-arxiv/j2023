However, the size of 3D high-resolution data poses a\nsignificant challenge for data analysis and processing. Since only a few areas\nof the brain show structural changes highly associated with AD, the patch-based\nmethods dividing the whole image data into several small regular patches have\nshown promising for more efficient sMRI-based image analysis. The major\nchallenges of the patch-based methods on sMRI include identifying the\ndiscriminative patches, combining features from the discrete discriminative\npatches, and designing appropriate classifiers. This work proposes a novel\npatch-based deep learning network (sMRI-PatchNet) with explainable patch\nlocalisation and selection for AD diagnosis using sMRI. Specifically, it\nconsists of two primary components: 1) A fast and efficient explainable patch\nselection mechanism for determining the most discriminative patches based on\ncomputing the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) contribution to a transfer\nlearning model for AD diagnosis on massive medical data; and 2) A novel\npatch-based network for extracting deep features and AD classfication from the\nselected patches with position embeddings to retain position information,\ncapable of capturing the global and local information of inter- and\nintra-patches. This method has been applied for the AD classification and the\nprediction of the transitional state moderate cognitive impairment (MCI)\nconversion with real datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 16:01:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 02:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Attacking smart cards can\nhave severe consequences, such as losing money or leaking sensitive\ninformation. Although the security protections embedded in smart cards have\nevolved over the years, those with weak security properties are still commonly\nused. Among the different solutions, blocking cards are affordable devices to\nprotect smart cards. These devices are placed close to the smart cards,\ngenerating a noisy jamming signal or shielding them. Whereas vendors claim the\nreliability of their blocking cards, no previous study has ever focused on\nevaluating their effectiveness. In this paper, we shed light on the security\nthreats on smart cards even in the presence of blocking cards, showing the\npossibility of being bypassed by an attacker. We analyze blocking cards by\ninspecting their emitted signal and assessing a vulnerability in their internal\ndesign. We propose a novel attack that bypasses the jamming signal emitted by a\nblocking card and reads the content of the smart card. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of 14 blocking cards when protecting a MIFARE Ultralight smart\ncard and a MIFARE Classic card. We demonstrate that the protection of the 8\nblocking cards among the 14 we evaluate can be successfully bypassed to dump\nthe content of the smart card. Based on this observation, we propose a\ncountermeasure that may lead to the design of effective blocking cards. To\nassist further security improvement, the tool that we developed to inspect the\nspectrum emitted by blocking cards and set up our attack is made available in\nopen source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 16:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

Existing methods\nmainly focus on applying global data augmentation to generate different views\nof the skeleton sequence for contrastive learning. However, due to the rich\naction clues in the skeleton sequences, existing methods may only take a global\nperspective to learn to discriminate different skeletons without thoroughly\nleveraging the local relationship between different skeleton joints and video\nframes, which is essential for real-world applications. In this work, we\npropose a Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (PSTL) framework to exploit the\nlocal relationship from a partial skeleton sequences built by a unique\nspatio-temporal masking strategy. Specifically, we construct a\nnegative-sample-free triplet steam structure that is composed of an anchor\nstream without any masking, a spatial masking stream with Central Spatial\nMasking (CSM), and a temporal masking stream with Motion Attention Temporal\nMasking (MATM). The feature cross-correlation matrix is measured between the\nanchor stream and the other two masking streams, respectively. (1) Central\nSpatial Masking discards selected joints from the feature calculation process,\nwhere the joints with a higher degree of centrality have a higher possibility\nof being selected. (2) Motion Attention Temporal Masking leverages the motion\nof action and remove frames that move faster with a higher possibility. Our\nmethod achieves SOTA performance on NTU-60, NTU-120 and PKU-MMD under various\ndownstream tasks. A practical evaluation is performed where some skeleton\njoints are lost in downstream tasks. In contrast to previous methods that\nsuffer from large performance drops, our PSTL can still achieve remarkable\nresults, validating the robustness of our method.

This allows the\ndefinition of priors that encourage well separated and interpretable clusters.\nIn this work, we provide a unified framework for the construction and the\nBayesian analysis of random probability measures with interacting atoms,\nencompassing both repulsive and attractive behaviors. Specifically we derive\nclosed-form expressions for the posterior distribution, the marginal and\npredictive distributions, which were not previously available except for the\ncase of measures with i.i.d. atoms. We show how these quantities are\nfundamental both for prior elicitation and to develop new posterior simulation\nalgorithms for hierarchical mixture models. Our results are obtained without\nany assumption on the finite point process that governs the atoms of the random\nmeasure. Their proofs rely on new analytical tools borrowed from the theory of\nPalm calculus and that might be of independent interest.

Such methods\nassume that the system dynamics is given by a first order ODE, whereas robots\nare often governed by a second or higher order ODE involving configuration\nvariables and their time derivatives. To apply a collocation method, therefore,\nthe usual practice is to resort to the well known procedure of casting an M th\norder ODE into M first order ones. This manipulation, which in the continuous\ndomain is perfectly valid, leads to inconsistencies when the problem is\ndiscretized. Since the configuration variables and their time derivatives are\napproximated with polynomials of the same degree, their differential\ndependencies cannot be fulfilled, and the actual dynamics is not satisfied, not\neven at the collocation points. This paper draws attention to this problem, and\ndevelops improved versions of the trapezoidal and Hermite-Simpson collocation\nmethods that do not present these inconsistencies.

First, because the\nstandard definition of the Bondi angular momentum $J$ is subject to a\nsupertranslation ambiguity, it has been shown that when the corresponding flux\n$F_J$ is expanded in powers of Newton's constant $G$, it can start at either\n$O(G^2)$ or $O(G^3)$ depending on the choice of frame. This naturally raises\nthe question as to whether the $O(G^2)$ part of the flux is physically\nmeaningful. The second puzzle concerns a set of new methods for computing the\nflux that were recently developed using quantum field theory. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, it was found that they generally do not agree with the standard\nformula for $F_J$, except in the binary's center-of-mass frame. In this paper,\nwe show that the resolution to both of these puzzles lies in the careful\ninterpretation of $J$: Generically, the Bondi angular momentum $J$ is\n\\emph{not} equal to the mechanical angular momentum $\\mathcal{J}$ of the\nbinary, which is the actual quantity of interest. Rather, it is the sum of\n$\\mathcal{J}$ and an extra piece involving the shear of the gravitational\nfield. By separating these contributions, we obtain a new balance law, accurate\nto all orders in $G$, that equates the total loss in mechanical angular\nmomentum $\\Delta_\\mathcal{J}$ to the sum of a radiative term, which always\nstarts at $O(G^3)$, and a static term, which always starts at $O(G^2)$. We show\nthat each of these terms is invariant under supertranslations, and we find that\n$\\Delta_\\mathcal{J}$ matches the result from quantum field theory at least up\nto $O(G^2)$ in all Bondi frames.

We evolve these systems\nthroughout the inspiral, merger and postmerger phases to identify the impact of\nthe BH spins and the MR on any jet and their electromagnetic (EM) signatures.\nWe find that incipient jets are launched from both BHs regardless of the MR and\nalong the spin directions as long as the force-free parameter\n$B^2/(8\\,\\pi\\rho_0)$ in the funnel and above their poles is larger than one. At\nlarge distances the two jets merge into a single one what may prevent the EM\ndetection of individual jets. As the accretion rate reaches a quasistationary\nstate during predecoupling, we observe a sudden amplification of the outgoing\nPoynting luminosity that depends on the MR. Following merger, the sudden change\nin the direction of the spin of the BH remnant with respect to the spins of its\nprogenitors causes a reorientation of the jet, which drives a single,\nhigh-velocity, outward narrow beam collimated by a tightly wound, helical\nBfield which, in turn, boosts the Poynting luminosity. This effect is nearly MR\nindependent. During this process, a kink is produced in the Bfield lines,\nconfining the jet. The kink propagates along the jet but rapidly decays,\nleaving no memory of the spin-shift. Our results suggest that the merger of\nmisaligned, low-spinning, BHBH mergers in low-mass disks may not provide a\nviable scenario to explain X-shaped radio galaxies if other features are not\ntaken into account. However, the sudden changes in the outgoing luminosity at\nmerger may help to identify mergers of BHs in active galactic nuclei, shedding\nlight on BH growth mechanisms and the observed co-evolution of their host\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

We identified two candidate dual\nAGNs residing in apparent minor mergers with mass ratios of $\\sim$1:7 and\n$\\sim$1:30. SDSS fiber spectra show broad and narrow emission lines in the\nprimary nuclei of each merger while only a narrow [O III] emission line and a\nbroad and prominent H$\\alpha$/[N II] complex is observed in the secondary\nnuclei. The FWHMs of the broad H$\\alpha$ lines in the primary and secondary\nnuclei are inconsistent in each merger, suggesting that each nucleus in each\nmerger hosts a Type 1 AGN. However, spatially-resolved LBT optical spectroscopy\nreveal rest-frame stellar absorption features, indicating the secondary sources\nare foreground stars and that the previously detected broad lines are likely\nthe result of fiber spillover effects induced by the atmospheric seeing at the\ntime of the SDSS observations. This study demonstrates for the first time that\noptical spectroscopic searches for Type 1/Type 1 pairs similarly suffer from\nfiber spillover effects as has been observed previously for Seyfert 2 dual AGN\ncandidates. The presence of foreground stars may not have been clear if an\ninstrument with more limited wavelength range or limited sensitivity had been\nused.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 19:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

A canonical example is an\nactive Brownian particle (ABP) that moves at constant speed while its direction\nof motion undergoes rotational diffusion. When ABPs are confined within a\nchannel, they tend to accumulate at the channel walls, even when inter-particle\ninteractions are ignored. Each particle pushes on the boundary until a tumble\nevent reverses its direction. The wall thus acts as a sticky boundary. In this\npaper we consider a natural extension of sticky boundaries that allows for a\nparticle to be permanently killed (absorbed) whilst attached to a wall. In\nparticular, we investigate the first passage time (FPT) problem for an ABP in a\ntwo-dimensional channel where one of the walls is partially absorbing.\nCalculating the exact FPT statistics requires solving a non-trivial two-way\ndiffusion boundary value problem (BVP). We follow a different approach by\nseparating out the dynamics away from the absorbing wall from the dynamics of\nabsorption and escape whilst attached to the wall. Using probabilistic methods,\nwe derive an explicit expression for the MFPT of absorption, assuming that the\narrival statistics of particles at the wall are known.

Android apps are\nevent-driven programs. Unfortunately, generating all possible types of events\nby interacting with the app's interface is challenging for an automated testing\napproach. Callback-driven testing eliminates the need for event generation by\ndirectly invoking app callbacks. However, existing callback-driven testing\ntechniques assume prior knowledge of Android callbacks, and they rely on a\nhuman expert, who is familiar with the Android API, to write stub code that\nprepares callback arguments before invocation. Since the Android API is huge\nand keeps evolving, prior techniques could only support a small fraction of\ncallbacks present in the Android framework.\n  In this work, we introduce Columbus, a callback-driven testing technique that\nemploys two strategies to eliminate the need for human involvement: (i) it\nautomatically identifies callbacks by simultaneously analyzing both the Android\nframework and the app under test, and (ii) it uses a combination of\nunder-constrained symbolic execution (primitive arguments), and type-guided\ndynamic heap introspection (object arguments) to generate valid and effective\ninputs. Lastly, Columbus integrates two novel feedback mechanisms -- data\ndependency and crash-guidance, during testing to increase the likelihood of\ntriggering crashes, and maximizing coverage. In our evaluation, Columbus\noutperforms state-of-the-art model-driven, checkpoint-based, and\ncallback-driven testing tools both in terms of crashes and coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 20:03:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

The most prominent among these\nclasses are the algebraic and map methods. This paper surveys and compares\nthese two types of methods as regards simplicity, efficiency, and usability.\nThe paper identifies the main types of solutions of Boolean equations as\nsubsumptive general solutions, parametric general solutions and particular\nsolutions. In a subsumptive general solution, each of the variables is\nexpressed as an interval based on successive conjunctive or disjunctive\neliminants of the original function. In a parametric general solution each of\nthe variables is expressed via arbitrary parameters which are freely chosen\nelements of the underlying Boolean algebra. A particular solution is an\nassignment from the underlying Boolean algebra to every pertinent variable that\nmakes the Boolean equation an identity. The paper offers a tutorial exposition,\nreview, and comparison of the three types of solutions by way of an\nillustrative example. This example is also viewed from the perspective of a\nrecently developed technique that relies on atomic decomposition. Map\ntechniques are demonstrated to be at least competitive with (and occasionally\nsuperior to) algebraic techniques, since they have a better control on the\nminimality of the pertinent function representations, and hence are more\ncapable of producing more compact solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 20:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

The endowments\nthus define for each agent her ideal utility as that which she derives from her\nfavorite allocation with no competition, but subject to getting at most her\nfair share of the items across rounds.

The\nprocess can be modelled as an evolutionary game dynamics system, which may be\ncontrollable. In modern control theory, eigenvalue (pole) assignment is a basic\napproach to designing a full-state feedback controller, which can influence the\noutcome of a game. This study shows that, in a game with two Nash equilibria,\nthe long-running strategy distribution can be controlled by pole assignment. We\nillustrate a theoretical workflow to design and evaluate the controller. To our\nknowledge, this is the first realisation of the control of equilibrium\nselection by design in the game dynamics theory paradigm. We hope the\ncontroller can be verified in a laboratory human subject game experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 20:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

In addition, in each scattering event the\norientation of the biomolecule is random and unknown. As a further layer of\ncomplexity, many biomolecules show structural heterogeneity and conformational\ntransitions between different distinct structures; these structural dynamics\nare averaged out by existing refinement methods.

Poor architectural\ndecisions frequently lead to the presence of large, change-prone source files\nthat are at the center of complexes of technical debt. This kind of technical\ndebt quickly incurs interest both through coordination costs and\nerror-proneness. In this paper, we present a new approach for decomposing these\n``large-active'' files to pay down critical technical debt. We package our\napproach as a refactoring recommendation system. Each recommendation is\ndetermined by analyzing patterns of co-change and mutual dependency among\nfiles. Each recommendation corresponds to a responsibility the large-active\nfile has in relation to the rest of the system. By moving recommended\nfunctionality from the large-active file into smaller files, developers can\nreduce the impact of a debt-laden file and clarify its essential\nresponsibilities. A key advantage of this approach over prior work is that we\nbetter focus effort; we avoid spending developer effort refactoring code that\nis only superficially problematic. We achieve this by incorporating revision\nhistory into both determining and ranking recommendations. Each recommendation\ncorresponds to some change-prone responsibility.

We consider two popular ways to\nmeasure the uncertainty deficit of VI: (i) the degree to which it\nunderestimates the componentwise variance, and (ii) the degree to which it\nunderestimates the entropy. To better understand these effects, and the\nrelationship between them, we examine an informative setting where they can be\nexplicitly (and elegantly) analyzed: the approximation of a Gaussian,~$p$, with\na dense covariance matrix, by a Gaussian,~$q$, with a diagonal covariance\nmatrix. We prove that $q$ always underestimates both the componentwise variance\nand the entropy of $p$, \\textit{though not necessarily to the same degree}.\nMoreover we demonstrate that the entropy of $q$ is determined by the trade-off\nof two competing forces: it is decreased by the shrinkage of its componentwise\nvariances (our first measure of uncertainty) but it is increased by the\nfactorized approximation which delinks the nodes in the graphical model of $p$.\nWe study various manifestations of this trade-off, notably one where, as the\ndimension of the problem grows, the per-component entropy gap between $p$ and\n$q$ becomes vanishingly small even though $q$ underestimates every\ncomponentwise variance by a constant multiplicative factor. We also use the\nshrinkage-delinkage trade-off to bound the entropy gap in terms of the problem\ndimension and the condition number of the correlation matrix of $p$.

Often, compute-constrained robots require assistance from remote\ncomputation (''the cloud'') if they need to invoke compute-intensive Deep\nNeural Network perception or control models. Likewise, a robot can be remotely\nteleoperated by a human during risky scenarios.

However, these sub-disciplines or 'pillars' of\ntrustworthiness have largely developed independently, which has limited us from\nunderstanding their interactions in real-world ML pipelines. In this paper,\nfocusing specifically on compositions of functions arising from the different\npillars, we aim to reduce this gap, develop new insights for trustworthy ML,\nand answer questions such as the following. Does the composition of multiple\nfairness interventions result in a fairer model compared to a single\nintervention? How do bias mitigation algorithms for fairness affect local\npost-hoc explanations? Does a defense algorithm for untargeted adversarial\nattacks continue to be effective when composed with a privacy transformation?\nToward this end, we report initial empirical results and new insights from 9\ndifferent compositions of functions (or pipelines) on 7 real-world datasets\nalong two trustworthy dimensions - fairness and explainability. We also report\nprogress, and implementation choices, on an extensible composer tool to\nencourage the combination of functionalities from multiple pillars.

Many novel electronic,\nmagnetic and even optical properties induced by such effect have been\ndiscovered. However, the twist-angle effect on phononic property is not so\nremarkable. By investigating the thermal conductivity of twist bilayer graphene\n(TBG), here we reveal that the trivial twist-angle effect on phononic property\nobserved in previous studies is owing to the non-localization nature of\nphonons. This characteristic makes phonons hardly trapped by the weak\ninterlayer potentials induced by the twist-angle dependent Moir\\'e pattern. We\npropose that the twist-angle effect can be effectively enhanced by increasing\nthe interface coupling. In use of a sandwich structure composed of h-BN and\nTBG, we demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of TBG can be either\nsignificantly increased or dramatically decreased, under the synergistic\nmodulation of interlayer coupling strength and twist angle. Particularly, the\ntwist-angle effect can lead to a nontrivial reduction of thermal conductivity\nup to 78% when a strong interlayer coupling is applied. The reduction is\nseveral times larger than that observed in the freestanding TBG where the\nreduction is attributed to the twist-angle dependent phonon scatterings induced\nby the edge phonons. The underlying mechanism for the giant twist-angle\ndependence of thermal conductivity is further revealed on the basis of phonon\ntransport theory. Our findings provide a platform for achieving efficient\ntwist-angle modulation on phonon transport property of vdW materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 02:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Simulations have shown that 0.01-0.1M$_\\odot$ of r-process\nmaterial could be generated in the outflows originating from the accretion disk\nsurrounding the rapidly rotating black hole that forms as a remnant to both\nneutron star mergers and collapsing massive stars associated with long-duration\ngamma-ray bursts (collapsars). The hallmark signature of r-process\nnucleosynthesis in the binary neutron star merger GW170817 was its long-lasting\nnear-infrared emission, thus motivating a systematic photometric study of the\nlight curves of broadlined stripped-envelope (Ic-BL) supernovae (SNe)\nassociated with collapsars. We present the first systematic study of 25 SNe\nIc-BL -- discovered with the Zwicky Transient Facility and from the literature\n-- in the optical/near-infrared bands to determine what quantity of r-process\nmaterial, if any, is synthesized in these explosions. Using semi-analytic\nmodels designed to account for r-process production in SNe Ic-BL, we perform\nlight curve fitting to derive constraints on the r-process mass for these SNe.\nWe also perform independent light curve fits to models without r-process. We\nfind that the r-process-free models are a better fit to the light curves of the\nobjects in our sample. Thus we conclude that there is no compelling evidence of\nr-process enrichment in any of our objects. Further high-cadence infrared\nphotometric studies and nebular spectroscopic analysis would be sensitive to\nsmaller quantities of r-process ejecta mass or indicate whether all collapsars\nare completely devoid of r-process nucleosynthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 04:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Directly training SNN by spike-based backpropagation (BP) such as\nsurrogate gradient approximation is more flexible. Yet now, the performance of\nSNNs is not competitive compared with ANNs. In this paper, we propose a novel\nk-based leaky Integrate-and-Fire (KLIF) neuron model to improve the learning\nability of SNNs.

These\nfactors limit their practical adoption as fully-sampled MRI is prohibitively\ntime-consuming to acquire clinically. Further, non-Cartesian sampling patterns\nare particularly desirable as they are more amenable to acceleration and show\nimproved motion robustness. To this end, we present a fully self-supervised\napproach for accelerated non-Cartesian MRI reconstruction which leverages\nself-supervision in both k-space and image domains. In training, the\nundersampled data are split into disjoint k-space domain partitions. For the\nk-space self-supervision, we train a network to reconstruct the input\nundersampled data from both the disjoint partitions and from itself. For the\nimage-level self-supervision, we enforce appearance consistency obtained from\nthe original undersampled data and the two partitions. Experimental results on\nour simulated multi-coil non-Cartesian MRI dataset demonstrate that DDSS can\ngenerate high-quality reconstruction that approaches the accuracy of the fully\nsupervised reconstruction, outperforming previous baseline methods.

Large energy events of geomagnetic importance like\nflares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) contribute little to the global\nenergetics of the solar corona. Therefore, events with several (9-10) orders of\nmagnitudes of lower energy, with much higher frequency of occurrence, need to\nbe studied in great detail. Observations suggest that these impulsive events\nwith different energies follow a power-law distribution, indicating a common\nunderlying mechanism. We perform observation-motivated modeling of coronal\nloops (magnetic flux tubes) to understand the energetics of these small\ntransient events and their similarity with impulsive events like flares.

First, we formulate GDRO as a stochastic convex-concave\nsaddle-point problem, and demonstrate that stochastic mirror descent (SMD),\nusing $m$ samples in each iteration, achieves an $O(m (\\log m)/\\epsilon^2)$\nsample complexity for finding an $\\epsilon$-optimal solution, which matches the\n$\\Omega(m/\\epsilon^2)$ lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. Then, we make\nuse of techniques from online learning to reduce the number of samples required\nin each round from $m$ to $1$, keeping the same sample complexity.\nSpecifically, we cast GDRO as a two-players game where one player simply\nperforms SMD and the other executes an online algorithm for non-oblivious\nmulti-armed bandits. Next, we consider a more practical scenario where the\nnumber of samples that can be drawn from each distribution is different, and\npropose a novel formulation of weighted GDRO, which allows us to derive\ndistribution-dependent convergence rates. Denote by $n_i$ the sample budget for\nthe $i$-th distribution, and assume $n_1 \\geq n_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq n_m$. In the\nfirst approach, we incorporate non-uniform sampling into SMD such that the\nsample budget is satisfied in expectation, and prove the excess risk of the\n$i$-th distribution decreases at an $O(\\sqrt{n_1 \\log m}/n_i)$ rate. In the\nsecond approach, we use mini-batches to meet the budget exactly and also reduce\nthe variance in stochastic gradients, and then leverage stochastic mirror-prox\nalgorithm, which can exploit small variances, to optimize a carefully designed\nweighted GDRO problem. Under appropriate conditions, it attains an $O((\\log\nm)/\\sqrt{n_i})$ convergence rate, which almost matches the optimal\n$O(\\sqrt{1/n_i})$ rate of only learning from the $i$-th distribution with $n_i$\nsamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 09:24:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 01:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

MH-MARL utilizes an expected action module to generate expected\nother agents' actions for each particular agent. Then, the expected actions are\ndelivered to other agents for selective imitation during training. Experimental\nresults show that MH-MARL improves the performance of MARL both in success rate\nand cumulative reward.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 10:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

In silicon photonics, microheaters are mainly realized by metal\nwires or highly doped silicon lines placed at a safe distance (1um) from the\nwaveguide to avoid considerable optical loss. However, this poses a significant\nlimitation for heating efficiency because of the excessive free-carrier loss\nwhen a heater is brought closer to the optical path. In this work, we present a\nnew concept of using optically transparent 2D semiconductors (e.g. MoS2) for\nrealizing highly efficient waveguide integrated heaters operating at telecom\nwavelengths. We demonstrate that a single-layer MoS2 heater with negligible\noptical absorption in the infrared can be placed in close proximity (only 30nm)\nto the waveguide and show the best-reported heating efficiency of 15 mW per FSR\nwithout sacrificing the optical insertion loss. The heater response time is\n25us, limited by Au 1L-MoS2 Schottky contact. Both the efficiency and response\ntime can be further significantly improved by realizing 2D MoS2 heaters with\nohmic contacts.

With the proliferation of deep models for time series\nanalysis, various time series DA techniques are proposed in the literature,\ne.g., cropping-, warping-, flipping-, and mixup-based methods. However, these\naugmentation methods mainly apply to time series classification and anomaly\ndetection tasks. In time series forecasting (TSF), we need to model the\nfine-grained temporal relationship within time series segments to generate\naccurate forecasting results given data in a look-back window. Existing DA\nsolutions in the time domain would break such a relationship, leading to poor\nforecasting accuracy. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes simple yet\neffective frequency domain augmentation techniques that ensure the semantic\nconsistency of augmented data-label pairs in forecasting, named FrAug.

A set of explicit criteria for modulational instability (MI) to\noccur is obtained. Wavepacket modulation properties in 3D dusty plasmas are\nshown to differ from e.g. Maxwellian plasmas in 1D. Stronger negative dust\nconcentration results in a narrower instability window in the $K$ (perturbation\nwavenumber) domain and a suppressed growth rate. In the opposite manner, the\ninstability growth rate increases for higher positive dust concentrations and\nthe instability window gets larger. In a nutshell, negative dust seems to\nsuppress instability while positive dust appears to favor the amplitude\nmodulation instability mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 11:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

While models are commonly used to describe observations,\nthere are instances where there is a lack of agreement between the two. This\ncan occur when models are derived from incomplete theories, when a\nbetter-fitting model is not available or when measurement uncertainties are not\ncorrectly considered. However, with the application of specific tests that\nassess the consistency between observations and astrophysical models in a\nmodel-independent way, it is possible to address this issue. The consistency\ntests (ConTESTs) developed in this paper use a combination of non-parametric\nmethods and distance measures to obtain a test statistic that evaluates the\ncloseness of the astrophysical model to the observations. To draw conclusions\non the consistency hypothesis, a simulation-based methodology is performed. In\nparticular, we built two tests for density models and two for regression models\nto be used depending on the case at hand and the power of the test needed. We\nused ConTEST to examine synthetic examples in order to determine the\neffectiveness of the tests and provide guidance on using them while building a\nmodel.

It aims at transferring\nprior knowledge learned on the source dataset to novel target datasets. The\nCD-FSL task is especially challenged by the huge domain gap between different\ndatasets. Critically, such a domain gap actually comes from the changes of\nvisual styles, and wave-SAN empirically shows that spanning the style\ndistribution of the source data helps alleviate this issue. However, wave-SAN\nsimply swaps styles of two images. Such a vanilla operation makes the generated\nstyles ``real'' and ``easy'', which still fall into the original set of the\nsource styles. Thus, inspired by vanilla adversarial learning, a novel\nmodel-agnostic meta Style Adversarial training (StyleAdv) method together with\na novel style adversarial attack method is proposed for CD-FSL. Particularly,\nour style attack method synthesizes both ``virtual'' and ``hard'' adversarial\nstyles for model training. This is achieved by perturbing the original style\nwith the signed style gradients. By continually attacking styles and forcing\nthe model to recognize these challenging adversarial styles, our model is\ngradually robust to the visual styles, thus boosting the generalization ability\nfor novel target datasets. Besides the typical CNN-based backbone, we also\nemploy our StyleAdv method on large-scale pretrained vision transformer.\nExtensive experiments conducted on eight various target datasets show the\neffectiveness of our method.

Shortcut Learning is\nconcerning, particularly when the DNNs are applied to safety-critical domains.\nThis paper aims to better understand shortcut learning through the lens of the\nlearning dynamics of the internal neurons during the training process. More\nspecifically, we make the following observations: (1) While previous works\ntreat shortcuts as synonymous with spurious correlations, we emphasize that not\nall spurious correlations are shortcuts. We show that shortcuts are only those\nspurious features that are \"easier\" than the core features. (2) We build upon\nthis premise and use instance difficulty methods (like Prediction Depth) to\nquantify \"easy\" and to identify this behavior during the training phase. (3) We\nempirically show that shortcut learning can be detected by observing the\nlearning dynamics of the DNN's early layers, irrespective of the network\narchitecture used. In other words, easy features learned by the initial layers\nof a DNN early during the training are potential shortcuts. We verify our\nclaims on simulated and real medical imaging data and justify the empirical\nsuccess of our hypothesis by showing the theoretical connections between\nPrediction Depth and information-theoretic concepts like V-usable information.\nLastly, our experiments show the insufficiency of monitoring only accuracy\nplots during training (as is common in machine learning pipelines), and we\nhighlight the need for monitoring early training dynamics using example\ndifficulty metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 14:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

The corresponding inverse map, which we use as an\nencoder, is a multi-stage convolution sparse coding (CSC), with each stage\nobtained from unrolling an optimization algorithm for solving the corresponding\n(convexified) sparse coding program. To avoid computational difficulties in\nminimizing distributional distance between the real and generated images, we\nutilize the recent closed-loop transcription (CTRL) framework that optimizes\nthe rate reduction of the learned sparse representations.

Previous approaches generally implemented\nlanguage-conditioned RL by providing human instructions in natural language\n(NL) and training a following policy. In this outside-in approach, the policy\nneeds to comprehend the NL and manage the task simultaneously. However, the\nunbounded NL examples often bring much extra complexity for solving concrete RL\ntasks, which can distract policy learning from completing the task. To ease the\nlearning burden of the policy, we investigate an inside-out scheme for natural\nlanguage-conditioned RL by developing a task language (TL) that is task-related\nand unique. The TL is used in RL to achieve highly efficient and effective\npolicy training. Besides, a translator is trained to translate NL into TL. We\nimplement this scheme as TALAR (TAsk Language with predicAte Representation)\nthat learns multiple predicates to model object relationships as the TL.\nExperiments indicate that TALAR not only better comprehends NL instructions but\nalso leads to a better instruction-following policy that improves 13.4% success\nrate and adapts to unseen expressions of NL instruction.

However, it is difficult to obtain clean images in many scenes. On\nthe contrary, the capture of multiple noisy frames for the same field of view\nis available and often natural in real life. Therefore, it is necessary to\navoid the restriction of clean labels and make full use of noisy data for model\ntraining. So we propose an unsupervised learning strategy named one-pot\ndenoising (OPD) for multi-frame images. OPD is the first proposed unsupervised\nmulti-frame denoising (MFD) method. Different from the traditional supervision\nschemes including both supervised Noise2Clean (N2C) and unsupervised\nNoise2Noise (N2N), OPD executes mutual supervision among all of the multiple\nframes, which gives learning more diversity of supervision and allows models to\nmine deeper into the correlation among frames. N2N has also been proved to be\nactually a simplified case of the proposed OPD. From the perspectives of data\nallocation and loss function, two specific implementations, random coupling\n(RC) and alienation loss (AL), are respectively provided to accomplish OPD\nduring model training. In practice, our experiments demonstrate that OPD\nbehaves as the SOTA unsupervised denoising method and is comparable to\nsupervised N2C methods for synthetic Gaussian and Poisson noise, and real-world\noptical coherence tomography (OCT) speckle noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 09:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-23"}

Our purpose is to\naddress the question whether the cryptocurrency market still preserves its\nautonomy with respect to the traditional financial markets or it has already\naligned with them in expense of its independence. We are motivated by the fact\nthat some previous related studies gave mixed results. By calculating the\n$q$-dependent detrended cross-correlation coefficient based on the high\nfrequency 10 s data in the rolling window, the dependence on various time\nscales, different fluctuation magnitudes, and different market periods are\nexamined. There is a strong indication that the dynamics of the bitcoin and\nethereum price changes since the March 2020 Covid-19 panic is no longer\nindependent. Instead, it is related to the dynamics of the traditional\nfinancial markets, which is especially evident now in 2022, when the bitcoin\nand ethereum coupling to the US tech stocks is observed during the market bear\nphase. It is also worth emphasizing that the cryptocurrencies have begun to\nreact to the economic data such as the Consumer Price Index readings in a\nsimilar way as traditional instruments. Such a spontaneous coupling of the so\nfar independent degrees of freedom can be interpreted as a kind of phase\ntransition that resembles the collective phenomena typical for the complex\nsystems.
