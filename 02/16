Visualising complex networks\nis crucial to understand and make sense of networked data and the relationships\nit represents. Due to the large size of many networks, visualisation is\nextremely difficult; the simple method of drawing large networks like those of\nFacebook or Twitter leads to graphics that convey little or no information.\nWhile modern graph layout algorithms can scale computationally to large\nnetworks, their output tends to a common \"hairball\" look, which makes it\ndifficult to even distinguish different graphs from each other. Graph sampling\nand graph coarsening techniques partially address these limitations but they\nare only able to preserve a subset of the properties of the original graphs. In\nthis paper we take the problem of visualising large graphs from a novel\nperspective: we leave the original graph's nodes and edges behind, and instead\nsummarise its properties such as the clustering coefficient and bipartivity by\ngenerating a completely new graph whose structural properties match that of the\noriginal graph. To verify the utility of this approach as compared to other\ngraph visualisation algorithms, we perform an experimental evaluation in which\nwe repeatedly asked experimental subjects (professionals in graph mining and\nrelated areas) to determine which of two given graphs has a given structural\nproperty and then assess which visualisation algorithm helped in identifying\nthe correct answer. Our summarisation approach SynGraphy compares favourably to\nother techniques on a variety of networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 16:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

Indeed, elections in\nthe US, UK, France, and Germany have all seen tightly won races, with notable\nexamples including the 2016 Trump vs. Clinton presidential election and the\nUK's Brexit referendum. However, while there has been much qualitative\ndiscussion of polarization on key issues, there are few examples of formal\nquantitative assessments examining this topic. Therefore, in this paper, we\nundertake a statistical evaluation of political polarization for\nrepresentatives elected to the US congress on key policy issues between\n2021-2022. The method is based on applying sentiment analysis to Twitter data\nand developing quantitative analysis for six political groupings defined based\non voting records. Two sets of policy groups are explored, including\ngeopolitical policies (e.g., Ukraine-Russia, China, Taiwan, etc.) and domestic\npolicies (e.g., abortion, climate change, LGBTQ, immigration, etc.). We find\nthat out of the twelve policies explored here, gun control was the most\npolitically polarizing, with significant polarization results found for all\ngroups (four of which were P < 0.001). The next most polarizing issues include\nimmigration and border control, fossil fuels, and Ukraine-Russia.\nInterestingly, the least polarized policy topics were Taiwan, LGBTQ, and the\nChinese Communist Party, potentially demonstrating the highest degree of\nbipartisanship on these issues. The results can be used to guide future policy\nmaking, by helping to identify areas of common ground across political groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 16:51:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2023 12:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

In this article, a thermodynamically consistent continuum\nmodel for coupling chemical and mechanical effects of electrode particles is\nextended by a change in the boundary condition for the displacement via a\nvariational inequality. This switch represents a limited enlargement of the\nparticle swelling or shrinking due to lithium intercalation or deintercalation\nin the host material, respectively. For inequality constraints as boundary\ncondition a smaller time step size is need as well as a locally finer mesh.

Various schemes to include it in galaxy evolution models exist,\ngenerally assuming that the Toomre $Q$ parameter is self-regulated to\n$Q_\\mathrm{crit}$, the critical $Q$ dividing stable from unstable conditions in\na linear stability analysis. This assumption is in tension with observational\nestimates of $Q$ that find values far below any plausible value of\n$Q_\\mathrm{crit}$.

Many different\nspatiotemporal growth profiles may sculpt tissues into the same target 3D\nshapes, but only specific growth patterns are observed in animal and plant\ndevelopment. In particular, growth profiles may differ in their degree of\nspatial variation and growth anisotropy, however, the criteria that distinguish\nobserved patterns of growth from other possible alternatives are not\nunderstood. Here we exploit the mathematical formalism of quasiconformal\ntransformations to formulate the problem of \"growth pattern selection\"\nquantitatively in the context of 3D shape formation by growing 2D epithelial\nsheets. We propose that nature settles on growth patterns that are the\n'simplest' in a certain way. Specifically, we demonstrate that growth pattern\nselection can be formulated as an optimization problem and solved for the\ntrajectories that minimize spatiotemporal variation in areal growth rates and\ndeformation anisotropy. The result is a complete prediction for the growth of\nthe surface, including not only a set of intermediate shapes, but also a\nprediction for cell displacement along those surfaces in the process of growth.\nOptimization of growth trajectories for both idealized surfaces and those\nobserved in nature show that relative growth rates can be uniformized at the\ncost of introducing anisotropy. Minimizing the variation of programmed growth\nrates can therefore be viewed as a generic mechanism for growth pattern\nselection and may help to understand the prevalence of anisotropy in\ndevelopmental programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 18:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

To pave the way for\ninterpretable quantification of B-lines, we propose a novel \"single-point\"\napproach to B-line localization using only the point of origin. Our results\nshow that (a) the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranges\nfrom 0.864 to 0.955 for the benchmarked detection methods, (b) within this\nrange, the best performance is achieved by models that leverage multiple\nsuccessive frames as input, and (c) the proposed single-point approach for\nB-line localization reaches an F1-score of 0.65, performing on par with the\ninter-observer agreement. The dataset and developed methods can facilitate\nfurther biomedical research on automated interpretation of lung ultrasound with\nthe potential to expand the clinical utility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 18:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

The formation of stars and clusters in Sco-Cen is\ncorrelated but not linearly, implying that more stars were formed per cluster\nduring the peak of the star formation rate.

The inference latency is further exacerbated by\nautoregressive generative tasks, as models need to run iteratively to generate\ntokens sequentially without leveraging token-level parallelization. To address\nthis, we propose Big Little Decoder (BiLD), a framework that can improve\ninference efficiency and latency for a wide range of text generation\napplications. The BiLD framework contains two models with different sizes that\ncollaboratively generate text.

To evaluate our framework across different tasks and\nmodels, we apply BiLD to various text generation scenarios encompassing machine\ntranslation on IWSLT 2017 De-En and WMT 2014 De-En, and summarization on XSUM\nand CNN/DailyMail.

We aim to increase the sample of\noptimal targets for future gravito-inertial asteroseismology by assessing the\nproperties of 15062 newly found Gaia DR3 gravity-mode pulsators.

After re-classifying about 22% of the F-type\ngravity-mode pulsators as B-type according to their effective temperature, we\nconstruct histograms of the fundamental parameters and mode properties of the\n15062 new Gaia DR3 pulsators. We compare these histograms with those of 63\nKepler bona fide class members. We fit errors-in-variables regression models to\ncouple the effective temperature, luminosity, gravity, and oscillation\nproperties to the two Gaia DR3 parameters capturing spectral line broadening\nfor a fraction of the pulsators. We find that the selected 15062 gravity-mode\npulsators have properties fully in line with those of their well-known Kepler\nanalogues, revealing that Gaia has a role to play in asteroseismology. The\ndominant g-mode frequency is a significant predictor of the spectral line\nbroadening for the class members having this quantity measured. We show that\nthe Gaia vbroad parameter captures the joint effect of time-independent\nintrinsic and rotational line broadening and time-dependent tangential\npulsational broadening.

Black hole models with realistic behavior at infinity predict that\nthe gravitating mass of a black hole can increase with the expansion of the\nuniverse independently of accretion or mergers, in a manner that depends on the\nblack hole's interior solution. We test this prediction by considering the\ngrowth of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies over\n$0<z\\lesssim2.5$. We find evidence for cosmologically coupled mass growth among\nthese black holes, with zero cosmological coupling excluded at 99.98%\nconfidence. The redshift dependence of the mass growth implies that, at\n$z\\lesssim7$, black holes contribute an effectively constant cosmological\nenergy density to Friedmann's equations.

The gas dynamics\nduring cluster mergers may also drive large-scale turbulence in the ICM, which\nin turn generates extended synchrontron sources known as radio halos. Surface\nbrightness edges have been found numerous times in the thermal gas of clusters\nbased on X-ray observations. In contrast, edges in radio halos have only been\nobserved in a handful of cases.

To aid the identification of surface brightness discontinuities,\nwe applied a gradient-filtering edge-detection method to the radio images. We\nfind that the adopted filtering technique is helpful in identifying surface\nbrightness edges in radio images, allowing us to identify at least one gradient\nin half of the radio halos studied. For the Bullet Cluster, we find excellent\nagreement between the locations of the 4 radio discontinuities detected and the\nX-ray edges. This similarity informs us that there is substantial interplay\nbetween thermal and nonthermal components in galaxy clusters. This interplay is\nlikely due to the frozen-in ICM magnetic field, which mediates the advection of\ncosmic rays while being dragged by thermal gas flows. We conclude that radio\nhalos are shaped by dynamical motions in the ICM and that they often display\nsurface brightness discontinuities, which appear to be co-located with edges in\nthe thermal gas emission.

It has been shown that because of interactions at\natomic and molecular levels, the behaviour of a mixture of hydrogen and helium\ncannot be accurately represented by considering these elements separately. This\npaper aims at providing a simple method to account for interactions between\nhydrogen and helium in interior and evolution models of giant planets. Using on\nthe one hand ab initio simulations that involve a system of interacting\nhydrogen and helium particles and pure equations of state for hydrogen and\nhelium on the other, we derived the contributions in density and entropy of the\ninteractions between hydrogen and helium particles. We show that relative\nvariations of up to 15% in density and entropy arise when non-ideal mixing is\naccounted for. These non-ideal mixing effects must be considered in interior\nmodels of giant planets based on accurate gravity field measurements,\nparticularly in the context of variations in the helium-to-hydrogen ratio.

The\ndifferent lines present in stellar spectra are created by several species,\nwhich are non-uniformly affected by stellar variability features such as spots\nor faculae. Stellar variability distorts the shape of the spectral absorption\nlines from which precise RVs are measured, posing one of the main problems in\nthe study of exoplanets. In this work we aim to study how the spectral lines\npresent in M dwarfs are independently impacted by stellar activity. We used\nCARMENES optical spectra of six active early- and mid-type M dwarfs to compute\nline-by-line RVs and study their correlation with several well-studied proxies\nof stellar activity. We are able to classify spectral lines based on their\nsensitivity to activity in five M dwarfs displaying high levels of stellar\nactivity. We further used this line classification to compute RVs with\nactivity-sensitive lines and less sensitive lines, enhancing or mitigating\nstellar activity effects in the RV time series. For specific sets of the least\nactivity-sensitive lines, the RV scatter decreases by ~ 2 to 5 times the\ninitial one, depending on the star. Finally, we compare these lines in the\ndifferent stars analysed, finding the sensitivity to activity to vary from star\nto star. Despite the high density of lines and blends present in M dwarf\nstellar spectra, we find that a line-by-line approach is able to deliver\nprecise RVs. Line-by-line RVs are also sensitive to stellar activity effects,\nand they allow for an accurate selection of activity-insensitive lines to\nmitigate activity effects in RV. However, we find stellar activity effects to\nvary in the same insensitive lines from star to star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 19:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

The initial motivation for this work is to predict this effect and\ncorrect it in Sounding Rocket (SR) experiments. In particular, the Full-sun\nUltraviolet Rocket Spectrograph (FURST) is anticipated to launch in mid-2023.\nFURST has the potential to observe UV absorption while imaging solar spectra\nbetween 120-181 nm, at a resolution of R > 2x10$^4$ ($\\Delta$ V < $\\pm$ 15\nkm/s), and at altitudes of between 110-255 km. This model uses estimates for\ndensity and temperature, as well as laboratory measurements of the absorption\ncross-section, to predict the UV absorption of solar radiation at high\naltitudes. Refraction correction is discussed and partially implemented but is\nnegligible for the results presented. Absorption by molecular Oxygen is the\nprimary driver within the UV spectral range of our interest. The model is built\nwith a wide range of applications in mind. The primary result is a method for\ninversion of the absorption cross-section from images obtained during an\ninstrument flight, even if atmospheric observations were not initially\nintended. The potential to obtain measurements of atmospheric properties is an\nexciting prospect, especially since sounding rockets are the only method\ncurrently available for probing this altitude in situ. Simulation of noisy\nspectral images along the FURST flight profile is performed using data from the\nHigh-Resolution Telescope and Spectrograph (HRTS) SR and the FISM2 model for\ncomparison. Analysis of these simulated signals allows us to capture the\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of FURST and the capability to measure atmospheric\nabsorption properties as a function of altitude. Based on the prevalence of\ndistinct spectral features, our calculations demonstrate that atmospheric\nabsorption may be used to perform wavelength calibration from in-flight data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 19:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Unfortunately, this can result\nin overly conservative behavior. Chance-constrained optimization can be applied\nto improve the performance of motion planning algorithms by allowing for a\nuser-specified amount of bounded constraint violation. However,\nstate-of-the-art methods rely either on moment-based inequalities, which can be\noverly conservative, or make it difficult to satisfy assumptions about the\nclass of probability distributions used to model uncertainty. To address these\nchallenges, this work proposes a real-time, risk-aware reachability-based\nmotion planning framework called RADIUS. The method first generates a reachable\nset of parameterized trajectories for the robot offline. At run time, RADIUS\ncomputes a closed-form over-approximation of the risk of a collision with an\nobstacle.

Then, RADIUS performs\nreal-time optimization to construct a trajectory that can be followed by the\nrobot in a manner that is certified to have a risk of collision that is less\nthan or equal to a user-specified threshold.

We\nintroduce a new dataset of over 13K instances of individuals' self-reporting\nshock events on Twitter and construct networks of relationship-labeled dyadic\ninteractions around these events. By examining behaviors across 110K replies to\nshocked users in a pseudo-causal analysis, we demonstrate relationship-specific\npatterns in response levels and topic shifts. We also show that while\nwell-established social dimensions of closeness such as tie strength and\nstructural embeddedness contribute to shock responsiveness, the degree of\nimpact is highly dependent on relationship and shock types. Our findings\nindicate that social relationships contain highly distinctive characteristics\nin network interactions and that relationship-specific behaviors in online\nshock responses are unique from those of offline settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 21:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

The recently derived shallow water moment\nequations are an extension of these standard shallow water equations. The\nextended models allow for vertical changes in the lateral velocity, resulting\nin a system that is more accurate in situations where the horizontal velocity\nvaries considerably over the height of the fluid. Unfortunately, already the\none-dimensional models lack global hyperbolicity, an important property of\npartial differential equations that ensures that disturbances have a finite\npropagation speed. In this paper we show that the loss of hyperbolicity also\noccurs in two-dimensional axisymmetric systems. First, a cylindrical moment\nmodel is obtained by starting from the cylindrical incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations. We derive two-dimensional axisymmetric Shallow Water Moment\nEquations by imposing axisymmetry in the cylindrical model. The loss of\nhyperbolicity is observed by directly evaluating the propagation speeds and\nplotting the hyperbolicity region. A hyperbolic axisymmetric moment model is\nthen obtained by modifying the system matrix in analogy to the one-dimensional\ncase, for which the hyperbolicity problem has already been observed and\novercome. The new model is written in analytical form and we prove that\nhyperbolicity can be guaranteed. To test the new model, numerical simulations\nwith both discontinuous and continuous initial data are performed. We show that\nthe hyperbolic model leads to less oscillations than the non-hyperbolic model\nin the case of a discontinuous initial height profile. The hyperbolic model is\npreferred over the non-hyperbolic model in this specific scenario for shorter\ntimes. Further, we observe that the error decreases when the order of the model\nis increased in a test case with smooth initial data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 21:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

For private machine\nlearning, existing auditing mechanisms are tight: the empirical privacy\nestimate (nearly) matches the algorithm's provable privacy guarantee. But these\nauditing techniques suffer from two limitations. First, they only give tight\nestimates under implausible worst-case assumptions (e.g., a fully adversarial\ndataset). Second, they require thousands or millions of training runs to\nproduce non-trivial statistical estimates of the privacy leakage.\n  This work addresses both issues. We design an improved auditing scheme that\nyields tight privacy estimates for natural (not adversarially crafted) datasets\n-- if the adversary can see all model updates during training. Prior auditing\nworks rely on the same assumption, which is permitted under the standard\ndifferential privacy threat model.

In an attempt to establish a link between attention\ninstability and the dynamic properties of Functional Connectivity (FC), we\ninvestigated the differences in temporal variability of FC between 40 children\nwith ADHD and 40 Typically Developing (TD) children. Using a sliding-window\nmethod to segment the rs-fMRI scans in time, we employed seed-to-voxel\ncorrelation analysis for each window to obtain time-evolving seed connectivity\nmaps for seeds placed in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial\nprefrontal cortex (mPFC).

Calibration inaccuracies can compromise the sensitivity\nof these measurements to the effect that a detection of the EoR is precluded.\nAn alternative to standard analysis techniques makes use of the closure phase,\nwhich allows one to bypass antenna-based direction-independent calibration.\nSimilarly to standard approaches, we use a delay spectrum technique to search\nfor the EoR signal. Using 94 nights of data observed with Phase I of the\nHydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), we place approximate constraints\non the 21 cm power spectrum at $z=7.7$.

The\nclassic instance of this is the famous Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm\n(ISTA), based on soft-thresholding of wavelet coefficients. More modern\napproaches to IDAs replace soft-thresholding with a black-box denoiser, such as\nBM3D or a learned deep neural network denoiser. These are often referred to as\n``plug-and-play\" (PnP) methods because, in principle, an off-the-shelf denoiser\ncan be used for a variety of different inverse problems. The problem with PnP\nmethods is that they may not provide the best solutions to a specific linear\ninverse problem; better solutions can often be obtained by a denoiser that is\ncustomized to the problem domain. A problem-specific denoiser, however,\nrequires expensive re-engineering or re-learning which eliminates the\nsimplicity and ease that makes PnP methods attractive in the first place. This\npaper proposes a new IDA that allows one to use a general, black-box denoiser\nmore effectively via a simple linear filtering modification to the usual\ngradient update steps that accounts for the specific linear inverse problem.\nThe proposed Filtered IDA (FIDA) is mathematically derived from the classical\nISTA and wavelet denoising viewpoint.

Detecting nonlinearity in a structure, which has been\ndesigned to operate in its linear region, might indicate the existence of\ndamage. Therefore, it is important, even for safety reasons, to detect when a\nstructure exhibits nonlinear behaviour. In the current work, a method to detect\nnonlinearity is proposed, based on the distribution of the gradients of a\ndata-driven model, which is fitted on data acquired from the structure of\ninterest. The data-driven model herein is a neural network. The selection of\nsuch a type of model was done in order to not allow the user to decide how\nlinear or nonlinear the model shall be, but to let the training algorithm of\nthe neural network shape the level of nonlinearity according to the training\ndata. The neural network is trained to predict the accelerations of the\nstructure for a time-instant using as inputs accelerations of previous\ntime-instants, i.e. one-step-ahead predictions. Afterwards, the gradients of\nthe output of the neural network with respect to its inputs are calculated.\nGiven that the structure is linear, the distribution of the aforementioned\ngradients should be quite peaked, while in the case of a structure with\nnonlinearities, the distribution of the gradients shall be more spread and,\npotentially, multimodal. To test the above assumption, data from an\nexperimental structure are considered. The structure is tested under different\nscenarios, some of which are linear and some nonlinear.

High throughput methods offer a path forward, but a strong\nconnection between the synthesis of a given composition and structure with its\nproperties has not been fully realized to date. Here we present the rapid\nidentification of light weight highly corrosion-resistant alloys based on\ncombinations of Al and Cr in a Cantor-like base alloy (Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni).\nPreviously unstudied alloy stoichiometries were identified using a combination\nof high throughput experimental screening coupled with key metallurgical and\nelectrochemical corrosion tests, identifying alloys with excellent passivation\nbehavior. Importantly, the electrochemical impedance modulus of the\nexposure-modified, air-formed film at the corrosion potential was found as an\naccurate non-destructive predictor of corrosion and passivation\ncharacteristics. Multi-element EXAFS analyses connected more ordered type\nchemical short range order in the Ni-Al 1st nn shell to poorer corrosion.

Developing a\nrobust classifier for activity recognition has always been of interest to\nresearchers. One major problem is that there is usually a deficit of training\ndata for some activities, making it difficult and sometimes impossible to\ndevelop a classifier. In this work, a novel GAN network called TheraGAN was\ndeveloped to generate realistic IMU signals associated with a particular\nactivity. The generated signal is of a 6-channel IMU. i.e., angular velocities\nand linear accelerations.

Common practice is\nstruggling with the trade-off between usability and performance. On one hand,\nDL frameworks such as PyTorch use dynamic graphs to facilitate model developers\nat a price of sub-optimal model training performance. On the other hand,\npractitioners propose various approaches to improving the training efficiency\nby sacrificing some of the flexibility, ranging from making the graph static\nfor more thorough optimization (e.g., XLA) to customizing optimization towards\nlarge-scale distributed training (e.g., DeepSpeed and Megatron-LM).\n  In this paper, we aim to address the tension between usability and training\nefficiency through separation of concerns. Inspired by DL compilers that\ndecouple the platform-specific optimizations of a tensor-level operator from\nits arithmetic definition, this paper proposes a schedule language to decouple\nmodel execution from definition.

Next, we establish entity-feature\ncorrespondence with cyclic walks along high transition probability based on\npairwise similarity between perceptual features (aka \"parts\") and slot-binded\nobject representations (aka \"whole\"). The whole is greater than its parts and\nthe parts constitute the whole. The part-whole interactions form cycle\nconsistencies, as supervisory signals, to train the slot-attention module. We\nempirically demonstrate that the networks trained with our cyclic walks can\nextract object-centric representations on seven image datasets in three\nunsupervised learning tasks. In contrast to object-centric models attached with\na decoder for image or feature reconstructions, our cyclic walks provide strong\nsupervision signals, avoiding computation overheads and enhancing memory\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 01:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

(2) Can we achieve acceleration for sampling?\n  For (1), prior results for ULMC only hold under a log-Sobolev inequality\ntogether with a restrictive Hessian smoothness condition. Here, we relax these\nassumptions by removing the Hessian smoothness condition and by considering\ndistributions satisfying a Poincar\\'e inequality. Our analysis achieves the\nstate of art dimension dependence, and is also flexible enough to handle weakly\nsmooth potentials.

Although many deep neural networks\n(DNNs) have been developed for LF image SR and achieved continuously improved\nperformance, existing methods cannot well leverage the long-range\nspatial-angular correlation and thus suffer a significant performance drop when\nhandling scenes with large disparity variations. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet effective method to learn the non-local spatial-angular correlation\nfor LF image SR. In our method, we adopt the epipolar plane image (EPI)\nrepresentation to project the 4D spatial-angular correlation onto multiple 2D\nEPI planes, and then develop a Transformer network with repetitive\nself-attention operations to learn the spatial-angular correlation by modeling\nthe dependencies between each pair of EPI pixels. Our method can fully\nincorporate the information from all angular views while achieving a global\nreceptive field along the epipolar line. We conduct extensive experiments with\ninsightful visualizations to validate the effectiveness of our method.\nComparative results on five public datasets show that our method not only\nachieves state-of-the-art SR performance, but also performs robust to disparity\nvariations.

We further develop OGS method that integrates original, gray, and\nskeleton views under this framework to demonstrate the effectiveness.\nExperimental results on the fusulinid fossil dataset over five deep learning\nbased milestone models show that OGS using three base models consistently\noutperforms the baseline using a single base model, and the ablation study\nverifies the usefulness of each selected view.

Therefore, a pre-trained model still needs enough\nlabelled data to fit the relations. To mitigate this challenge, in this paper,\nwe present a novel prompt-based learning method, namely LabelPrompt, for the\nrelation classification task. It is an extraordinary intuitive approach by a\nmotivation: ``GIVE MODEL CHOICES!''. First, we define some additional tokens to\nrepresent the relation labels, which regards these tokens as the verbalizer\nwith semantic initialisation and constructs them with a prompt template method.\nThen we revisit the inconsistency of the predicted relation and the given\nentities, an entity-aware module with the thought of contrastive learning is\ndesigned to mitigate the problem. At last, we apply an attention query strategy\nto self-attention layers to resolve two types of tokens, prompt tokens and\nsequence tokens. The proposed strategy effectively improves the adaptation\ncapability of prompt-based learning in the relation classification task when\nonly a small labelled data is available. Extensive experimental results\nobtained on several bench-marking datasets demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed LabelPrompt method, particularly in the few-shot scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 04:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

The latter can be improved by\nincreasing the number of trajectories while the true initial distribution,\ni.e., first hitting point distribution (FHPD), has no analytic expression in\nthe general case.

In this work, we use the quantum\nkinetics under relaxation time approximation to study the dependence of\nsecond-order nonlinear optical responses on Fermi level and frequency under\ndifferent out-of-plane electric fields in WTe$_2$ monolayer from radio to\ninfrared region. We find that the maximum frequency at which the Berry\ncurvature dipole mechanism for the nonlinear Hall effect plays a major role is\nabout 1 THz. In radio and microwave regions, two large peaks of nonlinear\nconductivities occur when the Fermi level is equal to the energy corresponding\nto gap-opening points.

A GUP-type relation naturally emerges when\nthe standard position operator is replaced by an appropriate Positive Operator\nValued Measure (POVM), representing a finite-accuracy measurement that\nlocalises the quantum wave packet to within a spatial region $\\sigma_g > 0$.\nThis length scale is the standard deviation of the envelope function, $g$, that\ndefines the POVM elements. Similarly, an EUP-type relation emerges when the\nstandard momentum operator is replaced by a POVM that localises the wave packet\nto within a region $\\tilde{\\sigma}_g > 0$ in momentum space. The usual GUP and\nEUP are recovered by setting $\\sigma_g \\simeq \\sqrt{\\hbar G/c^3}$, the Planck\nlength, and $\\tilde{\\sigma}_g \\simeq \\hbar\\sqrt{\\Lambda/3}$, where $\\Lambda$ is\nthe cosmological constant.

It is challenging due to\nhigh occlusion in the clutter, elusive entanglement phenomena, and the need for\nskilled manipulation planning. In this paper, we propose an autonomous,\neffective and general approach for picking up tangled-prone objects for\nindustrial bin picking. First, we learn PickNet - a network that maps the\nvisual observation to pixel-wise possibilities of picking isolated objects or\nseparating tangled objects and infers the corresponding grasp. Then, we propose\ntwo effective separation strategies: Dropping the entangled objects into a\nbuffer bin to reduce the degree of entanglement; Pulling to separate the\nentangled objects in the buffer bin planned by PullNet - a network that\npredicts position and direction for pulling from visual input. To efficiently\ncollect data for training PickNet and PullNet, we embrace the self-supervised\nlearning paradigm using an algorithmic supervisor in a physics simulator.\nReal-world experiments show that our policy can dexterously pick up\ntangled-prone objects with success rates of 90%.

Recently, an expressive and efficient\narchitecture, Fourier neural operator (FNO) has been developed by directly\nparameterising the integral kernel in the Fourier domain, and achieved\nsignificant success in different parametric partial differential equations.\nHowever, the Fourier transform of FNO requires the regular domain with uniform\ngrids, which means FNO is inherently inapplicable to complex geometric domains\nwidely existing in real applications. The eigenfunctions of the Laplace\noperator can also provide the frequency basis in Euclidean space, and can even\nbe extended to Riemannian manifolds. Therefore, this research proposes a\nLaplace Neural Operator (LNO) in which the kernel integral can be parameterised\nin the space of the Laplacian spectrum of the geometric domain. LNO breaks the\ngrid limitation of FNO and can be applied to any complex geometries while\nmaintaining the discretisation-invariant property. The proposed method is\ndemonstrated on the Darcy flow problem with a complex 2d domain, and a\ncomposite part deformation prediction problem with a complex 3d geometry.

The recently discovered system Apep, a unique massive system hosting two\nWolf-Rayet stars, is the most powerful synchrotron radio emitter among the\nknown CWBs, being an exciting candidate to investigate the non-thermal\nprocesses associated with stellar wind shocks.\n  Aims: We intend to break the degeneracy between the relativistic particle\npopulation and the magnetic field strength in the WCR of Apep by probing its\nhard X-ray spectrum, where inverse-Compton (IC) emission is expected to\ndominate.\n  Methods: We observe Apep with NuSTAR for 60 ks and combine this with a\nre-analysis of a deep archival XMM-Newton observation to better constrain the\nX-ray spectrum. We use a non-thermal emission model to derive physical\nparameters from the results.\n  Results: We detect hard X-ray emission consistent with a power-law component.\nThis is compatible with IC emission produced in the WCR for a magnetic field of\n100-160 mG and a fraction of ~1.5e-4 of the total wind kinetic power being\nconverted into relativistic electron acceleration.\n  Conclusions: This is the first time that the non-thermal emission from a CWB\nis detected both in radio and high energies. This allows us to derive the most\nrobust constraints of the particle acceleration efficiency and magnetic field\nintensity in a CWB so far, reducing the typical uncertainty of a few orders of\nmagnitude to just within a factor of two.

We find that large, metal-rich galaxies with high star\nformation rates are more likely to have gravitational wave (GW) events compared\nto younger, more metal poor galaxies. Our simulation with the default input\nparameters predicts a higher local merger rate density compared to the third\ngravitational wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3) prediction from LIGO, VIRGO and\nKAGRA.

In the search for an\nenergetic indicator of breaking inception, we use an ensemble of non-breaking\nand breaking crests evolving within unsteady wave packets simulated in a\nnumerical wave tank to investigate the evolution of each term in the kinetic\nenergy balance equation. We observe that breaking onset is preceded by around\none quarter of a wave period by a rapid increase in the rate of convergence of\nkinetic energy that triggers an irreversible acceleration of the kinetic energy\ngrowth rate. This energetic signature, which is present only for crests that\nsubsequently break, arises when the kinetic energy growth rate exceeds a\ncritical threshold. At this point the additional kinetic energy convergence\ncannot be offset by converting excess kinetic energy to potential energy or by\ndissipation through friction. Our results suggest that the ratio of the leading\nterms of the kinetic energy balance equation at the time of this energetic\nsignature is proportional to the strength of the breaking crest.

Various\ndata-independent criteria, including norm-based and relationship-based ones,\nwere proposed to prune the most unimportant filters.

In this paper, we first analyze\nthe limitation of relationship-based criteria with examples, and then introduce\na new data-independent criterion, Weighted Hybrid Criterion (WHC), to tackle\nthe problems of both norm-based and relationship-based criteria. By taking the\nmagnitude of each filter and the linear dependence between filters into\nconsideration, WHC can robustly recognize the most redundant filters, which can\nbe safely pruned without introducing severe performance degradation to\nnetworks. Extensive pruning experiments in a simple one-shot manner demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed WHC.

However, when the\nantenna spacing is made very small, the array gain of a compact array can be\nproportional to the square of the number of antennas - a value much larger than\nthe traditional array. To achieve this so-called ``superdirectivity\" however,\nthe calculation of the excitation coefficients (beamforming vector) is known to\nbe a challenging problem. In this paper, we address this problem with a novel\ndouble coupling-based superdirective beamforming method. In particular, we\ncategorize the antenna coupling effects to impedance coupling and field\ncoupling. By characterizing these two coupling in model, we derive the\nbeamforming vector for superdirective arrays.

Subsequently, to improve the generalization\ncapability, we design a simple but effective iterative strategy to enhance the\nwarp adaption in cross-dataset and cross-resolution applications.

A novel dataset is generated based on five real-world experiments and\ntheir associated ground truth data to train the adapted EfficientNetV2B0 model.\nThe experimental situations simulated a crowded event entrance, and social\npsychologists manually created the ground truths for each video experiment.\nSeveral experiments on the videos and the generated dataset are carried out to\nevaluate the accuracy and annotation delay time of the proposed system.\nFurthermore, the experts manually revised the annotation results of the system.\nFindings indicate that the system identified pushing behaviors with an accuracy\nrate of 89% within an acceptable delay time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 11:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

In all settings, the online class incremental learning (CIL), where\nincoming samples from data stream can be used only once, is more challenging\nand can be encountered more frequently in real world. Actually, the CIL faces a\nstability-plasticity dilemma, where the stability means the ability to preserve\nold knowledge while the plasticity denotes the ability to incorporate new\nknowledge. Although replay-based methods have shown exceptional promise, most\nof them concentrate on the strategy for updating and retrieving memory to keep\nstability at the expense of plasticity. To strike a preferable trade-off\nbetween stability and plasticity, we propose a Adaptive Focus Shifting\nalgorithm (AFS), which dynamically adjusts focus to ambiguous samples and\nnon-target logits in model learning. Through a deep analysis of the\ntask-recency bias caused by class imbalance, we propose a revised focal loss to\nmainly keep stability. By utilizing a new weight function, the revised focal\nloss can pay more attention to current ambiguous samples, which can provide\nmore information of the classification boundary. To promote plasticity, we\nintroduce a virtual knowledge distillation. By designing a virtual teacher, it\nassigns more attention to non-target classes, which can surmount overconfidence\nand encourage model to focus on inter-class information.

Existing unmixing methods have two limitations with respect\nto noise robustness. First, if the input HS image is highly noisy, even if the\nbalance between sparse and piecewise-smooth regularizations for abundance maps\nis carefully adjusted, noise may remain in the estimated abundance maps or\nundesirable artifacts may appear. Second, existing methods do not explicitly\naccount for the effects of stripe noise, which is common in HS measurements, in\ntheir formulations, resulting in significant degradation of unmixing\nperformance when such noise is present in the input HS image. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a new robust hyperspectral unmixing method based on\nconstrained convex optimization. Our method employs, in addition to the two\nregularizations for the abundance maps, regularizations for the HS image\nreconstructed by mixing the estimated abundance maps and endmembers. This\nstrategy makes the unmixing process much more robust in highly-noisy scenarios,\nunder the assumption that the abundance maps used to reconstruct the HS image\nwith desirable spatio-spectral structure are also expected to have desirable\nproperties. Furthermore, our method is designed to accommodate a wider variety\nof noise including stripe noise. To solve the formulated optimization problem,\nwe develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual\nsplitting method, which can automatically determine appropriate stepsizes based\non the problem structure.

We further introduce the \"dialogue\" modality as a\nvalid explanation approach to increase participant engagement and interaction\nwith the \"explainer\", allowing for more insight into their understanding in the\nprocess. Our analysis further suggests that individuality in understanding\naffects participants' perceptions of algorithmic fairness, demonstrating the\ninterdependence between understanding and ADM assessment that previous studies\nhave outlined.

Trion emission from semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes\n(SWCNTs) occurs in the near-infrared and at lower energies compared to the\nrespective exciton. It can be used as an indicator for the presence of excess\ncharge carriers in SWCNT samples and devices. Both excitons and trions are\nhighly sensitive to the surrounding dielectric medium of the nanotubes, having\nan impact on their application in optoelectronic devices. Here, the influence\nof different dielectric materials on exciton and trion emission from\nelectrostatically doped networks of polymer-sorted (6,5) SWCNTs in top-gate\nfield-effect transistors is investigated. The observed differences of trion and\nexciton emission energies and intensities for hole and electron accumulation\ncannot be explained with the polarizability or screening characteristics of the\ndifferent dielectric materials, but they show a clear dependence on the charge\ntrapping properties of the dielectrics. Charge localization (trapping of holes\nor electrons by the dielectric) reduces exciton quenching, emission blue-shift\nand trion formation. Based on the observed carrier type and dielectric material\ndependent variations, the ratio of trion to exciton emission and the exciton\nblue-shift are not suitable as quantitative metrics for doping levels of carbon\nnanotubes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 13:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

As (bi)-linearly parameterized mesh elements are not flexible\nenough to cover smooth domains, we focus in this work on the case of planar\nmixed meshes parameterized by (bi)-quadratic geometry mappings.

On the one\nhand, this will enable a detailed determination of the BSM model's parameters\nwhen a discovery is made and additional sensitivity in non-dominant production\nmodes can be achieved. On the other hand, the naive narrow width approximation\nin dominant production modes such as gluon fusion might be inadequate for some\nBSM parameter regions due to interference effects, effectively making less\ndominant production modes more relevant in such instances. In this work, we\nconsider both these questions in the context of four top quark final states at\nthe LHC. Firstly, we show that the SM potential can be enhanced through the\napplication of targeted Graph Neural Network techniques that exploit data\ncorrelations beyond cut-and-count approaches. Secondly, we show that\ndestructive interference effects that can degrade BSM sensitivity of top-philic\nstates from gluon fusion are largely avoided by turning to four top final\nstates. This achieves considerable exclusion potential for, e.g., the two Higgs\ndoublet model. This further motivates four top final states as sensitive tools\nfor BSM discovery in the near future of the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 13:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Our\nanalysis is based on a video dataset that captures and records social\ninteractions between children with autism and their therapy trainers (N=28\nobservations, 84 video clips, 21 Hrs duration).

To quantify and curb these uncertainties, an ensemble-based\nsimulation and data assimilation model for pluvial flood inundation is\nconstructed. The shallow water equation is decoupled in the x and y directions,\nand the inertial form of the Saint-Venant equation is chosen to realize fast\ncomputation. The probability distribution of the input and output factors is\ndescribed using Monte Carlo samples. Subsequently, a particle filter is\nincorporated to enable the assimilation of hydrological observations and\nimprove prediction accuracy. To achieve high-resolution, real-time ensemble\nsimulation, heterogeneous computing technologies based on CUDA (compute unified\ndevice architecture) and a distributed storage multi-GPU (graphics processing\nunit) system are used. Multiple optimization skills are employed to ensure the\nparallel efficiency and scalability of the simulation program.

In this paper, we study the effect of bias on two popular consensus\nprotocols, namely, the {\\em voter rule} and the {\\em 2-choices rule} with\nbinary opinions. We assume that agents with opinion $1$ update their opinion\nwith a probability $q_1$ strictly less than the probability $q_0$ with which\nupdate occurs for agents with opinion $0$. We call opinion $1$ as the superior\nopinion and our interest is to study the conditions under which the network\nreaches consensus on this opinion. We assume that the agents are located on the\nvertices of a regular expander graph with $n$ vertices. We show that for the\nvoter rule, consensus is achieved on the superior opinion in $O(\\log n)$ time\nwith high probability even if system starts with only $\\Omega(\\log n)$ agents\nhaving the superior opinion. This is in sharp contrast to the classical voter\nrule where consensus is achieved in $O(n)$ time and the probability of\nachieving consensus on any particular opinion is directly proportional to the\ninitial number of agents with that opinion. For the 2-choices rule, we show\nthat consensus is achieved on the superior opinion in $O(\\log n)$ time with\nhigh probability when the initial proportion of agents with the superior\nopinion is above a certain threshold. We explicitly characterise this threshold\nas a function of the strength of the bias and the spectral properties of the\ngraph.

In this sense, saturons carry an advantage with\nrespect to other macroscopic objects such as black holes and ordinary solitons.\nDue to unsuppressed thermal production, saturons can have interesting\ncosmological implications. In particular they can serve as viable dark matter\ncandidates with some unique features. Unlike ordinary particle dark matter, the\nsuperheavy saturons can freeze-in at very low temperatures.

In these environments dust and cloud particles grow to macroscopic\nsizes when gas phase species condense onto cloud condensation nuclei (CCNs).\nUnderstanding the formation processes of CCNs and dust in AGB stars is\nimportant because the species that formed in their outflows enrich the\ninterstellar medium. Although widely used, the validity of chemical and thermal\nequilibrium conditions is debatable in some of these highly dynamical\nastrophysical environments. We aim to derive a kinetic nucleation model that\nincludes the effects of thermal non-equilibrium by adopting different\ntemperatures for nucleating species, and to quantify the impact of thermal\nnon-equilibrium on kinetic nucleation. Forward and backward rate coefficients\nare derived as part of a collisional kinetic nucleation theory ansatz. The\nendothermic backward rates are derived from the law of mass action in thermal\nnon-equilibrium. We consider elastic collisions as thermal equilibrium drivers.\nFor homogeneous TiO2 nucleation and a gas temperature of 1250 K, we find that\ndifferences in the kinetic cluster temperatures as small as 20 K increase the\nformation of larger TiO2 clusters by over an order of magnitude. An increase in\ncluster temperature of around 20 K at gas temperatures of 1000 K can reduce the\nformation of a larger TiO2 cluster by over an order of magnitude. Our results\nconfirm and quantify the prediction of previous thermal non-equilibrium\nstudies. Small thermal non-equilibria can cause a significant change in the\nsynthesis of larger clusters.

Powder bed fusion additive\nmanufacturing of metals allows to integrate particle inclusions of arbitrary\nshape, size and spatial distribution directly into bulk material, giving rise\nto novel metamaterials with controllable dissipation without the need for\nadditional external damping devices. At present, however, it is not well\nunderstood how the degree of dissipation is influenced by the properties of the\nenclosed powder packing. In the present work, a two-way coupled discrete\nelement - finite element model is proposed allowing for the first time to\nconsistently describe the interaction between oscillating deformable structures\nand enclosed powder packings. As fundamental test case, the free oscillations\nof a hollow cantilever beam filled with various powder packings differing in\npacking density, particle size, and surface properties are considered to\nsystematically study these factors of influence. Critically, it is found that\nthe damping characteristics strongly depend on the packing density of the\nenclosed powder and that an optimal packing density exists at which the\ndissipation is maximized. Moreover, it is found that the influence of\n(absolute) particle size on dissipation is rather small. First-order analytical\nmodels for different deformation modes of such powder cavities are derived to\nshed light on this observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 15:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Although understanding the benefits and harms of using AI systems\nrequires more time, their rapid and indiscriminate adoption in practice is a\nreality. Currently, we lack a common framework and language to define and\nreport the responsible use of AI for content generation. Prior work proposed\nguidelines for using AI in specific scenarios (e.g., robotics or medicine)\nwhich are not transferable to conducting and reporting scientific research. Our\nwork makes two contributions: First, we propose a three-dimensional model\nconsisting of transparency, integrity, and accountability to define the\nresponsible use of AI. Second, we introduce ``AI Usage Cards'', a standardized\nway to report the use of AI in scientific research. Our model and cards allow\nusers to reflect on key principles of responsible AI usage. They also help the\nresearch community trace, compare, and question various forms of AI usage and\nsupport the development of accepted community norms. The proposed framework and\nreporting system aims to promote the ethical and responsible use of AI in\nscientific research and provide a standardized approach for reporting AI usage\nacross different research fields. We also provide a free service to easily\ngenerate AI Usage Cards for scientific work via a questionnaire and export them\nin various machine-readable formats for inclusion in different work products at\nhttps://ai-cards.org.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 08:41:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 15:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

However, in Surgical Data\nScience, access to it is limited. It is thus unsurprising that substantial\nresearch efforts are made to develop methods aiming at mitigating the scarcity\nof annotated SDS data. In parallel, an increasing number of Computer Assisted\nInterventions (CAI) datasets are being released, although the scale of these\nremain limited. On these premises, data curation is becoming a key element of\nmany SDS research endeavors. Surgical video datasets are demanding to curate\nand would benefit from dedicated support tools. In this work, we propose to\nsummarize surgical videos into storyboards or collages of representative frames\nto ease visualization, annotation, and processing. Video summarization is\nwell-established for natural images. However, state-of-the-art methods\ntypically rely on models trained on human-made annotations, few methods have\nbeen evaluated on surgical videos, and the availability of software packages\nfor the task is limited. We present videosum, an easy-to-use and open-source\nPython library to generate storyboards from surgical videos that contains a\nvariety of unsupervised methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 19:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

To tackle these\nchallenges, a model to predict EV growth in geographical scope would be\nhelpful. In this study, an agent-based parameterized bass network diffusion\nmodel was developed for EV population data in Washington. The model included\nincome levels and number of neighbors adopted as two key factors in determining\nEV diffusion probabilities. With the parameters estimated from simulation, the\nresulting model achieve a high estimation accuracy for EV adoption in\nWashington in both temporal and geographical scopes. This model could be used\nto predict EV growth in Washington, and to be adopted to other geographical\nareas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 02:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

The concern of this study is to analyze combined pressure-driven\nand electroosmotic flow of Herschel-Bulkley fluid. The wall potential is\nconsidered to vary slowly and periodically along the axis of the tube. With\nreference to flow in the micro-vessels, the problem has been solved using the\nlubrication theory. The Helmholtz-Smoluchowski (HS) slip boundary condition has\nbeen employed in this study. Volumetric flow rate $Q$ is found to be\nsignificantly affected by the yield stress parameter $\\nu$ only if an applied\npressure force is active. The linear superposition of flow components\nseparately due to the hydrodynamic and electric force occurs only for a\nstrictly uniform tube. This linear relationship fails if non-uniformity appears\nin either tube radius or in distribution of the electrokinetic slip boundary\ncondition. Moreover, converging/diverging nature of the mean tube radius plays\na crucial role on the fluid transport. For the benefit of readers, along with\nthe original contribution, some applications of external electrical stimulation\n(ES) in the human body and HS slip velocity, studied in the past by previous\nresearchers have been discussed in the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 21:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}
