To ensure network operability, the\ndeployment process must be carried out effectively in terms of two main\nfactors: connectivity and coverage. The network connectivity is based on fog\nnode deployment which determines the physical topology of the network while the\ncoverage determines the network accessibility. Both have a significant impact\non network performance and guarantee the network QoS. Determining an optimum\nfog node deployment method that minimizes cost, reduces computation and\ncommunication overhead, and provides a high degree of network connection\ncoverage is extremely hard. Therefore, maximizing coverage as well as\npreserving network connectivity is a non-trivial problem. In this paper, we\nproposed a fog deployment algorithm that can effectively connect the fog nodes\nand cover all edge devices. Firstly, we formulate fog deployment as an instance\nof multi-objective optimization problems with a large search space. Then, we\nleverage Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA) to tackle the deployment problem and\nprove that MPA is well-suited for fog node deployment due to its rapid\nconvergence and low computational complexity compared to other population-based\nalgorithms. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a different\nbenchmark of generated instances with various fog scenario configurations.

In\nthis work, we design and implement a bad data detection solution for electrical\nsubstations called ResiGate, that effectively combines a physics-based approach\nand a machine-learning-based approach to provide substantial speed-up in\nhigh-throughput substation communication scenarios, while still maintaining\nhigh detection accuracy and confidence.

A key\nchallenge for this is to continuously run the computationally demanding\nphysics-based analysis to monitor the measurement data frequently transmitted\nin a typical substation. To provide high throughput without sacrificing\naccuracy, ResiGate uses machine learning to effectively filter out most of the\nnon-suspicious (normal) data and thereby reducing the overall computational\nload, allowing efficient performance even with a high volume of network\ntraffic.

Due to the structural property of the SQL queries, the seq2seq model\ntakes the responsibility of parsing both the schema items (i.e., tables and\ncolumns) and the skeleton (i.e., SQL keywords). Such coupled targets increase\nthe difficulty of parsing the correct SQL queries especially when they involve\nmany schema items and logic operators. This paper proposes a ranking-enhanced\nencoding and skeleton-aware decoding framework to decouple the schema linking\nand the skeleton parsing. Specifically, for a seq2seq encoder-decode model, its\nencoder is injected by the most relevant schema items instead of the whole\nunordered ones, which could alleviate the schema linking effort during SQL\nparsing, and its decoder first generates the skeleton and then the actual SQL\nquery, which could implicitly constrain the SQL parsing. We evaluate our\nproposed framework on Spider and its three robustness variants: Spider-DK,\nSpider-Syn, and Spider-Realistic.

It is an old and\nintensively studied inverse problem with a wide range of applications, but the\nexisting inversion methodologies are still far from satisfactory. The typical\nmathematical formulation is a nonlinear least squares data fit optimization and\nthe difficulty stems from the non-convexity of the objective function that\ndisplays numerous local minima at which local optimization approaches stagnate.\nThis pathological behavior has at least three unavoidable causes: (1) The\nmapping from the unknown coefficients to the wave field is nonlinear and\ncomplicated. (2) The sources and receivers typically lie on a single side of\nthe medium, so only backscattered waves are measured. (3) The probing signals\nare band limited and with high frequency content. There is a lot of activity in\nthe computational science and engineering communities that seeks to mitigate\nthe difficulty of estimating the medium by data fitting. In this paper we\npresent a different point of view, based on reduced order models (ROMs) of two\noperators that control the wave propagation. The ROMs are called data driven\nbecause they are computed directly from the measurements, without any knowledge\nof the wave field inside the inaccessible medium. This computation is\nnon-iterative and uses standard numerical linear algebra methods. The resulting\nROMs capture features of the physics of wave propagation in a complementary way\nand have surprisingly good approximation properties that facilitate waveform\ninversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 19:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

The interface\nshape depends on the rotation rate, fluid elasticity, surface tension, and\ninertia. By solving the equations of motion in the low rotation rate limit for\na second-order fluid, a mathematical relationship between the interface\ndeflection and the fluid material functions, specifically the first and second\nnormal stress differences, emerges. This relationship has been used in the past\nto measure the climbing constant, a combination of the first ($\\Psi_{1,0}$) and\nsecond ($\\Psi_{2,0}$) normal stress difference coefficients from experimental\nobservations of rod-climbing in the low inertia limit. However, a quantitative\nreconciliation of such observations with the capabilities of modern-day\ntorsional rheometers is lacking. To this end, we combine rod-climbing\nexperiments with both small amplitude oscillatory shear flow measurements and\nsteady shear measurements of the first normal stress difference from commercial\nrheometers to quantify the values of both normal stress differences for a\nseries of polymer solutions. Furthermore, by retaining the oft-neglected\ninertial terms, we show that the climbing constant\n$\\hat{\\beta}=0.5\\Psi_{1,0}+2\\Psi_{2,0}$ can be measured even when the fluids,\nin fact, experience rod descending. A climbing condition derived by considering\nthe competition between elasticity and inertial effects accurately predicts\nwhether a fluid will undergo rod-climbing or rod-descending.

The results indicated that PH24_230 has a better adsorption\ncapacity when compared to AR-AC; achieving over 97% removal of Pb2+ after 60\nminutes. The batch adsorption studies were best described by the pseudo-second\norder kinetic model with coefficient of regression (R2) values above 0.99.\nAlso, slow pyrolysis experiments were carried out to evaluate the difference in\nsolid yields, char heating value and surface area. Pyrochar yields were\nslightly higher, while heating values were one order of magnitude lower when\ncompared to hydrochars. The pyrolysis conducted at 700{\\deg}C led to the\npyrochar with the highest value of the surface area (63.15 m2/g).

However, game-theoretic predictions are\nbased on the assumption that agents are fully rational and believe in\nequilibrium plays, which unfortunately are mostly not true when human decision\nmakers are involved. To address this limitation, a number of behavioral\ngame-theoretic models are defined to account for the limited rationality of\nhuman decision makers. The \"quantal cognitive hierarchy\" (QCH) model, which is\none of the more recent models, is demonstrated to be the state-of-art model for\npredicting human behaviors in normal-form games. The QCH model assumes that\nagents in games can be both non-strategic (level-0) and strategic (level-$k$).\nFor level-0 agents, they choose their strategies irrespective of other agents.\nFor level-$k$ agents, they assume that other agents would be behaving at levels\nless than $k$ and best respond against them. However, an important assumption\nof the QCH model is that the distribution of agents' levels follows a Poisson\ndistribution. In this paper, we relax this assumption and design a\nlearning-based method at the population level to iteratively estimate the\nempirical distribution of agents' reasoning levels. By using a real-world\ndataset from the Swedish lowest unique positive integer game, we demonstrate\nhow our refined QCH model and the iterative solution-seeking process can be\nused in providing a more accurate behavioral model for agents. This leads to\nbetter performance in fitting the real data and allows us to track an agent's\nprogress in learning to play strategically over multiple rounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 00:23:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 02:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Most existing VLN agents directly learn to align the raw\ndirectional features and visual features trained using one-hot labels to\nlinguistic instruction features. However, the big semantic gap among these\nmulti-modal inputs makes the alignment difficult and therefore limits the\nnavigation performance. In this paper, we propose Actional Atomic-Concept\nLearning (AACL), which maps visual observations to actional atomic concepts for\nfacilitating the alignment. Specifically, an actional atomic concept is a\nnatural language phrase containing an atomic action and an object, e.g., ``go\nup stairs''. These actional atomic concepts, which serve as the bridge between\nobservations and instructions, can effectively mitigate the semantic gap and\nsimplify the alignment. AACL contains three core components: 1) a concept\nmapping module to map the observations to the actional atomic concept\nrepresentations through the VLN environment and the recently proposed\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, 2) a concept refining\nadapter to encourage more instruction-oriented object concept extraction by\nre-ranking the predicted object concepts by CLIP, and 3) an observation\nco-embedding module which utilizes concept representations to regularize the\nobservation representations.

For decompression the base layer is decoded and\nupconverted to the original resolution using a deep upsampling neural network,\naided by the prior knowledge of the learned adaptive downsampling kernels.

Existing methods directly extend subgraph matching\nalgorithms to the case of hypergraphs. However, this approach delays hyperedge\nverification and underutilises the high-order information in hypergraphs, which\nleads to large search space and high enumeration cost. Furthermore, with the\ngrowing size of hypergraphs, it is becoming hard to compute subhypergraph\nmatching sequentially.

These methods\nintegrate self-attention mechanism in neural networks to utilize surrounding\nneural elements based on their correlation and help the networks capture\nlong-range dependencies. Temperature is a parameter in the Softmax function\nused in the self-attention, and it enables biasing the distribution of\nattention scores towards a handful of similar patches. Most existing\nself-attention mechanisms in image inpainting are convolution-based and set the\ntemperature as a constant, performing patch matching in a limited feature\nspace. In this work, we analyze the artifacts and training problems in previous\nself-attention mechanisms, and redesign the temperature learning network as\nwell as the self-attention mechanism to address them. We present an image\ninpainting framework with a multi-head temperature masked self-attention\nmechanism, which provides stable and efficient temperature learning and uses\nmultiple distant contextual information for high quality image inpainting. In\naddition to improving image quality of inpainting results, we generalize the\nproposed model to user-guided image editing by introducing a new sketch\ngeneration method.

Crystal Toolkit comes with a library of ready-made\ncomponents that can be assembled to make complex web apps: simulation of powder\nand single crystalline diffraction patterns, convex hull phase diagrams,\nPourbaix diagrams, electronic band structures, analysis of local chemical\nenvironments and symmetry, and more. Crystal Toolkit is now powering the\nMaterials Project website frontend, providing user-friendly access to its\ndatabase of computed materials properties. In the future, it is hoped that new\nvisualizations might be prototyped using Crystal Toolkit to help explore new\nforms of data being generated by the materials science community, and that this\nin turn can help new materials scientists develop intuition for how their data\nbehaves and the insights that might be found within.

However, the pre-trained depth network is still biased by\nRGB-based models which may result in a suboptimal solution. In this paper, we\npresent a single-model self-supervised hybrid pre-training framework for RGB\nand depth modalities, termed as CoMAE. Our CoMAE presents a curriculum learning\nstrategy to unify the two popular self-supervised representation learning\nalgorithms: contrastive learning and masked image modeling. Specifically, we\nfirst build a patch-level alignment task to pre-train a single encoder shared\nby two modalities via cross-modal contrastive learning. Then, the pre-trained\ncontrastive encoder is passed to a multi-modal masked autoencoder to capture\nthe finer context features from a generative perspective. In addition, our\nsingle-model design without requirement of fusion module is very flexible and\nrobust to generalize to unimodal scenario in both training and testing phases.\nExtensive experiments on SUN RGB-D and NYUDv2 datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our CoMAE for RGB and depth representation learning. In\naddition, our experiment results reveal that CoMAE is a data-efficient\nrepresentation learner. Although we only use the small-scale and unlabeled\ntraining set for pre-training, our CoMAE pre-trained models are still\ncompetitive to the state-of-the-art methods with extra large-scale and\nsupervised RGB dataset pre-training.

Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy\n(STM/STS) together with theoretical calculations reveal that the monolayer has\nan electronic Janus lattice, i.e., an energy-dependent atomic-lattice and a\npseudo-Te sublattice, and shares the identical geometry with the Mo5Te8 layer.\nDirac-like and flat electronic bands inherently existing in the CT lattice are\nidentified by two broad and two prominent peaks in STS spectra, respectively,\nand verified with density-functional-theory calculations. Two types of\nintrinsic domain boundaries were observed, in one of which the\nelectronic-Janus-lattice feature maintains, implying potential applications as\nan energy-tunable electron-tunneling barrier in future functional devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 08:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Instead of making an\nadditional copy of the model state, SWIFT resolves the inconsistencies of the\nmodel state caused by the failure and exploits the replicas of the model state\nin data parallelism for failure recovery.

However, the data, especially the videos published on the Internet,\nare usually compressed with lossy compression algorithms such as H.264. The\ncompressed data could significantly degrade the performance of recent detection\nalgorithms. The existing anti-compression algorithms focus on enhancing the\nperformance in detecting heavily compressed data but less consider the\ncompression adaption to the data from various compression levels. We believe\ncreating a forgery detection model that can handle the data compressed with\nunknown levels is important. To enhance the performance for such models, we\nconsider the weak compressed and strong compressed data as two views of the\noriginal data and they should have similar representation and relationships\nwith other samples. We propose a novel anti-compression forgery detection\nframework by maintaining closer relations within data under different\ncompression levels. Specifically, the algorithm measures the pair-wise\nsimilarity within data as the relations, and forcing the relations of weak and\nstrong compressed data close to each other, thus improving the discriminate\npower for detecting strong compressed data. To achieve a better strong\ncompressed data relation guided by the less compressed one, we apply video\nlevel contrastive learning for weak compressed data, which forces the model to\nproduce similar representations within the same video and far from the negative\nsamples. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm could boost\nperformance for strong compressed data while improving the accuracy rate when\ndetecting the clean data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 08:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

To address the first goal of interpretability, the GNN\nautoencoder achieves reduction in the number nodes in the encoding stage\nthrough an adaptive graph reduction procedure. This reduction procedure\nessentially amounts to flowfield-conditioned node sampling and sensor\nidentification, and produces interpretable latent graph representations\ntailored to the flowfield reconstruction task in the form of so-called masked\nfields.

Weighted Model Integration (WMI)\nrecently emerged as a unifying formalism for probabilistic inference in hybrid\ndomains. Despite a considerable amount of recent work, allowing WMI algorithms\nto scale with the complexity of the hybrid problem is still a challenge.

Methods: We designed an interactive human-robot scenario,\nincluding auditive and gestural cues, and compared this pipeline to a\nnon-interactive scenario. Both scenarios were evaluated through a questionnaire\nto measure acceptance.

Much\nof the merit is attributable to positional encoding and multi-head attention.\nHowever, Transformers fall short in learning long-range dependencies mainly due\nto the quadratic complexity scaled with context length, in terms of both time\nand space. Consequently, over the past five years, a myriad of methods has been\nproposed to make Transformers more efficient. In this work, we first take a\nstep back, study and compare existing solutions to long-sequence modeling in\nterms of their pure mathematical formulation. Specifically, we summarize them\nusing a unified template, given their shared nature of token mixing. Through\nbenchmarks, we then demonstrate that long context length does yield better\nperformance, albeit application-dependent, and traditional Transformer models\nfall short in taking advantage of long-range dependencies. Next, inspired by\nemerging sparse models of huge capacity, we propose a machine learning system\nfor handling million-scale dependencies.

The high density of evanescent near-field modes\nin the vicinity of a metal surface can strongly modulate the FRET in\nmultichromophoric systems. Based on the previous generalized FRET [A. Poudel,\nX. Chen and M. Ratner, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 7(2016) 955], the theory of FRET is\ngeneralized for the multichromophore aggregates and nonequilibrium situations\nin the vicinity of evanescent surface electromagnetic waves of nanophotonic\nstructures. The classic dyadic green function (DGF) approach to\nmultichromophoric FRET (MC-FRET) in the existence of evanescent near-field is\nestablished. The classic DGF approach provides a microscopic understanding of\nthe interaction between the emission and absorption spectral coupling and the\nevanescent electromagnetic field. The MC-FRET of the ring structures\ndemonstrates complicated distance dependence in the vicinity of the silver thin\nfilm. Given the analytic expression of hyperbolic multi-layer thin film, the\ngeneralized coupling due to the metallic thin film is determined by the\nscattering DGF above the metal surface. The decomposition of the reduced\nscattering DGF by ignoring $S$ wave in the evanescent wave shows how the\ninterface of the metallic thin films modulates the MC-FRET.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 09:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

We aim to\nstudy the three-dimensional distribution of NaCl around the AGB star IK Tau,\nand to obtain the abundance of NaCl relative to H$_2$ for each of the clumps.\nFirst, a new value for the maximum expansion velocity is determined. The\nobserved ALMA channel maps are then deprojected to create a three-dimensional\nmodel of the distribution of NaCl. This model is then used as input for the\nradiative transfer modelling code magritte, which is used to obtain the NaCl\nabundances of each of the clumps by comparing the observations with the results\nof the magritte simulations.

We study the optical afterglow with empirical\nfitting from GRANDMA+HXMT data, augmented with data from the literature up to\n60 days. We then model numerically, using a Bayesian approach, the GRANDMA and\nHXMT-LE afterglow observations, that we augment with Swift-XRT and additional\noptical/NIR observations reported in the literature.

A hitting formula is a set of Boolean clauses such that any two of\nthem cannot be simultaneously falsified.

Using the fact that\nhitting formulas are easy to check for satisfiability we use them to build a\nstatic proof system Hitting: a refutation of a CNF in Hitting is an\nunsatisfiable hitting formula such that each of its clauses is a weakening of a\nclause of the refuted CNF. Comparing this system to resolution and other proof\nsystems is equivalent to studying the hardness of hitting formulas.\n  We show that tree-like resolution and Hitting are quasi-polynomially\nseparated. We prove that Hitting is quasi-polynomially simulated by tree-like\nresolution, thus hitting formulas cannot be exponentially hard for resolution,\nso Peitl-Szeider's conjecture is partially refuted. Nevertheless Hitting is\nsurprisingly difficult to polynomially simulate. Using the ideas of PIT for\nnoncommutative circuits [Raz-Shpilka,05] we show that Hitting is simulated by\nExtended Frege. As a byproduct, we show that a number of static (semi)algebraic\nsystems are verifiable in a deterministic polynomial time.\n  We consider multiple extensions of Hitting.

Convolution neural\nnetwork (CNN) is a popular deep learning algorithm with many successful\napplications in chemical fault detection and diagnosis tasks. However,\nconvolution layers in CNN are very sensitive to the order of features, which\ncan lead to instability in the processing of tabular data. Optimal order of\nfeatures result in better performance of CNN models but it is expensive to seek\nsuch optimal order. In addition, because of the encapsulation mechanism of\nfeature extraction, most CNN models are opaque and have poor interpretability,\nthus failing to identify root-cause features without human supervision. These\ndifficulties inevitably limit the performance and credibility of CNN methods.\nIn this paper, we propose an order-invariant and interpretable hierarchical\ndilated convolution neural network (HDLCNN), which is composed by feature\nclustering, dilated convolution and the shapley additive explanations (SHAP)\nmethod. The novelty of HDLCNN lies in its capability of processing tabular data\nwith features of arbitrary order without seeking the optimal order, due to the\nability to agglomerate correlated features of feature clustering and the large\nreceptive field of dilated convolution. Then, the proposed method provides\ninterpretability by including the SHAP values to quantify feature contribution.\nTherefore, the root-cause features can be identified as the features with the\nhighest contribution. Computational experiments are conducted on the Tennessee\nEastman chemical process benchmark dataset. Compared with the other methods,\nthe proposed HDLCNN-SHAP method achieves better performance on processing\ntabular data with features of arbitrary order, detecting faults, and\nidentifying the root-cause features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 10:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Besides the challenges associated with the conciliation of the\nconflicting requirements to perform wireless communication and radar sensing in\na real-time cooperation, privacy issues represent a cause of concern as the\nco-design can let the network prone to active attacks. This paper tackles this\nissue by evaluating the associated privacy risks with the design of transmit\nprecoders that simultaneously optimise both the radar transmit beampattern and\nthe signal-to-interference-plus-noise at the communication users. Our results\nshow that if a malicious user can infer the transmitted precoder matrix with a\ncertain accuracy, there is a reasonable risk of exposure of the location of the\ntarget and privacy breaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 10:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

In the mobile-written\napplication, we developed a mathematical algorithm based on Pan-Tompkins\nalgorithm to calculate the heartbeat rate, in which the signal peaks are\ndetermined after several processing steps using a threshold. In this regard,\nthe ECG signals of 10 subjects were recorded and analyzed to calculate the\noptimum threshold. Finally, the power spectral density (PSD) and input referred\nnoise were calculated and plotted to check the output signal quality. Based on\nthe PSD and input referred noise amplitudes, we achieved a signal-to-noise\nratio of 50dB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 11:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

To achieve a high degree of accuracy; black-box ML\nmodels are often required - inhibiting interpretation of predictions and\nconsequently reducing confidence in the use of such methods. This paper\nproposes the use of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) - a unifying\ninterpretability framework based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory\n- to provide insights into ML models that are trained to predict critical\nclearing time (CCT). We use SHAP to obtain explanations of location-specific ML\nmodels trained to predict CCT at each busbar on the network. This can provide\nunique insights into power system variables influencing the entire stability\nboundary under increasing system complexity and uncertainty. Subsequently, the\ncovariance between a variable of interest and the corresponding SHAP values\nfrom each location-specific ML model - can reveal how a change in that variable\nimpacts the stability boundary throughout the network.

However, optimizing the performance of\nDNNs requires careful tuning of multiple hyperparameters and network parameters\nvia training. High-performance DNNs utilize a large number of parameters,\ncorresponding to high energy consumption during training. To address these\nlimitations, researchers have developed spiking neural networks (SNNs), which\nare more energy-efficient and can process data in a biologically plausible\nmanner, making them well-suited for tasks involving sensory data processing,\ni.e., neuromorphic data. Like DNNs, SNNs are vulnerable to various threats,\nsuch as adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. Yet, the attacks and\ncountermeasures for SNNs have been almost fully unexplored.\n  This paper investigates the application of backdoor attacks in SNNs using\nneuromorphic datasets and different triggers. More precisely, backdoor triggers\nin neuromorphic data can change their position and color, allowing a larger\nrange of possibilities than common triggers in, e.g., the image domain. We\npropose different attacks achieving up to 100\\% attack success rate without\nnoticeable clean accuracy degradation.

Atomic density functional calculations are typically carried out\nemploying spherically symmetric densities, corresponding to the use of\nfractional orbital occupations.

Self-attention is proven to be effective in encoding\ncorrelation information in 3D point clouds by (xie2020mlcvnet). While other 3D\ndetectors focus on enhancing point cloud feature extraction by selectively\nobtaining more meaningful local features (wang2022rbgnet) where contextual\ninformation is overlooked. To this end, the proposed architecture uses\nray-based surface-biased feature extraction and multi-level context encoding to\noutperform the state-of-the-art 3D object detector.

Hence, it should\nhave a strong impact on the deposit formation and might be responsible for\nvolcano-like, dome-like and at deposit morphologies.\n  Experiments: A method based on a thin-film interference was used to track the\ndrop height profile and contact line motion during the drying. A diverse set of\ndrying scenarios was obtained by using inks with different solvent compositions\nand by adjusting the substrate wetting properties. The experimental data was\ncompared to the predictions of phenomenological model.\n  Findings: We highlight the essential role of contact-line mobility on the\ndeposit morphology of solution-based inks. A pinned contact line produces\nexclusively ring-like deposits under normal conditions. On the contrary, drops\nwith a mobile contact line can produce ring-, at- or dome-like morphology. The\ndeveloped phenomenological model shows that the deposit morphology depends on\nsolvent evaporation profile, evolution of the drop radius relative to its\ncontact angle, and the ratio between initial and maximal (gelling) solute\nconcentration. These parameters can be adjusted by the ink solvent composition\nand substrate wetting behaviour, which provides a way for deposition of uniform\nand at deposits via inkjet printing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 11:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

However,\nmost of the existing methods either heavily rely on the accurate alignment\nbetween low-resolution (LR) HSIs and RGB images, or can only deal with\nsimulated unaligned RGB images generated by rigid geometric transformations,\nwhich weakens their effectiveness for real scenes. In this paper, we explore\nthe fusion-based HSI super-resolution with real RGB reference images that have\nboth rigid and non-rigid misalignments. To properly address the limitations of\nexisting methods for unaligned reference images, we propose an HSI fusion\nnetwork with heterogenous feature extractions, multi-stage feature alignments,\nand attentive feature fusion. Specifically, our network first transforms the\ninput HSI and RGB images into two sets of multi-scale features with an HSI\nencoder and an RGB encoder, respectively. The features of RGB reference images\nare then processed by a multi-stage alignment module to explicitly align the\nfeatures of RGB reference with the LR HSI. Finally, the aligned features of RGB\nreference are further adjusted by an adaptive attention module to focus more on\ndiscriminative regions before sending them to the fusion decoder to generate\nthe reconstructed HR HSI. Additionally, we collect a real-world HSI fusion\ndataset, consisting of paired HSI and unaligned RGB reference, to support the\nevaluation of the proposed model for real scenes. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on both simulated and our real-world datasets, and it shows that our\nmethod obtains a clear improvement over existing single-image and fusion-based\nsuper-resolution methods on quantitative assessment as well as visual\ncomparison.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 11:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

In this scheme, all-optical active\ntuning governs spatial and temporal enhancement of plasmon oscillations in the\nEOT system without device customization.

On\nthe other hand, theoretical approaches do not apply to graphs with\nheterogeneous degree distributions, which is often the case for complex\nreal-world networks. To address these drawbacks, we consider geometric\ninhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs) as a random graph model, which captures a\nvariety of properties observed in practice. These include a heterogeneous\ndegree distribution and non-vanishing clustering coefficient, which is the\nprobability that two random neighbours of a vertex are adjacent.

Cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services,\nMicrosoft Azure and the Google Cloud Platform aggressively expand their\nMachine-Learning-as-a-Service offerings. While the widespread adoption of\nmachine learning has huge potential for both research and industry, the\nlarge-scale evaluation of possibly sensitive data on untrusted platforms bears\ninherent data security and privacy risks. Since computation time is expensive,\nperformance is a critical factor for machine learning. However, prevailing\nsecurity measures proposed in the past years come with a significant\nperformance overhead. We investigate the current state of protected distributed\nmachine learning systems, focusing on deep convolutional neural networks. The\nmost common and best-performing mixed MPC approaches are based on homomorphic\nencryption, secret sharing, and garbled circuits. They commonly suffer from\ncommunication overheads that grow linearly in the depth of the neural network.\nWe present Dash, a fast and distributed private machine learning inference\nscheme. Dash is based purely on arithmetic garbled circuits. It requires only a\nsingle communication round per inference step, regardless of the depth of the\nneural network, and a very small constant communication volume.

We give a detailed qualitative\ncharacterization of the crystallization processes using imaging and optical\nmicroscopy. By contrast to the bulk samples, the initial alloy formation in\nslit cells is not volume-filling, and we now observe also alpha- and\nbeta-phases with low solubility of the odd component. In addition to the\ninitial homogeneous nucleation route, the interplay of gradients opens various\nfurther crystallization and transformation pathways leading to a great\ndiversity of microstructures.

In particular, we show\nthat an energy estimate derived in the physical coordinate system is equivalent\nto a semi-bounded property with respect to a stationary reference domain. The\ncontinuous analysis leading up to this result is based on a skew-symmetric\nsplitting of the material time derivative, and thus relies on the property of\nintegration-by-parts. Following this, a mimetic energy stable arbitrary\nLagrangian-Eulerian framework for semi-discretization is formulated, based on\napproximating the material time derivative in a way consistent with discrete\nsummation-by-parts. Thanks to the semi-bounded property, a method-of-lines\napproach using standard explicit or implicit time integration schemes can be\napplied to march the system forward in time. The same type of stability\narguments applies as for the corresponding stationary domain problem, without\nregards to additional properties such as discrete geometric conservation.

This is achieved by combining projection-based reduced-order\nmodeling with spectral proper orthogonal decomposition. In this method,\nspace-only proper orthogonal decomposition is first performed on velocity data\nto identify a subspace onto which the known equations of motion are projected,\nfollowing standard Galerkin projection techniques. The resulting reduced-order\nmodel is then utilized to generate time-resolved trajectories of data. Spectral\nproper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) is then applied to this model-generated\ndata to obtain a prediction of the spectral content of the system, while\npredicted SPOD modes can be obtained by lifting back to the original velocity\nfield domain. This method is first demonstrated on a forced, randomly generated\nlinear system, before being applied to study and reconstruct the spectral\ncontent of two-dimensional flow over two collinear flat plates perpendicular to\nan oncoming flow. At the range of Reynolds numbers considered, this\nconfiguration features an unsteady wake characterized by the formation and\ninteraction of vortical structures in the wake. Depending on the Reynolds\nnumber, the wake can be periodic or feature broadband behavior, making it an\ninsightful test case to assess the performance of the proposed method. In\nparticular, we show that this method can accurately recover the spectral\ncontent of periodic, quasi-periodic, and broadband flows without utilizing any\ntemporal information in the original data.

By reconstructing\nindependent stacks of projection data, a self-supervised loss is calculated in\nthe CT image domain and used to directly optimize projection image intensities\nto match the missing tomographic views constrained by the projection geometry.\nOur experiments on real X-ray microscope (XRM) tomographic mouse tibia bone\nscans show that our method improves reconstructions by 3.1-7.4%/7.7-17.6% in\nterms of PSNR/SSIM with respect to the interpolation baseline. Our approach is\napplicable as a flexible self-supervised projection inpainting tool for\ntomographic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 15:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

The Higgs\nboson, which was first detected in 2012, explains how the smallest building\nblocks get their mass. However, the Higgs mechanism only explains 1% of the\nmass of the proton. The other 99% arises from internal strong forces that are\nnot yet well-understood. To better understand the 99%, it is important to study\nthe production of hadrons in different processes, and to obtain information\nfrom as many different decay reactions as possible. Hadrons of the charmonia\ngroup, such as J/psi and the ground state eta_c, are highly suitable particles\nfor this, and result in a relatively easy-to-interpret spectrum of narrow peaks\nthat do not overlap.

Unfortunately, the usual formula for exponential resummation of the\nlattice data suffers from stochastic bias due to the fact that the derivatives\nof the fermion matrix are calculated stochastically. It is necessary to\nsubtract this bias in order to identify genuine higher-order contributions. In\nthis paper we present an alternative method of subtracting the stochastic bias\nup to a certain order of either the Taylor series or the cumulant expansion by\nmodifying the argument of the exponential. In this way, the exponential form of\nthe resummation, and hence the knowledge of the phase factor is retained.

In this paper, we first rebuild the connections between FFN and\nkey-value memory by conducting extensive studies on ReLU and Softmax, and find\nthey are equivalent when adding an additional layer normalization module on\nSoftmax.

Results show that the region over Europa's surface within which\nplumes would be separable from the H$_2$O atmosphere by JUICE (the region of\nseparability) is reduced by up to a half with the collisional model compared to\nthe collisionless model.

Although for the\ngrowth in the number of IoT devices, Context Management Platforms (CMPs) that\nintegrate different domains of IoT to produce context information lacks\nscalability to cater to a high volume of context queries. Research in\nscalability and adaptation in CMPs are of significant importance due to this\nreason. However, there is limited methods to benchmarks and validate research\nin this area due to the lack of sizable sets of context queries that could\nsimulate real-world situations, scenarios, and scenes.

In this paper, we propose a context query\nsimulator for the context-aware smart car parking scenario in Melbourne Central\nBusiness District in Australia.

These unnecessary features,\nincluding 1) ambiguous parts resulting from the visual similarity in object\nappearances and 2) noninformative parts (e.g., background noise), can have a\nsignificant adverse impact on classification results.

We implement this methodology on the challenging iNaturalist-2021\ndataset, comprised of approximately 2.7 million images of macro-organisms\nacross 10,000 classes, and achieve a new state-of-the art model in terms of\nzero-shot classification accuracy. Somewhat surprisingly, our model (trained\nusing a new method called locked-image text tuning) uses a pre-trained, frozen\nvision representation, proving that language alignment alone can attain strong\ntransfer learning performance, even on fractious, long-tailed datasets. Our\napproach opens the door for utilizing high quality vision-language pretrained\nmodels in agriculturally relevant applications involving species detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 20:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

Since dependence among the cut sets beyond the second\norder is generally difficult to obtain, second order bounds on system failure\nprobability have practical value. The upper bound is conservative by definition\nand can be adopted in reliability based decision making. In this paper we\npropose a new hierarchy of m-level second order upper bounds, Bm : the\nwell-known Kounias-Vanmarcke-Hunter-Ditlevsen (KVHD) bound - the current\nstandard for upper bounds using second order joint probabilities - turns out to\nbe the weakest member of this family (m = 1). We prove that Bm is\nnon-increasing with level m in every ordering of the cut sets, and derive\nconditions under which Bm+1 is strictly less than Bm for any m and any\nordering. We also derive conditions under which the optimal level m bound is\nstrictly less than the optimal level m + 1 bound, and show that this\nimprovement asymptotically achieves a probability of 1 as long as the second\norder joint probabilities are only constrained by the pair of corresponding\nfirst order probabilities. Numerical examples show that our second order upper\nbounds can yield tighter values than previously achieved and in every case\nexhibit considerable less scatter across the entire n! orderings of the cut\nsets compared to KVHD bounds. Our results therefore may lead to more efficient\nidentification of the optimal upper bound when coupled with existing linear\nprogramming and tree search based approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2023 23:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}
