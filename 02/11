Most previously proposed parameter estimation algorithms\ninstantiate the EM algorithm, often with random initialization. However, such\nan initialization scheme may not yield a good initial estimate and the\nalgorithms require multiple restarts, incurring a large time complexity. As for\nthe EM procedure, while the E-step can be performed efficiently, maximizing the\nlog-likelihood in the M-step is difficult due to the combinatorial nature of\nthe PL likelihood function (Gormley and Murphy 2008). Therefore, previous\nauthors favor algorithms that maximize surrogate likelihood functions (Zhao et\nal. 2018, 2020). However, the final estimate may deviate from the true maximum\nlikelihood estimate as a consequence. In this paper, we address these known\nlimitations. We propose an initialization algorithm that can provide a provably\naccurate initial estimate and an EM algorithm that maximizes the true\nlog-likelihood function efficiently. Experiments on both synthetic and real\ndatasets show that our algorithm is competitive in terms of accuracy and speed\nto baseline algorithms, especially on datasets with a large number of items.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 16:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

Using quasi-simultaneous observations from MAXI/GSC\nand INTEGRAL/SPI, we studied the temporal and spectral evolution of MAXI\nJ1535-571 in the 2-500 keV range. Early spectra show a Comptonized spectrum and\na high-energy component dominant above ~150 keV. CompTT fits to the SPI data\nfound electron temperatures (kTe) evolves from ~31 keV to 18 keV with a tied\noptical depth (tau ~ 0.85) or tau evolving from ~1.2-0.65 with a tied kTe (~24\nkeV).

The CompTT flux varies\nsignificantly during the hard state while the high-energy component flux is\nconsistent with a constant flux. This result suggests that the two components\noriginate from different locations, which favors a jet origin interpretation\nfor the high-energy component over a hybrid corona interpretation.

One of\nthe reasons is the lack of large-scale shadow & shadow-free image pairs.\nUnsupervised methods can alleviate the issue but their restoration qualities\nare much lower than those of fully-supervised methods. In this work, we find\nthat pretraining shadow removal networks on the image inpainting dataset can\nreduce the shadow remnants significantly: a naive encoder-decoder network gets\ncompetitive restoration quality w.r.t. the state-of-the-art methods via only\n10% shadow & shadow-free image pairs. After analyzing networks with/without\ninpainting pre-training via the information stored in the weight (IIW), we find\nthat inpainting pretraining improves restoration quality in non-shadow regions\nand enhances the generalization ability of networks significantly.\nAdditionally, shadow removal fine-tuning enables networks to fill in the\ndetails of shadow regions. Inspired by these observations we formulate shadow\nremoval as an adaptive fusion task that takes advantage of both shadow removal\nand image inpainting. Specifically, we develop an adaptive fusion network\nconsisting of two encoders, an adaptive fusion block, and a decoder. The two\nencoders are responsible for extracting the feature from the shadow image and\nthe shadow-masked image respectively. The adaptive fusion block is responsible\nfor combining these features in an adaptive manner. Finally, the decoder\nconverts the adaptive fused features to the desired shadow-free result. The\nextensive experiments show that our method empowered with inpainting\noutperforms all state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 16:21:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 22:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-23"}

In contrast to prior work, our method, referred to as\nrandomly infused advice (RIA), does not make any probabilistic assumptions\nabout the input sequence and does not rely on the development of designated\nonline algorithms. Rather, it can be applied to existing online randomized\nalgorithms, introducing a means to evaluate their performance in scenarios that\nlie outside the radical worst-case regime. More concretely, an online algorithm\nALG with RIA benefits from pieces of advice generated by an omniscient but not\nentirely reliable oracle. The crux of the new method is that the advice is\nprovided to ALG by writing it into the buffer B from which ALG normally reads\nits random bits, hence allowing us to augment it through a very simple and\nnon-intrusive interface. The (un)reliability of the oracle is captured via a\nparameter 0 {\\le} {\\alpha} {\\le} 1 that determines the probability (per round)\nthat the advice is successfully infused by the oracle; if the advice is not\ninfused, which occurs with probability 1 - {\\alpha}, then the buffer B contains\nfresh random bits (as in the classic online setting).\n  The applicability of the new RIA method is demonstrated by applying it to\nthree extensively studied online problems: paging, uniform metrical task\nsystems, and online set cover. For these problems, we establish new upper\nbounds on the competitive ratio of classic online algorithms that improve as\nthe infusion parameter {\\alpha} increases. These are complemented with (often\ntight) lower bounds on the competitive ratio of online algorithms with RIA for\nthe three problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 16:42:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 07:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 09:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

The trained CNNs\neffectively segmented the AR, annulus and STJ, resulting in mean Dice scores of\n0.93 for the AR, and mean surface distances of 1.16 mm and 1.30 mm for the\nannulus and STJ, respectively. Automatic measurements were in good agreement\nwith manual annotations, yielding annulus diameters that differed by 0.52\n[-2.96, 4.00] mm (bias and 95% limits of agreement for manual minus algorithm).\nEvaluating the area-derived diameter, bias and limits of agreement were 0.07\n[-0.25, 0.39] mm. STJ and sinuses diameters computed by the automatic method\nyielded differences of 0.16 [-2.03, 2.34] and 0.1 [-2.93, 3.13] mm,\nrespectively. The proposed tool is a fully automatic solution to quantify\nmorphological biomarkers for pre-TAVI planning. The method was validated\nagainst manual annotation from clinical experts and showed to be quick and\neffective in assessing AR anatomy, with potential for time and cost savings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 16:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

It has been argued that\nthis may be possible through causal models, aiming to mirror the modularity of\nthe real world in terms of independent causal mechanisms. However, the true\ncausal structure underlying a given set of data is generally not identifiable,\nso it is desirable to have means to quantify differences between models (e.g.,\nbetween the ground truth and an estimate), on both the observational and\ninterventional level.\n  In the present work, we introduce the Interventional Kullback-Leibler (IKL)\ndivergence to quantify both structural and distributional differences between\nmodels based on a finite set of multi-environment distributions generated by\ninterventions from the ground truth.

CPS integrate sensing, computation, control and\nnetworking into physical objects and mission-critical services, connecting\ntraditional infrastructure to internet technologies. While this integration\nincreases service efficiency, it has to face the possibility of new threats\nposed by the new functionalities. This leads to cyber-threats, such as\ndenial-of-service, modification of data, information leakage, spreading of\nmalware, and many others. Cyber-resilience refers to the ability of a CPS to\nprepare, absorb, recover, and adapt to the adverse effects associated with\ncyber-threats, e.g., physical degradation of the CPS performance resulting from\na cyber-attack. Cyber-resilience aims at ensuring CPS survival, by keeping the\ncore functionalities of the CPS in case of extreme events. The literature on\ncyber-resilience is rapidly increasing, leading to a broad variety of research\nworks addressing this new topic. In this article, we create a systematization\nof knowledge about existing scientific efforts of making CPS cyber-resilient.\nWe systematically survey recent literature addressing cyber-resilience with a\nfocus on techniques that may be used on CPS. We first provide preliminaries and\nbackground on CPS and threats, and subsequently survey state-of-the-art\napproaches that have been proposed by recent research work applicable to CPS.\nIn particular, we aim at differentiating research work from traditional risk\nmanagement approaches, based on the general acceptance that it is unfeasible to\nprevent and mitigate all possible risks threatening a CPS. We also discuss\nquestions and research challenges, with a focus on the practical aspects of\ncyber-resilience, such as the use of metrics and evaluation methods, as well as\ntesting and validation environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 18:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

Recently, many flexible machine learning methods have been\ndeveloped for instrumental variable estimation.

Some problems with the task are:\nlack of controllability for topics of the inferred facts; lack of commonsense\nknowledge during training; and, possibly, hallucinated or false facts. In this\nwork, we utilize a transformer model for this task and develop techniques to\naddress the aforementioned problems in the task. We control the inference by\nintroducing a new technique we call \"hinting\". Hinting is a kind of language\nmodel prompting, that utilizes both hard prompts (specific words) and soft\nprompts (virtual learnable templates). This serves as a control signal to\nadvise the language model \"what to talk about\". Next, we establish a\nmethodology for performing joint inference with multiple commonsense knowledge\nbases. Joint inference of commonsense requires care, because it is imprecise\nand the level of generality is more flexible. You want to be sure that the\nresults \"still make sense\" for the context. To this end, we align the textual\nversion of assertions from three knowledge graphs (ConceptNet, ATOMIC2020, and\nGLUCOSE) with a story and a target sentence. This combination allows us to\ntrain a single model to perform joint inference with multiple knowledge graphs.\nWe show experimental results for the three knowledge graphs on joint inference.\nOur final contribution is exploring a GAN architecture that generates the\ncontextualized commonsense assertions and scores them as to their plausibility\nthrough a discriminator. The result is an integrated system for contextual\ncommonsense inference in stories, that can controllably generate plausible\ncommonsense assertions, and takes advantage of joint inference between multiple\ncommonsense knowledge bases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 18:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

First, we\ninvestigate the so-called float-up process at high effective temperature,\nwhereby the upward diffusion of trace hydrogen leads to the formation of a\nhydrogen atmosphere. We examine the dependence of this phenomenon on the\ninitial hydrogen abundance and on the strength of the radiative wind that\nopposes gravitational settling. Combined with our empirical knowledge of\nspectral evolution, our simulations provide new quantitative constraints on the\nhydrogen content of the hot helium-dominated white dwarf population. Then, we\nstudy the outcome of the so-called convective dilution process at low effective\ntemperature, whereby the superficial hydrogen layer is mixed within the\nunderlying helium-rich envelope. In stark contrast with previous works on\nconvective dilution, we demonstrate that, under reasonable assumptions, our\nmodels successfully reproduce the observed atmospheric composition of cool DBA\nstars, thereby solving one of the most important problems of spectral evolution\ntheory. This major improvement is due to our self-consistent modeling of the\nearlier float-up process, which predicts the existence of a massive hydrogen\nreservoir underneath the thin superficial layer. We argue that the trace\nhydrogen detected at the surface of DBA white dwarfs is, in most cases, of\nprimordial origin rather than the result of external accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 18:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

In\nthis paper, we show that large efficiency gains can be obtained by employing a\nfast unified functional hash, especially through the functional equivalence\ncaching technique, which we also present. The central idea is to detect by\nhashing when the search method produces equivalent candidates, which occurs\nvery frequently, and this way avoid their costly re-evaluation. Our hash is\n\"functional\" in that it identifies equivalent candidates even if they were\nrepresented or coded differently, and it is \"unified\" in that the same\nalgorithm can hash arbitrary representations; e.g. compute graphs, imperative\ncode, or lambda functions.

This\nmethod expresses the power spectrum of a masked map (\"pseudo-$C_\\ell$\") in\nterms of the power spectrum of the unmasked map (the true $C_\\ell$) and that of\nthe mask or weight map. However, it is often the case that the map and mask are\ncorrelated in some way, such as point source masks used in cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) analyses, which have nonzero correlation with CMB secondary\nanisotropy fields and other mm-wave sky signals. In such situations, the MASTER\napproach gives biased results, as it assumes that the unmasked map and mask\nhave zero correlation.

We propose a\ntheoretical analysis of the dynamics of PEPITA. In particular, we show that\nPEPITA is well-approximated by an \"adaptive-feedback-alignment\" algorithm and\nwe analytically track its performance during learning in a prototype\nhigh-dimensional setting. Finally, we develop a strategy to apply the weight\nmirroring algorithm on \"forward-only\" algorithms with top-down feedback and we\nshow how it impacts PEPITA's accuracy and convergence rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 18:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

For each system, we release four one-dimensional\n(1D) spectra to the ESO Science Archive, one spectrum for each arm of the\nX-Shooter spectrograph. In this paper, we focus on the line-of-sight velocity\ndistribution, measuring integrated stellar velocity dispersions from the\nspectra, and assessing their robustness and the associated uncertainties. For\neach of the 21 new systems, we systematically investigated the effect of the\nparameters and set-ups of the full spectral fitting on the stellar velocity\ndispersion ($\\sigma$) measurements. In particular, we tested how $\\sigma$\nchanges when several parameters of the fit as well as the resolution and\nspectral coverage of the input spectra are varied. We found that the effect\nthat causes the largest systematic uncertainties on $\\sigma$ is the wavelength\nrange used for the fit, especially for spectra with a lower signal-to-noise\nratio (S/N $\\leq$ 30). When using blue wavelengths (UVB arm) one generally\nunderestimates the velocity dispersion (by $\\sim$15 km/s). The values obtained\nfrom the near-IR (NIR) arm present a larger scatter because the quality of the\nspectra is lower. We finally compared our results with those in literature,\nfinding a very good agreement overall. Joining results obtained in DR1 with\nthose presented here, INSPIRE contains 40 ultra-compact massive galaxies,\ncorresponding to 75% of the whole survey. By plotting these systems in a\nstellar mass-velocity dispersion diagram, we identify at least four highly\nreliable relic candidates among the new systems. Their velocity dispersion is\nlarger than that of normal-sized galaxies of similar stellar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

Ages for luminous giants, which can be seen to large\ndistances, are an essential component of studies of the Milky Way, but they are\ntraditionally very difficult to estimate precisely for a large dataset and\noften require careful analysis on a star-by-star basis in asteroseismology.\nBecause spectra are easier to obtain for large samples, being able to determine\nprecise ages from spectra allows for large age samples to be constructed, but\nspectroscopic ages are often imprecise and contaminated by abundance\ncorrelations. Here we present an application of a variational encoder-decoder\non cross-domain astronomical data to solve these issues.

State-of-the-art integer programming algorithms can compute strong\nrelaxation bounds even for hard instances, but may have to enumerate a large\nnumber of subproblems for determining an optimum solution. If the potential of\nquantum computing realizes, it can be expected that in particular finding\nhigh-quality solutions for hard problems can be done fast. Still, near-future\nquantum hardware considerably limits the size of treatable problems. In this\nwork, we go one step into integrating the potentials of quantum and classical\ntechniques for combinatorial optimization. We propose a hybrid heuristic for\nthe weighted maximum-cut problem or, equivalently, for quadratic unconstrained\nbinary optimization. The heuristic employs a linear programming relaxation,\nrendering it well-suited for integration into exact branch-and-cut algorithms.\nFor large instances, we reduce the problem size according to a linear\nrelaxation such that the reduced problem can be handled by quantum machines of\nlimited size.

Our recent study has shown a correlation between the bile-to-plasma\nratio of FDA-approved sodium fluorescein (SF) and the degree of hepatic IRI,\npresumably due to IRI-induced decrease in the activity of the hepatic multidrug\nresistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2); however, the contribution of SF blood\nclearance via the bile is still convoluted with other factors, such as renal\nclearance. In this work, we sought to computationally model SF blood clearance\nvia the bile. First, we converted extant SF fluorescence data from rat whole\nblood, plasma, and bile to concentrations using calibration curves. Next, based\non these SF concentration data, we generated a liver-centric,\nphysiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of SF liver uptake and\nclearance via the bile. Model simulations show that SF bile concentration is\nhighly sensitive to a change in the activity of hepatic MPR2. These simulations\nsuggest that SF bile clearance along with the PBPK model can be used to\nquantify the effect of IRI on the activity of MRP2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 21:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

However, most estimation methods rely on the\nstrong assumption that all confounders are observed, which is impractical and\nuntestable in the real world. We develop a mediation analysis framework\ninferring the latent confounder for debiasing both direct and indirect causal\neffects. Specifically, we introduce generalized structural equation modeling\nthat incorporates structured latent factors to improve the goodness-of-fit of\nthe model to observed data, and deconfound the mediators and outcome\nsimultaneously. One major advantage of the proposed framework is that it\nutilizes the causal pathway structure from cause to outcome via multiple\nmediators to debias the causal effect without requiring external information on\nlatent confounders. In addition, the proposed framework is flexible in terms of\nintegrating powerful nonparametric prediction algorithms while retaining\ninterpretable mediation effects. In theory, we establish the identification of\nboth causal and mediation effects based on the proposed deconfounding method.\nNumerical experiments on both simulation settings and a normative aging study\nindicate that the proposed approach reduces the estimation bias of both causal\nand mediation effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 21:20:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

We find that models with an IMBH undergo\ncore collapse at earlier times, the larger the IMBH mass the shallower, with an\napproximately constant central density at core collapse. The presence of an\nIMBH tends to lower the central velocity dispersion. These results hold\nindependently of the mass function.

Logistic regression is considered for the VFL model. One party, referred\nto as the active party, possesses the ground truth labels of the samples in the\ntraining phase, while the other, referred to as the passive party, only shares\na separate set of features corresponding to these samples. It is shown that the\nactive party can carry out inference attacks on both training and prediction\nphase samples by acquiring an ML model independently trained on the training\nsamples available to them. This type of inference attack does not require the\nactive party to be aware of the score of a specific sample, hence it is\nreferred to as an agnostic inference attack. It is shown that utilizing the\nobserved confidence scores during the prediction phase, before the time of the\nattack, can improve the performance of the active party's autonomous model, and\nthus improve the quality of the agnostic inference attack.

As geminate\nrecombination of excess carriers is the most frequent radiative pathway for\nelectrons and holes in solar cells at low power density of illumination, while\nnongeminate recombination dominates at high power, enhanced nongeminate\nrecombination occurs at the SCOM focal plane. Thus, the cs-p-CELIV signal\nprovides enhanced information on the mobility of all of the cross-sectional\nlayers, except for the focal plane. By scanning the focal plane along the\nz-axis, the mobility profile can be derived. To demonstrate our technique, we\nuse it to investigate the carrier mobility in a hydrogenated amorphous silicon\n(a-Si:H) solar cell.

A thorough evaluation with real multi-document sets streams\ndemonstrates that PDSum outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised\nmulti-document summarization algorithms in EMDS in terms of relevance, novelty,\nand distinctiveness and is also robust to various evaluation settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 23:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Random surveys are common because\nthey allow the use of theoretically unbiased estimators. In practice however,\nsuch design-based approaches are often unable to account for logistical or\nbudgetary constraints. Thus, they may result in samples that are logistically\ninefficient, or infeasible to implement. Various balancing and optimal sampling\ntechniques have been proposed to improve the statistical efficiency of such\ndesigns, but few models have attempted to explicitly incorporate logistical and\nfinancial constraints. We introduce a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for\noptimal sampling design, capable of capturing a variety of constraints and a\nwide class of Bayesian regression models. We demonstrate the use of our model\non three spatial sampling problems of increasing complexity, including the real\nlogistics of the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis survey of\nTanana, Alaska. Our methodological contribution to survey design is significant\nbecause the proposed modeling framework makes it possible to generate\nhigh-quality sampling designs and inferences while satisfying practical\nconstraints defined by the user. The technical novelty of the method is the\nexplicit integration of Bayesian statistical models in combinatorial\noptimization.

In this work, we propose to reconstruct\na 3D colored shape from a single RGB image through a novel conditional\ndiffusion model. The reverse process of the proposed diffusion model is\nconsisted of three modules, shape prediction module, color prediction module\nand NeRF-like rendering module. In shape prediction module, the reference RGB\nimage is first encoded into a high-level shape feature and then the shape\nfeature is utilized as a condition to predict the reverse geometric noise in\ndiffusion model. Then the color of each 3D point updated in shape prediction\nmodule is predicted by color prediction module. Finally, a NeRF-like rendering\nmodule is designed to render the colored point cloud predicted by the former\ntwo modules to 2D image space to guide the training conditioned only on a\nreference image. As far as the authors know, the proposed method is the first\ndiffusion model for 3D colored shape reconstruction from a single RGB image.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive\nperformance on colored 3D shape reconstruction, and the ablation study\nvalidates the positive role of the color prediction module in improving the\nreconstruction quality of 3D geometric point cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 02:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Consequently, evaluating and enhancing the\nquality of ASR systems is of great importance. This paper proposes ASDF, an\nAutomated Speech Recognition Differential Testing Framework for testing ASR\nsystems. ASDF extends an existing ASR testing tool, the CrossASR++, which\nsynthesizes test cases from a text corpus. However, CrossASR++ fails to make\nuse of the text corpus efficiently and provides limited information on how the\nfailed test cases can improve ASR systems. To address these limitations, our\ntool incorporates two novel features: (1) a text transformation module to boost\nthe number of generated test cases and uncover more errors in ASR systems and\n(2) a phonetic analysis module to identify on which phonemes the ASR system\ntend to produce errors. ASDF generates more high-quality test cases by applying\nvarious text transformation methods (e.g., change tense) to the texts in failed\ntest cases. By doing so, ASDF can utilize a small text corpus to generate a\nlarge number of audio test cases, something which CrossASR++ is not capable of.\nIn addition, ASDF implements more metrics to evaluate the performance of ASR\nsystems from multiple perspectives. ASDF performs phonetic analysis on the\nidentified failed test cases to identify the phonemes that ASR systems tend to\ntranscribe incorrectly, providing useful information for developers to improve\nASR systems.

Many methods with varying levels of complexity have been\ndeveloped to predict CME arrival. However, the mean absolute error (MAE) of\npredictions remains above 12 hours, even with the increasing complexity of\nmethods. In this work we develop a new method for CME arrival time prediction\nthat uses magnetohydrodynamic simulations involving data-constrained\nflux-rope-based CMEs, which are introduced in a data-driven solar wind\nbackground. We found that, for 6 CMEs studied in this work, the MAE in arrival\ntime was ~8 hours. We further improved our arrival time predictions by using\nensemble modeling and comparing the ensemble solutions with STEREO-A&B\nheliospheric imager data. This was done by using our simulations to create\nsynthetic J-maps. A machine learning (ML) method called the lasso regression\nwas used for this comparison. Using this approach, we could reduce the MAE to\n~4 hours.

Federated Split Learning (FSL) preserves the\nparallel model training principle of FL, with a reduced device computation\nrequirement thanks to splitting the ML model between the server and clients.\nHowever, FSL still incurs very high communication overhead due to transmitting\nthe smashed data and gradients between the clients and the server in each\nglobal round. Furthermore, the server has to maintain separate models for every\nclient, resulting in a significant computation and storage requirement that\ngrows linearly with the number of clients. This paper tries to solve these two\nissues by proposing a communication and storage efficient federated and split\nlearning (CSE-FSL) strategy, which utilizes an auxiliary network to locally\nupdate the client models while keeping only a single model at the server, hence\navoiding the communication of gradients from the server and greatly reducing\nthe server resource requirement. Communication cost is further reduced by only\nsending the smashed data in selected epochs from the clients. We provide a\nrigorous theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL that guarantees its convergence for\nnon-convex loss functions.

Two signal\nfields coupled from two ends of an optical cavity excite two separate atomic\ntransitions simultaneously under the collective strong coupling condition and\nproduce three polariton eigenstates which can be tuned freely by varying system\nparameters. The output field intensities of multiple channels are zero when the\nCPA criterion is satisfied. However, destructive quantum interference can be\ninduced by a free-space weak control laser tuned to the multi-polariton\nexcitations. As a consequence, the CQED system acts as a perfect light\nabsorber/reflector as the control field is turned on/off the polariton\nresonances.

It is\nwell-known that in the setting of offline optimization, the smoothness of\nfunctions and the strong convexity of functions accompanying specific\nproperties of constraint sets can be utilized to achieve fast convergence rates\nfor the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. However, for OFW, previous studies only\nestablish a dynamic regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{T}(1+V_T+\\sqrt{D_T}))$ by\nutilizing the convexity of problems, where $T$ is the number of rounds, $V_T$\nis the function variation, and $D_T$ is the gradient variation.

The\nkey technique for this extension is to set the step size of OFW with a line\nsearch rule. In this way, we first show that the dynamic regret bound of OFW\ncan be improved to $O(\\sqrt{T(1+V_T)})$ for smooth functions.

However,\nit is still a challenging topic to apply knowledge distillation to detection\ntasks. There are two key points resulting in poor distillation performance for\ndetection tasks. One is the serious imbalance between foreground and background\nfeatures, another one is that small object lacks enough feature representation.\nTo solve the above issues, we propose a new distillation method named dual\nrelation knowledge distillation (DRKD), including pixel-wise relation\ndistillation and instance-wise relation distillation. The pixel-wise relation\ndistillation embeds pixel-wise features in the graph space and applies graph\nconvolution to capture the global pixel relation. By distilling the global\npixel relation, the student detector can learn the relation between foreground\nand background features, and avoid the difficulty of distilling features\ndirectly for the feature imbalance issue. Besides, we find that instance-wise\nrelation supplements valuable knowledge beyond independent features for small\nobjects. Thus, the instance-wise relation distillation is designed, which\ncalculates the similarity of different instances to obtain a relation matrix.\nMore importantly, a relation filter module is designed to highlight valuable\ninstance relations.

Therefore, the unsupervised vehicle\nre-identification with stronger cross-scene generalization ability has\nattracted more attention.

An ultrasound scanning robot usually\nworks in a doctor-robot co-existing environment, hence both efficiency and\nsafety during the collaboration should be considered. In this paper, we propose\na novel multi-modal control scheme for ultrasound scanning robots, in which\nthree interaction modes are integrated into a single control input.\nSpecifically, the scanning mode drives the robot to track a time-varying\ntrajectory on the patient's body under the desired impedance model; the\nrecovery mode allows the robot to actively recontact the body whenever physical\ncontact between the ultrasound probe and the patient's body is lost; the\nhuman-guided mode renders the robot passive such that the doctor can safely\nintervene to manually reposition the probe. The integration of multiple modes\nallows the doctor to intervene safely at any time during the task and also\nmaximizes the robot's autonomous scanning ability.

Following previous works on semi-implicit hybrid\nFV/FE schemes, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are split into a\npressure and a transport-diffusion subsystem. The first of them can be seen as\na Poisson type problem and is thus solved efficiently using classical\ncontinuous Lagrange finite elements. On the other hand, finite volume methods\nare employed to solve the convective subsystem, in combination with\nCrouzeix-Raviart finite elements for the discretization of the viscous stress\ntensor. For some applications, the related CFL condition, even if depending\nonly in the bulk velocity, may yield a severe time restriction in case explicit\nschemes are used. To overcome this issue an implicit approach is proposed. The\nsystem obtained from the implicit discretization of the transport-diffusion\noperator is solved using an inexact Newton-Krylov method, based either on the\nBiCStab or the GMRES algorithm. To improve the convergence properties of the\nlinear solver a symmetric Gauss-Seidel (SGS) preconditioner is employed,\ntogether with a simple but efficient approach for the reordering of the grid\nelements that is compatible with MPI parallelization.

At the same\ntime, excitement about Venus exploration is blooming again with a number of\nconfirmed and proposed missions in the coming decades from India, Russia,\nJapan, the European Space Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration. In this chapter, we review what is known and what we may\ndiscover tomorrow in complementary studies of Venus and its exoplanetary\ncousins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 15:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Here, we build on a mechanistic dual-path\nhypothesis that brings error-monitoring and emotional processing systems as key\nelements for self-awareness, with distinct impacts on the emergence of\nanosognosia in AD. Proceeding from the notion of anosognosia as a dimensional\nsyndrome, ranging from the lack of concern about one's own deficits (i.e.,\nanosodiaphoria) to the complete lack of awareness of deficits, our hypothesis\nstates that (i) unawareness of deficits would result from a failure in the\nerror-monitoring system, whereas (ii) anosodiaphoria would more likely result\nfrom an imbalance between emotional processing and error-monitoring systems. In\nthe first case, a synaptic failure in the error-monitoring system, in which the\ncingulate cortex plays a major role, would have a negative impact on error (or\ndeficits) awareness, preventing patients from becoming aware of their\ncondition. In the second case, an impairment in the emotional processing\nsystem, in which the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex play a major role, would\nprevent patients from monitoring the internal milieu for relevant errors (or\ndeficits) and assigning appropriate value to them, thus biasing their impact on\nthe error-monitoring system. Our hypothesis stems from two scientific premises.\nOne comes from preliminary results in AD patients showing a synaptic failure in\nthe error-monitoring system and decline of awareness at the time of diagnosis.\nAnother comes from the somatic marker hypothesis, which proposes that emotional\nsignals are critical to adaptive behavior. Further exploration will be of great\ninterest to illuminate the foundations of self-awareness and improve our\nunderstanding of the underlying mechanisms of anosognosia in AD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 15:36:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 20:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Eliciting information\non observable quantities allows experts to provide meaningful information on a\nquantity familiar to them, in contrast to elicitation on model parameters,\nwhich may be subject to interactions with other parameters or non-linear\ntransformations before obtaining an observable quantity. The approach to\nincorporating expert opinion described in this paper is distinctive in that we\ndo not specify a prior to match an expert's opinion on observed quantity,\nrather we obtain a posterior by updating the model parameters through a loss\nfunction. This loss function contains the observable quantity, expressed a\nfunction of the parameters, and is related to the expert's opinion which is\ntypically operationalized as a statistical distribution. Parameters which\ngenerate observable quantities which are further from the expert's opinion\nincur a higher loss, allowing for the model parameters to be estimated based on\ntheir fidelity to both the data and expert opinion, with the relative strength\ndetermined by the number of observations and precision of the elicited belief.\nIncluding expert opinion in this fashion allows for a flexible specification of\nthe opinion and in many situations is straightforward to implement with\ncommonly used probabilistic programming software.

A\npencil plasma jet (PPJ) using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) was used to\nprepare PAW. In one configuration, the air bubbler was fitted at the tip of the\npencil plasma jet, causing the discharge gases to emerge as bubbles in the\nwater. In another configuration, the water was agitated using the bubbler\nduring plasma-water interaction. The plasma generated in the PPJ setup was a\nfilamentary DBD micro-discharge. However, water agitation using the bubbler\nchanged this filamentary DBD to a diffusive DBD, which showed higher discharge\ncurrent and lower electrode voltage compared to filamentary DBD. PAW produced\nusing the fitted bubbler in the PPJ setup showed enhanced physicochemical\nproperties, including NO2, NO3, dissolved O3, and non-traceable H2O2 compared\nto PAW produced without a bubbler. Additionally, PAW produced using water\nagitation by the bubbler showed a substantial increase in physicochemical\nproperties and reactive species concentrations. The PAW process parameters such\nas air flow rate, plasma-water treatment time, and plasma discharge power\nshowed monotonically increasing properties of PAW. The maximum concentrations\nof NO2, NO3, H2O2, and dissolved O3 (flow rate: 20 L/min, time: 5 min, power:\n15 W) observed in this study were 0.334 g/L, 0.078 g/L, 0.045 g/L, and 0.016\ng/L, respectively.

While FPE describes the\nmacroscopic behavior of particles under drift and diffusion, MVE accounts for\nthe additional inter-particle interactions, which are often highly singular in\nphysical systems. Two important examples considered in this paper are the MVE\nwith Coulomb interactions and the vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes\nequation. We show that a generalized self-consistency potential controls the\nKL-divergence between a hypothesis solution to the ground truth, through\nentropy dissipation. Built on this result, we propose to solve the MVEs by\nminimizing this potential function, while utilizing the neural networks for\nfunction approximation. We validate the empirical performance of our approach\nby comparing with state-of-the-art NN-based PDE solvers on several example\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 14:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

Part 1 of this paper considers the\nprimary motivations given for developing HGVs and summarizes the current\ndevelopment programs of the United States, Russia, and China. It then analyzes\nthe vulnerability of hypersonic boost-glide vehicles (BGVs) to missile defenses\nand finds that evading the most capable current endo-atmospheric defenses\nrequires that BGVs maintain speeds significantly higher than Mach 5 throughout\ntheir glide phase. Achieving these high speeds has important implications for\nthe mass and range of these weapons, which in turn affect what delivery\nvehicles can carry them and how their performance compares to other means of\ndelivery, as is discussed in Part 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2023 00:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}
