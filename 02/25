GEAR-RT is modeled after RAMSES-RT\n(Rosdahl et al. 2013) with some key differences. Firstly, while RAMSES-RT uses\nFinite Volume methods and an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) strategy, GEAR-RT\nemploys particles as discretization elements and solves the equations using a\nFinite Volume Particle Method (FVPM). Secondly, GEAR-RT makes use of the\ntask-based parallelization strategy of SWIFT, which allows for optimized load\nbalancing, increased cache efficiency, asynchronous communications, and a\ndomain decomposition based on work rather than on data. GEAR-RT is able to\nperform sub-cycles of radiative transfer steps w.r.t. a single hydrodynamics\nstep. Radiation requires much smaller time step sizes than hydrodynamics, and\nsub-cycling permits calculations which are not strictly necessary to be\nskipped. Indeed, in a test case with gravity, hydrodynamics, and radiative\ntransfer, the sub-cycling is able to reduce the runtime of a simulation by over\n90%. Allowing only a part of the involved physics to be sub-cycled is a\ncontrived matter when task-based parallelism is involved, and is an entirely\nnovel feature in SWIFT.\n  Since GEAR-RT uses a FVPM, a detailed introduction into Finite Volume methods\nand Finite Volume Particle Methods is presented. In astrophysical literature,\ntwo FVPM methods are written about: Hopkins (2015) have implemented one in\ntheir GIZMO code, while the one mentioned in Ivanova et al. (2013) isn't used\nto date. In this work, I test an implementation of the Ivanova et al. (2013)\nversion, and conclude that in its current form, it is not suitable for use with\nparticles which are co-moving with the fluid, which in turn is an essential\nfeature for cosmological simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 16:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Over a wide range of impact velocities, the air is\ncompressed into a thin film, slowing the progress of the liquid toward the\nsurface. Below a critical impact velocity, the air film remains intact; the\ndroplet rebounds off of the air film without making contact. Above this\ncritical impact velocity, the droplet always makes contact. The initiation of\ncontact formation occurs via a topological transition, whereby the initially\nconnected gas domain is ruptured, and a liquid capillary bridge forms, binding\nthe droplet to the surface. Here we probe this transition in detail around the\ncritical impact velocity using calibrated total internal reflection (TIR)\nmicroscopy to monitor the air film profile at high speed during the impact\nprocess. Two air film rupture modalities are observed: nucleated contacts,\nwhich are isolated and don't correspond to the global minimum air film\nthickness, and spontaneous contacts, that occur always on a ring centered upon\nthe impact axis where the air film reaches its global minimum. Our measurements\nshow that for impact velocities exceeding the critical velocity for contact\ninitiation, the air film ruptures at a nearly identical height h min ~ 20 nm,\nfor two fluids - silicone oil and a water glycerol mixture.

This design has been\nmotivated and formalized by Neu, Tas, and Tse (S&P 2021) through the\nintroduction of the ebb-and-flow class of protocols, which are protocols with\ntwo confirmation rules that output two ledgers, one that provides liveness\nunder dynamic participation (and synchrony), LMD-GHOST, and one that provides\nsafety even under network partitions, Casper.\n  Currently, Gasper takes between 64 and 95 slots to finalize blocks. Because\nof that, a significant portion of the chain is susceptible to reorgs. The\npossibility to capture MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) through such reorgs can\nthen disincentivize honestly following the protocol, breaking the desired\ncorrespondence of honest and rational behavior. Moreover, the relatively long\ntime to finality forces users to choose between economic security and faster\ntransaction confirmation. This motivates the study of the so-called single slot\nfinality protocols: consensus protocols that finalize a block in each slot and,\nmore importantly, that finalize the block proposed at a given slot within such\nslot.\n  In this work we propose a simple, non-blackbox protocol that combines a\nsynchronous dynamically available protocol with a finality gadget, resulting in\na secure ebb-and-flow protocol that can finalize one block per slot, paving the\nway to single slot finality within Ethereum. Importantly, the protocol we\npresent can finalize the block proposed in a slot, within such slot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 16:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

While there are many methods for generating synthetic tabular\ndata, the task remains non-trivial and unexplored for specific scenarios. One\nsuch scenario is survival data. Here, the key difficulty is censoring: for some\ninstances, we are not aware of the time of event, or if one even occurred.\nImbalances in censoring and time horizons cause generative models to experience\nthree new failure modes specific to survival analysis: (1) generating too few\nat-risk members; (2) generating too many at-risk members; and (3) censoring too\nearly. We formalize these failure modes and provide three new generative\nmetrics to quantify them. Following this, we propose SurvivalGAN, a generative\nmodel that handles survival data firstly by addressing the imbalance in the\ncensoring and event horizons, and secondly by using a dedicated mechanism for\napproximating time-to-event/censoring. We evaluate this method via extensive\nexperiments on medical datasets.

It rests on a crucial\nassumption that we can write the treated unit as a linear combination of the\nuntreated units. This linearity assumption, however, can be unlikely to hold in\npractice and, when violated, the resulting SC estimates are incorrect. In this\npaper we examine two questions: (1) How large can the misspecification error\nbe? (2) How can we limit it? First, we provide theoretical bounds to quantify\nthe misspecification error. The bounds are comforting: small misspecifications\ninduce small errors. With these bounds in hand, we then develop new SC\nestimators that are specially designed to minimize misspecification error. The\nestimators are based on additional data about each unit, which is used to\nproduce the SC weights. (For example, if the units are countries then the\nadditional data might be demographic information about each.) We study our\nestimators on synthetic data; we find they produce more accurate causal\nestimates than standard synthetic controls. We then re-analyze the California\ntobacco-program data of the original SC paper, now including additional data\nfrom the US census about per-state demographics. Our estimators show that the\nobservations in the pre-treatment period lie within the bounds of\nmisspecification error, and that the observations post-treatment lie outside of\nthose bounds. This is evidence that our SC methods have uncovered a true\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 17:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

Instead, VIPeR implicitly obtains pessimism by simply perturbing the\noffline data multiple times with carefully-designed i.i.d.

We achieve this by introducing a cut-off into the subtraction,\nrestricting its influence to the immediate neighborhood of the source. In this\nwork, this approach will be presented, analyzed, and compared to other\nstate-of-the-art FEM right-hand side approaches. Furthermore, we discuss how to\narrive at an efficient and stable implementation. We perform validation in\nmulti-layer sphere models where analytical solutions exist. There, we\ndemonstrate that the localized subtraction approach is vastly more efficient\nthan the subtraction approach. Moreover, we find that for the EEG forward\nproblem, the localized subtraction approach is less dependent on the global\nstructure of the FEM mesh when compared to the subtraction approach.\nAdditionally, we show the localized subtraction approach to rival, and in many\ncases even surpass, the other investigated approaches in terms of accuracy. For\nthe MEG forward problem, we show the localized subtraction approach and the\nsubtraction approach to produce highly accurate approximations of the volume\ncurrents close to the source. The localized subtraction approach thus reduces\nthe computational cost of the subtraction approach to an extent that makes it\nusable in practical applications without sacrificing rigorousness and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 17:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

The transition mass where $\\fbp$ reaches half the plateau\nvalue is $\\logMstar = 10.14$, consistent with the observational value within\nmeasurement errors. We show that this transition in $\\fbp$ can be attributed to\nthe youth of the bars at low $\\Mstar$, which is a consequence of downsizing of\ngalaxies. Young bars, being generally shorter and weaker, have not yet had time\nto form BPs. At high mass, while we find a plateau, the value is at $\\sim 60\\%$\nwhereas observations saturate at $100\\%$. We attribute this difference to\nexcessive heating in TNG50, due to merger activity and to numerical resolution\neffects. BPs in TNG50 tend to occur in galaxies with more quiescent merger\nhistories. As a result, the main driver of whether a bar hosts a BP in TNG50 is\nnot the galaxy mass, but how long and strong the bar is. Separating the BP\nsample into those that have visibly buckled and those that have not, we find\nthat fully half of BP galaxies show clear signs of buckling, despite the\nexcessive heating and limited vertical resolution of TNG50.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 18:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

The presence of non-trivial corner symmetries\nassociated with any entangling cut provides stringent constraints on the\ntheory's mathematical structure and a guide through quantization. This report\nreviews new and recent results for non-perturbative quantum gravity, which are\nnatural consequences of this structure. First, we establish that the corner\nsymmetry derived from the gauge principle encodes quantum entanglement across\ninternal boundaries. We also explain how the quantum representation of the\ncorner symmetry algebra provides us with a notion of quantum geometry. We then\nfocus our discussion on the first-order formulation of gravity and show how\nmany results obtained in the continuum connect naturally with previous results\nin loop quantum gravity. In particular, we show that it is possible to get,\npurely from quantization and without discretization, an area operator with\ndiscrete spectrum, which is covariant under local Lorentz symmetry. We\nemphasize that while loop gravity correctly captures some of the gravitational\nquantum numbers, it does not capture all of them, which points towards\nimportant directions for future developments.

The traditional techniques often resort\nover-sampling methods, but they may cause overfitting problem. More recently,\nsome works propose to synthesize additional nodes for minority classes from the\nlabelled nodes, however, there is no any guarantee if those generated nodes\nreally stand for the corresponding minority classes. In fact, improperly\nsynthesized nodes may result in insufficient generalization of the algorithm.\nTo resolve the problem, in this paper we seek to automatically augment the\nminority classes from the massive unlabelled nodes of the graph. Specifically,\nwe propose \\textit{GraphSR}, a novel self-training strategy to augment the\nminority classes with significant diversity of unlabelled nodes, which is based\non a Similarity-based selection module and a Reinforcement Learning(RL)\nselection module. The first module finds a subset of unlabelled nodes which are\nmost similar to those labelled minority nodes, and the second one further\ndetermines the representative and reliable nodes from the subset via RL\ntechnique. Furthermore, the RL-based module can adaptively determine the\nsampling scale according to current training data. This strategy is general and\ncan be easily combined with different GNNs models.

The key to our proposed\nmethod is a reinterpretation of frequency collisions as an unintended\ndegeneracy of Floquet states, which allows a collision analysis on more complex\nsystems with many qubits driven by multi-modal microwave drives. Although the\nFloquet state is defined in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, we develop\nalgorithms, based on operation perturbation theory, to truncate the Hilbert\nspace down to the optimal computational complexity. In particular, we show that\nthe computational complexity of the collision analysis for a sparse qubit\nlattice is linear with the number of qubits. Finally, we demonstrate our\nproposed method on Cross-Resonance based experimental protocols. We first study\nthe Cross-Resonance gate in an isolated three-qubit system, where the\neffectiveness of our method is verified by comparing it with previous studies.\nWe next consider the more complex problem of syndrome extraction in the\nheavy-hexagon code. Our proposed method advances our understanding of quantum\ncontrol for quantum processors and contributes to their improved design and\ncontrol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 18:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-27"}

These persistent\nequatorial zones of trapped high energy particles up to tens of MeV can produce\nbright radio emission and impact the surface chemistry of close-in moons.\nRecent observations confirm planet-like radio emission such as aurorae from\nlarge-scale magnetospheric current systems on very low mass stars and brown\ndwarfs. These objects, collectively known as ultracool dwarfs, also exhibit\nquiescent radio emission hypothesized to trace stellar coronal flare activity\nor extrasolar radiation belt analogs. Here we present high resolution imaging\nof the ultracool dwarf LSR J1835+3259 demonstrating that this radio emission is\nspatially resolved and traces a long-lived, double-lobed, and axisymmetric\nstructure similar in morphology to the Jovian radiation belts. Up to 18\nultracool dwarf radii separate the two lobes. This structure is stably present\nin three observations spanning >1 year. We infer a belt-like distribution of\nplasma confined by the magnetic dipole of LSR J1835+3259, and we estimate ~15\nMeV electron energies that are consistent with those measured in the Jovian\nradiation belts.

This\nexpansion is an asymptotic series, so - via the same resurgence analysis\nfamiliar from quantum mechanics - necessitates the existence of\nnon-perturbative effects. In the case of identity conformal blocks, these new\neffects have a simple interpretation: the CFT must possess new primary\noperators with dimension of order the central charge.

Thanks to\nvarious fuzzing techniques, most of the fuzzers have been able to demonstrate\ngreat performance on their selected targets. However, paradoxically, this\ndiversity in fuzzers also made it difficult to select fuzzers that are best\nsuitable for complex real-world programs, which we call selection burden.\nCommunities attempted to address this problem by creating a set of standard\nbenchmarks to compare and contrast the performance of fuzzers for a wide range\nof applications, but the result was always a suboptimal decision - the\nbest-performing fuzzer on average does not guarantee the best outcome for the\ntarget of a user's interest.\n  To overcome this problem, we propose an automated, yet non-intrusive\nmeta-fuzzer, called autofz, to maximize the benefits of existing\nstate-of-the-art fuzzers via dynamic composition. To an end user, this means\nthat, instead of spending time on selecting which fuzzer to adopt, one can\nsimply put all of the available fuzzers to autofz, and achieve the best,\noptimal result. The key idea is to monitor the runtime progress of the fuzzers,\ncalled trends (similar in concept to gradient descent), and make a fine-grained\nadjustment of resource allocation. This is a stark contrast to existing\napproaches - autofz deduces a suitable set of fuzzers of the active workload in\na fine-grained manner at runtime. Our evaluation shows that autofz outperforms\nany best-performing individual fuzzers in 11 out of 12 available benchmarks and\nbeats the best, collaborative fuzzing approaches in 19 out of 20 benchmarks.\nMoreover, on average, autofz found 152% more bugs than individual fuzzers, and\n415% more bugs than collaborative fuzzing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 20:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

To achieve state-of-the-art results, these methods assume that\nthe objects are specified with respect to a fixed canonical coordinate frame,\nwhere instances of the same category are perfectly aligned. In this work, we\npresent a new method for joint category-specific 3D reconstruction and object\npose estimation from a single image.

In order to avoid\nimpairing network performance during the initial stages of learning, agents are\npre-trained in an earlier phase of offline learning. During this phase, an\ninitial policy is obtained using feedback from a static network simulator and\nconsidering a wide variety of scenarios. Finally, agents can intelligently tune\nthe cell parameters of a test network by suggesting small incremental changes,\nslowly guiding the network toward an optimal configuration. The agents propose\noptimal changes using the experience gained with the simulator in the\npre-training phase, but they can also continue to learn from current network\nreadings after each change. The results show how the proposed approach\nsignificantly improves the performance gains already provided by expert\nsystem-based methods when applied to remote antenna tilt optimization.

Parametric images of HK-distribution\nparameters can be formed by dividing the envelope data into small overlapping\npatches and estimating parameters within the patches independently. This\napproach imposes two limiting constraints, the HK-distribution parameters are\nassumed to be constant within each patch, and each patch requires enough\nindependent samples.

By using empirical measurements of the CMB\nlensing reconstruction, combined with weak priors on the smoothness of the\nlensing spectrum, foregrounds, and shape of any additional integrated\nSachs-Wolfe effect, we show how the early-universe parameters can be\nconstrained from CMB observations almost independently of the late-time\nevolution. This provides a way to test new models for early-universe physics,\nand measure early-universe parameters, independently of late-time cosmology.\nUsing the empirical measurement of lensing keeps the size of the effect of\nlate-time modelling uncertainty under control, leading to only modest increases\nin error bars of most early-universe parameters compared to assuming a full\nevolution model. We provide robust constraints on early-$\\Lambda$CDM model\nparameters using the latest Planck PR4 data and show that with future data\nmarginalizing over a single lensing amplitude parameter is sufficient to remove\nsensitivity to late-time cosmological model only if the spectral shape matches\npredictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 21:56:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 14:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

To explore how\neducators balance the security and privacy of their students with the\nrequirements of remote exams, we sent survey requests to over 3,400 instructors\nat a large private university that taught online classes during the 2020/21\nacademic year.

Examples of such semirings include Viterbi semiring, min-max or\naccess control semiring, tropical semiring, and fuzzy semiring.\n  The present work investigates the complexity of constraint optimization\nproblems over semirings. The generic optimization problem we study is the\nfollowing: Given a propositional formula $\\varphi$ over $n$ variable and a\nsemiring $(K,+,\\cdot,0,1)$, find the maximum value over all possible\ninterpretations of $\\varphi$ over $K$. This can be seen as a generalization of\nthe well-known satisfiability problem. A related problem is to find an\ninterpretation that achieves the maximum value. In this work, we first focus on\nthese optimization problems over the Viterbi semiring, which we call optConfVal\nand optConf.\n  We show that for general propositional formulas in negation normal form,\noptConfVal and optConf are in ${\\mathrm{FP}}^{\\mathrm{NP}}$. We investigate\noptConf when the input formula $\\varphi$ is represented as a CNF. For CNF\nformulae, we first derive an upper bound on optConfVal as a function of the\nnumber of maximum satisfiable clauses. In particular, we show that if $r$ is\nthe maximum number of satisfiable clauses in a CNF formula with $m$ clauses,\nthen its optConfVal is at most $1/4^{m-r}$. Building on this we establish that\noptConfVal for CNF formulae is hard for the complexity class\n${\\mathrm{FP}}^{\\mathrm{NP}[\\log]}$. We also design polynomial-time\napproximation algorithms and establish an inapproximability for optConfVal. We\nestablish similar complexity results for these optimization problems over other\nsemirings including tropical, fuzzy, and access control semirings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 23:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

The Euler buckling\nbehavior is analytically tackled as a static displacement-controlled process as\nan example of the theoretical procedure, where no force potential energy\ncomponent but compression and bending strain energy components are considered\nprecisely at the deformed configuration for the total potential energy of the\nbeams. Analytical solutions to the potential energy, structural deformation,\ninternal forces and their critical results are obtained in closed-form for the\nbeams with six typical boundary conditions. We find that these beams have only\none unique but universal normalized potential energy surface depending on two\ndimensionless quantities. The valley bottom pathways on the potential energy\nsurface show that the critical buckling state is not only a bifurcation point\nbut also a valley-ridge inflection point, and the energy increases\nquadratically before the point and increases linearly with a slope of 2 beyond\nthe point. The axial forces are gradually increasing during post-buckling, but\nare almost constant, indicating a symmetric neutral bifurcation buckling. Our\ntheoretical expressions generally agree with the counterparts of the\nforce-controlled model but exactly indicate somewhat differences.

Purpose: To study excited states in $^{23}$Na above the proton\nthreshold to determine if this resonance state, and other unconfirmed resonance\nstates in $^{23}$Na, exist. Methods: The non-selective proton inelastic\nscattering reaction at low energies was used to search for excited states in\n$^{23}$Na above the proton threshold. Protons scattered from various targets\nwere momentum-analysed in the Q3D magnetic spectrograph at the Maier-Leibnitz\nLaboratorium, Munich, Germany.

These\nforces may be transmitted over long range through the cytoskeletal medium - a\ndisordered, viscoelastic network of biopolymers. The resulting cell size scale\nforce chains can in principle mediate mechanical interactions between distant\nactomyosin units, leading to self-organized structural order in the cell\ncytoskeleton. To investigate this process, we model the actin cytoskeleton on a\npercolated fiber lattice network, where fibers are modeled as linear elastic\nelements that can both bend and stretch, whereas myosin motors exert\ncontractile force dipoles. We quantify the range and heterogeneity of force\ntransmission in these networks in response to a force dipole, showing how these\ndepend on varying bond dilution and fiber bending-to-stretching stiffness\nratio. By analyzing clusters of nodes connected to highly strained bonds, as\nwell as the decay rate of strain energy with distance from the force dipole, we\nshow that long-range force transmission is screened out by fiber bending in\ndiluted networks. We further characterize the difference in the propagation of\ntensile and compressive forces. This leads to a dependence of the mechanical\ninteraction between a pair of force dipoles on their mutual separation and\norientation. In more homogeneous networks, the interaction between force\ndipoles recapitulates the power law dependence on separation distance predicted\nby continuum elasticity theory, while in diluted networks, the interactions are\nshort-ranged and fluctuate strongly with local network configurations.\nAltogether, our work suggests that elastic interactions between force dipoles\nin disordered, fibrous media can act as an organizing principle in biological\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 00:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

However, their performance highly relies on the architecture\nhyperparameters, and finding proper hyperparameters for a deep CNN is a\nchallenging optimization problem owing to its high-dimensional and\ncomputationally expensive characteristics. Given these difficulties, this study\nproposes a surrogate-assisted highly cooperative hyperparameter optimization\n(SHCHO) algorithm for chain-styled CNNs. To narrow the large search space,\nSHCHO first decomposes the whole CNN into several overlapping sub-CNNs in\naccordance with the overlapping hyperparameter interaction structure and then\ncooperatively optimizes these hyperparameter subsets. Two cooperation\nmechanisms are designed during this process. One coordinates all the sub-CNNs\nto reproduce the information flow in the whole CNN and achieve macro\ncooperation among them, and the other tackles the overlapping components by\nsimultaneously considering the involved two sub-CNNs and facilitates micro\ncooperation between them. As a result, a proper hyperparameter configuration\ncan be effectively located for the whole CNN. Besides, SHCHO also employs the\nwell-performing surrogate technique to assist in the hyperparameter\noptimization of each sub-CNN, thereby greatly reducing the expensive\ncomputational cost. Extensive experimental results on two widely-used image\nclassification datasets indicate that SHCHO can significantly improve the\nperformance of CNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 02:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

Mainstream solutions consist of well-trained neural networks and\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods, which need numerous\ncarefully labeled images and multiple sensor estimations. However, there is a\nlack of underground parking scenario datasets with multiple sensors and\nwell-labeled images that support both SLAM tasks and perception tasks, such as\nsemantic segmentation and parking slot detection. In this paper, we present\nSUPS, a simulated dataset for underground automatic parking, which supports\nmultiple tasks with multiple sensors and multiple semantic labels aligned with\nsuccessive images according to timestamps. We intend to cover the defect of\nexisting datasets with the variability of environments and the diversity and\naccessibility of sensors in the virtual scene. Specifically, the dataset\nrecords frames from four surrounding fisheye cameras, two forward pinhole\ncameras, a depth camera, and data from LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU),\nGNSS. Pixel-level semantic labels are provided for objects, especially ground\nsigns such as arrows, parking lines, lanes, and speed bumps.

We also evaluate the state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms\nand perception models on our dataset.

Rip currents\nare dangerous strong currents that can drag beachgoers out to sea. Most people\nare either unaware of them or do not know what they look like. In some\ninstances, even trained personnel such as lifeguards have difficulty\nidentifying them. RipViz produces a simple, easy to understand visualization of\nrip location overlaid on the source video. With RipViz, we first obtain an\nunsteady 2D vector field from the stationary video using optical flow. Movement\nat each pixel is analyzed over time. At each seed point, sequences of short\npathlines, rather a single long pathline, are traced across the frames of the\nvideo to better capture the quasi-periodic flow behavior of wave activity.\nBecause of the motion on the beach, the surf zone, and the surrounding areas,\nthese pathlines may still appear very cluttered and incomprehensible.\nFurthermore, lay audiences are not familiar with pathlines and may not know how\nto interpret them. To address this, we treat rip currents as a flow anomaly in\nan otherwise normal flow. To learn about the normal flow behavior, we train an\nLSTM autoencoder with pathline sequences from normal ocean, foreground, and\nbackground movements. During test time, we use the trained LSTM autoencoder to\ndetect anomalous pathlines (i.e., those in the rip zone). The origination\npoints of such anomalous pathlines, over the course of the video, are then\npresented as points within the rip zone. RipViz is fully automated and does not\nrequire user input. Feedback from domain expert suggests that RipViz has the\npotential for wider use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 04:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

The key to\nachieve VCC is to design a semantic interface that enables composition of\ncorrectness theorems for compiling individual modules. Most of the existing\ntechniques for VCC fix a semantic interface from the very beginning and force\nit down to every single compiler pass. This requires significant changes to the\nexisting framework and makes it difficult to understand the relationship\nbetween conditions enforced by the semantic interface and the actual\nrequirements of compiler passes. A different approach is to design appropriate\nsemantic interfaces for individual compiler passes and combine them into a\nunified interface which faithfully reflects the requirements of underlying\ncompiler passes. However, this requires vertically composable simulation\nrelations, which were traditionally considered very difficult to construct even\nwith extensive changes to compiler verification frameworks.\n  We propose a solution to construction of unified semantic interfaces for VCC\nwith a bottom-up approach. Our starting point is CompCertO, an extension of\nCompCert -- the state-of-the-art verified compiler -- that supports VCC but\nlacks a unified interface. We discover that a CompCert Kripke Logical Relation\n(CKLR) in CompCertO provides a uniform notion of memory protection for evolving\nmemory states across modules and is transitively composable. Based on this\nuniform and composable CKLR, we then merge the simulation relations for all the\ncompiler pass in CompCertO (except for three value analysis passes) into a\nunified interface.

Our model is based on observing two major issues\nin existing methods: large depth translation errors and duplicate predictions\nalong depth axes. To mitigate these issues, we propose two key solutions within\nDAT. To address the first issue, we introduce a Depth-Aware Spatial\nCross-Attention (DA-SCA) module that incorporates depth information into\nspatial cross-attention when lifting image features to 3D space. To address the\nsecond issue, we introduce an auxiliary learning task called Depth-aware\nNegative Suppression loss. First, based on their reference points, we organize\nfeatures as a Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature map. Then, we sample positive and\nnegative features along each object ray that connects an object and a camera\nand train the model to distinguish between them. The proposed DA-SCA and DNS\nmethods effectively alleviate these two problems. We show that DAT is a\nversatile method that enhances the performance of all three popular models,\nBEVFormer, DETR3D, and PETR. Our evaluation on BEVFormer demonstrates that DAT\nachieves a significant improvement of +2.8 NDS on nuScenes val under the same\nsettings.

A popular approach to positioning relies\non so-called radio maps that contain pairs of a vector of Wi-Fi signal strength\nindicator values (RSSIs), called a fingerprint, and a location label, called a\nreference point (RP), in which the fingerprint was observed. The positioning\naccuracy depends on the quality of the radio maps and their fingerprints. Radio\nmaps are often sparse, with many pairs containing vectors missing many RSSIs as\nwell as RPs. Aiming to improve positioning accuracy, we present a complete set\nof techniques to impute such missing values in radio maps. We differentiate two\ntypes of missing RSSIs: missing not at random (MNAR) and missing at random\n(MAR). Specifically, we design a framework encompassing a missing RSSI\ndifferentiator followed by a data imputer for missing values. The\ndifferentiator identifies MARs and MNARs via clustering-based fingerprint\nanalysis. Missing RSSIs and RPs are then imputed jointly by means of a novel\nencoder-decoder architecture that leverages temporal dependencies in data\ncollection as well as correlations among fingerprints and RPs. A time-lag\nmechanism is used to consider the aging of data, and a sparsity-friendly\nattention mechanism is used to focus attention score calculation on observed\ndata.

However, the perception of standalone intelligence\ninevitably suffers from occlusions. A new paradigm, Cooperative Perception\n(CP), comes to the rescue by sharing sensor data from another perspective,\ni.e., from a cooperative vehicle (CoV). Due to the limited communication\nbandwidth, it is essential to schedule the most beneficial CoV, considering\nboth the viewpoints and communication quality. Existing methods rely on the\nexchange of meta-information, such as visibility maps, to predict the\nperception gains from nearby vehicles, which induces extra communication and\nprocessing overhead. In this paper, we propose a new approach, learning while\nscheduling, for distributed scheduling of CP. The solution enables CoVs to\npredict the perception gains using past observations, leveraging the temporal\ncontinuity of perception gains. Specifically, we design a mobility-aware sensor\nscheduling (MASS) algorithm based on the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB)\ntheory to maximize the expected average perception gain.

We consider a graph whose edges have two possible states\n(on/off). The edges' states are hidden initially. We could query an edge to\nreveal its state. Given a source s and a destination t, we aim to test s-t\nconnectivity by identifying either a path (consisting of only on edges) or a\ncut (consisting of only off edges). We are limited to B queries, after which we\nstop regardless of whether graph connectivity is established. We aim to design\na query policy that minimizes the expected number of queries.\n  If we remove the query limit B (i.e., by setting B to the total number of\nedges), then our problem becomes a special case of (monotone) Stochastic\nBoolean Function Evaluation (SBFE). There are two existing exact algorithms\nthat are prohibitively expensive. They have best known upper bounds of O(3^m)\nand O(2^{2^k}) respectively, where m is the number of edges and k is the number\nof paths/cuts. These algorithms do not scale well in practice.\n  We propose a significantly more scalable exact algorithm. Our exact algorithm\nworks by iteratively improving the performance lower bound until the lower\nbound becomes achievable. Even when our exact algorithm does not scale, it can\nbe used as an anytime algorithm for calculating lower bound.\n  We experiment on a wide range of practical graphs. We observe that even for\nlarge graphs (i.e., tens of thousands of edges), it mostly takes only a few\nqueries to reach conclusion, which is the practical motivation behind the query\nlimit B.

The control action is derived by inserting a compensator\ndevice in the forward path of the system that is to be controlled.

It uses a nonlinear subspace that is the\nimage of the compensator being used to determine the parameters of the\ncompensator and modify system behavior. The coordinates of the state space\nsystem are taken as the compensator parameters. The method is capable of\ndesigning a compensator of arbitrary order to make the system comply with given\nstability performance requirements provided that these requirements can be\ngeometrically interpreted in the frequency domain. The approach is developed\nand a proof of its ability to converge, if a solution exists, to the\ncompensator tuning parameter set that satisfy the desired performance\nconditions is provided.

However, standard CPS transformations for PPL compilers\nintroduce significant overhead, a problem the community has generally\noverlooked.

Although the poisoned model behaves normally on benign samples, it\nproduces anomalous results on samples containing the trigger pattern.\nNevertheless, most existing backdoor attacks face two significant drawbacks:\ntheir trigger patterns are visible and easy to detect by human inspection, and\ntheir injection process leads to the loss of natural sample features and\ntrigger patterns, thereby reducing the attack success rate and the model\naccuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack named SATBA that\novercomes these limitations by using spatial attention mechanism and U-type\nmodel. Our attack leverages spatial attention mechanism to extract data\nfeatures and generate invisible trigger patterns that are correlated with clean\ndata. Then it uses U-type model to plant these trigger patterns into the\noriginal data without causing noticeable feature loss. We evaluate our attack\non three prominent image classification DNNs across three standard datasets and\ndemonstrate that it achieves high attack success rate and robustness against\nbackdoor defenses. Additionally, we also conduct extensive experiments on image\nsimilarity to highlight the stealthiness of our attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 10:57:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2023 14:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

Methods based on point pair features, which\nwere introduced in 2010 and achieved competitive results even in 2020, are now\nclearly outperformed by deep learning methods. The synthetic-to-real domain gap\nwas again significantly reduced, with 82.7 AR$_C$ achieved by GDRNPP trained\nonly on synthetic images from BlenderProc. The fastest variant of GDRNPP\nreached 80.5 AR$_C$ with an average time per image of 0.23s. Since most of the\nrecent methods for 6D object pose estimation begin by detecting/segmenting\nobjects, we also started evaluating 2D object detection and segmentation\nperformance based on the COCO metrics. Compared to the Mask R-CNN results from\nCosyPose in 2020, detection improved from 60.3 to 77.3 AP$_C$ and segmentation\nfrom 40.5 to 58.7 AP$_C$.

The proposed Overlap Token Embedding (OTE) module generates\nmulti-scale features. A decoder network is proposed, which further processes\nthese features using a multi-scale feature fusion policy to enhance the feature\nrepresentation ability of the network.

Especially, recent studies turn to self-supervised\ncontrastive learning with manually designed similarity metrics for urban\nimagery representation learning and further socioeconomic prediction, which\nhowever suffers from effectiveness and robustness issues. To address such\nissues, in this paper, we propose a Knowledge-infused Contrastive Learning\n(KnowCL) model for urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction. Specifically,\nwe firstly introduce knowledge graph (KG) to effectively model the urban\nknowledge in spatiality, mobility, etc., and then build neural network based\nencoders to learn representations of an urban image in associated semantic and\nvisual spaces, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modality based\ncontrastive learning framework with a novel image-KG contrastive loss, which\nmaximizes the mutual information between semantic and visual representations\nfor knowledge infusion. Extensive experiments of applying the learnt visual\nrepresentations for socioeconomic prediction on three datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of KnowCL with over 30\\% improvements on $R^2$ compared\nwith baselines.

However, the potential of powerful cross-modal\ncontrastive learning methods for fake news detection has not been well\nexploited. Besides, how to aggregate features from different modalities to\nboost the performance of the decision-making process is still an open question.\nTo address that, we propose COOLANT, a cross-modal contrastive learning\nframework for multimodal fake news detection, aiming to achieve more accurate\nimage-text alignment. To further improve the alignment precision, we leverage\nan auxiliary task to soften the loss term of negative samples during the\ncontrast process. A cross-modal fusion module is developed to learn the\ncross-modality correlations. An attention mechanism with an attention guidance\nmodule is implemented to help effectively and interpretably aggregate the\naligned unimodal representations and the cross-modality correlations. Finally,\nwe evaluate the COOLANT and conduct a comparative study on two widely used\ndatasets, Twitter and Weibo. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nCOOLANT outperforms previous approaches by a large margin and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results on the two datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 10:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Three\npattern mining algorithms (l-length Closed Contiguous [LCCspm], Longest Common\nSubsequence [LCS] and AprioriClose) were used to profile elite rugby football\nleague hookers (n = 22 players) and wingers (n = 28 players) match-games\nmovements across 319 matches.

LCCspm and LCS movement\npatterns shared a 0.19 Jaccard similarity score. AprioriClose movement patterns\nshared no significant similarity with LCCspm and LCS patterns. The closed\ncontiguous movement patterns profiled by LCCspm best-separated players into\nplaying positions. Multi-layered Perceptron algorithm achieved the highest\naccuracy of 91.02% and precision, recall and F1 scores of 0.91 respectively.\nTherefore, we recommend the extraction of closed contiguous (consecutive) over\nnon-consecutive movement patterns for separating groups of players.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 12:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

Many works focus on adversarial\ndetection and adversarial training to defend against adversarial attacks.\nHowever, few works explore the tool-chains behind adversarial examples, which\ncan help defenders to seize the clues about the originator of the attack, their\ngoals, and provide insight into the most effective defense algorithm against\ncorresponding attacks. With such a gap, it is necessary to develop techniques\nthat can recognize tool-chains that are leveraged to generate the adversarial\nexamples, which is called Adversarial Attribution Problem (AAP). In this paper,\nAAP is defined as the recognition of three signatures, i.e., {\\em attack\nalgorithm}, {\\em victim model} and {\\em hyperparameter}. Current works transfer\nAAP into single label classification task and ignore the relationship between\nthese signatures. The former will meet combination explosion problem as the\nnumber of signatures is increasing. The latter dictates that we cannot treat\nAAP simply as a single task problem. We first conduct some experiments to\nvalidate the attributability of adversarial examples. Furthermore, we propose a\nmulti-task learning framework named Multi-Task Adversarial Attribution (MTAA)\nto recognize the three signatures simultaneously. MTAA contains perturbation\nextraction module, adversarial-only extraction module and classification and\nregression module. It takes the relationship between attack algorithm and\ncorresponding hyperparameter into account and uses the uncertainty weighted\nloss to adjust the weights of three recognition tasks. The experimental results\non MNIST and ImageNet show the feasibility and scalability of the proposed\nframework as well as its effectiveness in dealing with false alarms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 12:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

To improve the performance for the problem of interest, the\nspecific parameter tuning is required, which in practice can be a\ntime-consuming and tedious task. The present paper deals with the problem of\nautomating the optimization of the numerical method parameters to improve the\nperformance of the mathematical physics simulations and simplify the modeling\nprocess.\n  The paper proposes the hybrid evolution strategy applied to tune the\nparameters of the Krylov subspace and algebraic multigrid iterative methods\nwhen solving a sequence of linear systems with a constant matrix and varying\nright-hand side. The algorithm combines the evolution strategy with the\npre-trained neural network, which filters the individuals in the new\ngeneration. The coupling of two optimization approaches allows to integrate the\nadaptivity properties of the evolution strategy with a priori knowledge\nrealized by the neural network. The use of the neural network as a preliminary\nfilter allows for significant weakening of the prediction accuracy requirements\nand reusing the pre-trained network with a wide range of linear systems.\n  The algorithm efficiency evaluation is performed for a set of model linear\nsystems, including the ones from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection and the\nsystems from the turbulent flow simulations.
