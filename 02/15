Its long acquisition time not only\nincreases the motion and the associated artifacts but also the patient's\ndiscomfort, thus PET acceleration is desirable. However, accelerating PET\nacquisition will result in reconstructed images with low SNR, and the image\nquality will still be degraded by motion-induced artifacts. Most of the\nprevious PET motion correction methods are motion type specific that require\nmotion modeling, thus may fail when multiple types of motion present together.\nAlso, those methods are customized for standard long acquisition and could not\nbe directly applied to accelerated PET. To this end, modeling-free universal\nmotion correction reconstruction for accelerated PET is still highly\nunder-explored. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-aided motion\ncorrection and reconstruction framework for accelerated PET, called\nFast-MC-PET. Our framework consists of a universal motion correction (UMC) and\na short-to-long acquisition reconstruction (SL-Reon) module. The UMC enables\nmodeling-free motion correction by estimating quasi-continuous motion from\nultra-short frame reconstructions and using this information for\nmotion-compensated reconstruction. Then, the SL-Recon converts the accelerated\nUMC image with low counts to a high-quality image with high counts for our\nfinal reconstruction output. Our experimental results on human studies show\nthat our Fast-MC-PET can enable 7-fold acceleration and use only 2 minutes\nacquisition to generate high-quality reconstruction images that\noutperform/match previous motion correction reconstruction methods using\nstandard 15 minutes long acquisition data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 16:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Recent studies have\nshown that the loss functions of these networks do not satisfy the conventional\nsmoothness condition, but instead satisfy a relaxed smoothness condition, i.e.,\nthe Lipschitz constant of the gradient scales linearly in terms of the gradient\nnorm. Due to this observation, several gradient clipping algorithms have been\ndeveloped for nonconvex and relaxed-smooth functions. However, the existing\nalgorithms only apply to the single-machine or multiple-machine setting with\nhomogeneous data across machines. It remains unclear how to design provably\nefficient gradient clipping algorithms in the general Federated Learning (FL)\nsetting with heterogeneous data and limited communication rounds. In this\npaper, we design EPISODE, the very first algorithm to solve FL problems with\nheterogeneous data in the nonconvex and relaxed smoothness setting. The key\ningredients of the algorithm are two new techniques called \\textit{episodic\ngradient clipping} and \\textit{periodic resampled corrections}. At the\nbeginning of each round, EPISODE resamples stochastic gradients from each\nclient and obtains the global averaged gradient, which is used to (1) determine\nwhether to apply gradient clipping for the entire round and (2) construct local\ngradient corrections for each client. Notably, our algorithm and analysis\nprovide a unified framework for both homogeneous and heterogeneous data under\nany noise level of the stochastic gradient, and it achieves state-of-the-art\ncomplexity results. In particular, we prove that EPISODE can achieve linear\nspeedup in the number of machines, and it requires significantly fewer\ncommunication rounds. Experiments on several heterogeneous datasets show the\nsuperior performance of EPISODE over several strong baselines in FL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 16:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

To address this, an automated\nscreening system that captures characteristics of the LUS patterns can be of\nsignificant assistance to clinicians who are not experts in lung ultrasound\n(LUS) images. In this paper, we propose a feature extraction method designed to\nquantify the spatially-localized line patterns and texture patterns found in\nLUS images.

In recent years, several robust aggregation schemes have been\nproposed to defend against malicious updates from Byzantine clients and improve\nthe robustness of federated learning. These solutions were claimed to be\nByzantine-robust, under certain assumptions. Other than that, new attack\nstrategies are emerging, striving to circumvent the defense schemes. However,\nthere is a lack of systematic comparison and empirical study thereof. In this\npaper, we conduct an experimental study of Byzantine-robust aggregation schemes\nunder different attacks using two popular algorithms in federated learning,\nFedSGD and FedAvg . We first survey existing Byzantine attack strategies and\nByzantine-robust aggregation schemes that aim to defend against Byzantine\nattacks. We also propose a new scheme, ClippedClustering , to enhance the\nrobustness of a clustering-based scheme by automatically clipping the updates.\nThen we provide an experimental evaluation of eight aggregation schemes in the\nscenario of five different Byzantine attacks. Our results show that these\naggregation schemes sustain relatively high accuracy in some cases but are\nineffective in others. In particular, our proposed ClippedClustering\nsuccessfully defends against most attacks under independent and IID local\ndatasets. However, when the local datasets are Non-IID, the performance of all\nthe aggregation schemes significantly decreases. With Non-IID data, some of\nthese aggregation schemes fail even in the complete absence of Byzantine\nclients. We conclude that the robustness of all the aggregation schemes is\nlimited, highlighting the need for new defense strategies, in particular for\nNon-IID datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 16:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Use cases span many applications,\nfrom weather forecasting to digital maps, carbon footprint tracking, and\nvegetation monitoring. However, there are also limitations; satellites are\ndifficult to manufacture, expensive to maintain, and tricky to launch into\norbit. Therefore, it is critical that satellites are employed efficiently. This\nposes a challenge known as the satellite mission planning problem, which could\nbe computationally prohibitive to solve on large scales. However,\nclose-to-optimal algorithms can often provide satisfactory resolutions, such as\ngreedy reinforcement learning, and optimization algorithms. This paper\nintroduces a set of quantum algorithms to solve the mission planning problem\nand demonstrate an advantage over the classical algorithms implemented thus\nfar.

Accounting for the observed matter\nanti-matter asymmetry of the Universe requires the existence of new sources of\nCP violation beyond the Standard Model. In models with an extended scalar\nsector CP violation can emerge either explicitly, i.e., at the Lagrangian\nlevel, or spontaneously. In the context of multi-Higgs extensions of the\nStandard Model imposing the existence of a scalar basis where all couplings are\nreal is a sufficient condition for CP to be explicitly conserved. We discuss a\nthree-Higgs-doublet model with an underlying $S_3$ symmetry, allowing in\nprinciple for complex couplings. In this framework it is possible to have\neither spontaneous or explicit CP violation in the scalar sector, depending on\nthe regions of parameter space corresponding to the different possible vacua of\nthe $S_3$ symmetric potential. We list all possible vacuum structures allowing\nfor CP violation in the scalar sector specifying whether it can be explicit or\nspontaneous. It is by now established that CP is violated in the flavour sector\nand that the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix is complex. In order to\nunderstand what are the possible sources of CP violation in the Yukawa sector\nwe analyse the implications of the different available choices of\nrepresentations for the quarks under the $S_3$ group. This classification is\nbased strictly on the exact $S_3$-symmetric scalar potential with no soft\nsymmetry breaking terms. The scalar sector of one such model was explored\nnumerically.

Ensemble learning is partially a\nsolution to the problem of small datasets and overfitting. However, ensemble\nlearning in its basic version is associated with a linear increase in\ncomputational complexity. We analyzed the impact of the ensemble\ndecision-fusion mechanism and checked various methods of sharing the decisions\nincluding voting algorithms. We used the modified knowledge distillation\nframework as a decision-fusion mechanism which allows in addition compressing\nof the entire ensemble model into a weight space of a single model.

Moreover, we show that under certain conditions, when the transport map\nis used in conjunction with ULA, we can improve the geometric rate of\nconvergence of the output process in the 2--Wasserstein distance. Illustrative\nnumerical results complement our theoretical claims.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 18:13:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 02:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

This can lead software engineers to act like\nchess players playing a gambit -- making sacrifices of their technically sound\nestimates, thus submitting their teams to time pressure. In turn, time pressure\ncan have varied detrimental effects, such as poor product quality and emotional\ndistress, decreasing productivity, which leads to more time pressure and\ndelays: a hard-to-stop vicious cycle. This reveals a need for moving on from\nthe more passive strategy of yielding to pressure to a more active one of\ndefending software estimates. Therefore, we propose an approach to support\nsoftware estimators in acquiring knowledge on how to carry out such defense, by\nintroducing negotiation principles encapsulated in a set of defense lenses,\npresented through a digital simulation. We evaluated the proposed approach\nthrough a controlled experiment with software practitioners from different\ncompanies. We collected data on participants' attitudes, subjective norms,\nperceived behavioral control, and intentions to perform the defense of their\nestimates in light of the Theory of Planned Behavior. We employed a frequentist\nand a bayesian approach to data analysis. Results show improved scores among\nexperimental group participants after engaging with the digital simulation and\nlearning about the lenses. They were also more inclined to choose a defense\naction when facing pressure scenarios than a control group exposed to questions\nto reflect on the reasons and outcomes of pressure over estimates. Qualitative\nevidence reveals that practitioners perceived the set of lenses as useful in\ntheir current work environments. Collectively, these results show the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach and its perceived relevance for the\nindustry, despite the low amount of time required to engage with it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 18:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

Current Parker Solar Probe (PSP)\nobservations show that the HCS crossings near the Sun could be full or partial\ncurrent sheet crossing (PCS), and they share some common features but also have\ndifferent properties. In this work, using the PSP observations from encounters\n4 to 10, we identify streamer belt solar wind from enhancements in plasma beta,\nand we further use electron pitch angle distributions to separate it into HPS\nsolar wind that around the full HCS crossings and PCS solar wind that in the\nvicinity of PCS crossings. Based on our analysis, we find that the PCS solar\nwind has different characteristics as compared with HPS solar wind: a) PCS\nsolar wind could be non-pressure-balanced structures rather than magnetic\nholes, and the total pressure enhancement mainly results from the less reduced\nmagnetic pressure; b) some of the PCS solar wind are mirror unstable; c) PCS\nsolar wind is dominated by very low helium abundance but varied alpha-proton\ndifferential speed. We suggest the PCS solar wind could originate from coronal\nloops deep inside the streamer belt, and it is pristine solar wind that still\nactively interacts with ambient solar wind, thus it is valuable for further\ninvestigations on the heating and acceleration of slow solar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 18:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

Most existing approaches that\nintegrate semantic concepts with 3D maps largely remain confined to the\nclosed-set setting: they can only reason about a finite set of concepts,\npre-defined at training time. Further, these maps can only be queried using\nclass labels, or in recent work, using text prompts.\n  We address both these issues with ConceptFusion, a scene representation that\nis (1) fundamentally open-set, enabling reasoning beyond a closed set of\nconcepts and (ii) inherently multimodal, enabling a diverse range of possible\nqueries to the 3D map, from language, to images, to audio, to 3D geometry, all\nworking in concert. ConceptFusion leverages the open-set capabilities of\ntoday's foundation models pre-trained on internet-scale data to reason about\nconcepts across modalities such as natural language, images, and audio. We\ndemonstrate that pixel-aligned open-set features can be fused into 3D maps via\ntraditional SLAM and multi-view fusion approaches.

Hence efficient approaches are required to\nbe developed for recognising faces in selfie images. Due to the short distance\nbetween the camera and face in selfie images, and the different visual effects\noffered by the selfie apps, face recognition becomes more challenging with\nexisting approaches. A dataset is needed to be developed to encourage the study\nto recognize faces in selfie images. In order to alleviate this problem and to\nfacilitate the research on selfie face images, we develop a challenging Wild\nSelfie Dataset (WSD) where the images are captured from the selfie cameras of\ndifferent smart phones, unlike existing datasets where most of the images are\ncaptured in controlled environment. The WSD dataset contains 45,424 images from\n42 individuals (i.e., 24 female and 18 male subjects), which are divided into\n40,862 training and 4,562 test images. The average number of images per subject\nis 1,082 with minimum and maximum number of images for any subject are 518 and\n2,634, respectively. The proposed dataset consists of several challenges,\nincluding but not limited to augmented reality filtering, mirrored images,\nocclusion, illumination, scale, expressions, view-point, aspect ratio, blur,\npartial faces, rotation, and alignment. We compare the proposed dataset with\nexisting benchmark datasets in terms of different characteristics. The\ncomplexity of WSD dataset is also observed experimentally, where the\nperformance of the existing state-of-the-art face recognition methods is poor\non WSD dataset, compared to the existing datasets. Hence, the proposed WSD\ndataset opens up new challenges in the area of face recognition and can be\nbeneficial to the community to study the specific challenges related to selfie\nimages and develop improved methods for face recognition in selfie images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 18:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

However, much like\nother AI-powered tools, AI-powered code completions are not always accurate,\npotentially introducing bugs or even security vulnerabilities into code if not\nproperly detected and corrected by a human programmer. One technique that has\nbeen proposed and implemented to help programmers identify potential errors is\nto highlight uncertain tokens. However, there have been no empirical studies\nexploring the effectiveness of this technique-- nor investigating the different\nand not-yet-agreed-upon notions of uncertainty in the context of generative\nmodels. We explore the question of whether conveying information about\nuncertainty enables programmers to more quickly and accurately produce code\nwhen collaborating with an AI-powered code completion tool, and if so, what\nmeasure of uncertainty best fits programmers' needs. Through a mixed-methods\nstudy with 30 programmers, we compare three conditions: providing the AI\nsystem's code completion alone, highlighting tokens with the lowest likelihood\nof being generated by the underlying generative model, and highlighting tokens\nwith the highest predicted likelihood of being edited by a programmer. We find\nthat highlighting tokens with the highest predicted likelihood of being edited\nleads to faster task completion and more targeted edits, and is subjectively\npreferred by study participants. In contrast, highlighting tokens according to\ntheir probability of being generated does not provide any benefit over the\nbaseline with no highlighting.

We find that\nthe main contribution to the B-field structure of these spiral galaxies comes\nfrom the $m=2$ and $m=0$ modes at FIR wavelengths and the $m=2$ mode at radio\nwavelengths. The $m=2$ mode has a spiral structure and is directly related to\nthe magnetic pitch angle, while $m=0$ has a constant B-field orientation. The\nFIR data tend to have a higher relative contribution from other modes than the\nradio data. The extreme case is NGC 6946: all modes contribute similarly in the\nFIR, while $m=2$ still dominates in the radio. The average magnetic pitch angle\nin the FIR data is smaller and has greater angular dispersion than in the\nradio, indicating that the B-fields in the disk midplane traced by FIR dust\npolarization are more tightly wound and more chaotic than the B-field structure\nin the radio, which probes a larger volume.

In this paper,\nwe investigate the impact that hosting a steadily-accreting WD would have on\nthe properties and evolution of a PN. By pairing the published accreting\nnuclear-burning WD models with radiation transfer simulations, we extract the\ntime evolution of the emission line spectra and ionization properties of a PN\nthat surrounds a 0.6$\\rm M_{\\odot}$ steadily nuclear-burning WD as a function\nof the mass accretion rate.

Their properties remain almost invariant with\ntime and their visibility time can be much longer compared to PNe powered by\nsingle WDs.

The interaction of added neutron(s) and the\nprotons forming the $Z=82$ proton core is responsible for a major contribution\nto the buildup of differential charge radii. It depends on the overlaps of\nproton and neutron wave functions and leads to a redistribution of\nsingle-particle density of occupied proton states which in turn modifies the\ncharge radii. Self-consistency effects affecting the shape of proton potential,\ntotal proton densities and the energies of the single-particle proton states\nprovide only secondary contribution to differential charge radii. The buildup\nof differential charge radii is a combination of single-particle and collective\nphenomena. The former is due to proton-neutron interaction, the impact of which\nis state dependent, and the latter reflects the fact that all occupied proton\nsingle-particle states contribute to this process. The neglect of either one of\nthese aspects of the process by ignoring proton-neutron interaction and\nself-consistency effects as it is done in macroscopic+microscopic approach or\nby introducing the core as in spherical shell model introduces uncontrollable\nerrors and restricts the applicability of such approaches to the description of\ndifferential charge radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 19:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

This study used simulations to determine optimal\nsequence parameters for ihMT imaging for use in high-resolution cortical\nmapping. Methods: MT-weighted cortical image intensity and ihMT SNR were\nsimulated using modified Bloch equations for a range of sequence parameters.\nThe acquisition time was limited to 4.5 min/volume. A custom MT-weighted RAGE\nsequence with center-out k-space encoding was used to enhance SNR at 3 Tesla.\nPulsed MT imaging was studied over a range of saturation parameters and the\nimpact of the turbo-factor on effective ihMT was investigated. 1 mm isotropic\nihMTsat maps were generated in 25 healthy adults using an optimized protocol.\nResults: Greater SNR was observed for larger number of bursts consisting of 6-8\nsaturation pulses each, combined with a high readout turbo-factor.

The goal of this work is to propose a\nnew technique for plasma dynamic studies based on LIF spectroscopy with\nphase-resolution within the breathing period. To this purpose the Hilbert\ntransform is used to define the instantaneous phase of oscillation of the\nthruster current. Ion velocity distribution modification, over assigned phases\nof oscillation, is measured simultaneously and in real-time thanks to fully\nnumerical analysis of the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 19:51:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 18:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Our results indicate that molecular adsorption tends to\nfavour a perpendicular MCA at surfaces. A detailed analysis of various\natom-resolved quantities, accompanied by an elementary model, demonstrates that\nthe underlying physical mechanism is related to the metal-molecule interfacial\nhybridization and, in particular, to the chemical bonding between the molecular\nC $p_z$ and the out-of-plane Co $d_{z^2}$ orbitals.

Although analytical wake models are widely used for these\napplications, several model components must be better understood to improve\ntheir accuracy. To this end, we propose a Bayesian uncertainty quantification\nframework for physics-guided data-driven model enhancement. The framework\nincorporates turbulence-related aleatoric uncertainty in historical wind farm\ndata, epistemic uncertainty in the empirical parameters, and systematic\nuncertainty due to unmodelled physics. We apply the framework to the wake\nexpansion parameterization in the Gaussian wake model and employ historical\npower data of the Westermost Rough offshore wind farm. We find that the\nframework successfully distinguishes the three sources of uncertainty in the\njoint posterior distribution of the parameters. On the one hand, the framework\nallows for wake model calibration by selecting the maximum a posteriori\nestimators for the empirical parameters. On the other hand, it facilitates\nmodel validation by separating the measurement error and the model error\ndistribution. In addition, the model adequacy and the effect of unmodelled\nphysics are assessable via the posterior parameter uncertainty and\ncorrelations. Consequently, we believe that the Bayesian uncertainty\nquantification framework can be used to calibrate and validate existing and\nupcoming physics-guided models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 20:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

ScatterShot iteratively slices unlabeled data into task-specific\npatterns, samples informative inputs from underexplored or not-yet-saturated\nslices in an active learning manner, and helps users label more efficiently\nwith the help of an LLM and the current example set. In simulation studies on\ntwo text perturbation scenarios, ScatterShot sampling improves the resulting\nfew-shot functions by 4-5 percentage points over random sampling, with less\nvariance as more examples are added. In a user study, ScatterShot greatly helps\nusers in covering different patterns in the input space and labeling in-context\nexamples more efficiently, resulting in better in-context learning and less\nuser effort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 21:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

As a\nresult, many automated threat mitigation solutions have been proposed to\ncounter the security issues of smart contracts. These threat mitigation\nsolutions include various tools and methods that are challenging to compare.\nThis survey develops a comprehensive classification taxonomy of smart contract\nthreat mitigation solutions within five orthogonal dimensions: defense\nmodality, core method, targeted contracts, input-output data mapping, and\nthreat model. We classify 133 existing threat mitigation solutions using our\ntaxonomy and confirm that the proposed five dimensions allow us to concisely\nand accurately describe any smart contract threat mitigation solution. In\naddition to learning what the threat mitigation solutions do, we also show how\nthese solutions work by synthesizing their actual designs into a set of uniform\nworkflows corresponding to the eight existing defense core methods.

RDF, which can be constructed using supervised\nlearning in a tractable fashion, accurately predicts the distance between the\nswept volume of a robot arm and an obstacle.

Thus far, however, these machine-learning studies have focused\nalmost exclusively on simple liquids composed of passive particles.

Notably, both become\nineffective when the activity is low, suggesting a fundamentally different\nstructural signature for dynamic propensity and non-equilibrium activity.\nUltimately, these efforts might also find relevance in the context of\nbiological active glasses such as confluent cell layers, where subtle changes\nin the microstructure can hint at pathological changes in cell dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 21:34:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 16:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

These theoretical predictions are\nbenchmarked against 2.5D MHD simulations. Applying the theoretical scalings to\nprominence threads or fading spicules, we found that as a mixing layer grows on\ntheir boundaries this would lead to the creation of transition region material\nwith a cooling time of ~100 s, explaining the warm emission observed as\nprominence threads or spicules fade in cool spectral lines without the\nrequirement for any heating. For quiescent prominences, dynamic condensation\ndriven by the mixing process could restore ~18 per cent of the mass lost from a\nprominence through downflows. Overall, this mechanism of thermal energy loss\nthrough radiative losses induced by mixing highlights the importance for\nconsidering dynamical interaction between material at different temperatures\nwhen trying to understand the thermodynamic evolution of the cool material in\nthe solar corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 21:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

In the setting of classical convex sets, extreme points are central\nobjects which exhibit many important properties. For example, the Minkowski\ntheorem shows that any element of a closed bounded convex set can be expressed\nas a convex combination of extreme points. Extreme points are also of great\ninterest in the dimension free setting of matrix convex sets; however, here the\nsituation requires more nuance.\n  In the dimension free setting, there are many different types of extreme\npoints. Of particular importance are free extreme points, a highly restricted\ntype of extreme point that is closely connected to the dilation theoretic\nArveson boundary. If free extreme points span a matrix convex set through\nmatrix convex combinations, then they satisfy a strong notion of minimality in\ndoing so. However, not all closed bounded matrix convex sets even have free\nextreme points. Thus, a major goal is to determine which matrix convex sets are\nspanned by their free extreme points.\n  Building on a recent work of J. W.

But it can\nalso be problematic since it can induce inconsistencies in, e.g., Hessian-based\nflatness measures, optimization trajectories, and modes of probability\ndensities. This complicates downstream analyses: e.g. one cannot definitively\nrelate flatness with generalization since arbitrary reparametrization changes\ntheir relationship. In this work, we study the invariance of neural nets under\nreparametrization from the perspective of Riemannian geometry. From this point\nof view, invariance is an inherent property of any neural net if one explicitly\nrepresents the metric and uses the correct associated transformation rules.\nThis is important since although the metric is always present, it is often\nimplicitly assumed as identity, and thus dropped from the notation, then lost\nunder reparametrization. We discuss implications for measuring the flatness of\nminima, optimization, and for probability-density maximization.

They consist of a forward process that perturbs input data with\nGaussian white noise and a reverse process that learns a score function to\ngenerate samples by denoising. Despite their tremendous success, they are\nmostly formulated on finite-dimensional spaces, e.g. Euclidean, limiting their\napplications to many domains where the data has a functional form such as in\nscientific computing and 3D geometric data analysis. In this work, we introduce\na mathematically rigorous framework called Denoising Diffusion Operators (DDOs)\nfor training diffusion models in function space. In DDOs, the forward process\nperturbs input functions gradually using a Gaussian process. The generative\nprocess is formulated by integrating a function-valued Langevin dynamic.

Often, Decision Trees\nmodels are constructed greedily in a top-down fashion via heuristic search\ncriteria, such as Gini impurity or entropy. However, trees constructed in this\nmanner are sensitive to minor fluctuations in training data and are prone to\noverfitting. In contrast, Bayesian approaches to tree construction formulate\nthe selection process as a posterior inference problem; such approaches are\nmore stable and provide greater theoretical guarantees. However, generating\nBayesian Decision Trees usually requires sampling from complex, multimodal\nposterior distributions. Current Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based approaches for\nsampling Bayesian Decision Trees are prone to mode collapse and long mixing\ntimes, which makes them impractical. In this paper, we propose a new criterion\nfor training Bayesian Decision Trees. Our criterion gives rise to BCART-PCFG,\nwhich can efficiently sample decision trees from a posterior distribution\nacross trees given the data and find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) tree.\nLearning the posterior and training the sampler can be done in time that is\npolynomial in the dataset size. Once the posterior has been learned, trees can\nbe sampled efficiently (linearly in the number of nodes). At the core of our\nmethod is a reduction of sampling the posterior to sampling a derivation from a\nprobabilistic context-free grammar. We find that trees sampled via BCART-PCFG\nperform comparable to or better than greedily-constructed Decision Trees in\nclassification accuracy on several datasets.

Such operations, however, are time-consuming, cannot meet the\nreal-time requirements of video encryption. Existing works, therefore, realize\nvideo encryption by simplifying the encryption process or encrypting specific\nparts of video frames, which results in lower security compared to image\nencryption. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a real-time chaotic video\nencryption strategy based on multithreaded parallel confusion and diffusion. It\ntakes a video as the input, splits the frame into subframes, creates a set of\nthreads to simultaneously perform five rounds of confusion and diffusion\noperations on corresponding subframes, and efficiently outputs the encrypted\nframes. The encryption speed evaluation shows that our method significantly\nimproves the confusion and diffusion speed, realizes real-time 480x480,\n576x576, and 768x768 24FPS video encryption using Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel\nCore i7-8700, and Intel Xeon Gold 6226R, respectively.

To shed light on\nthe hidden layers of DNN, we study supervised learning by a DNN of width $N$\nand depth $L$ consisting of perceptrons with $c$ inputs by a statistical\nmechanics approach called the teacher-student setting. We consider an ensemble\nof student machines that exactly reproduce $M$ sets of $N$ dimensional\ninput/output relations provided by a teacher machine. We analyze the ensemble\ntheoretically using a replica method (H. Yoshino (2020)) and numerically\nperforming greedy Monte Carlo simulations.

Both the theory and the simulation\nsuggest learning by the DNN is quite heterogeneous in the network space:\nconfigurations of the machines are more correlated within the layers closer to\nthe input/output boundaries while the central region remains much less\ncorrelated due to over-parametrization.

With the continuous-time formulation, we can query\nposes at any time instants corresponding to the sensor measurements. To bound\nthe computation complexity of the continuous-time fixed-lag smoother, we\nmaintain temporal and keyframe sliding windows with constant size, and\nprobabilistically marginalize out control points of the trajectory and other\nstates, which allows preserving prior information for future sliding-window\noptimization.

We also show that our Fukaya category is not\nquasi-equivalent to the limit of the Fukaya category of surfaces of finite type\nappearing in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 06:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

Unlike the static graph, a temporal graph is usually\norganized in the form of node interaction sequences over continuous time\ninstead of an adjacency matrix. Most temporal graph learning methods model\ncurrent interactions by combining historical information over time. However,\nsuch methods merely consider the first-order temporal information while\nignoring the important high-order structural information, leading to\nsub-optimal performance. To solve this issue, by extracting both temporal and\nstructural information to learn more informative node representations, we\npropose a self-supervised method termed S2T for temporal graph learning. Note\nthat the first-order temporal information and the high-order structural\ninformation are combined in different ways by the initial node representations\nto calculate two conditional intensities, respectively. Then the alignment loss\nis introduced to optimize the node representations to be more informative by\nnarrowing the gap between the two intensities. Concretely, besides modeling\ntemporal information using historical neighbor sequences, we further consider\nthe structural information from both local and global levels. At the local\nlevel, we generate structural intensity by aggregating features from the\nhigh-order neighbor sequences. At the global level, a global representation is\ngenerated based on all nodes to adjust the structural intensity according to\nthe active statuses on different nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed method S2T achieves at most 10.13% performance improvement\ncompared with the state-of-the-art competitors on several datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 06:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

The\navailability of space-based data allows the full set of physical parameters to\nbe calculated. However, there exists an eightfold degeneracy in the parallax\nmeasurement. The four best solutions correspond to very-low-mass binaries near\n($M_1 = 170^{+40}_{-50} M_J$ and $M_2 = 110^{+20}_{-30} M_J$), or well below\n($M_1 = 22.5^{+0.7}_{-0.4} M_J$ and $M_2 = 13.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3} M_J$) the\nboundary between stars and brown dwarfs.

When the target reflectivity is small so that it is hard\nto distinguish target presence or absence, the exponential decay constant falls\ninto a class of objects called monotone metrics. We evaluate monotone metrics\nrestricted to Gaussian states in terms of first-order moments and covariance\nmatrix. Under the assumption of a low reflectivity target, we explicitly derive\nanalytic formulae for decay constant of an arbitrary Gaussian input state.\nEspecially, in the limit of large background noise and low reflectivity, there\nis no need of symplectic diagonalization which usually complicates the\ncomputation of decay constants. First, we show that two-mode squeezed vacuum\n(TMSV) states are the optimal probe among pure Gaussian states with fixed\nsignal mean photon number. Second, as an alternative to preparing TMSV states\nwith high mean photon number, we show that preparing a TMSV state with low mean\nphoton number and displacing the signal mode is a more experimentally feasible\nsetup without degrading the performance that much.

Experiments on the benchmark 300-hour\nSwitchboard and the 233-hour AMI datasets suggest that the proposed confidence\nscore-based adaptation schemes consistently outperformed the baseline\nspeaker-independent (SI) Conformer model and conventional non-Bayesian, point\nestimate-based adaptation using no speaker data selection. Similar consistent\nperformance improvements were retained after external Transformer and LSTM\nlanguage model rescoring. In particular, on the 300-hour Switchboard corpus,\nstatistically significant WER reductions of 1.0%, 1.3%, and 1.4% absolute\n(9.5%, 10.9%, and 11.3% relative) were obtained over the baseline SI Conformer\non the NIST Hub5'00, RT02, and RT03 evaluation sets respectively. Similar WER\nreductions of 2.7% and 3.3% absolute (8.9% and 10.2% relative) were also\nobtained on the AMI development and evaluation sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

The\npredicted zero phonon line shows that the Bi complex emits in the\ntelecommunication range, and the computed many-body energy levels suggest a\nviable optical cycle required for qubit initialization. Notably, the high-spin\nnucleus of each dopant strongly couples to the electron spin, leading to many\ncontrollable quantum levels and the emergence of atomic clock-like transitions\nthat are well protected from environmental noise. Specifically, the Hanh-echo\ncoherence time increases beyond seconds at the clock-like transition in the\ndefect with $^{209}$Bi.

Specifically, attribute-incomplete\nindicates that a part of the attribute vectors of all nodes are incomplete,\nwhile attribute-missing indicates that the whole attribute vectors of partial\nnodes are missing. Although many efforts have been devoted, none of them is\ncustom-designed for a common situation where both types of graph data absence\nexist simultaneously. To fill this gap, we develop a novel network termed\nRevisiting Initializing Then Refining (RITR), where we complete both\nattribute-incomplete and attribute-missing samples under the guidance of a\nnovel initializing-then-refining imputation criterion. Specifically, to\ncomplete attribute-incomplete samples, we first initialize the incomplete\nattributes using Gaussian noise before network learning, and then introduce a\nstructure-attribute consistency constraint to refine incomplete values by\napproximating a structure-attribute correlation matrix to a high-order\nstructural matrix. To complete attribute-missing samples, we first adopt\nstructure embeddings of attribute-missing samples as the embedding\ninitialization, and then refine these initial values by adaptively aggregating\nthe reliable information of attribute-incomplete samples according to a dynamic\naffinity structure. To the best of our knowledge, this newly designed method is\nthe first unsupervised framework dedicated to handling hybrid-absent graphs.\nExtensive experiments on four datasets have verified that our methods\nconsistently outperform existing state-of-the-art competitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

Although Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) theory has in principle already\nincluded the Lorentz transformation of gravitational wave, the transformation\nof the three dimensional gravitational wave tensor has not been explicitly\ncalculated before. Within four dimensional spacetime, gravitational wave have\nproperty of `boost weight zero' and `spin weight 2'. This fact makes the\nLorentz transformation of gravitational wave difficult to understand. In the\ncurrent paper we adopt the traditional three dimensional tensor description of\ngravitational wave. Such a transverse-traceless tensor describes the\ngravitational wave freedom directly. We derive the explicit Lorentz\ntransformation of the gravitational wave tensor. The transformation is similar\nto the Lorentz transformation for electric field vector and magnetic field\nvector which are three dimensional vectors. Based on the deduced Lorentz\ntransformation of the gravitational wave three dimensional tensor, we can\nconstruct the gravitational waveform of moving source with any speed if only\nthe waveform of the corresponding rest waveform is given. As an example, we\napply our method to the effect of kick velocity of binary black hole. The\nadjusted waveform by the kick velocity is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

However, the vanilla\nversion of bootstrap is no longer feasible computationally for many modern\nmassive datasets due to the need to repeatedly resample the entire data.\nTherefore, several improvements to the bootstrap method have been made in\nrecent years, which assess the quality of estimators by subsampling the full\ndataset before resampling the subsamples. Naturally, the performance of these\nmodern subsampling methods is influenced by tuning parameters such as the size\nof subsamples, the number of subsamples, and the number of resamples per\nsubsample. In this paper, we develop a novel hyperparameter selection\nmethodology for selecting these tuning parameters. Formulated as an\noptimization problem to find the optimal value of some measure of accuracy of\nan estimator subject to computational cost, our framework provides closed-form\nsolutions for the optimal hyperparameter values for subsampled bootstrap,\nsubsampled double bootstrap and bag of little bootstraps, at no or little extra\ntime cost.

In this\npaper, we first introduce ACNet, a large-scale dataset for AC prediction. ACNet\ncurates over 400K Matched Molecular Pairs (MMPs) against 190 targets, including\nover 20K MMP-cliffs and 380K non-AC MMPs, and provides five subsets for model\ndevelopment and evaluation.

Our new mechanism\nresults from the instability of the many-body ground state for exciton\ncondensation, caused by the strong competition between the polarization and\ncondensation energies in the presence of an electric field. We refer to this\nmechanism as ``many-body breakdown''. To investigate this new mechanism, we\npropose a BCS-type trial wave function under finite electric fields and use it\nto study the many-body breakdown numerically. Our results reveal two different\ntypes of electric breakdown behavior. If the system size is larger than a\ncritical value, the Zener tunneling process is first turned on when an\nelectrical field is applied, but the excitonic gap remains until the field\nstrength reaches the critical value of the many-body breakdown, after which the\nexcitonic gap disappears and the system becomes a highly conductive metallic\nstate. However, if the system size is much smaller than the critical value, the\nintermediate tunneling phase disappears since the many-body breakdown happens\nbefore the onset of Zener tunneling.

In the microwave region this corresponds to energies in the yJ range.\nThis extreme sensitivity has to be combined with an extremely low dark count\nrate, since the probability of axions conversion into microwave photons is\nsupposed to be very low. To face this complicated task, we followed two\npromising approaches that both rely on the use of superconducting devices based\non the Josephson effect. The first one is to use a single Josephson junction\n(JJ) as a switching detector (i.e. exploiting the superconducting to normal\nstate transition in presence of microwave photons). We designed a device\ncomposed of a coplanar waveguide terminated on a current biased Josephson\njunction. We tested its efficiency to pulsed (pulse duration 10 ns) microwave\nsignals, since this configuration is closer to an actual axions search\nexperiment. We show how our device is able to reach detection capability of the\norder of 10 photons with frequency 8 GHz. The second approach is based on an\nintrinsically quantum device formed by two resonators coupled only via a\nsuperconducting qubit network (SQN).

Manual annotations can solve this issue, but they\nare time consuming, expert-dependent, and cannot run on large datasets. Another\nsolution consists in using a labelling function that automatically segments\naudio recordings before assigning a label to each segmented audio sample.\nAlthough labelling functions were introduced to expedite strong label\nassignment, their classification performance remains mostly unknown. To address\nthis issue and reduce label noise (wrong label assignment) in large bird song\ndatasets, we introduce a data-centric novel labelling function composed of\nthree successive steps: 1) time-frequency sound unit segmentation, 2) feature\ncomputation for each sound unit, and 3) classification of each sound unit as\nbird song or noise with either an unsupervised DBSCAN algorithm or the\nsupervised BirdNET neural network.

A possible way to achieve this is coded multipath\ncommunication: redundancy is added to a block of information through a robust\npacket-level code, transmitting across multiple independent channels to reduce\nthe impact of blockages or rate fluctuation. The number of these links can grow\nsignificantly over traditional two-path schemes: in these scenarios, the\noptimization of the timing metrics is non-trivial, and latency and AoI might\nrequire different settings. In particular, packet preemption is often the\noptimal solution to optimize AoI in uncoded communication, but can\nsignificantly reduce the reliability of individual blocks. In this work, we\nmodel the multipath communication as a fork-join D/M/(K,N)/L queue, where K\nblocks of information are encoded into N>K redundant blocks. We derive the\nlatency and Peak AoI (PAoI) distributions for different values of the queue\nsize L.

We show that the observed pulse profile shape\ncan be described in terms of a combination of two symmetric single-pole\ncontributions for wide range of energies and luminosities for a fixed geometry\ndefining basic geometry of the pulsar. This corresponds to a slightly distorted\ndipole magnetic field, i.e., one pole has to be offset by $\\sim 12^{\\circ}$\nfrom the antipodal position of the other pole. We reconstruct the intrinsic\nbeam patterns of the pulsar assuming the geometry recovered from the\ndecomposition analysis, and find evidence for a transition between \"pencil\" and\n\"fan\" beams in energy ranges above the cyclotron line energy which can be\ninterpreted as transition from sub- to super-critical accretion regimes\nassociated with onset of an accretion column. At lower energies the beam\npattern appears, however, to be more complex, and contains substantial \"fan\"\nbeam and an additional \"pencil\" beam component at all luminosities. The latter\nis not related to the accretion rate and is stronger in the fading phase of the\noutburst. We finally discuss results in context of other observational and\ntheoretical findings earlier reported for the source in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 10:18:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 10:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-29"}

However, one-stage\nanchor-based detectors lack the structure to generate high-quality or flexible\npseudo labels, leading to serious inconsistency problems in SSOD. In this\npaper, we propose the Efficient Teacher framework for scalable and effective\none-stage anchor-based SSOD training, consisting of Dense Detector, Pseudo\nLabel Assigner, and Epoch Adaptor. Dense Detector is a baseline model that\nextends RetinaNet with dense sampling techniques inspired by YOLOv5. The\nEfficient Teacher framework introduces a novel pseudo label assignment\nmechanism, named Pseudo Label Assigner, which makes more refined use of pseudo\nlabels from Dense Detector. Epoch Adaptor is a method that enables a stable and\nefficient end-to-end semi-supervised training schedule for Dense Detector. The\nPseudo Label Assigner prevents the occurrence of bias caused by a large number\nof low-quality pseudo labels that may interfere with the Dense Detector during\nthe student-teacher mutual learning mechanism, and the Epoch Adaptor utilizes\ndomain and distribution adaptation to allow Dense Detector to learn globally\ndistributed consistent features, making the training independent of the\nproportion of labeled data.

These\nrange from computer vision tasks such as age estimation from photographs, to\nmedical tasks such as ejection fraction estimation from echocardiograms for\ndisease tracking. Semi-supervised approaches for deep regression are notably\nunder-explored compared to classification and segmentation tasks, however.\nUnlike classification tasks, which rely on thresholding functions for\ngenerating class pseudo-labels, regression tasks use real number target\npredictions directly as pseudo-labels, making them more sensitive to prediction\nquality. In this work, we propose a novel approach to semi-supervised\nregression, namely Uncertainty-Consistent Variational Model Ensembling (UCVME),\nwhich improves training by generating high-quality pseudo-labels and\nuncertainty estimates for heteroscedastic regression. Given that aleatoric\nuncertainty is only dependent on input data by definition and should be equal\nfor the same inputs, we present a novel uncertainty consistency loss for\nco-trained models. Our consistency loss significantly improves uncertainty\nestimates and allows higher quality pseudo-labels to be assigned greater\nimportance under heteroscedastic regression.

In contemporary\nlinguistics, there are two major schools of thought that give completely\nopposite answers. According to Chomsky's theory of universal grammar, language\ncannot be learned because children are not exposed to sufficient data in their\nlinguistic environment. In contrast, usage-based models of language assume a\nprofound relationship between language structure and language use. In\nparticular, contextual mental processing and mental representations are assumed\nto have the cognitive capacity to capture the complexity of actual language use\nat all levels. The prime example is syntax, i.e., the rules by which words are\nassembled into larger units such as sentences. Typically, syntactic rules are\nexpressed as sequences of word classes. However, it remains unclear whether\nword classes are innate, as implied by universal grammar, or whether they\nemerge during language acquisition, as suggested by usage-based approaches.\nHere, we address this issue from a machine learning and natural language\nprocessing perspective. In particular, we trained an artificial deep neural\nnetwork on predicting the next word, provided sequences of consecutive words as\ninput. Subsequently, we analyzed the emerging activation patterns in the hidden\nlayers of the neural network. Strikingly, we find that the internal\nrepresentations of nine-word input sequences cluster according to the word\nclass of the tenth word to be predicted as output, even though the neural\nnetwork did not receive any explicit information about syntactic rules or word\nclasses during training. This surprising result suggests, that also in the\nhuman brain, abstract representational categories such as word classes may\nnaturally emerge as a consequence of predictive coding and processing during\nlanguage acquisition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 11:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

This is the case of\nstarling flocks, that can turn very quickly to evade predators. In this paper,\nwe investigate the conditions under which a global change of direction can\noccur upon local perturbations. Using minimal models of self-propelled\nparticles, we show that a collective directional response occurs on timescales\nthat grow with the system size and it is, therefore, a finite-size effect. The\nlarger the group is, the longer it will take to turn. We also show that global\ncoherent turns can only take place if i) the mechanism for information\npropagation is efficient enough to transmit the local reaction undamped through\nthe whole group; and if ii) motility is not too strong, to avoid that the\nperturbed individual leaves the group before the turn is complete.

The challenge resides in the fact\nthat both noise and intra-regional correlation lead to inconsistent\ninter-regional correlation estimation using classical approaches. While some\nexisting methods handle either one of these issues, no non-parametric\napproaches tackle both simultaneously. To address this problem, we propose a\ntrade-off between two procedures: correlating regional averages, which is not\nrobust to intra-regional correlation; and averaging pairwise inter-regional\ncorrelations, which is not robust to noise. To that end, we project the data\nonto a space where Euclidean distance is used as a proxy for sample\ncorrelation.

In this work, we propose\nUncertainty-Estimation with Normalized Logits (UE-NL), a robust learning method\nfor OOD detection, which has three main benefits.

The purpose of this work is to present a pulse\nparameter optimizer application to match intended dose and dose rate precisely\nand efficiently.\n  Methods: Dose and dose rate calculation have been described for a commercial\nelectron FLASH platform.

Our starting point is the celebrated hidden-action\nmodel and the classic notion of a contract, where the principal commits to an\noutcome-contingent payment scheme for incentivizing an agent to take a costly\naction. An ambiguous contract generalizes this notion by allowing the principal\nto commit to a set of two or more contracts, without specifying which of these\nwill be employed. A natural behavioral assumption in such cases is that the\nagent engages in a max-min strategy, maximizing her expected utility in the\nworst case over the set of possible contracts. We show that the principal can\nin general gain utility by employing an ambiguous contract, at the expense of\nthe agent's utility. We provide structural properties of the optimal ambiguous\ncontract, showing that an optimal ambiguous contract is composed of simple\ncontracts. We then use these properties to devise poly-time algorithms for\ncomputing the optimal ambiguous contract. We also provide a characterization of\nnon-manipulable classes of contracts - those where a principal cannot gain by\nemploying an ambiguous contract. We show that linear contracts - unlike other\ncommon contracts - are non-manipulable, which might help explain their\npopularity. Finally, we provide bounds on the ambiguity gap - the gap between\nthe utility the principal can achieve by employing ambiguous contracts and the\nutility the principal can achieve with a single contract.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 12:23:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 07:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

In the\nmodeling of EDLs, a prominent knowledge gap has been the exclusion of van der\nWaals (vdW) and soft repulsive interactions in modified Poisson-Boltzmann (PB)\ntheories. Although more short-ranged as compared to electrostatic interactions,\nwe show here that vdW interactions can play an important role in determining\nthe structure of the EDL via the formation of a Stern layer and in modulating\nthe differential capacitance of an electrode in solution. To this end, we\nincorporate ion-ion and wall-ion vdW attraction and soft repulsion via a 12-6\nLennard-Jones (LJ) potential, resulting in a modified PB-LJ approach. The\nwall-ion LJ interactions were found to have a significant effect on the\nelectrical potential and concentration profiles, especially close to the wall.\nHowever, ion-ion LJ interactions do not affect the EDL structure at low bulk\nion concentrations (< 1 M). We also derive dimensionless numbers to quantify\nthe impact of ion-ion and wall-ion LJ interactions on the EDL. Furthermore, in\nthe pursuit of capturing ion-specific effects, we apply our model by\nconsidering various combinations of ions. We observe how varying parameters\nsuch as the electrolyte concentration and electrode potential affect the\nstructure of the EDL due to the competition between ion-specific LJ and\nelectrostatic interactions. Lastly, we show that the inclusion of vdW and soft\nrepulsion interactions as well as hydration effects lead to a better\nqualitative agreement of the PB models with experimental double-layer\ndifferential capacitance data. Overall, the modified PB-LJ approach presented\nherein will lead to more accurate theoretical descriptions of EDLs in various\napplication areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 12:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

Through five examples of predictive simulations solved using five\ntranscription methods and 100 initial guesses in the Bioptim software, we\nshowed that not a single method outperformed systematically better. All methods\nconverged to almost the same solution (cost, states, and controls) in all but\none OCP, with several local minima being found in the latter. Nevertheless, DC\nbased on fourth-order Legendre polynomials provided overall better results,\nespecially in terms of dynamic consistency compared to DMS based on a\nfourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Furthermore, expressing the rigid-body\nconstraints using inverse dynamics was usually faster than forward dynamics. DC\nwith dynamics constraints based on inverse dynamics converged to better and\nless variable solutions. Consequently, we recommend starting with this\ntranscription to solve OCPs but keep testing other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 13:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 14:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

In practice, however, there is no clear separation\nof scheduling responsibilities between an SWMS and a resource manager because\nthere exists no agreed-upon separation of concerns between their different\ncomponents. This has two consequences. First, the lack of a standardized API to\nexchange scheduling information between SWMSs and resource managers hinders\nportability. It incurs costly adaptations when a component should be replaced\nby a different one (e.g., an SWMS with another SWMS on the same resource\nmanager). Second, due to overlapping functionalities, current installations\noften actually have two schedulers, both making partial scheduling decisions\nunder incomplete information, leading to suboptimal workflow scheduling.\n  In this paper, we propose a simple REST interface between SWMSs and resource\nmanagers, which allows any SWMS to pass dynamic workflow information to a\nresource manager, enabling maximally informed scheduling decisions. We provide\nan implementation of this API as an example, using Nextflow as an SWMS and\nKubernetes as a resource manager. Our experiments with nine real-world\nworkflows show that this strategy reduces makespan by up to 25.1% and 10.8% on\naverage compared to the standard Nextflow/Kubernetes configuration.\nFurthermore, a more widespread implementation of this API would enable leaner\ncode bases, a simpler exchange of components of workflow systems, and a unified\nplace to implement new scheduling algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 13:35:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 12:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-16"}

We propose to extend the classical OTP from an n-bit finite\nfield to the entire symmetric group over the finite field. Within this context\nthe symmetric group can be represented by a discrete Hilbert sphere (DHS) over\nan n-bit computational basis. Unlike the continuous Hilbert space defined over\na complex field in quantum computing, a DHS is defined over the finite field\nGF(2). Within this DHS, the entire symmetric group can be completely described\nby the complete set of n-bit binary permutation matrices. Encoding of a\nplaintext can be done by randomly selecting a permutation matrix from the\nsymmetric group to multiply with the computational basis vector associated with\nthe state corresponding to the data to be encoded. Then, the resulting vector\nis converted to an output state as the ciphertext. The decoding is the same\nprocedure but with the transpose of the pre-shared permutation matrix. We\ndemonstrate that under this extension, the 1-to-1 mapping in the classical OTP\nis equally likely decoupled in Discrete Hilbert Space. The uncertainty\nrelationship between permutation matrices protects the selected pad, consisting\nof M permutation matrices (also called Quantum permutation pad, or QPP).

Furthermore, we propose a\none-epoch learning policy that can be used to efficiently avoid overfitting\nwhen computing the loss function is expensive compared to generating data.\nFinally, we show how our multimap approach can be combined with enhanced\nsampling strategies to overcome the pervasive problem of poor convergence due\nto slow degrees of freedom. We test our method on the HiPen dataset of\ndrug-like molecules and fragments, and we show that it can accelerate the\ncalculation of the free energy difference of switching from a force field to a\nDFTB3 potential by about 3 orders of magnitude compared to standard FEP and by\na factor of about 8 compared to previously published nonequilibrium\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 14:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

Furthermore, we design a novel contrastive objective\nin which the usual pairs are supplemented with additional sample-dependent\npositives and negatives sampled from the evolving feature space. In our model,\nwe apply such losses among video clips and between videos and their temporally\ncorresponding audio clips. We verify our model design in extensive ablation\nexperiments and evaluate the video and audio representations in transfer\nexperiments to action recognition and retrieval on UCF101 and HMBD51, audio\nclassification on ESC50, and robust video fingerprinting on VGG-Sound, with\nstate-of-the-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 15:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

This search is\nsensitive to all-sky neutrinos of all flavours and of energies $>100$ GeV,\nthanks to the inclusion of both track-like events (mainly induced by $\\nu_\\mu$\ncharged-current interactions) and shower-like events (induced by other\ninteraction types). Neutrinos are selected if they are detected within $\\pm\n500$ s from the GW merger and with a reconstructed direction compatible with\nits sky localisation. No significant excess is found for any of the 80 analysed\nGW events, and upper limits on the neutrino emission are derived. Using the\ninformation from the GW catalogues and assuming isotropic emission, upper\nlimits on the total energy $E_{\\rm tot, \\nu}$ emitted as neutrinos of all\nflavours and on the ratio $f_\\nu = E_{\\rm tot, \\nu}/E_{\\rm GW}$ between\nneutrino and GW emissions are also computed. Finally, a stacked analysis of all\nthe 72 binary black hole mergers (respectively the 7 neutron star - black hole\nmerger candidates) has been performed to constrain the typical neutrino\nemission within this population, leading to the limits: $E_{\\rm tot, \\nu} < 4.0\n\\times 10^{53}$ erg and $f_\\nu < 0.15$ (respectively, $E_{\\rm tot, \\nu} < 3.2\n\\times 10^{53}$ erg and $f_\\nu < 0.88$) for $E^{-2}$ spectrum and isotropic\nemission.

Due to the\ncontradiction between the limited resources of IoT devices and\nresource-intensive ViT models, the use of cloud servers to assist ViT model\ntraining has become mainstream. However, due to the larger number of parameters\nand floating-point operations (FLOPs) of the existing ViT models, the model\nparameters transmitted by cloud servers are large and difficult to run on\nresource-constrained IoT devices. To this end, this paper proposes a\ntransmission-friendly ViT model, TFormer, for deployment on\nresource-constrained IoT devices with the assistance of a cloud server. The\nhigh performance and small number of model parameters and FLOPs of TFormer are\nattributed to the proposed hybrid layer and the proposed partially connected\nfeed-forward network (PCS-FFN). The hybrid layer consists of nonlearnable\nmodules and a pointwise convolution, which can obtain multitype and multiscale\nfeatures with only a few parameters and FLOPs to improve the TFormer\nperformance. The PCS-FFN adopts group convolution to reduce the number of\nparameters. The key idea of this paper is to propose TFormer with few model\nparameters and FLOPs to facilitate applications running on resource-constrained\nIoT devices to benefit from the high performance of the ViT models.\nExperimental results on the ImageNet-1K, MS COCO, and ADE20K datasets for image\nclassification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate\nthat the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art models.\nSpecifically, TFormer-S achieves 5% higher accuracy on ImageNet-1K than\nResNet18 with 1.4$\\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 15:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-16"}

An agent's broadcast\nsucceeds if no other agent broadcasts during that slot. If two or more agents\nbroadcast in the same slot, then the broadcasts collide and both broadcasts\nfail. An agent listening on the channel during a slot receives ternary\nfeedback, learning whether that slot had silence, a successful broadcast, or a\ncollision. Agents are (adversarially) injected into the system over time. The\ngoal is to coordinate the agents so that each is able to successfully broadcast\nits packet.\n  A contention-resolution protocol is measured both in terms of its throughput\nand the number of slots during which an agent broadcasts or listens. Most prior\nwork assumes that listening is free and only tries to minimize the number of\nbroadcasts.\n  This paper answers two foundational questions. First, is constant throughput\nachievable when using polylogarithmic channel accesses per agent, both for\nlistening and broadcasting? Second, is constant throughput still achievable\nwhen an adversary jams some slots by broadcasting noise in them? Specifically,\nfor $N$ packets arriving over time and $J$ jammed slots, we give an algorithm\nthat with high probability in $N+J$ guarantees $\\Theta(1)$ throughput and\nachieves on average $O(\\texttt{polylog}(N+J))$ channel accesses against an\nadaptive adversary.

In this paper, we present\na modified superstructure formulation to implement streams with variable\ntemperatures and flow capacities. To apply fast MILP solvers, all nonlinear\nterms, such as those of LMTD, HEX areas and energy balances, are\npiecewise-linear approximated with simplex or hyperplane models. The\ntranslation to MILP is achieved with highly efficient logarithmic coding. One\npromising application is implementing utilities as streams with variable\ntemperatures and flow capacities. On the one hand, this enables multi-stage\nheat transfer with stream splits and intermediate utility placement. On the\nother hand, the temperatures of the utilities can be included as a design\nparameter in optimizing the heat exchanger network. This makes sense if only\nthe sensible heat of, e.g., thermal oil, water or flue gas, is used as a\nutility where the inlet and outlet temperatures do not necessarily have to be\nspecified a priori. To examine whether the implementation of utilities as\nstreams leads to more cost-effective solutions, three representative case\nstudies were considered. The results show that reducing the outlet temperature\nof cold utilities or increasing the outlet temperature of hot utilities leads\nto significant cost savings.

Moreover, when it comes to the Internet of\nthings (IoT), one of the foundations for enabling connecting everything, the\nneed for EH may become inevitable. IoT involves connecting not only devices\nthat are large in number, but also hard to reach. The good news, nevertheless,\nis that the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), owning to its flexibility and ease\nof deployment is emerging to offer communication services when infrastructure\nis lacking. Merging the UAV and IoT is of quite interest as the former could\nnot just enable flexible connectivity for the IoT but also powering them in\nspite of any restrictions. However, managing the UAV assisted IoT resources to\nmeet certain data communications and EH quality measures while keeping the UAV\nconsumed energy minimized is a major challenge as this corresponds to a\nnon-convex optimization problem.

The\nrelaxation of the contraction constraint allows the proposed model to learn\nmore complex priors, thus offering improved performance over traditional PnP\nschemes. Our experiments in magnetic resonance image reconstruction\ndemonstrates the improved performance offered by the proposed energy model over\ntraditional PnP methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 09:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

LA with\nfinite action set can be classified into two main categories: fixed and\nvariable structure. Furthermore, variable action-set learning automaton (VASLA)\nis one of the main subsets of variable structure learning automaton. In this\npaper, we propose VDHLA, a novel hybrid learning automaton model, which is a\ncombination of fixed structure and variable action set learning automaton. In\nthe proposed model, variable action set learning automaton can increase,\ndecrease, or leave unchanged the depth of fixed structure learning automaton\nduring the action switching phase. In addition, the depth of the proposed model\ncan change in a symmetric (SVDHLA) or asymmetric (AVDHLA) manner. To the best\nof our knowledge, it is the first hybrid model that intelligently changes the\ndepth of fixed structure learning automaton. Several computer simulations are\nconducted to study the performance of the proposed model with respect to the\ntotal number of rewards and action switching in stationary and non-stationary\nenvironments. The proposed model is compared with FSLA and VSLA. In order to\ndetermine the performance of the proposed model in a practical application, the\nselfish mining attack which threatens the incentive-compatibility of a\nproof-of-work based blockchain environment is considered. The proposed model is\napplied to defend against the selfish mining attack in Bitcoin and compared\nwith the tie-breaking mechanism, which is a well-known defense. Simulation\nresults in all environments have shown the superiority of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 06:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-24"}

In this study, we have introduced a facile fabrication procedure for\nannealing hematite to monitor ethanol gas. Due to large specific area of this\nconductive platform, more available target molecules (ethanol gas) are\ndetected. To construct this platform, initially, a large scale well-separated\niron oxide (hematite) nanostructures are created via an annealing process. The\nmorphology of the nanostructure is optimized through annealing temperature and\noperating temperature for ethanol gas. The best response for the gas sensor is\nachieved for hematite nanostructures fabricated through the annealing\ntemperature of 500{\\deg}C and the operating temperature of 225$^\\circ$C. The\nfabricated nanostructures is tested in air ambient conditions for various\nethanol gas concentrations from 50 to 1000 ppm. The modified sensor exhibited\nacceptable reproducibility and good selectivity with no interference-effect. To\nexamine the X-ray diffraction patterns of hematite nanostructures at three\nannealed temperatures, the Rietveld method and FullProf software are used in\nwhich the average crystal size has been obtained. Obviously, with increasing\nthe annealing temperature, the average size of the crystals has been increased.\nThe results of ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy show that the energy gap\ndecreased with increasing annealing temperature.

However, the benefits of such a\nsemantic-centric design can be limited by radio frequency interference (RFI)\nthat causes substantial semantic noise. The impact of semantic noise due to\ninterference can be alleviated using an interference-resistant and robust\n(IR$^2$) SemCom design. Nevertheless, no such design exists yet. To shed light\non this knowledge gap and stimulate fundamental research on IR$^2$ SemCom, the\nperformance limits of a text SemCom system named DeepSC is studied in the\npresence of single- and multi-interferer RFI. By introducing a principled\nprobabilistic framework for SemCom, we show that DeepSC produces semantically\nirrelevant sentences as the power of single- and multi-interferer RFI gets very\nlarge. Corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations, these performance limits offer\ndesign insights -- regarding IR$^2$ SemCom -- contrary to the theoretically\nunsubstantiated sentiment that SemCom techniques (such as DeepSC) work well in\nvery low signal-to-noise ratio regimes. The performance limits also reveal the\nvulnerability of DeepSC and SemCom to a wireless attack using RFI.
