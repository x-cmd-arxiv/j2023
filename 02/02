Dual-energy CT (DECT) statistical iterative reconstruction (SIR) has\ndemonstrated its potential for reducing noise and increasing accuracy. Our lab\nproposed a joint statistical DECT algorithm for stopping power estimation and\nshowed that it outperforms competing image-based material-decomposition\nmethods. However, due to its slow convergence and the high computational cost\nof projections, the elapsed time of 3D DECT SIR is often not clinically\nacceptable. Therefore, to improve its convergence, we have embedded DECT SIR\ninto a deep learning model-based unrolled network for 3D DECT reconstruction\n(MB-DECTNet) that can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. This deep\nlearning-based method is trained to learn the shortcuts between the initial\nconditions and the stationary points of iterative algorithms while preserving\nthe unbiased estimation property of model-based algorithms. MB-DECTNet is\nformed by stacking multiple update blocks, each of which consists of a data\nconsistency layer (DC) and a spatial mixer layer, where the spatial mixer layer\nis the shrunken U-Net, and the DC layer is a one-step update of an arbitrary\ntraditional iterative method. Although the proposed network can be combined\nwith numerous iterative DECT algorithms, we demonstrate its performance with\nthe dual-energy alternating minimization (DEAM). The qualitative result shows\nthat MB-DECTNet with DEAM significantly reduces noise while increasing the\nresolution of the test image. The quantitative result shows that MB-DECTNet has\nthe potential to estimate attenuation coefficients accurately as traditional\nstatistical algorithms but with a much lower computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 16:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

Specifically, we train a diffusion\ngenerative model on protein structures from molecular dynamics simulations, and\nwe show that its score function approximates a force field that can directly be\nused to simulate CG molecular dynamics. While having a vastly simplified\ntraining setup compared to previous work, we demonstrate that our approach\nleads to improved performance across several small- to medium-sized protein\nsimulations, reproducing the CG equilibrium distribution, and preserving\ndynamics of all-atom simulations such as protein folding events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 17:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

While science has traditionally relied on trial and error\nand even serendipity to a large extent, the last few decades have seen a surge\nof data-driven scientific discoveries. However, in order to truly leverage\nlarge-scale data sets and high-throughput experimental setups, machine learning\nmethods will need to be further improved and better integrated in the\nscientific discovery pipeline. A key challenge for current machine learning\nmethods in this context is the efficient exploration of very large search\nspaces, which requires techniques for estimating reducible (epistemic)\nuncertainty and generating sets of diverse and informative experiments to\nperform. This motivated a new probabilistic machine learning framework called\nGFlowNets, which can be applied in the modeling, hypotheses generation and\nexperimental design stages of the experimental science loop. GFlowNets learn to\nsample from a distribution given indirectly by a reward function corresponding\nto an unnormalized probability, which enables sampling diverse, high-reward\ncandidates. GFlowNets can also be used to form efficient and amortized Bayesian\nposterior estimators for causal models conditioned on the already acquired\nexperimental data. Having such posterior models can then provide estimators of\nepistemic uncertainty and information gain that can drive an experimental\ndesign policy. Altogether, here we will argue that GFlowNets can become a\nvaluable tool for AI-driven scientific discovery, especially in scenarios of\nvery large candidate spaces where we have access to cheap but inaccurate\nmeasurements or to expensive but accurate measurements.

We introduce Synthetic prompting, a method that leverages a few\nhandcrafted examples to prompt the model to generate more examples by itself,\nand selects effective demonstrations to elicit better reasoning. Our method\nalternates between a backward and forward process to generate new examples. The\nbackward process generates a question that match a sampled reasoning chain, so\nthat the question is solvable and clear. The forward process produces a more\ndetailed reasoning chain for the question, improving the quality of the\nexample.

Inspired by the\nduality connections between the rate-distortion and channel coding problems in\nthe classical setting, we propose a new formulation for the lossy quantum\nsource coding problem. This formulation differs from the existing quantum\nrate-distortion theory in two aspects. Firstly, we require that the\nreconstruction of the compressed quantum source fulfill a global error\nconstraint as opposed to the sample-wise local error criterion used in the\nstandard rate-distortion setting. Secondly, instead of a distortion observable,\nwe employ the notion of a backward quantum channel, which we refer to as a\n\"posterior reference map\", to measure the reconstruction error. Using these, we\ncharacterize the asymptotic performance limit of the lossy quantum source\ncoding problem in terms of single-letter coherent information of the given\nposterior reference map. We demonstrate a protocol to encode (at the specified\nrate) and decode, with the reconstruction satisfying the provided global error\ncriterion, and therefore achieving the asymptotic performance limit. The\nprotocol is constructed by decomposing coherent information as a difference of\ntwo Holevo information quantities, inspired from prior works in quantum\ncommunication problems. To further support the findings, we develop analogous\nformulations for the quantum-classical and classical variants and express the\nasymptotic performance limit in terms of single-letter mutual information\nquantities with respect to appropriately defined channels analogous to\nposterior reference maps. We also provide various examples for the three\nformulations, and shed light on their connection to the standard\nrate-distortion formulation wherever possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 17:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

Due to the complex behavior of system degradation, data-driven methods\nare often preferred, and neural network-based methods have been shown to\nperform particularly very well. Many neural network-based methods have been\nproposed and successfully applied to many problems. However, most models rely\non assumptions that often are quite restrictive and there is an interest to\nfind more expressive models. Energy-based models are promising candidates for\nthis due to their successful use in other applications, which include natural\nlanguage processing and computer vision. The focus of this work is therefore to\ninvestigate how energy-based models can be used for survival modeling and\npredictive maintenance. A key step in using energy-based models for survival\nmodeling is the introduction of right-censored data, which, based on a maximum\nlikelihood approach, is shown to be a straightforward process. Another\nimportant part of the model is the evaluation of the integral used to normalize\nthe modeled probability density function, and it is shown how this can be done\nefficiently.

In the absence of thermocapillary\nphenomena, the combined effect of non-uniform evaporation due to the increased\nvapour concentration between the two droplets and elastocapillary phenonema\ndetermines whether the drop-drop interaction is attractive or repulsive. The\nMarangoni stresses suppress droplet attraction at the early stages of the\ndrying process and lead to longer droplet lifetimes. For substrates with\nintermediate stiffness, the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking at late\nstages of evaporation is found. The rich dynamics of this complex system is\nexplored through the construction of a detailed flow map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 18:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-02"}

Thus, it is of interest to use temporal data to uncover the\ndirectional, time-dependent, influence structure of a given network while also\nquantifying uncertainty even when knowledge of a physical network is lacking.\nTypically, methods for inferring the influence structure in networks require\nknowledge of a physical network or are only able to infer small network\nstructures.

We place new limits on the properties of\naxion-like particles that are independent of their non-gravitational couplings\nto the standard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

Owing to\ntheir complexity and relative scarcity, quasiperiodic crystals are\nunderexplored relative to periodic and amorphous structures. Here, we introduce\na new type of highly tunable quasiperiodic crystal easily assembled from\nperiodic components. By twisting three layers of graphene with two different\ntwist angles, we form two moir\\'e patterns with incommensurate moir\\'e unit\ncells. In contrast to many common quasiperiodic structures that are defined on\nthe atomic scale, the quasiperiodicity in our system is defined on moir\\'e\nlength scales of several nanometers. This novel \"moir\\'e quasiperiodic crystal\"\nallows us to tune the chemical potential and thus the electronic system between\na periodic-like regime at low energies and a strongly quasiperiodic regime at\nhigher energies, the latter hosting a large density of weakly dispersing\nstates. Interestingly, in the quasiperiodic regime we observe superconductivity\nnear a flavor-symmetry-breaking phase transition, the latter indicative of the\nimportant role electronic interactions play in that regime. The prevalence of\ninteracting phenomena in future systems with in situ tunability is not only\nuseful for the study of quasiperiodic systems, but it may also provide insights\ninto electronic ordering in related periodic moir\\'e crystals. We anticipate\nthat extending this new platform to engineer quasiperiodic crystals by varying\nthe number of layers and twist angles, and by using different two-dimensional\ncomponents, will lead to a new family of quantum materials to investigate the\nproperties of strongly interacting quasiperiodic crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

Using\nstate-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, we present systematic analyses\nsimulating the expected weak lensing profiles from clusters in a variety of\ndynamic states and at wide range of redshifts. In order to derive cluster\nmasses, we use a model consistent with the implementation within the Euclid\nConsortium of the dedicated processing function and find that, when jointly\nmodelling mass and the concentration parameter of the Navarro-Frenk-White halo\nprofile, the weak lensing masses tend to be, on average, biased low with\nrespect to the true mass. Using a fixed value for the concentration, the mass\nbias is diminished along with its relative uncertainty. Simulating the weak\nlensing signal by projecting along the directions of the axes of the moment of\ninertia tensor ellipsoid, we find that orientation matters: when clusters are\noriented along the major axis the lensing signal is boosted, and the recovered\nweak lensing mass is correspondingly overestimated. Typically, the weak lensing\nmass bias of individual clusters is modulated by the weak lensing\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and the negative mass bias tends to be larger toward\nhigher redshifts. However, when we use a fixed value of the concentration\nparameter the redshift evolution trend is reduced. These results provide a\nsolid basis for the weak-lensing mass calibration required by the cosmological\napplication of future cluster surveys from Euclid and Rubin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

Based on\nextensive computational evidence, we propose an elegant conjecture which, in\nparticular, completely classifies such densities: Let $m = 2^j m_0$ with $m_0$\nodd. If $2^j < m_0$, then the odd density of $b_m$ is $1/2$; moreover, such\ndensity is equal to $1/2$ on every (nonconstant) subprogression $An+B$. If $2^j\n> m_0$, then $b_m$, which is already known to have density zero, is identically\neven on infinitely many non-nested subprogressions. This and all other\nconjectures of this paper are consistent with our ''master conjecture'' on\neta-quotients presented in the previous work.\n  In general, our results on $b_m$ for $m$ even determine behaviors\nconsiderably different from the case of $m$ odd. Also interesting, it\nfrequently happens that on subprogressions $An+B$, $b_m$ matches the parity of\nthe multipartition functions $p_t$, for certain values of $t$. We make a\nsuitable use of Ramanujan-Kolberg identities to deduce a large class of such\nresults; as an example, $b_{28}(49n+12) \\equiv p_3(7n+2) \\pmod{2}$. Additional\nconsequences are several ''almost always congruences'' for various $b_m$, as\nwell as new parity results specifically for $b_{11}$.\n  We wrap up our work with a much simpler proof of the main result of a recent\npaper by Cherubini-Mercuri, which fully characterized the parity of $b_8$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 19:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 04:13:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

As with classical thermodynamics,\nfundamental principles can be explored through engines and refrigerators, but,\nin the quantum case, these devices are miniaturized and their operations\ninvolve uniquely quantum effects. Our work provides a broad overview of this\nactive field of quantum engines and refrigerators, reviewing the latest\ntheoretical proposals and experimental realizations.

Thus, we designed an audio-based haptic\nfeedback system that measures the vibrations experienced by the robot tools and\nenables the operator to feel them in real time. Accurate haptic transmission\nwas achieved by optimizing the positions of the system's off-the-shelf\naccelerometers and voice-coil actuators. A user study was conducted to evaluate\nhow this naturalistic type of vibration feedback affects the operator's\nperformance in telerobotic assembly. Thirty participants used a bimanual\nteleoperation system to build a structure under three randomly ordered haptic\nfeedback conditions: no vibrations, one-axis vibrations, and three-axis\nvibrations.

Yet, they suffer from security-related issues such as\nadversarial examples and poisoning (backdoor) attacks. A deep learning model\nmay be poisoned by training with backdoored data or by modifying inner network\nparameters. Then, a backdoored model performs as expected when receiving a\nclean input, but it misclassifies when receiving a backdoored input stamped\nwith a pre-designed pattern called \"trigger\". Unfortunately, it is difficult to\ndistinguish between clean and backdoored models without prior knowledge of the\ntrigger. This paper proposes a backdoor detection method by utilizing a special\ntype of adversarial attack, universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), and its\nsimilarities with a backdoor trigger. We observe an intuitive phenomenon: UAPs\ngenerated from backdoored models need fewer perturbations to mislead the model\nthan UAPs from clean models. UAPs of backdoored models tend to exploit the\nshortcut from all classes to the target class, built by the backdoor trigger.\nWe propose a novel method called Universal Soldier for Backdoor detection (USB)\nand reverse engineering potential backdoor triggers via UAPs. Experiments on\n345 models trained on several datasets show that USB effectively detects the\ninjected backdoor and provides comparable or better results than\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 20:47:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 13:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

Our contention is that there is a distinguished Most Probable\nEscape Path (MPEP) crossing the periodic orbit which acts as a guide for noisy\nescaping paths in the case of small noise slightly away from the limit of\nvanishing noise. It is well known that, before exiting, noisy trajectories will\ntend to cycle around the periodic orbit as the noise vanishes, but we observe\nthat the escaping paths are stubbornly resistant to cycling as soon as the\nnoise becomes at all significant.

Studies from\nacross different hosts, cell-lines, and labs into the cellular effects induced\nby aneuploidy have conflicted, ranging from small, chaotic global changes to\nlarge instances of either overexpression or underexpression throughout the\ntrisomic chromosome. We ascertained that conflicting findings may be correct\nbut miss the overarching ground truth due to careless use of thresholds. To\ncorrect this deficiency, we introduce the Meta-analytic Operation of\nThreshold-independent Filtering (MOTiF) method, which begins by providing a\npanoramic view of all thresholds, transforms the data to eliminate the effects\naccounted for by known mechanisms, and then reconstructs an explanation of the\nmechanisms that underly the difference between the baseline and the\nuncharacterized effects observed.

We were able to decompose the gene\nexpression alterations into three overlapping mechanisms: the raw chromosome\ncontent, the genomic compartmentalization, and the global structural\ncondensation.

Symbolic regression is a method that generates nonlinear\nmodels from data in the form of analytic expressions. Historically, symbolic\nregression has been predominantly realized using genetic programming, a method\nthat iteratively evolves a population of candidate solutions that are sampled\nby genetic operators crossover and mutation. This gradient-free evolutionary\napproach suffers from several deficiencies: it does not scale well with the\nnumber of variables and samples in the training data, models tend to grow in\nsize and complexity without an adequate accuracy gain, and it is hard to\nfine-tune the inner model coefficients using just genetic operators. Recently,\nneural networks have been applied to learn the whole analytic formula, i.e.,\nits structure as well as the coefficients, by means of gradient-based\noptimization algorithms. We propose a novel neural network-based symbolic\nregression method that constructs physically plausible models based on limited\ntraining data and prior knowledge about the system.

Instead\nof particles, the physics of a TQFT only manifests itself in non-trivial\nspacetime topologies. Topological defects provide a natural place to\ninvestigate such effects. In particular, we consider two possible ways in which\naxionic cosmic strings can interact with a Zn TQFT. One of them, by extending\nthe structure of the axion coupling, leads to specific predictions for the\nlocalized degrees of freedom on the cosmic string, which can in turn effect\ntheir evolution and leave observable signals. The second approach, by gauging a\ndiscrete subgroup of the axionic shift symmetry, leads to dramatic changes in\nthe string spectrum. We stress that the scenario considered here should be\nregarded as a plausible way for new physics to arise since it can be the low\nenergy effective field theory for quite generic scenarios at high energies. To\ndemonstrate this point and further illustrate the physical implications, we\nconstructed such UV completions for both of the cases of couplings to TQFTs.\nThe detailed prediction for observable signals of such scenarios needs further\ninvestigation.

When\nassuming the Planck cosmology, the canonical HMF parameters are rejected at\nmore than $2\\sigma$ level for both KiDS and DES, where reconstructed HMF from\nthese posteriors give a $48.8\\%^{+8.3\\%}_{-9.4\\%}$ lower for KiDS-1000 and a\n$29.5\\%^{+8.5\\%}_{-8.5\\%}$ lower for DES-y3 in terms of total halo mass larger\nthan $M_\\mathrm{Halo} > 10^{14} M_\\odot$ compared to a canonical HMF model. In\naddition, a Planck-like $S_8$ is also preferred if massive haloes were to have\na $\\sim 20\\%$ lower abundance compared to a canonical halo mass function. Under\none of these alternative HMFs, we found $S_8 \\sim 0.826_{-0.019}^{+0.021}$ for\nKiDS-1000 and $0.851_{-0.021}^{+0.020}$ for DES-y3. Our work suggests that\nvarying the halo abundance provides an alternative to varying the matter power\nspectrum when exploring possible solutions to the $S_8$ tension. By comparing\nthe posteriors of both cosmological and HMF parameters between two different\nsurveys (KiDS-1000 and DES-y3), we are also testing the self-consistency of the\ncosmological interpretation at a level that has corresponding particle and/or\nastrophysical interpretations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 22:24:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 05:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-20"}

Monitoring slopes prone to instabilities is\ntherefore critical in mitigating the risk posed by their failure. The purpose\nof slope monitoring is to detect precursory signs of stability issues, such as\nchanges in the rate of displacement with which a slope is deforming. This\ninformation can then be used to predict the timing or probability of an\nimminent failure in order to provide an early warning. In this study, a more\nobjective, statistical-learning algorithm is proposed to detect and\ncharacterise the risk of a slope failure, based on spectral analysis of\nserially correlated displacement time series data. The algorithm is applied to\nsatellite-based interferometric synthetic radar (InSAR) displacement time\nseries data to retrospectively analyse the risk of the 2019 Brumadinho tailings\ndam collapse in Brazil. Two potential risk milestones are identified and signs\nof a definitive but emergent risk (27 February 2018 to 26 August 2018) and\nimminent risk of collapse of the tailings dam (27 June 2018 to 24 December\n2018) are detected by the algorithm.

On the\nother hand, on-line scheduling or rescheduling, which can improve the\nrobustness by using the model and the latest measurements simultaneously,\nsuffer from a high computational cost. This work proposes a hybrid scheduling\nframework, which combines the advantages of both off-line scheduling and\non-line scheduling, to provide a balanced solution between robustness and\ncomputational cost. A novel concept of partially-dispatchable state is\nintroduced. It can be treated as a constant in scheduling when the model works\nwell.

The problem\nhas been widely argued to be one of the central safety problems in AI.\nUnfortunately, most existing works in value alignment tend to focus on issues\nthat are primarily related to the fact that reward functions are an unintuitive\nmechanism to specify objectives. However, the complexity of the objective\nspecification mechanism is just one of many reasons why the user may have\nmisspecified their objective.

Nuclear\nmatter is constructed with the parity doublet nucleon model coupled to scalar\nfields $\\sigma$, vector fields $(\\omega, \\rho)$, and to mesons with strangeness\nthrough the U(1)$_A$ anomaly. In models with large $m_0$, the nucleon mass is\ninsensitive to the medium, and the nuclear saturation properties can be\nreproduced without demanding strong couplings of nucleons to scalar fields\n$\\sigma$ and vector fields $\\omega$.

A sparsity of language resources has hampered\nprevious work on Indonesian. The Transformer is a new architecture rapidly\nbecoming dominant for NLP, surpassing alternatives like convolutional and\nrecurrent neural networks. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a\nTransformer model that converts all text-based language problems to\ntext-to-text format for English. The multilingual variant is mT5 (multilingual\nT5) which has shown promising results on many NLP tasks across languages.\nHowever, the size of this multilingual model is a drawback for its application\nin real production applications, which sometimes require only one language. In\nthis study, the mT5 model was adapted for only one language, Indonesian,\nresulting in a pre-trained T5 model that was specific only for Indonesian with\na smaller size. For performance comparison, we fine-tuned this model and the\nmT5 model to the Sentiment Analysis (SA), Question Generation (QG), and\nQuestion Answering (QA) tasks with the exact mechanism and dataset. Fine-tuned\nmodel based on our model achieved 77.18% accuracy on SA, 8% higher than the\nmT5-based model, and obtained nearly the same score as the mT5-based model on\nQG and QA. The results confirm that it is possible to produce a smaller\npre-trained model that maintains comparable yields while reducing the model\nsize by up to 58%. In addition, the resulting model requires less memory, loads\nfaster, and inference times faster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 03:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

In this work, we relax these\nassumptions and propose a novel algorithm for task-agnostic online\nmeta-learning in non-stationary environments. More specifically, we first\npropose two simple but effective detection mechanisms of task switches and\ndistribution shift based on empirical observations, which serve as a key\nbuilding block for more elegant online model updates in our algorithm: the task\nswitch detection mechanism allows reusing of the best model available for the\ncurrent task at hand, and the distribution shift detection mechanism\ndifferentiates the meta model update in order to preserve the knowledge for\nin-distribution tasks and quickly learn the new knowledge for\nout-of-distribution tasks. In particular, our online meta model updates are\nbased only on the current data, which eliminates the need of storing previous\ndata as required in most existing methods. We further show that a sublinear\ntask-averaged regret can be achieved for our algorithm under mild conditions.\nEmpirical studies on three different benchmarks clearly demonstrate the\nsignificant advantage of our algorithm over related baseline approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 04:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

For\nrealistic character animation, it is necessary to synthesize such interactions\nbetween virtual characters and their surroundings. Despite recent progress in\ncharacter animation using machine learning, most systems focus on controlling\nan agent's movements in fairly simple and homogeneous environments, with\nlimited interactions with other objects. Furthermore, many previous approaches\nthat synthesize human-scene interactions require significant manual labeling of\nthe training data. In contrast, we present a system that uses adversarial\nimitation learning and reinforcement learning to train physically-simulated\ncharacters that perform scene interaction tasks in a natural and life-like\nmanner. Our method learns scene interaction behaviors from large unstructured\nmotion datasets, without manual annotation of the motion data. These scene\ninteractions are learned using an adversarial discriminator that evaluates the\nrealism of a motion within the context of a scene. The key novelty involves\nconditioning both the discriminator and the policy networks on scene context.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three challenging\nscene interaction tasks: carrying, sitting, and lying down, which require\ncoordination of a character's movements in relation to objects in the\nenvironment. Our policies learn to seamlessly transition between different\nbehaviors like idling, walking, and sitting. By randomizing the properties of\nthe objects and their placements during training, our method is able to\ngeneralize beyond the objects and scenarios depicted in the training dataset,\nproducing natural character-scene interactions for a wide variety of object\nshapes and placements.

One of the key challenges for prediction is to learn\nthe evolution of facts. Most existing works focus on exploring evolutionary\ninformation in history to obtain effective temporal embeddings for entities and\nrelations, but they ignore the variation in evolution patterns of facts, which\nmakes them struggle to adapt to future data with different evolution patterns.\nMoreover, new entities continue to emerge along with the evolution of facts\nover time. Since existing models highly rely on historical information to learn\nembeddings for entities, they perform poorly on such entities with little\nhistorical information. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Temporal\nMeta-learning framework for TKG reasoning, MetaTKG for brevity. Specifically,\nour method regards TKG prediction as many temporal meta-tasks, and utilizes the\ndesigned Temporal Meta-learner to learn evolutionary meta-knowledge from these\nmeta-tasks. The proposed method aims to guide the backbones to learn to adapt\nquickly to future data and deal with entities with little historical\ninformation by the learned meta-knowledge. Specially, in temporal meta-learner,\nwe design a Gating Integration module to adaptively establish temporal\ncorrelations between meta-tasks. Extensive experiments on four widely-used\ndatasets and three backbones demonstrate that our method can greatly improve\nthe performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 05:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

However, a key limitation is that these language models fundamentally\nlack visual perception - a crucial attribute needed to extend these models to\nbe able to interact with the real world and solve vision tasks, such as in\nvisual-question answering and robotics. Prior works have largely connected\nimage to text through pretraining and/or fine-tuning on curated image-text\ndatasets, which can be a costly and expensive process. In order to resolve this\nlimitation, we propose a simple yet effective approach called\nLanguage-Quantized AutoEncoder (LQAE), a modification of VQ-VAE that learns to\nalign text-image data in an unsupervised manner by leveraging pretrained\nlanguage models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Our main idea is to encode image as\nsequences of text tokens by directly quantizing image embeddings using a\npretrained language codebook. We then apply random masking followed by a BERT\nmodel, and have the decoder reconstruct the original image from BERT predicted\ntext token embeddings. By doing so, LQAE learns to represent similar images\nwith similar clusters of text tokens, thereby aligning these two modalities\nwithout the use of aligned text-image pairs. This enables few-shot image\nclassification with large language models (e.g., GPT-3) as well as linear\nclassification of images based on BERT text features.

It renders the global model to signifcantly degrade\nrecognition performance on old categories (i.e., catastrophic forgetting), when\nlocal clients receive new categories consecutively under limited memory of\nstoring old categories. Moreover, some new local clients that collect novel\ncategories unseen by other clients may be introduced to the FL training\nirregularly, which further exacerbates the catastrophic forgetting on old\ncategories. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel Local-Global\nAnti-forgetting (LGA) model to address local and global catastrophic forgetting\non old categories, which is a pioneering work to explore a global\nclass-incremental model in the FL feld.

In addition, for some critical applications,\nit is also often a requirement that the imputation method is scalable and the\nlogic behind the imputation is explainable, which is especially difficult for\ncomplex methods that are, for example, based on deep learning. Based on these\nconsiderations, we propose a new algorithm named \"conditional\nDistribution-based Imputation of Missing Values with Regularization\" (DIMV).\nDIMV operates by determining the conditional distribution of a feature that has\nmissing entries, using the information from the fully observed features as a\nbasis.

The traditional method for measuring\nthis is through HI experiments, which are costly and time-consuming. The DPCIPI\nmodel uses a pre-trained neural network to vectorize the gene sequences of\nviruses and predicts the degree of cross-immunity between them. Method: The\npaper describes the steps taken to develop the DPCIPI model. First, the gene\nsequence of two viruses is converted into k-mers. Then, the k-mers sequences\nare aligned, and identical k-mers at the exact position are deleted. The human\nDNA pre-trained model (DNABERT) is used to vectorize each k-mer in the\nremaining k-mers. This is followed using a BiLSTM encoder to encode the two\nviruses into sequence representation and embeddings. An information fusion\noperation is then performed on the two embeddings to obtain a splicing vector,\nwhich is further input into a fully connected neural network for prediction.\nAll parameters of the model are trained simultaneously. Result: Binary\ncross-immunity prediction predicts whether the HI titer between two viruses\nexceeds a certain threshold (in our case, an HI titer measurement value higher\nthan 40).

To resolve this theoretically critical issue, we present a\nnew warm-start-with-prediction framework for\n$\\text{L}$-/$\\text{L}^\\natural$-convex function minimization. Our framework\noffers time complexity bounds proportional to the distance between a prediction\nand the set of all optimal solutions. The main technical difficulty lies in\nlearning predictions that are provably close to sets of all optimal solutions,\nfor which we present an online-gradient-descent-based method. We thus give the\nfirst polynomial-time learnability of predictions that can provably warm-start\nalgorithms regardless of multiple optimal solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 08:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

The defenses against the persistent-type\ncovert channels have been well addressed, while those for the volatile-type are\nstill rather inadequate.

However, there is a severe performance drop compared with\nreal-valued networks, due to its intrinsic frequent weight oscillation during\ntraining. In this paper, we introduce a Resilient Binary Neural Network (ReBNN)\nto mitigate the frequent oscillation for better BNNs' training. We identify\nthat the weight oscillation mainly stems from the non-parametric scaling\nfactor. To address this issue, we propose to parameterize the scaling factor\nand introduce a weighted reconstruction loss to build an adaptive training\nobjective. For the first time, we show that the weight oscillation is\ncontrolled by the balanced parameter attached to the reconstruction loss, which\nprovides a theoretical foundation to parameterize it in back propagation. Based\non this, we learn our ReBNN by calculating the balanced parameter based on its\nmaximum magnitude, which can effectively mitigate the weight oscillation with a\nresilient training process. Extensive experiments are conducted upon various\nnetwork models, such as ResNet and Faster-RCNN for computer vision, as well as\nBERT for natural language processing.

This paper proposes a new type of metric known as Eloss\nand offers a novel training strategy to empower perception models from the\naspect of anomaly detection. Eloss is designed based on an explanation of the\nperception model's information compression layers. Specifically, taking\ninspiration from the design of a communication system, the information\ntransmission process of an information compression network has two\nexpectations: the amount of information changes steadily, and the information\nentropy continues to decrease. Then Eloss can be obtained according to the\nabove expectations, guiding the update of related network parameters and\nproducing a sensitive metric to identify anomalies while maintaining the model\nperformance. Our experiments demonstrate that Eloss can deviate from the\nstandard value by a factor over 100 with anomalous data and produce distinctive\nvalues for similar but different types of anomalies, showing the effectiveness\nof the proposed method.

The recursive application of the wavelet transform to the lowpass\nsubband of the previous stage yields coarser temporal resolutions of the input\nsequence.

Neurocognitive and psychosomatic\nphenomena demonstrated during such exercises were instrumentally explored with\nEEG and other sensors. Neurocognitive modeling in the form of meditative\nvisualization produced persistent temperature effects in the body long after\nthe exercise finished; this raises the question about their psychosomatic or\nbiophysical origin. The work explores this question by comparing experiments\nwith focusing attention inside and outside the body. EEG, temperature, heart\nand breathing sensors monitor internal body conditions, high resolution\ndifferential calorimetric sensors are used to detect thermal effects outside\nthe body. Experiments with 159 attempts (2427 operator-sensor sessions) were\ncarried over five months, control measurements run in the same conditions in\nparallel to experimental series. Increase of body temperature up to moderate\nfever zone 38.5 C and intentional control of up and down trend of core\ntemperature by 1.6 C are demonstrated. Persistent temperature variations last\n>60 min. Experiments also demonstrated induced thermal fluctuations at 10^-3 C\nlevel in external calorimetric systems with 15 ml of water for 60-90 min.\nRepeatability of these attempts is over 90%, statistical Chi-square and\nMann-Whitney tests reject the null hypotheses about random character of\noutcomes. Thus, the obtained data confirm the persistent thermal effects\nreported in previous publications and indicate their biophysical dimension. To\nexplain these results we refer to a new model in neuroscience that involves\nspin phenomena in biochemical and physical systems. These experiments\ndemonstrate complex biophysical mechanisms of altered states of consciousness;\ntheir function in the body's neurohumoral regulation and non-classical brain\nfunctions is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 11:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

Here, we study a system\nwhich combines both phenomena, consisting of a two-impurity Anderson model\nultra-strongly coupled to a single-mode cavity. While presented as an abstract\nmodel, it is relevant for a range of future hybrid cavity-QED systems. Using\nthe hierarchical equations of motion approach we show that the ultrastrong\ncoupling of cavity photons to the electronic states (impurity) noticeably\nsuppresses the electronic Kondo resonance due to the destruction of many-body\ncorrelations of the Kondo cloud. We observe this transfer of correlations from\nthe Kondo cloud to the cavity by computing the entropy and mutual information\nof the impurity-cavity subsystems. In the weak lead-coupling limit and at\nzero-bias, the model exhibits a ground-state photon accumulation effect\noriginating entirely from counter-rotating terms in the impurity-cavity\ninteraction. Interestingly, in the strong lead-coupling limit, this\naccumulation is Kondo-enhanced by new transition paths opening when increasing\nthe hybridization to the leads. This suggests a new mechanism for the\ngeneration of real photons from virtual states.

While both methods\nheavily rely on the ability to score the difficulty of data samples, an optimal\nscoring function is still under exploration. Methodology: Distillation is a\nknowledge transfer approach where a teacher network guides a student network by\nfeeding a sequence of random samples. We argue that guiding student networks\nwith an efficient curriculum strategy can improve model generalization and\nrobustness. For this purpose, we design an uncertainty-based paced curriculum\nlearning in self distillation for medical image segmentation.

However, all the candidates with hexagonal lattices may not\nhost LWP phonons at $K$ ($K'$) high-symmetry points (HSPs). Hence, a more\naccurate recipe for LWP phonons in 2D is highly required. This work provides an\nexhaustive list of valley LWP phonons at HSPs in 2D by searching the entire 80\nlayer groups (LGs). We found that the valley LWP phonons can be obtained at\nHSPs in 11 of the 80 LGs. Guided by the symmetry analysis, we also contributed\nto realizing the ideal 2D material with valley LWP phonons. We identified the\nexistence of the valley LWP phonons in eleven 2D material candidates with 11\nLGs.

IKOL\ninvolves a nonconvex optimization that establishes an implicit mapping from an\nimage's 3D keypoints and body shapes to the relative body-part rotations. The\n3D keypoints and the body shapes are the inputs and the relative body-part\nrotations are the solutions. However, this procedure is implicit and hard to\nmake differentiable. So, to overcome this issue, we designed a Gauss-Newton\ndifferentiation (GN-Diff) procedure to differentiate IKOL. GN-Diff iteratively\nlinearizes the nonconvex objective function to obtain Gauss-Newton directions\nwith closed form solutions. Then, an automatic differentiation procedure is\ndirectly applied to generate a Jacobian matrix for end-to-end training.\nNotably, the GN-Diff procedure works fast because it does not rely on a\ntime-consuming implicit differentiation procedure. The twist rotation and shape\nparameters are learned from the neural networks and, as a result, IKOL has a\nmuch lower computational overhead than most existing optimization-based\nmethods. Additionally, compared to existing regression-based methods, IKOL\nprovides a more accurate mesh-image correspondence.

However, such studies have yet to\nhandle multi-memory games (where agents can memorize actions they played in the\npast and choose their actions based on their memories), even though\nmemorization plays a pivotal role in artificial intelligence and interpersonal\nrelationship. This study extends two major learning algorithms in games, i.e.,\nreplicator dynamics and gradient ascent, into multi-memory games. Then, we\nprove their dynamics are identical. Furthermore, theoretically and\nexperimentally, we clarify that the learning dynamics diverge from the Nash\nequilibrium in multi-memory zero-sum games and reach heteroclinic cycles\n(sojourn longer around the boundary of the strategy space), providing a\nfundamental advance in learning in games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 13:02:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 07:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

We introduce a\nunified generative modeling framework - MonoFlow: the particle evolution is\nrescaled via a monotonically increasing mapping of the log density ratio. Under\nour framework, adversarial training can be viewed as a procedure first\nobtaining MonoFlow's vector field via training the discriminator and the\ngenerator learns to draw the particle flow defined by the corresponding vector\nfield.

Extensive experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness of nuclear norm for various models (e.g., ViT and\nConvNeXt), different datasets (e.g., ImageNet and CUB-200), and diverse types\nof distribution shifts (e.g., style shift and reproduction shift). We show that\nthe nuclear norm is more accurate and robust in accuracy estimation than\nexisting methods. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of other\nmeasurements (e.g., mutual information maximization) for characterizing\ndispersity and confidence. Lastly, we investigate the limitation of the nuclear\nnorm, study its improved variant under severe class imbalance, and discuss\npotential directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 13:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-03"}

First, we introduce a new class of weighted tree\nautomata, called Root-Weighted Tree Automata, and their associated formal tree\nseries. Then we define, from this class, the SubTree automata that represent\ncompact computational models for finite tree languages. This allows us to\ndesign a theoretically guaranteed linear-time algorithm for computing the\nSubTree Kernel based on weighted tree automata intersection. The key idea\nbehind the proposed algorithm is to replace DAG reduction and nodes sorting\nsteps used in previous approaches by states equivalence classes computation\nallowed in the weighted tree automata approach.

In this\npaper, we focus on the full-range MPHPE problem, and propose a direct\nend-to-end simple baseline named DirectMHP. Due to the lack of datasets\napplicable to the full-range MPHPE, we firstly construct two benchmarks by\nextracting ground-truth labels for head detection and head orientation from\npublic datasets AGORA and CMU Panoptic.

Large scale magnetic fields\naround pre-PNe have been inferred from polarisation observations of masers.\nHowever, because masers probe very specific regions, it is still unclear if the\nmaser results are representative of the intrinsic magnetic field in the\ncircumstellar envelope (CSE). Molecular line polarisation can provide important\ninformation about the magnetic field. A comparison between the field morphology\ndetermined from maser observations and that observed in the more diffuse CO\ngas, can reveal if the two tracers probe the same magnetic field. We compare\nobservations taken with ALMA of molecular line polarisation around the\npost-Asymptotic Giant Branch)/pre-PNe star OH~17.7-2.0 with previous\nobservations of polarisation in the 1612~MHz OH maser region. We detect\nCO~$J=2-1$ molecular line polarisation at a level of $\\sim4\\%$ that displays an\nordered linear polarisation structure. We find that, correcting for Faraday\nrotation of the OH~maser linear polarisation vectors, the OH and CO linearly\npolarised emission trace the same large scale magnetic field. A structure\nfunction analysis of the CO linear polarisation reveals a plane-of-the-sky\nmagnetic field strength of $B_\\perp\\sim1$~mG in the CO region, consistent with\nprevious OH Zeeman observations. The consistency of the ALMA CO molecular line\npolarisation with maser observations indicate that both can be used to\ndetermine the magnetic field in CSEs. The existence of a strong, ordered,\nmagnetic-field around OH 17.7-2.0 indicates that magnetic fields are likely\ninvolved in the formation of this bipolar pre-PNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 14:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

In this Letter, we present the first thorough comparison between\nnear-infrared scattered light of the young planet-forming disk around IM Lup\nand the light-scattering properties of complex-shaped dust particles. The\navailability of scattering observations at multiple wavelengths and over a\nsignificant range of scattering angles allows for the first determination of\nthe monomer size, fractal dimension, and size of dust aggregates in a\nplanet-forming disk.

The obtained motif\nvocabulary consists of not only molecular motifs (i.e., the frequent\nfragments), but also their connection information, indicating how the motifs\nare connected with each other. Based on the mined connection-aware motifs,\nMiCaM builds a connection-aware generator, which simultaneously picks up motifs\nand determines how they are connected. We test our method on\ndistribution-learning benchmarks (i.e., generating novel molecules to resemble\nthe distribution of a given training set) and goal-directed benchmarks (i.e.,\ngenerating molecules with target properties), and achieve significant\nimprovements over previous fragment-based baselines. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that our method can effectively mine domain-specific motifs for\ndifferent tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 14:40:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 14:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

We assume that the particle switches between\ntwo constant velocity states $\\pm v$ at a rate $\\alpha$. Whenever the particle\nhits a boundary, it becomes stuck by pushing on the boundary until either a\ntumble event reverses the swimming direction or it is permanently absorbed. We\nformulate the absorption process by identifying the first passage time (FPT)\nfor absorption with the event that the time $A(t)$ spent attached to either\nwall up to time $t$ (the occupation time) crosses some random threshold\n$\\hat{A}$. Taking $\\Psi({a})\\equiv\\mathbb{P}[\\hat{A}\\gt{a}]$ to be an\nexponential distribution, $\\Psi[{a}]=e^{-\\kappa_0a}$, we show that the joint\nprobability density for particle position $X(t)$ and velocity state\n$\\sigma(t)=\\pm $ satisfies a well-defined boundary value problem (BVP) with\n$\\kappa_0$ representing a constant absorption rate. The solution of this BVP\ndetermines the so-called occupation time propagator, which is the joint\nprobability density for the triplet $(X(t),A(t),\\sigma(t))$. The propagator is\nthen used to incorporate more general models of absorption based on\nnon-exponential (non-Markovian) distributions $\\Psi(a)$. We illustrate the\ntheory by calculating the mean FPT (MFPT) and splitting probabilities for\nabsorption. We also show how our previous results for partially absorbing,\nnon-sticky boundaries can be recovered in an appropriate limit. Absorption now\ndepends on the number of collisions $\\ell(t)$ of the RTP with the boundary.\nFinally, we extend the theory by taking absorption to depend on the individual\noccupation times at the two ends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 15:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Particle filters are estimators\nconstructed by simulating trajectories from a sampling distribution and\naveraging them based on their importance weight. For particle filters to be\ncomputationally tractable, it must be feasible to simulate the trajectories by\ndrawing from the sampling distribution. Simultaneously, these trajectories need\nto reflect the reality of the nonlinear dynamical system so that the resulting\nestimators are accurate. Thus, the crux of particle filters lies in designing\nsampling distributions that are both easy to sample from and lead to accurate\nestimators. In this work, we propose to learn the sampling distributions. We\nput forward four methods for learning sampling distributions from observed\nmeasurements. Three of the methods are parametric methods in which we learn the\nmean and covariance matrix of a multivariate Gaussian distribution; each\nmethods exploits a different aspect of the data (generic, time structure, graph\nstructure). The fourth method is a nonparametric alternative in which we\ndirectly learn a transform of a uniform random variable.

His radial\nmethod was severely criticised by Newton and supporters, who preferred the\nrectilinear inertial frame, also claiming Leibniz failed to satisfy Newton's\nthird law of gravity. We show that these two approaches are equivalent if the\ncentral body is much larger than that in orbit. Furthermore we justify the\nLeibniz least action approach using the semi-latus rectum of the orbit,\ncharacteristic of the eccentricity to calculate the Newtonian centripetal\nacceleration opposed by the inertial acceleration, with the net radial\nacceleration controlling radius also allowing estimation of angular\ndisplacement and the action for each interval. Numerically, our Leibniz model\ncan be more accurate since it requires no assumption that linear vectors\nadequately simulate a curvilinear trajectory. Our review of the Newton\ngravitational equation using centre of mass coordinates concludes that the\nthird law is satisfied for symmetry if the gravitational and inertial masses\nare taken separately as equating force expressions for gravity and radial\ninertia, directed to the centre of mass for radial inertia. This symmetry\nvalidates centre of mass radial coordinates for more accurate plotting of\norbits including dual stars, possibly applicable for better understanding of\nEinstein relativity. An advantage of radial coordinates is that orbiting\ncouples can also accept perturbations from other nearby bodies acting\ncentripetally, but not inertially.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2023 11:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

An\nexperimental wave buoy was deployed alongside a commercial buoy. The inter-buoy\ncomparison showed that the experimental buoy measured wave heights and periods\naccurately; so the buoy data were used to study the predictability of a\nwave-ice model in this region. The first event we focused was when both buoys\nobserved a sudden decrease in significant wave heights $H_{m0}$. The sudden\ndecrease was caused by the change of wind directions from along the ice edge to\noff-ice wind. This event was compared with the ARC MFC wave-ice model product,\nwhich underestimated the $H_{m0}$. The inaccurate model representation of an\nice tongue located upwind of the buoys was found to constrain the available\nfetch for wave growth. The second case was when the buoys entered ice cover as\nnew ice formed; an on-ice wave event was observed and the buoy downwind\nmeasured 1.25 m $H_{m0}$. In this instance, the ARC MFC wave-ice model product\nlargely underestimated the downwind buoy $H_{m0}$. To investigate this event,\nmodel sea ice conditions were examined by comparing the ARC MFC sea ice forcing\nwith the neXtSIM sea ice model product. Our analysis revealed that the thin ice\nthickness distribution for ice types like young and grey ice, typically less\nthan 30 cm, were not resolved. The ARC MFC model's wave dissipation rate has a\nsea ice thickness dependence, and therefore, it overestimates wave dissipation\nin thin ice cover; sea ice forcing that can resolve the thin thickness\ndistribution is needed to improve the predictability.

Classical approaches to describe\nelectrochemical capacitance have difficulties to combine the treatment of the\nionic contribution of the electrolyte with the electronic contribution of the\nelectrode. Moreover, different approaches are typically required for the\ndescription of the double-layer capacitance, on the one hand, and the\npseudocapacitive contribution due to adsorption or intercalation of reactive\nspecies, on the other. In the present work, a new approach to describe\nelectrochemical capacitance from first principles is developed. The treatment\nof a general electrochemical system at the level of multicomponent\ndensity-functional theory (MCDFT) yields an exact analytical expression for the\ntotal capacitance of the system, which corresponds to a formal series-circuit\npartitioning into \"quantum\" capacitance contributions of the density of states\nof electrons and ions, the (mean-field) electrostatic capacitance, as well as\ncapacitance contributions of exchange and correlation among all active species.\nIt is shown that the classical expression of the double-layer capacitance\ninvolving the interfacial Galvani potential is obtained in the limit of\nextended electrode and electrolyte regions. Importantly, the present formalism\nalso describes systems with confined electrode and electrolyte phases, where\nthe definition of the (classical) inner potentials of the electrode and\nelectrolyte domains becomes problematic. Moreover, the new approach unifies the\ntreatment of double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance resulting from\nreactive processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2023 17:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-17"}

Motivated by this,\nin this work, we formulate a control constrained optimal control problem where\nwe aim to minimize time and also energy subjected to a quantum system\nsatisfying the bilinear Schrodinger equation. We derive the first order\noptimality conditions through the application of Pontryagin Maximum (minimum)\nPrinciple, which results in a boundary value problem. Next, in order to obtain\nefficient numerical results, we exploit a particular family of physics-informed\nneural networks that are specifically designed to tackle the indirect method\nbased on the Maximum Principle of Pontryagin. This method has not yet been\nstudied in the quantum context, but it can significantly speed up the process.\nTo this end, we first obtain a set of relations which finally let us compute\nthe optimal control strategy to determine the time- and energy-optimal protocol\ndriving a general initial state to a target state by a quantum Hamiltonian with\nbounded control.

To do so, we tested two different approaches to augment details to\ncompensate for missing pixel-wise annotations.
