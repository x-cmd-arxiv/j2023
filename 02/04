However, defense\nmethods have been designed only against specific attacks. This paper introduces\na general model of the spoofing attack framework in GNSS, from which optimal\nattack and defense strategies are derived. We consider a scenario with a\nlegitimate receiver (Bob) testing if the received signals come from multiple\nlegitimate space vehicles (Alice) or from an attack device (Eve). We first\nderive the optimal attack strategy against a Gaussian transmission from Alice,\nby minimizing an outer bound on the achievable error probability region of the\nspoofing detection test.

Creating morphing attacks is\ncommonly either performed on the image-level or on the representation-level.\nThe representation-level morphing has been performed so far based on generative\nadversarial networks (GAN) where the encoded images are interpolated in the\nlatent space to produce a morphed image based on the interpolated vector.

Recent advances in the diffusion autoencoder models have\novercome the GAN limitations, leading to high reconstruction fidelity. This\ntheoretically makes them a perfect candidate to perform representation-level\nface morphing. This work investigates using diffusion autoencoders to create\nface morphing attacks by comparing them to a wide range of image-level and\nrepresentation-level morphs.

To revisit VOS and make it more applicable in the real world, we\ncollect a new VOS dataset called coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSE) to\nstudy the tracking and segmenting objects in complex environments. MOSE\ncontains 2,149 video clips and 5,200 objects from 36 categories, with 431,725\nhigh-quality object segmentation masks.

Even labeling a few hundred documents with human subject-matter experts\nis a time-consuming process.

This paper\nproves that the collective behavior of number-oblivious individuals can even\nhave a critical numerosity, above and below which it qualitatively differs. We\nformalize the concept of critical numerosity in terms of a family of zero--one\nlaws and introduce a model of collective motion, called chain activation and\ntransport (CAT), that has one.\n  CAT describes the collective motion of $n \\geq 2$ individuals as a Markov\nchain that rearranges $n$-element subsets of the $d$-dimensional grid, $m < n$\nelements at a time. According to the individuals' dynamics, with each step, CAT\nremoves $m$ elements from the set and then progressively adds $m$ elements to\nthe boundary of what remains, in a way that favors the consecutive addition and\nremoval of nearby elements. This paper proves that, if $d \\geq 3$, then CAT has\na critical numerosity of $n_c = 2m+2$ with respect to the behavior of its\ndiameter. Specifically, if $n < n_c$, then the elements form one \"cluster,\" the\ndiameter of which has an a.s.--finite limit infimum. However, if $n \\geq n_c$,\nthen there is an a.s.--finite time at which the set consists of clusters of\nbetween $m+1$ and $2m+1$ elements, and forever after which these clusters grow\napart, resulting in unchecked diameter growth.\n  The existence of critical numerosities means that collectives can exhibit\n\"phase transitions\" that are governed purely by their numerosity and not, for\nexample, their density or the strength of their interactions. This fact\nchallenges prevalent beliefs about collective behavior and suggests new\nfunctionality for programmable matter. More broadly, it demonstrates an\nopportunity to explore the possible behaviors collectives through the study of\nrandom processes that rearrange sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 18:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-06"}

The results inform engineering decisions about well\nspacing. In this paper, we propose a new procedure for interpreting\ninterference tests. We fit the initial interference response with the solution\nto the 1D diffusivity equation at an offset observation point. It is\nadvantageous to use the initial interference response, rather than the\nsubsequent trend, because it is less affected by nonlinearities, time-varying\nboundary conditions, and uncertainties about flow geometry and regime. From the\ncurve fit, we estimate the hydraulic diffusivity and conductivity of the\nfractures connecting the wells. For engineering purposes, it would be useful to\nquantify the impact of interference on well production. Thus, we seek a\nrelationship between the degree of production interference (DPI) and an\nappropriate dimensionless quantity that can be derived from the estimate of\nfracture conductivity. Using simulations run under a wide range of conditions,\nwe find that the classical definition for dimensionless fracture conductivity\ndoes not achieve a consistent prediction of DPI. This occurs because the\ndimensionless fracture conductivity is derived assuming radial flow geometry,\nbut the dominant flow geometry during shale production is linear. We also find\nthat the CPG (Chow Pressure Group) metric does not yield consistently accurate\npredictions of DPI. As an alternative, we derive a dimensionless quantity\nsimilar to the classical dimensionless fracture conductivity, but derived for\nlinear, flow geometry. Using this approach, we calculate a dimensionless\ninterference length that collapses all cases onto a single curve that predicts\nDPI as a function of fracture conductivity, well spacing, and formation\nproperties.

When going beyond simplistic models such as party-list or\ndistrict-based elections, it is surprisingly challenging to capture\nproportionality formally. As a consequence, the literature has produced\nnumerous competing criteria of when a selected committee qualifies as\nproportional. Two of the most prominent notions are Dummett's proportionality\nfor solid coalitions (PSC) and Aziz et al.'s extended justified representation\n(EJR). Both guarantee proportional representation to groups of voters who have\nvery similar preferences; such groups are referred to as solid coalitions by\nDummett and as cohesive groups by Aziz et al. However, these notions lose their\nbite when groups are only almost solid or almost cohesive. In this paper, we\npropose proportionality axioms that are more robust: they guarantee\nrepresentation also to groups that do not qualify as solid or cohesive.\nFurther, our novel axioms can be easily verified: Given a committee, we can\ncheck in polynomial time whether it satisfies the axiom or not. This is in\ncontrast to many established notions like EJR, for which the corresponding\nverification problem is known to be intractable.\n  In the setting with approval preferences, we propose a robust and verifiable\nvariant of EJR and a simply greedy procedure to compute committees satisfying\nit. In the setting with ranked preferences, we propose a robust variant PSC,\nwhich can be efficiently verified even for general weak preferences.

Deep learning based state-of-the-art computer vision tasks, such\nas object segmentation and object detection, are computationally heavy\nalgorithms, requiring large memory and computing power. Many UAVs are using\n(pretrained) off-the-shelf versions of such algorithms. Offloading such\npower-hungry algorithms to a remote server could help UAVs save power\nsignificantly. However, deep learning based algorithms are susceptible to\nnoise, and a wireless communication system, by its nature, introduces noise to\nthe original signal. When the signal represents an image, noise affects the\nimage. There has not been much work studying the effect of the noise introduced\nby the communication system on pretrained deep networks. In this work, we first\nanalyze how reliable it is to offload deep learning based computer vision tasks\n(including both object segmentation and detection) by focusing on the effect of\nvarious parameters of a 5G wireless communication system on the transmitted\nimage and demonstrate how the introduced noise of the used 5G wireless\ncommunication system reduces the performance of the offloaded deep learning\ntask. Then solutions are introduced to eliminate (or reduce) the negative\neffect of the noise. The proposed framework starts with introducing many\nclassical techniques as alternative solutions first, and then introduces a\nnovel deep learning based solution to denoise the given noisy input image. The\nperformance of various denoising algorithms on offloading both object\nsegmentation and object detection tasks are compared. Our proposed deep\ntransformer-based denoiser algorithm (NR-Net) yields the state-of-the-art\nresults on reducing the negative effect of the noise in our experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2023 20:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

A general implicit approach to solving our equations is\ngiven using Cauchy characteristic curves giving necessary and sufficient\nconditions for existence and uniqueness of our solutions.

This paper presents Witscript, a novel joke\ngeneration system that can improvise original, contextually relevant jokes,\nsuch as humorous responses during a conversation. The system is based on joke\nwriting algorithms created by an expert comedy writer. Witscript employs\nwell-known tools of natural language processing to extract keywords from a\ntopic sentence and, using wordplay, to link those keywords and related words to\ncreate a punch line. Then a pretrained neural network language model that has\nbeen fine-tuned on a dataset of TV show monologue jokes is used to complete the\njoke response by filling the gap between the topic sentence and the punch line.\nA method of internal scoring filters out jokes that don't meet a preset\nstandard of quality.

This is in large part due to the paucity of diagnostics,\nparticularly at the lower-energy (deka-keV) range of non-thermal proton\ndistributions in flares. One means to identify the presence of deka-keV protons\nis by an effect originally described by \\cite{1976ApJ...208..618O}.

Although\ndetected in several regions of the ISM, its formation route is still debated\nand its abundance cannot be explained only by reactions in the gas phase. This\nwork explores a new gas-phase formation mechanism for glycolaldehyde and\ncompares the energy barrier reduction when the same route happens on the\nsurface of amorphous ices. The first step of the mechanism involves the\nformation of a carbon-carbon bond between formaldehyde (H2CO) and the formyl\nradical (HCO), with an energy barrier of 27 kJ mol-1 (gas-phase). The second\nstep consists of barrierless hydrogen addition. Density functional calculations\nunder periodic boundary conditions were applied to study this reaction path on\n10 different amorphous ice surfaces through an Eley-Rideal type mechanism. It\nwas found that the energy barrier is reduced on average by 49 per cent, leading\nin some cases to a 100 per cent reduction. The calculated adsorption energy of\nglycolaldehyde suggests that it can be promptly desorbed to the gas phase after\nits formation.

It\nis currently detected by applying heuristics to samples of DNS queries and\nresponses (probes) for specific destinations. These heuristics, however, are\nboth platform-specific and have been found to be brittle when censors change\ntheir blocking behavior, necessitating a more reliable automated process for\ndetecting censorship. In this paper, we explore how machine learning (ML)\nmodels can (1) help streamline the detection process, (2) improve the usability\nof large-scale datasets for censorship detection, and (3) discover new\ncensorship instances and blocking signatures missed by existing heuristic\nmethods. Our study shows that supervised models, trained using expert-derived\nlabels on instances of known anomalies and possible censorship, can learn the\ndetection heuristics employed by different measurement platforms. More\ncrucially, we find that unsupervised models, trained solely on uncensored\ninstances, can identify new instances and variations of censorship missed by\nexisting heuristics. Moreover, both methods demonstrate the capability to\nuncover a substantial number of new DNS blocking signatures, i.e., injected\nfake IP addresses overlooked by existing heuristics.

To make joint inferences of the function and its\nderivatives, a class of Gaussian processes called $p^{\\text{th}}$ order\nIntegrated Wiener's Process (IWP), is considered. Methods for constructing a\nfinite element (FEM) approximation of an IWP exist but have focused only on the\norder $p = 2$ case which does not allow appropriate inference for derivatives,\nand their computational feasibility relies on additional approximation to the\nFEM itself. In this article, we propose an alternative FEM approximation,\ncalled overlapping splines (O-spline), which pursues computational feasibility\ndirectly through the choice of test functions, and mirrors the construction of\nan IWP as the Ospline results from the multiple integrations of these same test\nfunctions. The O-spline approximation applies for any order $p \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}^+$, is computationally efficient and provides consistent inference\nfor all derivatives up to order $p-1$. It is shown both theoretically, and\nempirically through simulation, that the O-spline approximation converges to\nthe true IWP as the number of knots increases. We further provide a unified and\ninterpretable way to define priors for the smoothing parameter based on the\nnotion of predictive standard deviation (PSD), which is invariant to the order\n$p$ and the placement of the knot. Finally, we demonstrate the practical use of\nthe O-spline approximation through simulation studies and an analysis of COVID\ndeath rates where the inference is carried on both the function and its\nderivatives where the latter has an important interpretation in terms of the\ncourse of the pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 01:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

This paper explores stigma\ntoward PWUS using a data set of roughly 5,000 public Reddit posts.

To break the limit of time response speed of\nelectronic devices, such as charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary\nmetal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) detectors, ultrafast optical imaging\ntechniques usually convert the time information of a transient scene into the\nwavelength, angle, space or spatial frequency of the illumination light in\nprevious studies. In this work, we propose a novel polarization-resolved\nultrafast mapping photography (PUMP) technique by converting the time\ninformation into the polarization. Here, the spatiotemporal information of a\ndynamic scene is loaded into a rotationally polarized illumination laser pulse,\nand a polarization filtering in imaging detection and a deconvolution algorithm\nin image reconstruction are used to extract the original dynamic scene. In our\nPUMP system, the temporal resolution is 850 fs, the spatial resolution is 28.5\nlp/mm at 700 micrometer by 700 micrometer field of view, and the number of\nframes is 16. By using PUMP, a spatiotemporal dynamics of femtosecond laser\nablation in an indium tin oxide film on glass substrate is successfully\ncaptured.

Our analysis exploits the relation\nbetween this theory and the conformal anomaly action, which allows to uncover\nsome interesting features of the GB vertex at cubic and quartic level. If we\nintroduce a conformal decomposition of the metric, the resulting theory can be\nformulated in two different versions, which are regularization dependent, a\nlocal one which is quartic in the dilaton field, and a nonlocal one, with a\nquadratic dilaton.

A VCR model generally aims\nat answering a textual question regarding an image, followed by the rationale\nprediction for the preceding answering process. Though these two processes are\nsequential and intertwined, existing methods always consider them as two\nindependent matching-based instances. They, therefore, ignore the pivotal\nrelationship between the two processes, leading to sub-optimal model\nperformance. This paper presents a novel visual attention alignment method to\nefficaciously handle these two processes in a unified framework. To achieve\nthis, we first design a re-attention module for aggregating the vision\nattention map produced in each process. Thereafter, the resultant two sets of\nattention maps are carefully aligned to guide the two processes to make\ndecisions based on the same image regions. We apply this method to both\nconventional attention and the recent Transformer models and carry out\nextensive experiments on the VCR benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate\nthat with the attention alignment module, our method achieves a considerable\nimprovement over the baseline methods, evidently revealing the feasibility of\nthe coupling of the two processes as well as the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 07:02:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 06:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-21"}

Due to this, it remains\nunclear how these prototypes will perform in real-world environments. In this\npaper, we present the Practical View-Change-Less Protocol PVP, a\nhigh-throughput, simple, and reliable consensus protocol. Central to PVP is the\ncombination of (1) a chained consensus design for replicating requests with a\nreduced message cost; (2) the novel Rapid View Synchronization protocol that\nenables robust and low-cost failure recovery; and (3) a high-performance\nconcurrent consensus architecture in which independent instances of the chained\nconsensus operate concurrently to process requests with high throughput and\nwithout single-replica bottlenecks. Due to the concurrent consensus\narchitecture, PVP greatly outperforms traditional primary-backup consensus\nprotocols such as PBFT (by up to 430%), Narwhal (by up to 296%), and HotStuff\n(by up to 3803%). Due to its reduced message cost, PVP is even able to\noutperform RCC, a state-of-the-art high-throughput concurrent consensus\nprotocol, by up to 23%.

There are coherence\nrelationships among adjacent images because they often describe same entities\nor events. These relationships are important for entity-aware multi-image\ncaptioning, but are neglected in entity-aware single-image captioning. Most\nexisting work focuses on single-image captioning, while multi-image captioning\nhas not been explored before. Hence, this paper proposes a coherent\nentity-aware multi-image captioning model by making use of coherence\nrelationships. The model consists of a Transformer-based caption generation\nmodel and two types of contrastive learning-based coherence mechanisms. The\ngeneration model generates the caption by paying attention to the image and the\naccompanying text. The horizontal coherence mechanism aims to the make the\ncaption coherent with captions of adjacent images. The vertical coherence\nmechanism aims to make the caption coherent with the image and the accompanying\ntext. To evaluate coherence between captions, two coherence evaluation metrics\nare proposed. The new dataset DM800K is constructed that has more images per\ndocument than two existing datasets GoodNews and NYT800K, and are more suitable\nfor multi-image captioning. Experiments on three datasets show the proposed\ncaptioning model outperforms 6 baselines according to single-image captioning\nevaluations, and the generated captions are more coherent than that of\nbaselines according to coherence evaluations and human evaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 07:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Hence, accurate material movement demands a\ngood knowledge of the excavation process and the buckets interaction with the\nenvironment.

The large amount of such\ndisturbances causes information loss that reduces the statistical power and\nbiases estimates, leading to increased uncertainty in the production.

A particular way for combining these approaches\nwithin a framework called vector symbolic architectures leads to neural\nautomata. An interesting research direction we have pursued under this\nframework has been to consider mapping symbolic dynamics onto neurodynamics,\nrepresented as neural automata. This representation theory, enables us to ask\nquestions, such as, how does the brain implement Turing computations.\nSpecifically, in this representation theory, neural automata result from the\nassignment of symbols and symbol strings to numbers, known as G\\\"odel encoding.\nUnder this assignment symbolic computation becomes represented by trajectories\nof state vectors in a real phase space, that allows for statistical correlation\nanalyses with real-world measurements and experimental data. However, these\nassignments are usually completely arbitrary. Hence, it makes sense to address\nthe problem question of, which aspects of the dynamics observed under such a\nrepresentation is intrinsic to the dynamics and which are not. In this study,\nwe develop a formally rigorous mathematical framework for the investigation of\nsymmetries and invariants of neural automata under different encodings. As a\ncentral concept we define patterns of equality for such systems.

To address this\nissue, we propose a novel model called Contrastive Collaborative Filtering for\nCold-start item Recommendation (CCFCRec), which capitalizes on the\nco-occurrence collaborative signals in warm training data to alleviate the\nissue of blurry collaborative embeddings for cold-start item recommendation. In\nparticular, we devise a contrastive collaborative filtering (CF) framework,\nconsisting of a content CF module and a co-occurrence CF module to generate the\ncontent-based collaborative embedding and the co-occurrence collaborative\nembedding for a training item, respectively.

Solving such an ill-posed problem generally requires to explore\nintrinsic prior structures underlying tensor data, and formulate them as\ncertain forms of regularization terms for guiding a sound estimate of the\nrestored tensor. Recent research have made significant progress by adopting two\ninsightful tensor priors, i.e., global low-rankness (L) and local smoothness\n(S) across different tensor modes, which are always encoded as a sum of two\nseparate regularization terms into the recovery models. However, unlike the\nprimary theoretical developments on low-rank tensor recovery, these joint L+S\nmodels have no theoretical exact-recovery guarantees yet, making the methods\nlack reliability in real practice. To this crucial issue, in this work, we\nbuild a unique regularization term, which essentially encodes both L and S\npriors of a tensor simultaneously. Especially, by equipping this single\nregularizer into the recovery models, we can rigorously prove the exact\nrecovery guarantees for two typical tensor recovery tasks, i.e., tensor\ncompletion (TC) and tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA). To the\nbest of our knowledge, this should be the first exact-recovery results among\nall related L+S methods for tensor recovery. Significant recovery accuracy\nimprovements over many other SOTA methods in several TC and TRPCA tasks with\nvarious kinds of visual tensor data are observed in extensive experiments.\nTypically, our method achieves a workable performance when the missing rate is\nextremely large, e.g., 99.5%, for the color image inpainting task, while all\nits peers totally fail in such challenging case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 12:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Unlike autonomous vehicle systems, roadside sensors are usually\naffiliated with different subsystems and lack synchronization both in time and\nspace. Calibration is a key technology which allows the central server to fuse\nthe data generated by different location infrastructures, which can deliver\nimprove the sensing range and detection robustness. Unfortunately, existing\ncalibration algorithms often assume that the LiDARs are significantly\noverlapped or that the temporal calibration is already achieved. Since these\nassumptions do not always hold in the real world, the calibration results from\nthe existing algorithms are often unsatisfactory and always need human\ninvolvement, which brings high labor costs. In this paper, we propose TrajMatch\n-- the first system that can automatically calibrate for roadside LiDARs in\nboth time and space.

Finally, to\nevaluate the performance of TrajMatch , we collect two dataset, one simulated\ndataset LiDARnet-sim 1.0 and a real-world dataset.

To improve the efficiency of engineering computations, a novel\napproximate static reanalysis method based on system reduction and iterative\nsolution is proposed for statically indeterminate structures with high-rank\nmodification. In this approach, a statically indeterminate structure is divided\ninto the basis system and the additional components. Subsequently, the\nstructural equilibrium equations are rewritten as the equation system with the\nstiffness matrix of the basis system and the pseudo forces derived from the\nadditional elements. With the introduction of spectral decomposition, a reduced\nequation system with the element forces of the additional elements as the\nunknowns is established. Then, the approximate solutions of the modified\nstructure can be obtained by solving the reduced equation system through a\npre-conditioned iterative solution algorithm. The computational costs of the\nproposed method and the other two reanalysis methods are compared and numerical\nexamples including static reanalysis and static nonlinear analysis are\npresented. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has excellent\ncomputational performance for both the structures with homogeneous material and\nstructures composed of functionally graded beams.

Despite the advance of CNNs in image\ndemoireing, existing networks are with heavy design, causing redundant\ncomputation burden for mobile devices. In this paper, we launch the first study\non accelerating demoireing networks and propose a dynamic demoireing\nacceleration method (DDA) towards a real-time deployment on mobile devices. Our\nstimulus stems from a simple-yet-universal fact that moire patterns often\nunbalancedly distribute across an image. Consequently, excessive computation is\nwasted upon non-moire areas. Therefore, we reallocate computation costs in\nproportion to the complexity of image patches. In order to achieve this aim, we\nmeasure the complexity of an image patch by designing a novel moire prior that\nconsiders both colorfulness and frequency information of moire patterns. Then,\nwe restore image patches with higher-complexity using larger networks and the\nones with lower-complexity are assigned with smaller networks to relieve the\ncomputation burden. At last, we train all networks in a parameter-shared\nsupernet paradigm to avoid additional parameter burden. Extensive experiments\non several benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed DDA. In\naddition, the acceleration evaluated on the VIVO X80 Pro smartphone equipped\nwith a chip of Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 shows that our method can drastically reduce\nthe inference time, leading to a real-time image demoireing on mobile devices.\nSource codes and models are released at https://github.com/zyxxmu/DDA\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 15:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach to adaptively control\ntraffic lights based on the real-time traffic situation in a road network.\nHowever, conventional methods may suffer from poor scalability.

This allows it to classify similar samples close to\neach other in the latent space's distribution. VAEs classically assume the\nlatent space is normally distributed, though many distribution priors work, and\nthey encode this assumption through a K-L divergence term in the loss function.\nWhile VAEs learn the distribution of the latent space and naturally make each\ndimension in the latent space as disjoint from the others as possible, they do\nnot group together similar features -- the image space feature represented by\none unit of the representation layer does not necessarily have high correlation\nwith the feature represented by a neighboring unit of the representation layer.\nThis makes it difficult to interpret VAEs since the representation layer is not\nstructured in a way that is easy for humans to parse. We aim to make a more\ninterpretable VAE by partitioning the representation layer into disjoint sets\nof units. Partitioning the representation layer into disjoint sets of\ninterconnected units yields a prior that features of the input space to this\nnew VAE, which we call a partition VAE or PVAE, are grouped together by\ncorrelation -- for example, if our image space were the space of all ping ping\ngame images (a somewhat complex image space we use to test our architecture)\nthen we would hope the partitions in the representation layer each learned some\nlarge feature of the image like the characteristics of the ping pong table or\nthe characteristics and position of the players or the ball. We also add to the\nPVAE a cost-saving measure: subresolution. Because we do not have access to GPU\ntraining environments for long periods of time and Google Colab Pro costs\nmoney, we attempt to decrease the complexity of the PVAE by outputting an image\nwith dimensions scaled down from the input image by a constant factor, thus\nforcing the model to output a smaller version of the image. We then increase\nthe resolution to calculate loss and train by interpolating through neighboring\npixels. We train a tuned PVAE on MNIST and Sports10 to test its effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 05:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

BNNs convert\nCNN model parameters to 1-bit precision, allowing inference of BNNs to be\nprocessed with simple XNOR and bitcount operations. This makes BNNs amenable to\nhardware acceleration. Several photonic integrated circuits (PICs) based BNN\naccelerators have been proposed. Although these accelerators provide remarkably\nhigher throughput and energy efficiency than their electronic counterparts, the\nutilized XNOR and bitcount circuits in these accelerators need to be further\nenhanced to improve their area, energy efficiency, and throughput. This paper\naims to fulfill this need. For that, we invent a single-MRR-based optical XNOR\ngate (OXG). Moreover, we present a novel design of bitcount circuit which we\nrefer to as Photo-Charge Accumulator (PCA). We employ multiple OXGs in a\ncascaded manner using dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) and connect\nthem to the PCA, to forge a novel Optical XNOR-Bitcount based Binary Neural\nNetwork Accelerator (OXBNN). Our evaluation for the inference of four modern\nBNNs indicates that OXBNN provides improvements of up to 62x and 7.6x in\nframes-per-second (FPS) and FPS/W (energy efficiency), respectively, on\ngeometric mean over two PIC-based BNN accelerators from prior work.

Such shared protocol, induced in a self-supervised way, can to some\nextent be used to communicate about previously unseen object categories, as\nwell as to make more granular distinctions compared to the categories taught to\nthe original networks. Contradicting a common view in multi-agent emergent\ncommunication research, we find that imposing a discrete bottleneck on\ncommunication hampers the emergence of a general code.

It is\nrooted in ensemble theory. By ensemble theory, the variation of the system's\nmicroscopic state is indicated by the moving of the phase point, and the moving\ntrajectory is believed continuous. Thus, the ensemble density is thought to be\na smooth function, and it observes continuity equation. When the Hamiltonian\ncanonical equations of the molecules are applied to the continuity equation,\nLiouville equation can be obtained. We carefully analyze a gas composed of a\ngreat number of molecules colliding with each other. The defects in deriving\nLiouville equation are found. Due to collision, molecules' momenta changes\ndiscontinuously, so that the trajectories of the phase points are actually not\ncontinuous. In statistical mechanics, infinitesimals in physics and in\nmathematics should be distinguished. In continuity equation that the ensemble\ndensity satisfies, the derivatives with respect to space and time should be\nphysical infinitesimals, while in Hamiltonian canonical equations that every\nmolecule follows, the derivatives take infinitesimals in mathematics. In the\ncourse of deriving Liouville equation, the infinitesimals in physics are\nunknowingly replaced by those in mathematics.

The network is\nshowcased on the Lorenz-96 model, a prototypical chaotic dynamical system, for\na varying number of variables to reconstruct. First, we show the PI-LSTM\narchitecture and explain how to constrain the differential equations, which is\na non-trivial task in LSTMs. Second, the PI-LSTM is numerically evaluated in\nthe long-term autonomous evolution to study its ergodic properties. We show\nthat it correctly predicts the statistics of the unmeasured variables, which\ncannot be achieved without the physical constraint.

In particular, an MIMO system is considered in which edge\ndevices transmit their local FL models (trained using their locally collected\ndata) to a parameter server (PS) using beamforming to maximize the number of\ndevices scheduled for transmission. The PS, acting as a central controller,\ngenerates a global FL model using the received local FL models and broadcasts\nit back to all devices. Due to the limited bandwidth in a wireless network,\nAirComp is adopted to enable efficient wireless data aggregation. However,\nfading of wireless channels can produce aggregate distortions in an\nAirComp-based FL scheme. To tackle this challenge, we propose a modified\nfederated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm that combines digital modulation with\nAirComp to mitigate wireless fading while ensuring the communication\nefficiency. This is achieved by a joint transmit and receive beamforming\ndesign, which is formulated as a optimization problem to dynamically adjust the\nbeamforming matrices based on current FL model parameters so as to minimize the\ntransmitting error and ensure the FL performance. To achieve this goal, we\nfirst analytically characterize how the beamforming matrices affect the\nperformance of the FedAvg in different iterations. Based on this relationship,\nan artificial neural network (ANN) is used to estimate the local FL models of\nall devices and adjust the beamforming matrices at the PS for future model\ntransmission. The algorithmic advantages and improved performance of the\nproposed methodologies are demonstrated through extensive numerical\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2023 07:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}
