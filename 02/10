However, most of today's ML/DL approaches are based on supervised\nlearning techniques, meaning that they need to be trained using a large amount\nof task-specific labelled training data. This constraint poses an enormous\nchallenge to RE researchers, as the lack of labelled data makes it difficult\nfor them to fully exploit the benefit of advanced ML/DL technologies.\nObjective: This paper addresses this problem by showing how a zero-shot\nlearning approach can be used for requirements classification without using any\nlabelled training data. We focus on the classification task because many RE\ntasks can be framed as classification problems. Method: The ZSL approach used\nin our study employs contextual word-embeddings and transformer-based language\nmodels. We demonstrate this approach through a series of experiments to perform\nthree classification tasks: (1)FR/NFR: classification functional requirements\nvs non-functional requirements; (2)NFR: identification of NFR classes;\n(3)Security: classification of security vs non-security requirements. Results:\nThe study shows that the ZSL approach achieves an F1 score of 0.66 for the\nFR/NFR task. For the NFR task, the approach yields F1~0.72-0.80, considering\nthe most frequent classes. For the Security task, F1~0.66. All of the\naforementioned F1 scores are achieved with zero-training efforts. Conclusion:\nThis study demonstrates the potential of ZSL for requirements classification.\nAn important implication is that it is possible to have very little or no\ntraining data to perform classification tasks. The proposed approach thus\ncontributes to the solution of the long-standing problem of data shortage in\nRE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 16:05:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 21:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-17"}

This scalability\nissue is due to the use of consensus algorithms to guarantee the total order of\nthe chain of blocks and of the transactions within each block. However, total\norder is often not fully necessary, since important advanced applications of\nsmart-contracts do not require a total order among all operations. A much\nhigher scalability can potentially be achieved if a more relaxed order can be\nexploited. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed concurrent data type,\ncalled Setchain, which improves scalability significantly. A Setchain\nimplements a grow-only set whose elements are not ordered, unlike conventional\nblockchain operations. When convenient, the Setchain allows forcing a\nsynchronization barrier that assigns permanently an epoch number to a subset of\nthe latest elements added, agreed by consensus. Therefore, two operations in\nthe same epoch are not ordered, while two operations in different epochs are\nordered by their respective epoch number. We present different\nByzantine-tolerant implementations of Setchain, prove their correctness and\nreport on an empirical evaluation of a prototype implementation. Our results\nshow that Setchain is orders of magnitude faster than consensus-based ledgers,\nsince it implements grow-only sets with epoch synchronization instead of total\norder. Since Setchain barriers can be synchronized with the underlying\nblockchain, Setchain objects can be used as a sidechain to implement many\ndecentralized solutions with much faster operations than direct implementations\non top of blockchains. Finally, we also present an algorithm that encompasses\nin a single process the combined behavior of Byzantine servers, which\nsimplifies correctness proofs by encoding the general attacker in a concrete\nimplementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 16:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

Laves phases such as CaMg$_2$ (C14), Ca(Al,Mg)$_2$\n(C36), and CaAl2 (C15) have high melting points, high hardness at room and\nelevated temperatures, but unfortunately are inherently brittle. Mg-Al-Ca\nalloys thus have good creep properties but limited ductility. An understanding\nof the co-deformation behaviour of $\\alpha$-Mg and Laves phases is essential\nfor optimising the strength-ductility balance of these alloys. Here, we study\nthe mechanical behaviour of a Mg-4.65Al-2.82Ca alloy using micropillar\ncompression in the $\\alpha$-Mg matrix, at $\\alpha$-Mg/C36 and $\\alpha$-Mg/C15\ninterfaces and in the C15 phase in combination with scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SE imaging), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), transmission\nKikuchi diffraction (TKD), and low-kV scanning transmission electron microscopy\n(STEM). We show that both, C15 and C36, Laves phases provide considerable\nstrengthening to the $\\alpha$-Mg matrix by delaying the onset of basal slip and\nextension twinning, while only the C36 phase appears to allow a certain extent\nof slip transfer/ plastic co-deformation, in spite of its greater anisotropy\ncompared with the cubic C15 phase. We therefore conclude based on these results\nthat strengthening of the $\\alpha$-Mg matrix by the C36 Laves phase is\npreferable given that it combines easy skeleton formation with some\nco-deformation and considerable stability at common application temperatures of\nmagnesium alloys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 16:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

While\ncandidate triplet superconductors are rare, one especially promising material\nis the heavy fermion paramagnet uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$), which has\nrecently been found to exhibit numerous characteristics of an unconventional\nspin-triplet pairing state. To date, efforts to understand the microscopic\ndetails of superconductivity in UTe$_2$ have been severely impeded by\nuncertainty regarding the underlying electronic structure. Here, we directly\nprobe the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ by measuring magnetic quantum oscillations\nin ultra-pure crystals, as evidenced by their high superconducting transition\ntemperature $T_\\text{c} \\approx$ 2.1 K and residual resistivity ratio (RRR)\n$\\approx$ 900. We find an angular profile of quantum oscillatory frequency and\namplitude that is characteristic of a quasi-2D Fermi surface, exhibiting heavy\neffective masses up to 78(2) $m_e$ owing to strong correlations. We performed\nFermi surface simulations guided by these data, yielding excellent\ncorrespondence between quantum oscillation measurements and our resultant Fermi\nsurface model, which consists of two cylindrical sections of electron- and\nhole-type respectively. A comparison between the density of states at the Fermi\nlevel inferred from the quantum oscillations, and the normal state Sommerfeld\ncoefficient obtained from specific heat measurements, gives excellent agreement\nwith our Fermi surface model. Additionally, we find that both cylindrical Fermi\nsheets possess negligible corrugation, which may allow for their near-nesting\nand therefore promote magnetic fluctuations that enhance the triplet pairing\nmechanism.

Quarkyonic matter is composed of a shell of nucleons that\nunder-occupy the total available phase space associated with the underlying\nquark degrees of freedom.

[Question/problem] A common technique for detecting\nincompleteness in requirements is checking the requirements against external\nsources. With the emergence of language models such as BERT, an interesting\nquestion is whether language models are useful external sources for finding\npotential incompleteness in requirements. [Principal ideas/results] We mask\nwords in requirements and have BERT's masked language model (MLM) generate\ncontextualized predictions for filling the masked slots. We simulate\nincompleteness by withholding content from requirements and measure BERT's\nability to predict terminology that is present in the withheld content but\nabsent in the content disclosed to BERT. [Contribution] BERT can be configured\nto generate multiple predictions per mask. Our first contribution is to\ndetermine how many predictions per mask is an optimal trade-off between\neffectively discovering omissions in requirements and the level of noise in the\npredictions. Our second contribution is devising a machine learning-based\nfilter that post-processes predictions made by BERT to further reduce noise. We\nempirically evaluate our solution over 40 requirements specifications drawn\nfrom the PURE dataset [1]. Our results indicate that: (1) predictions made by\nBERT are highly effective at pinpointing terminology that is missing from\nrequirements, and (2) our filter can substantially reduce noise from the\npredictions, thus making BERT a more compelling aid for improving completeness\nin requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 17:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

In this work, we propose improving the data efficiency\nand generalisation capabilities of MuZero by explicitly incorporating the\nsymmetries of the environment in its world-model architecture.

However, too many notifications can be disruptive\nfor users. A typical mobile app usually has several types of notification,\nmanaged by distinct teams with objectives that are possibly conflicting with\neach other, or even with the overall platform objective. Therefore, there is a\nneed for careful curation of notifications sent to users of these different\ntypes. In this work, we study a novel centralized approach for notification\noptimization, where we view the opportunities to send user notifications as\nitems and types of notifications as buyers in an auction market. Furthermore,\nthe auction setup is unique, and the platform has the ability to subsidize the\nbids from the notification types.\n  Using tools from fair division, we study the application of competitive\nequilibrium for addressing this problem. We show that an Eisenberg-Gale-style\nconvex program allows us to find an allocation that is fair to all notification\ntypes in hindsight. Using the dual of the formulation, we present an online\nalgorithm that allocates notifications via first-price auctions using a\npacing-multiplier approach. Secondly, we introduce an approach based on\nsecond-price auctions and pacing, which has the benefit of working well with\nexisting advertising systems built for second-price auctions.\n  Through an A/B test in production, we show that the second price-based\nauction system improves over a decentralized notification optimization system,\nleading to its launch in production for some Instagram notifications. Further,\nthrough simulations on Instagram notification data and a subsequent production\nA/B test, we compare the outcomes of first-price and second-price auctions and\nshow that the former has more stable pacing multipliers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 18:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

In offsite-tuning, the model owner sends a\nlight-weight adapter and a lossy compressed emulator to the data owner, who\nthen fine-tunes the adapter on the downstream data with the emulator's\nassistance. The fine-tuned adapter is then returned to the model owner, who\nplugs it into the full model to create an adapted foundation model.\nOffsite-tuning preserves both parties' privacy and is computationally more\nefficient than the existing fine-tuning methods that require access to the full\nmodel weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of offsite-tuning on various\nlarge language and vision foundation models. Offsite-tuning can achieve\ncomparable accuracy as full model fine-tuning while being privacy-preserving\nand efficient, achieving 6.5x speedup and 5.6x memory reduction.

Here we report the serendipitous discovery of an\nextremely narrow linear feature in HST/ACS images that may be an example of\nsuch a wake. The feature extends 62 kpc from the nucleus of a compact\nstar-forming galaxy at z=0.964. Keck LRIS spectra show that the [OIII]/H$\\beta$\nratio varies from ~1 to ~10 along the feature, indicating a mixture of star\nformation and fast shocks. The feature terminates in a bright [OIII] knot with\na luminosity of 1.9x10$^{41}$ ergs/s. The stellar continuum colors vary along\nthe feature, and are well-fit by a simple model that has a monotonically\nincreasing age with distance from the tip. The line ratios, colors, and the\noverall morphology are consistent with an ejected SMBH moving through the CGM\nat high speed while triggering star formation. The best-fit time since ejection\nis ~39 Myr and the implied velocity is v~1600 km/s. The feature is not\nperfectly straight in the HST images, and we show that the amplitude of the\nobserved spatial variations is consistent with the runaway SMBH interpretation.\nOpposite the primary wake is a fainter and shorter feature, marginally detected\nin [OIII] and the rest-frame far-ultraviolet. This feature may be shocked gas\nbehind a binary SMBH that was ejected at the same time as the SMBH that\nproduced the primary wake.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

Candidate edge-on protoplanetary disks\nare typically identified via their unique spectral energy distribution and\nsubsequently confirmed through high-resolution imaging. However, this selection\nprocess is likely biased toward the largest, most massive disks, and the\nresulting sample may not accurately represent the underlying disk population.\nTo investigate this, we generated a grid of protoplanetary disk models using\nradiative transfer simulations and determined which sets of disk parameters\nproduce edge-on systems that could be recovered by aforementioned detection\ntechniques--i.e., identified by their spectral energy distribution and\nconfirmed through follow-up imaging with HST. In doing so, we adopt a\nquantitative working definition of \"edge-on disks\" that is observation-driven\nand agnostic about the disk inclination or other properties.

To\ninterpret the ALMA observations, we used radiative transfer modeling to\ndetermine the disk properties. We find that the disk is well resolved and\nnearly edge on. While the misalignment angle between the disk and the orbit is\nweakly constrained due to the short orbital arc available, the data strongly\nsupport a (near) coplanar geometry for the system. Furthermore, we find that\nthe models that describe the ALMA data best have an inner radius that is close\nto the companion's semi-major axis. Including a posteriori knowledge of the\nsystem's SED further narrows the constraints on the disk's inner radius and\nplace it at a location that is in reasonable agreement with, possibly interior\nto, predictions from existing dynamical models of disk truncation by an\ninterior substellar companion.

We explain how chaotic outflows may arise by constructing a map for\nthe wind mass-loss rate as a function of time. The map is built on three\nstatements: (1) The wind mass-loss rate scales in proportion to the surface\nequilibrium vapor pressure, rising exponentially with ground temperature. (2)\nBecause the wind takes a finite time to escape the planet's gravity well, the\nsurface mass-loss rate at any time determines the wind optical depth at a later\ntime -- the atmosphere has hysteresis.

Statement (3) follows from how dust condenses in the face of\nintense stellar irradiation. As discussed recently, condensates initially naked\nbefore the star must be silicate-rich and iron-poor, staying cool enough for\ncondensation by absorbing weakly in the visible and emitting strongly in the\ninfrared.

Governance follows as well a hierarchical structure, breaking the\nterritory into smaller units for its management. The possible mismatch between\nthese two organisations may lead to a range of problems, ranging from\ninefficiencies to insufficient and uneven distribution of resources. This paper\nseeks to develop a methodology to explore and quantify the correspondence\nbetween the hierarchical organisation given by the structure of governance and\nthat given by the structure of the urban systems being governed, where Chile is\nused as case study. The urban hierarchical structure is defined according to\nthe connectivity of the system given by the road network. This is extracted\nthrough a clustering algorithm defined as a percolation process on the street\nnetwork, giving rise to urban clusters at different scales. These are then\ncompared to the spatial scales of the administrative system. This is achieved\nby computing cophenetic distance on the dendrograms, by looking at the\ndifferent clustering membership using Jaccard similarity, and by analysing the\ntopological diversity defined as the structural entropy. The results show that\nthe urban sub-national structures present high heterogeneity, while the\nadministrative system is highly homogeneous, replicating the same structure of\norganisation across the national territory. Such contrasting organisational\nstructures present administrative challenges that can give rise to poor\ndecision-making processes and mismanagement, impairing the efficient\nfunctioning of systems. Our results can help address these challenges,\ninforming how to rebalance such mismatches through planning and political\nstrategies that consider the complex interdependencies of territories across\nscales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 19:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

In this work, we present the validation of the candidate\nplanet AU Mic d. We add 18 new transits and nine midpoint times in an updated\nTTV analysis to prior work. We perform the joint modeling of transit light\ncurves using EXOFASTv2 and extract the transit midpoint times. Next, we\nconstruct an O-C diagram and use Exo-Striker to model the TTVs. We generate TTV\nlog-likelihood periodograms to explore possible solutions for the period of\nplanet d and then follow those up with detailed TTV and RV MCMC modeling and\nstability tests. We find several candidate periods for AU Mic d, all of which\nare near resonances with AU Mic b and c of varying order. Based on our model\ncomparisons, the most-favored orbital period of AU Mic d is 12.73812+/-0.00128\ndays (T_{C,d}=2458333.32110+/-0.35836 BJD), which puts the three planets near a\n4:6:9 mean-motion orbital resonance. The mass for d is M_d=1.013+/-0.146 M_E,\nmaking this planet Earth-like in mass. The presence of orbital resonances in a\nvery young system implies that compact planetary systems can develop resonant\nchains very early on, which can quickly establish the stability of the systems.\nAdditional TTV observation of the AU Mic system are needed to further constrain\nthe planetary masses, search for possible transits of AU Mic d, and detect\npossible additional planets beyond AU Mic c.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 20:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

We demonstrate this\nissue by using two examples -- the generalized black-to-white hole bounce with\nmass difference and the Schwarzschild-to-de Sitter transition. The goal is to\nconstruct the corresponding Penrose diagrams without any explicit or implicit\nillness at the thin shell. To accomplish this, we find that two coordinate\ntransformations are required unless a special condition is met. The first\ntransformation serves as the removal of the unwanted area while the second one\nreconciles the two different coordinate systems on two sides of the shell by\nremoving an implicit discontinuity in the Penrose diagram of this type.\nHowever, the second transformation brings a different kind of coordinate\nsingularity back to the event horizon. This coordinate singularity either\ncreates a degeneracy such that all four-vectors are in 45$\\degree$, or a\ndegeneracy such that timelike vectors are parallel to the event horizon in the\nresulting Penrose diagram.

A common approach to strategy exploration, represented by the double\noracle algorithm, is to add strategies that best-respond to a current\nequilibrium. This approach may suffer from overfitting and other limitations,\nleading the developers of the policy-space response oracle (PSRO) framework for\niterative EGTA to generalize the target of best response, employing what they\nterm meta-strategy solvers (MSSs).

We assume that the resource cost incurred by an agent formed by joining\ntwo modules is the same as that of a single module. Such a cost formulation\nsimplistically models the benefits of joining two modules, such as passenger\nredistribution between the modules, less traffic congestion, and higher fuel\nefficiency. To find an optimal plan, we propose a heuristic algorithm that uses\nthe notion of graph centrality to determine when and where to join the modules.\nAdditionally, we use the nearest neighbor approach to estimate the cost routing\nfor joined or separated modules.

In these magnets, High Temperature Superconducting (HTS)\nmaterials are used in the high field part of the coil with so-called insert\ncoils, and Low Temperature Superconductors (LTS) like Nb3Sn and Nb-Ti\nsuperconductors are used in the lower field region with so-called outsert\ncoils. The attractiveness of the hybrid option lays on the fact that, on the\none hand, the 20 T field level is beyond the Nb3Sn practical limits of 15-16 T\nfor accelerator magnets and can be achieved only via HTS materials; on the\nother hand, the high cost of HTS superconductors compared to LTS\nsuperconductors makes it advantageous exploring a hybrid approach, where the\nHTS portion of the coil is minimized. We present in this paper an overview of\ndifferent design options aimed at generating 20 T field in a 50 mm clear\naperture. The coil layouts investigated include the Cos-theta design (CT), with\nits variations to reduce the conductor peak stress, namely the Canted Cos-theta\ndesign (CCT) and the Stress Management Cos-theta design (SMCT), and, in\naddition, the Block-type design (BL) including a form of stress management and\nthe Common-Coil design (CC).

However, the choice of the\ncoordinate system in which to search for it is far from unambiguous.

Specifically, we propose to use neural\nnetworks in numerical shape optimization to parameterize geometries. Geometry\nparameterization is crucial in enabling efficient shape optimization as it\nallows for optimizing complex shapes using only a few design variables. Recent\napproaches often utilize CAD data in conjunction with spline-based methods\nwhere the spline's control points serve as design variables. Consequently,\nthese approaches rely on the same design variables as specified by the human\ndesigner. While this choice is convenient, it either restricts the design to\nsmall modifications of given, initial design features - effectively prohibiting\ntopological changes - or yields undesirably many design variables. In this\nwork, we step away from CAD and spline-based approaches and construct an\nartificial, feature-dense yet low-dimensional optimization space using a\ngenerative neural network. Using the neural network for the geometry\nparameterization extends state-of-the-art methods in that the resulting design\nspace is not restricted to user-prescribed modifications of certain basis\nshapes. Instead, within the same optimization space, we can interpolate between\nand explore seemingly unrelated designs.

By\nmodelling the distribution of observed cluster mass for a given true mass to be\nlog-normal and adopting a selection threshold in the observed mass $M_{200m}\n\\geq 0.836 \\times 10^{14} h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$, we find about $4.1 \\times 10^{5}$\nclusters in the redshift range $0 \\leq z \\leq 1.5$ can be detected by the CSST.\nWe construct the Fisher matrix for the cluster number counts from CSST, and\nforecast constraints on dark energy parameters for models with constant\n($w_0$CDM) and time dependent ($w_0w_a$CDM) equation of state. In the\nself-calibration scheme, the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ of\n$w_0$CDM model can be constrained to $\\Delta w_0 = 0.036$. If $w_a$ is added as\na free parameter, we obtain $\\Delta w_0 = 0.077$ and $\\Delta w_a = 0.39$ for\nthe $w_0w_a$CDM model, with a Figure of Merit for ($w_0,w_a$) to be 68.99.\nShould we had perfect knowledge of the observable-mass scaling relation\n(``known SR\" scheme), we would obtain $\\Delta w_0 = 0.012$ for $w_0$CDM model,\n$\\Delta w_0 = 0.062$ and $\\Delta w_a = 0.24$ for $w_0w_a$CDM model. The dark\nenergy Figure of Merit of ($w_0,w_a$) increases to 343.25. By extending the\nmaximum redshift of the clusters from $z_{max} \\sim 1.5$ to $z_{max} \\sim 2$,\nthe dark energy Figure of Merit for ($w_0,w_a$) increases to 89.72\n(self-calibration scheme) and 610.97 (``known SR\" scheme), improved by a factor\nof $\\sim 1.30$ and $\\sim 1.78$, respectively.

To solve the\nproblem of fusion ghosting in the stitched image, seam-driven methods avoid the\nmisalignment area to fuse images by predicting the best seam. Currently, as\nstandard tools of the OpenCV library, dynamic programming (DP) and GraphCut\n(GC) are still the only commonly used seam prediction methods despite the fact\nthat they were both proposed two decades ago. However, GC can get excellent\nseam quality but poor real-time performance while DP method has good efficiency\nbut poor seam quality. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based seam\nprediction method (DSeam) for the sake of high seam quality with high\nefficiency. To overcome the difficulty of the seam description in network and\nno GroundTruth for training we design a selective consistency loss combining\nthe seam shape constraint and seam quality constraint to supervise the network\nlearning. By the constraint of the selection of consistency loss, we implicitly\ndefined the mask boundaries as seams and transform seam prediction into mask\nprediction. To our knowledge, the proposed DSeam is the first deep learning\nbased seam prediction method for image stitching. Extensive experimental\nresults well demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed Dseam method\nwhich is 15 times faster than the classic GC seam prediction method in OpenCV\n2.4.9 with similar seam quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 02:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

However, previous studies in the quantum Monte Carlo community suggest\nan exchange-energy-like power law of $N^{-2/3}$ is also be present in the\ncorrelation energy when using the conventional Coulomb interaction. The\nrationale for this is that the total energy goes as $N^{-1}$ and the exchange\nenergy as $N^{-2/3}$; so, the correlation energy should be a combination of the\ntwo power laws. Further, in coupled cluster theory, these power laws are\nrelated to the low $G$ scaling of the transition structure factor, $S(G)$,\nwhich is a property of the coupled cluster wavefunction calculated from the\namplitudes. We show that data from coupled cluster doubles calculations on the\nuniform electron gas(UEG) fit a function with a low $G$ behavior of $S(G)$~$G$.\nThe pre-factor for this linear term is derived from the exchange energy to be\nconsistent with an $N^{-2/3}$ power law at large $N$. Incorporating the\nexchange structure factor into the transition structure factor results in a\ncombined structure factor of $S(G)$~$G^2$, consistent with an $N^{-1}$ scaling\nof the exchange-correlation energy. We then look for the presence of an\n$N^{-2/3}$ power law in the energy. First, we develop a plane-wave cutoff\nscheme with less noise than the traditional basis set used for the UEG.

Recently, there have been several efforts to study if, and\nhow, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) acting in the absence of hardware noise can\nbe overparametrized. In particular, it has been proposed that a QNN can be\ndefined as overparametrized if it has enough parameters to explore all\navailable directions in state space. That is, if the rank of the Quantum Fisher\nInformation Matrix (QFIM) for the QNN's output state is saturated. Here, we\nexplore how the presence of noise affects the overparametrization phenomenon.\nOur results show that noise can \"turn on\" previously-zero eigenvalues of the\nQFIM. This enables the parametrized state to explore directions that were\notherwise inaccessible, thus potentially turning an overparametrized QNN into\nan underparametrized one. For small noise levels, the QNN is\nquasi-overparametrized, as large eigenvalues coexists with small ones. Then, we\nprove that as the magnitude of noise increases all the eigenvalues of the QFIM\nbecome exponentially suppressed, indicating that the state becomes insensitive\nto any change in the parameters. As such, there is a pull-and-tug effect where\nnoise can enable new directions, but also suppress the sensitivity to parameter\nupdates.

Several methods\nhave been proposed to handle this problem, but they either take a lot of time\nor lack generalizability.

The straightforward combination of LT and PLL, i.e.,\nLT-PLL, suffers from a fundamental dilemma: LT methods build upon a given class\ndistribution that is unavailable in PLL, and the performance of PLL is severely\ninfluenced in long-tailed context. We show that even with the auxiliary of an\noracle class prior, the state-of-the-art methods underperform due to an adverse\nfact that the constant rebalancing in LT is harsh to the label disambiguation\nin PLL. To overcome this challenge, we thus propose a dynamic rebalancing\nmethod, termed as RECORDS, without assuming any prior knowledge about the class\ndistribution. Based on a parametric decomposition of the biased output, our\nmethod constructs a dynamic adjustment that is benign to the label\ndisambiguation process and theoretically converges to the oracle class prior.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant\ngain of RECORDS compared with a range of baselines.

Various attempts have been made to reliably train DNNs under\ndata noise, but they separately account for either the noise existing in the\nlabels or that existing in the images. A naive combination of the two lines of\nworks would suffer from the limitations in both sides, and miss the\nopportunities to handle the two kinds of noise in parallel. This work provides\na first, unified framework for reliable learning under the joint (image,\nlabel)-noise. Technically, we develop a confidence-based sample filter to\nprogressively filter out noisy data without the need of pre-specifying noise\nratio. Then, we penalize the model uncertainty of the detected noisy data\ninstead of letting the model continue over-fitting the misleading information\nin them.

First, through the inner fusion property of 3D convolution, we design\na new feature fusion way that can simultaneously extract and fuse the feature\ninformation from bi-temporal images.

No differentiability or non-degeneracy conditions are required.\n  Further, we present a particle system based Euler-type split-step scheme\n(SSM) for the simulation of this type of MV-SDEs. The scheme attains, in\nstepsize, the strong error rate $1/2$ in the non-path-space root-mean-square\nerror metric and we demonstrate the property of mean-square contraction. Our\nresults are illustrated by numerical examples including: estimation of PoC\nrates across dimensions, preservation of periodic phase-space, and the\nobservation that taming appears to be not a suitable method unless strong\ndissipativity is present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 09:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

This method leverages the theoretical strengths of unsupervised\nlearning and the data availability of both normal and abnormal classes. The AD\nis often formulated as an unsupervised task motivated by the frequent\nimbalanced nature of the datasets, as well as the challenge of capturing the\nentirety of the abnormal class. Such methods only rely on normal images during\ntraining, which are devoted to be reconstructed through an autoencoder\narchitecture for instance. However, the information contained in the abnormal\ndata is also valuable for this reconstruction. Indeed, the model would be able\nto identify its weaknesses by better learning how to transform an abnormal (or\nnormal) image into a normal (or abnormal) image. Each of these tasks could help\nthe entire model to learn with higher precision than a single normal to normal\nreconstruction. To address this challenge, the proposed method utilizes\nCycle-Generative Adversarial Networks (Cycle-GANs) for abnormal-to-normal\ntranslation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that\nCycle-GANs have been studied for this purpose. After an input image has been\nreconstructed by the normal generator, an anomaly score describes the\ndifferences between the input and reconstructed images. Based on a threshold\nset with a business quality constraint, the input image is then flagged as\nnormal or not. The proposed method is evaluated on industrial and medical\nimages, including cases with balanced datasets and others with as few as 30\nabnormal images. The results demonstrate accurate performance and good\ngeneralization for all kinds of anomalies, specifically for texture-shaped\nimages where the method reaches an average accuracy of 97.2% (85.4% with an\nadditional zero false negative constraint).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 10:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

Recent test-time adaptation methods heavily rely on the modified\nbatch normalization, i.e., transductive batch normalization (TBN), which\ncalculates the mean and the variance from the current test batch rather than\nusing the running mean and variance obtained from the source data, i.e.,\nconventional batch normalization (CBN). Adopting TBN that employs test batch\nstatistics mitigates the performance degradation caused by the domain shift.\nHowever, re-estimating normalization statistics using test data depends on\nimpractical assumptions that a test batch should be large enough and be drawn\nfrom i.i.d. stream, and we observed that the previous methods with TBN show\ncritical performance drop without the assumptions. In this paper, we identify\nthat CBN and TBN are in a trade-off relationship and present a new test-time\nnormalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the\nimportance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of\neach BN layer.

We observe that such a scheme is\nsub-optimal, i.e., for better distinguishing anomaly one needs to understand\nwhat is a normal state, and may yield a higher false alarm rate. To address\nthis issue, we propose an Uncertainty Regulated Dual Memory Units (UR-DMU)\nmodel to learn both the representations of normal data and discriminative\nfeatures of abnormal data. To be specific, inspired by the traditional global\nand local structure on graph convolutional networks, we introduce a Global and\nLocal Multi-Head Self Attention (GL-MHSA) module for the Transformer network to\nobtain more expressive embeddings for capturing associations in videos.

A growing, adaptively refined mesh\naccurately captures all details of the laser beam motion.

It was\nalso assumed that a non minimal coupling between curvature and the scalar field\nis present. For the shake of completeness, the slow-roll and the constant-roll\nscenarios were examined separately. In the context of this scalar-tensor\ntheory, inflation can be viable for both scenarios since the observational\nindices take acceptable values according to the most recent Planck data.\nFurthermore, the involvement of the Chern-Simons term has no effect on the\nbackground equations, in contrast to the scalar function which couples with the\nRicci scalar and participates in the equations of motion. However, the\nChern-Simons term ensures the chirality of stochastic gravitational waves. A\nblue-tilted tensor spectral index of primordial curvature perturbations can be\nmanifested since, tensor modes are strongly affected by the Chern-Simons term.\nLastly, the Swampland criteria and the Lyth-bound were examined in order to\ndistinguish the effective field theories towards the path of a consistent\nM-theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 11:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

It is in full agreement\nwith both quantum mechanics and experiments. In this model the expectation for\na particular pair of observations is partial to the selected detector settings.\nThis leads to a slightly different variant of the Bell inequality, one that is\nconsistent with both quantum mechanics and measurements. In this model there is\nno Bell contradiction.\n  Furthermore, the proposed probability model is statistically local, is not\nfactorizable, and is not Bell-separable.

It is caused by an increased upper airway resistance during\nsleep, which determines episodes of partial or complete interruption of\nairflow. The detection and treatment of OSAS is particularly important in\nstroke patients, because the presence of severe OSAS is associated with higher\nmortality, worse neurological deficits, worse functional outcome after\nrehabilitation, and a higher likelihood of uncontrolled hypertension. The gold\nstandard test for diagnosing OSAS is polysomnography (PSG). Unfortunately,\nperforming a PSG in an electrically hostile environment, like a stroke unit, on\nneurologically impaired patients is a difficult task; also, the number of\nstrokes per day outnumbers the availability of polysomnographs and dedicated\nhealthcare professionals. Thus, a simple and automated recognition system to\nidentify OSAS among acute stroke patients, relying on routinely recorded vital\nsigns, is desirable. The majority of the work done so far focuses on data\nrecorded in ideal conditions and highly selected patients, and thus it is\nhardly exploitable in real-life settings, where it would be of actual use. In\nthis paper, we propose a convolutional deep learning architecture able to\nreduce the temporal resolution of raw waveform data, like physiological\nsignals, extracting key features that can be used for further processing.

Indeed, the recognition of permuted Demidenko matrices is a\nlongstanding open problem, in contrast to the effciently solved RP for\nimportant subclasses of Demidenko matrices such as the Kalmanson matrices, the\nSupnick matrices, the Monge matrices and the Anti-Robinson matrices. The\nrecognition of the permuted Demidenko matrices is relevant in the context of\nhard combinatorial optimization problems which become tractable if the input is\na Demidenko matrix. Demidenko matrices were introduced by Demidenko in 1976,\nwhen he proved that the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is polynomially\nsolvable if the symmetric distance matrix fulfills certain combinatorial\nconditions, nowadays known as the Demidenko conditions. In the context of the\nTSP the recognition problem consists in deciding whether there is a renumbering\nof the cities such that the correspondingly renumbered distance matrix fulfills\nthe Demidenko conditions, thus resulting in a polynomially solvable special\ncase of the TSP. We show that such a renumbering of n cities can be found in\n$O(n^4)$ time, if it exists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 11:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

This\nresearch suggests using a mono camera to virtually enhance the frame rate of\nLIDARs, allowing the more frequent monitoring of dynamic objects in the\nsurroundings that move quickly. As a first step, dynamic object candidates are\nidentified and tracked in the camera frames. Following that, the LIDAR\nmeasurement points of these items are found by clustering in the frustums of 2D\nbounding boxes. Projecting these to the camera and tracking them to the next\ncamera frame can be used to create 3D-2D correspondences between different\ntimesteps. These correspondences between the last LIDAR frame and the actual\ncamera frame are used to solve the PnP (Perspective-n-Point) problem. Finally,\nthe estimated transformations are applied to the previously measured points to\ngenerate virtual measurements. With the proposed estimation, if the ego\nmovement is known, not just static object position can be determined at\ntimesteps where camera measurement is available, but positions of dynamic\nobjects as well.

We do so starting\nfrom PoseNet, which successfully predicts camera poses from small datasets of\nRGB frames. State-of-the-art methods, however, require expensive tuning to\nbalance the orientational and translational components of the camera pose.This\nis usually done through complex, ad-hoc loss function to be minimized, and in\nsome cases also requires 3D points as well as images. Our approach has the\nadvantage of unifying the camera position and orientation through the motor.\nConsequently, the network searches for a single object which lives in a\nwell-behaved 4D space with a Euclidean signature. This means that we can\naddress the case of image-only datasets and work efficiently with a simple loss\nfunction, namely the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and ground\ntruth motors. We show that it is possible to achieve high accuracy camera pose\nregression with a significantly simpler problem formulation. This 1D-Up\napproach to CGA can be employed to overcome the dichotomy between translational\nand orientational components in camera pose regression in a compact and elegant\nway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 12:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

The synthesis of such energy systems,\ntherefore, requires models with high spatial resolution. However, high spatial\nresolution increases the computational effort. Here, we present the SpArta\nmethod for rigorous optimization of regionally resolved energy systems by\nSpatial Aggregation and decomposition. SpArta significantly reduces\ncomputational effort while maintaining the full spatial resolution of\nsector-coupled energy systems. SpArta first reduces problem size by spatially\naggregating the energy system using clustering. The aggregated problem is then\nrelaxed and restricted to obtain a lower and an upper bound. The spatial\nresolution is iteratively increased until the difference between upper and\nlower bound satisfies a predefined optimality gap. Finally, each cluster of the\naggregated problem is redesigned at full resolution. For this purpose, SpArta\ndecomposes the original synthesis problem into subproblems for each cluster.\nCombining the redesigned cluster solutions yields an optimal feasible solution\nof the full-scale problem within a predefined optimality gap. SpArta thus\noptimizes large-scale energy systems rigorously with significant reductions in\ncomputational effort. We apply SpArta to a case study of the sector-coupled\nGerman energy system, reducing the computational time by a factor of 7.5,\ncompared to the optimization of the same problem at full spatial resolution.

Its current baseline focal-plane\nconfiguration includes 15 frequency bands between 40 and 402 GHz, fulfilling\nthe mission requirements to detect the amplitude of gravitational waves with\nthe total uncertainty on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $\\delta r$, down to\n$\\delta r<0.001$. A key aspect of this performance is accurate astrophysical\ncomponent separation, and the ability to remove polarized thermal dust emission\nis particularly important. In this paper we note that the CMB frequency\nspectrum falls off nearly exponentially above 300 GHz relative to the thermal\ndust SED, and a relatively minor high frequency extension can therefore result\nin even lower uncertainties and better model reconstructions. Specifically, we\ncompare the baseline design with five extended configurations, while varying\nthe underlying dust modeling, in each of which the HFT (High-Frequency\nTelescope) frequency range is shifted logarithmically towards higher\nfrequencies, with an upper cutoff ranging between 400 and 600 GHz. In each\ncase, we measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ uncertainty and bias using both\nparametric and minimum-variance component-separation algorithms. When the\nthermal dust sky model includes a spatially varying spectral index and\ntemperature, we find that the statistical uncertainty on $r$ after foreground\ncleaning may be reduced by as much as 30--50 % by extending the upper limit of\nthe frequency range from 400 to 600 GHz, with most of the improvement already\ngained at 500 GHz. We also note that a broader frequency range leads to better\nability to discriminate between models through higher $\\chi^2$ sensitivity.\n(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 12:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

Apart from\nthat, the seesaw mechanism requires there to be at least two sterile states,\none of them being much heavier than the active ones. The heavier sterile state\n($m_{s}\\sim1$ keV) would decay and increase the effective number of active\nneutrinos. Therefore, the influence of a change in the effective number of\nrelativistic neutrino species $N_{\\rm eff}$ was studied as well, which could be\ncaused by, for example, the decay processes of the above-mentioned sterile\nneutrinos, as well as processes leading to an increase in the temperature of\nrelic neutrinos $T_{\\rm C\\nu B}$. The effects studied in this work lead to a\nsignificant change in the estimates of the cosmological parameters, including\nthe value of $H_{0}$. It has been discovered that the accounting of the sterile\nneutrino with masses $m=1$ and $2.7$ eV leads to a decrease in the estimate of\nthe current Hubble parameter value $H_{0}$ and, therefore, exacerbates the\n``$H_{0}$-tension'' problem. An increase in the value of the effective number\nof relativistic neutrino species leads, on the contrary, to an increase in the\n$H_{0}$ estimate, resolving the above-mentioned problem at $N_{\\rm\neff}=3.0+0.9$, which is equivalent to an increase of the neutrino temperature\nup to $T ^{\\,0}_{\\rm C\\nu B}=1.95+0.14\\,\\rm K$.

Similarly, identifying the speaker\ntransitions in a multispeaker utterance is known as speaker change detection\n(SCD). Since tasks-wise both are similar, the architecture/framework developed\nfor the SCD task may be suitable for the LCD task. Hence, the aim of the\npresent work is to develop LCD systems inspired by SCD. Initially, both LCD and\nSCD are performed by humans. The study suggests humans require (a) a larger\nduration around the change point and (b) language-specific prior exposure, for\nperforming LCD as compared to SCD. The larger duration requirement is\nincorporated by increasing the analysis window length of the unsupervised\ndistance-based approach. This leads to a relative performance improvement of\n29.1% and 2.4%, and a priori language knowledge provides a relative improvement\nof 31.63% and 14.27% on the synthetic and practical codeswitched datasets,\nrespectively. The performance difference between the practical and synthetic\ndatasets is mostly due to differences in the distribution of the monolingual\nsegment duration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 14:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

The major challenge in\ndeveloping a start-to-end quantum algorithm for the Boltzmann equation consists\nin encoding relevant data efficiently in quantum bits (qubits) and formulating\nthe streaming, collision and reflection steps as one comprehensive unitary\noperation. The current literature on quantum Boltzmann methods mostly proposes\ndata encodings and quantum primitives for individual phases of the pipeline\nassuming that they can be combined to a full algorithm.\n  In this paper we disprove this assumption by showing that for encodings\ncommonly discussed in literature either the collision or the streaming step\ncannot be unitary. Building on this landmark result we propose a novel encoding\nin which the number of qubits used to encode the velocity depends on the number\nof time steps one wishes to simulate, with the upper bound depending on the\ntotal number of grid points.\n  In light of the non-unitarity result established for existing encodings, our\nencoding method is to the best of our knowledge the only one currently known\nthat can be used for a start-to-end quantum Boltzmann solver where both the\ncollision and the streaming step are implemented as a unitary operation.\nFurthermore our theoretical unitarity result can serve as a guideline on which\ntypes of encodings to consider or whether a `stop-and-go' method with repeated\nmeasurements and re-initializations is the method of choice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 15:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

In our\napproach, which we call TurboTLS, the initial client-to-server and\nserver-to-client flows of the TLS handshake are sent over UDP rather than TCP.\nAt the same time, in the same flights, the three-way TCP handshake is carried\nout. Once the TCP connection is established, the client and server can complete\nthe final flight of the TLS handshake over the TCP connection and continue\nusing it for application data. No changes are made to the contents of the TLS\nhandshake protocol, only its delivery mechanism. We avoid problems with UDP\nfragmentation by using request-based fragmentation, in which the client sends\nin advance enough UDP requests to provide sufficient room for the server to fit\nits response with one response packet per request packet. Clients can detect\nwhich servers support this without an additional round trip, if the server\nadvertises its support in a DNS HTTPS resource record. Experiments using our\nsoftware implementation show substantial latency improvements. On reliable\nconnections, we effectively eliminate a round trip without any noticeable cost.\nTo ensure adequate performance on unreliable connections, we use lightweight\npacket ordering and buffering; we can have a client wait a very small time to\nreceive a potentially lost packet (e.g., a fraction of the RTT observed for the\nfirst fragment) before falling back to TCP without any further delay, since the\nTCP connection was already in the process of being established.

We implemented a general lattice\nmodel to simulate LLPS of an ensemble of different catalysts and extended it to\ninclude diffusion and a sequence of reactions of small substrates. We carried\nout a quantitative analysis of how the phase separation of the catalysts\naffects reaction times depending on the affinity between substrates and\ncatalysts, the length of the reaction pathway, the system size, and the degree\nof homogeneity of the condensate. A key aspect underlying the differences\nreported between the two scenarios is that the scale invariance observed in the\nWM system is broken by condensation processes. The main theoretical\nimplications of our results for mean-field chemistry are drawn, extending the\nmass action kinetics scheme to include substrate initial hitting times to reach\nthe catalysts condensate. We finally test this approach by considering open\nnon-linear conditions, where we successfully predict, through microscopic\nsimulations, that phase separation inhibits chemical oscillatory behaviour,\nproviding a possible explanation for the marginal role that this complex\ndynamic behaviour plays in real metabolisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 15:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-13"}

However, LMs lack awareness of security and are\nfound to frequently produce unsafe code. This work studies the security of LMs\nalong two important axes: (i) security hardening, which aims to enhance LMs'\nreliability in generating secure code, and (ii) adversarial testing, which\nseeks to evaluate LMs' security at an adversarial standpoint. We address both\nof these by formulating a new security task called controlled code generation.\nThe task is parametric and takes as input a binary property to guide the LM to\ngenerate secure or unsafe code, while preserving the LM's capability of\ngenerating functionally correct code. We propose a novel learning-based\napproach called SVEN to solve this task. SVEN leverages property-specific\ncontinuous vectors to guide program generation towards the given property,\nwithout modifying the LM's weights.

Of\nparticular concern is the apparent difference in the corrected brightnesses of\nSNe Ia in different host galaxy environments. SNe Ia in more massive, passive,\nolder environments appear brighter after having been standardized by their\nlight-curve properties. The luminosity difference commonly takes the form of a\nstep function. Recent works imply that environmental characteristics that trace\nthe age of the stellar population in the vicinity of SNe show the largest\nsteps. Here we use simulations of SN Ia populations to test the impact of using\ndifferent tracers and investigate promising new models of the step. We test\nmodels with a total-to-selective dust extinction ratio $R_V$ that changes\nbetween young and old SN Ia host galaxies, as well as an intrinsic luminosity\ndifference between SNe from young and old progenitors.

Methods: Based on data of\n35 patients of Cold/Hot ZHENG CG and 3 scRNA-seq CG samples, we conduct\nanalysis with transcriptomics datasets and algorithms, to discover biomarkers\nfor Cold/Hot ZHENG CG. And we collected 25 formulae (with traditional effects\nrelated to Cold/Hot ZHENG) for CG and corresponding 89 Cold/Hot herbs\n(including Warm/Cool herbs) to discover features and construct target networks\nof Cold/Hot herbs on the basis of network target and enrichment analysis.\nResults: Biomarkers of Cold/Hot ZHENG CG represented by CCL2 and LEP suggested\nthat Hot ZHENG CG might be characterized by over-inflammation and exuberant\nmetabolism, and Cold ZHENG CG showed a trend of suppression in immune\nregulation and energy metabolism.

On the detection task, the AI system obtained area under the\nreceiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.996 (hold-out test), 0.994 (external test\n1), 0.984 (external test 2), and 0.979 (external test 3), respectively.\nMeanwhile, the detection results of AI system showed a strong correlation with\nthe diagnosis of cardiologists (cardiologist 1 (R=0.794, p<1e-3), cardiologist\n2 (R=0.812, p<1e-3)). On the screening task, the AI system achieved AUCs of\n0.894 (hold-out test) and 0.850 (external test). The screening performance of\nthe AI system was better than that of the cardiologists (AI system (0.846) vs.\ncardiologist 1 (0.520) vs. cardiologist 2 (0.480)). Our study demonstrates the\nfeasibility of an accurate, objective, easy-to-use, fast, and low-cost AI\nsystem for CA detection and screening. The system has the potential to be used\nby healthcare professionals, caregivers, and general users to assess CAs based\non real-world ECG images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 10:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-22"}

However, most existing recommendation\nmethods collect these ego graphs from all users to compose a global graph to\nobtain high-order collaborative information between users and items, and these\ncentralized CF recommendation methods inevitably lead to a high risk of user\nprivacy leakage. Although recently proposed federated recommendation systems\ncan mitigate the privacy problem, they either restrict the on-device local\ntraining to an isolated ego graph or rely on an additional third-party server\nto access other ego graphs resulting in a cumbersome pipeline, which is hard to\nwork in practice. In addition, existing federated recommendation systems\nrequire resource-limited devices to maintain the entire embedding tables\nresulting in high communication costs.\n  In light of this, we propose a semi-decentralized federated ego graph\nlearning framework for on-device recommendations, named SemiDFEGL, which\nintroduces new device-to-device collaborations to improve scalability and\nreduce communication costs and innovatively utilizes predicted interacted item\nnodes to connect isolated ego graphs to augment local subgraphs such that the\nhigh-order user-item collaborative information could be used in a\nprivacy-preserving manner.

The\nchiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect has established a strong coupling\nbetween electron spin and molecular chirality and this coupling paves the way\nfor breaking the chiral molecular symmetry by spin-selective processes.\nMagnetic surfaces can act as chiral agents due to the CISS effect and they can\nbe templates for the enantioselective crystallization of chiral molecules.

Consequently, creating a stock portfolio should not only\ntake into account its performance but compliance with ESG criteria. Hence, this\npaper combines mathematical modelling, with ESG and finance. In more detail, we\nuse Bayesian optimization (BO), a sequential state-of-the-art design strategy\nto optimize black-boxes with unknown analytical and costly-to compute\nexpressions, to maximize the performance of a stock portfolio under the\npresence of ESG criteria soft constraints incorporated to the objective\nfunction.

We show that an analyst needs to\nconsider fewer dialects than distinct message patterns, which reduces their\ncognitive load when studying a complex format.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2023 21:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}
