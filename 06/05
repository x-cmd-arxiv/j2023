The data were analyzed using both maximum likelihood and\nBayesian structural equation modeling to unravel the intricate relationships\nbetween self-regulation, self-efficacy, perceptions of ICT, and self-assessment\ntools. Our research findings underscored the direct and indirect impacts of\nself-efficacy, perceived ease of use, and perceived use of technology on\nself-regulation. The results revealed the predictive power of self-assessment\ntools in determining self-regulation outcomes, underlining the potential of\ntechnology-enhanced self-regulated learning environments. The study posited the\nnecessity to transcend mere technology incorporation and to emphasize the\ninclusion of monitoring strategies explicitly designed to augment\nself-regulation. Interestingly, self-efficacy appeared to indirectly influence\nself-regulation outcomes through perceived the use of technology rather than\ndirect influence. Analytically, this research indicated that Bayesian\nestimation could offer a more comprehensive insight into structural equation\nmodeling by more accurately assessing our estimates' uncertainty.

The shot noise power is proportional to both the magnitude\nof the current and the effective charge of the carrier. Shot-noise spectroscopy\nthus enables - in principle - to determine the effective charge q of the charge\ncarriers that tunnel. This can be used to detect electron pairing in\nsuperconductors: in the normal state, the noise corresponds to single electron\ntunneling (q = 1e), while in the paired state, the noise corresponds to q = 2e,\nbecause of Andreev reflections. Here, we use a newly developed amplifier to\nreveal that in typical mesoscopic superconducting junctions, the shot noise\ndoes not reflect the signatures of pairing and instead stays at a level\ncorresponding to q = 1e. We show that transparency can control the shot noise\nand this q = 1e is due to the large number of tunneling channels with each\nhaving very low transparency. At such transparencies, the shot noise in the\njunction resembles that of a metallic instead of a superconducting tunnel\njunction. Our results indicate that in typical mesoscopic superconducting\njunctions one should expect q = 1e noise, and lead to design guidelines for\njunctions that allow the detection of electron pairing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 16:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

In this paper, we reveal that the scale factor has a\nstatistically significant impact on subjective quality scores of SR images,\nindicating that the scale information can be used to guide the task of blind SR\nIQA. Motivated by this, we propose a scale guided hypernetwork framework that\nevaluates SR image quality in a scale-adaptive manner. Specifically, the blind\nSR IQA procedure is divided into three stages, i.e., content perception,\nevaluation rule generation, and quality prediction. After content perception, a\nhypernetwork generates the evaluation rule used in quality prediction based on\nthe scale factor of the SR image. We apply the proposed scale guided\nhypernetwork framework to existing representative blind IQA metrics, and\nexperimental results show that the proposed framework not only boosts the\nperformance of these IQA metrics but also enhances their generalization\nabilities.

Classic examples include decoding, tracking, signal\nenhancement and denoising. Since the reconstructed signals are ultimately\nviewed by humans, it is desirable to achieve reconstructions that are pleasing\nto human perception. Mathematically, perfect perceptual-quality is achieved\nwhen the distribution of restored signals is the same as that of natural\nsignals, a requirement which has been heavily researched in static estimation\nsettings (i.e. when a whole signal is processed at once). Here, we study the\nproblem of optimal causal filtering under a perfect perceptual-quality\nconstraint, which is a task of fundamentally different nature. Specifically, we\nanalyze a Gaussian Markov signal observed through a linear noisy\ntransformation. In the absence of perceptual constraints, the Kalman filter is\nknown to be optimal in the MSE sense for this setting. Here, we show that\nadding the perfect perceptual quality constraint (i.e. the requirement of\ntemporal consistency), introduces a fundamental dilemma whereby the filter may\nhave to \"knowingly\" ignore new information revealed by the observations in\norder to conform to its past decisions. This often comes at the cost of a\nsignificant increase in the MSE (beyond that encountered in static settings).\nOur analysis goes beyond the classic innovation process of the Kalman filter,\nand introduces the novel concept of an unutilized information process. Using\nthis tool, we present a recursive formula for perceptual filters, and\ndemonstrate the qualitative effects of perfect perceptual-quality estimation on\na video reconstruction problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 16:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Many recent models also\nincorporate top-down networks going in the opposite direction. Top-down\nprocessing in deep learning models plays two primary roles: learning and\ndirecting attention. These two roles are accomplished in current models through\ndistinct mechanisms. While top-down attention is often implemented by extending\nthe model's architecture with additional units that propagate information from\nhigh to low levels of the network, learning is typically accomplished by an\nexternal learning algorithm such as back-propagation. In the current work, we\npresent an integration of the two functions above, which appear unrelated,\nusing a single unified mechanism. We propose a novel symmetric bottom-up\ntop-down network structure that can integrate standard bottom-up networks with\na symmetric top-down counterpart, allowing each network to guide and influence\nthe other. The same top-down network is being used for both learning, via\nback-propagating feedback signals, and at the same time also for top-down\nattention, by guiding the bottom-up network to perform a selected task.

However, existing\nmethods often rely on relaxing the low-rank constraint of the model weights\nusing a regularized nuclear norm penalty, which requires an appropriate\nhyperparameter that can be difficult to determine in practice. Furthermore,\nexisting compression techniques are not directly applicable to efficient\nover-the-air (OTA) aggregation in federated learning (FL) systems for\ndistributed Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel manifold optimization formulation for low-rank model compression in FL\nthat does not relax the low-rank constraint. Our optimization is conducted\ndirectly over the low-rank manifold, guaranteeing that the model is exactly\nlow-rank. We also introduce a consensus penalty in the optimization formulation\nto support OTA aggregation. Based on our optimization formulation, we propose\nan alternating Riemannian optimization algorithm with a precoder that enables\nefficient OTA aggregation of low-rank local models without sacrificing training\nperformance. Additionally, we provide convergence analysis in terms of key\nsystem parameters and conduct extensive experiments with real-world datasets to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Riemannian low-rank model\ncompression scheme compared to various state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 18:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

However, in offline learning for\nrobotics, we simply lack internet scale data, and so high quality datasets are\na necessity. This is especially true in imitation learning (IL), a sample\nefficient paradigm for robot learning using expert demonstrations. Policies\nlearned through IL suffer from state distribution shift at test time due to\ncompounding errors in action prediction, which leads to unseen states that the\npolicy cannot recover from. Instead of designing new algorithms to address\ndistribution shift, an alternative perspective is to develop new ways of\nassessing and curating datasets. There is growing evidence that the same IL\nalgorithms can have substantially different performance across different\ndatasets. This calls for a formalism for defining metrics of \"data quality\"\nthat can further be leveraged for data curation. In this work, we take the\nfirst step toward formalizing data quality for imitation learning through the\nlens of distribution shift: a high quality dataset encourages the policy to\nstay in distribution at test time. We propose two fundamental properties that\nshape the quality of a dataset: i) action divergence: the mismatch between the\nexpert and learned policy at certain states; and ii) transition diversity: the\nnoise present in the system for a given state and action. We investigate the\ncombined effect of these two key properties in imitation learning\ntheoretically, and we empirically analyze models trained on a variety of\ndifferent data sources. We show that state diversity is not always beneficial,\nand we demonstrate how action divergence and transition diversity interact in\npractice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 18:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

It is first\nshown that, when normalized by peak values, the Reynolds number dependence and\nwall-normal variation of all three profiles can be decoupled, in excellent\nagreement with available data, sharing the common inner expansion of the type\n$\\phi^+(y^+)=f_0(y^+)+f_1(y^+)/Re^{1/4}_\\tau$, where $\\phi^+$ is one of the\nquantities just mentioned, and the functions $f_0$ and $f_1$ depend only on\n$y^+$.

In\nmany modern signal enhancement interfaces, this problem is addressed by a\nlinear acoustic echo canceler which subtracts a loudspeaker echo estimate from\nthe recorded microphone signal. To obtain precise echo estimates, the\nparameters of the echo canceler, i.e., the filter coefficients, need to be\nestimated quickly and precisely from the observed loudspeaker and microphone\nsignals. For this a sophisticated adaptation control is required to deal with\nhigh-power double-talk and rapidly track time-varying acoustic environments\nwhich are often faced with portable devices. In this paper, we address this\nproblem by end-to-end deep learning. In particular, we suggest to infer the\nstep-size for a least mean squares frequency-domain adaptive filter update by a\nDeep Neural Network (DNN). Two different step-size inference approaches are\ninvestigated. On the one hand broadband approaches, which use a single DNN to\njointly infer step-sizes for all frequency bands, and on the other hand\nnarrowband methods, which exploit individual DNNs per frequency band. The\ndiscussion of benefits and disadvantages of both approaches leads to a novel\nhybrid approach which shows improved echo cancellation while requiring only\nsmall DNN architectures. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of different\nloss functions, signal feature vectors, and DNN output layer architectures on\nthe echo cancellation performance from which we obtain valuable insights into\nthe general design and functionality of DNN-based adaptation control\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 19:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Very good SED fits for\nmost SFHs demonstrates the compatibility of our templates with generations of\nstars in these first galaxies, even though they are derived from present-epoch\nstars in our Galaxy -- as expected, because the light is dominated by\nmain-sequence A-stars, free of post-main-sequence complexity and insensitive to\nheavy-element compositions.

This buildup of stellar mass amounts to 10^8\nto 10^9 Msun in an integer epoch, whether in a ~100 Myr burst or as part of a\nlonger history.

Effects on the observables using\ndifferent $NN$ and three-nucleon potentials are evaluated with the conclusion\nthat variations of around $2\\%$ are observed. Although these effects are small,\nfuture measurements can go beyond this accuracy allowing for new detailed\nstudies of strong interaction in light nuclear systems. The present study\nsupports the current efforts devoted to the measurement of correlation\nfunctions in systems dominated by the strong interactions, such as $pd$, $ppp$,\n$\\Lambda d$ and $pp\\Lambda$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 20:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

While prominent methods for\nestimating contagion effects in observational studies often assume that there\nare no unmeasured confounders, contagion can be confounded due to latent\nhomophily: nodes in a homophilous network tend to have ties to peers with\nsimilar attributes and can behave similarly without influencing one another.\nOne way to account for latent homophily is by considering proxies for the\nunobserved confounders. However, in the presence of high-dimensional proxies,\nproxy-based methods can lead to substantially biased estimation of contagion\neffects, as we demonstrate in this paper. To tackle this issue, we introduce\nthe novel Proximal Embeddings (ProEmb), a framework which integrates\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs) and adversarial networks to generate balanced\nlow-dimensional representations of high-dimensional proxies for different\ntreatment groups and identifies contagion effects in the presence of unobserved\nnetwork confounders. We empirically show that our method significantly\nincreases the accuracy of contagion effect estimation in observational network\ndata compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 20:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Among them, text data (e.g., tweets, blogs)\nmaintains the basic yet important social activities and generates a rich source\nof user-oriented information. While those explicit sensitive user data like\ncredentials has been significantly protected by all means, personal private\nattribute (e.g., age, gender, location) disclosure due to inference attacks is\nsomehow challenging to avoid, especially when powerful natural language\nprocessing (NLP) techniques have been effectively deployed to automate\nattribute inferences from implicit text data. This puts users' attribute\nprivacy at risk. To address this challenge, in this paper, we leverage the\ninherent vulnerability of machine learning to adversarial attacks, and design a\nnovel text-space Adversarial attack for Social Good, called Adv4SG. In other\nwords, we cast the problem of protecting personal attribute privacy as an\nadversarial attack formulation problem over the social media text data to\ndefend against NLP-based attribute inference attacks. More specifically, Adv4SG\nproceeds with a sequence of word perturbations under given constraints such\nthat the probed attribute cannot be identified correctly. Different from the\nprior works, we advance Adv4SG by considering social media property, and\nintroducing cost-effective mechanisms to expedite attribute obfuscation over\ntext data under the black-box setting. Extensive experiments on real-world\nsocial media datasets have demonstrated that our method can effectively degrade\nthe inference accuracy with less computational cost over different attribute\nsettings, which substantially helps mitigate the impacts of inference attacks\nand thus achieve high performance in user attribute privacy protection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 21:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

This paper offers a simple empirical\nrelation essentially free of assumptions, found using available data for 59\nhighest-z quasars and the so-called Salpeter relation.

DPP is a popular probabilistic approach that improves\ndata diversity by enforcing the repulsion of elements in the selected subsets.\nThe well-studied Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference in DPP aims to identify\nthe subset with the highest diversity quantified by DPP. However, this approach\nis limited by the presumption that all data samples are available at one point,\nwhich hinders its applicability to real-world applications such as traffic\ndatasets where data samples are distributed across sources and communication\nbetween them is band-limited.\n  Inspired by the techniques used in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)\ncommunication systems, we propose a strategy for performing MAP inference among\ndistributed sources.

A determinant-preserved sparse\nrepresentation of selected samples is used to perform sample precoding in local\nsources to be processed by DPP.

Data markets help with identifying valuable training\ndata: model consumers pay to train a model, the market uses that budget to\nidentify data and train the model (the budget allocation problem), and finally\nthe market compensates data providers according to their data contribution\n(revenue allocation problem). For example, a bank could pay the data market to\naccess data from other financial institutions to train a fraud detection model.\nCompensating data contributors requires understanding data's contribution to\nthe model; recent efforts to solve this revenue allocation problem based on the\nShapley value are inefficient to lead to practical data markets.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm to solve budget allocation and\nrevenue allocation problems simultaneously in linear time.

Better data means that the algorithm\naccesses those providers more often, and more frequent accesses corresponds to\nhigher compensation. Furthermore, the algorithm can be deployed in both\ncentralized and federated scenarios, boosting its applicability. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees for the algorithm that show the budget is used\nefficiently and the properties of revenue allocation are similar to Shapley's.\nFinally, we conduct an empirical evaluation to show the performance of the\nalgorithm in practical scenarios and when compared to other baselines.

However, not all the previous queries are related to,\nand useful for expanding the current query. In this paper, we propose a new\nmethod to select relevant historical queries that are useful for the current\nquery. To cope with the lack of labeled training data, we use a pseudo-labeling\napproach to annotate useful historical queries based on their impact on the\nretrieval results.

Using a new family of hash functions, we develop one of the\nfirst private, personalized, and memory-efficient on-device LSH frameworks. Our\nframework enables privacy and personalization by allowing each device to\ngenerate hash tables, without the help of a central host, using device-specific\nhashing hyper-parameters (e.g. number of hash tables or hash length).

Algorithmic and learning procedures that have been developed to\nproduce optimal policies mainly focus on finite state settings, and do not\ndirectly apply to these models. To overcome this lacuna, in this work we study\nthe problem of optimal control of a family of discrete-time countable\nstate-space Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) governed by an unknown parameter\n$\\theta\\in\\Theta$, and defined on a countably-infinite state space $\\mathcal\nX=\\mathbb{Z}_+^d$, with finite action space $\\mathcal A$, and an unbounded cost\nfunction. We take a Bayesian perspective with the random unknown parameter\n$\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^*$ generated via a given fixed prior distribution on\n$\\Theta$. To optimally control the unknown MDP, we propose an algorithm based\non Thompson sampling with dynamically-sized episodes: at the beginning of each\nepisode, the posterior distribution formed via Bayes' rule is used to produce a\nparameter estimate, which then decides the policy applied during the episode.\nTo ensure the stability of the Markov chain obtained by following the policy\nchosen for each parameter, we impose ergodicity assumptions.

Finally, to elucidate\nthe applicability of our algorithm, we consider two different queuing models\nwith unknown dynamics, and show that our algorithm can be applied to develop\napproximately optimal control algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 03:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

To address this\noverfitting issue, we propose divided spectro-temporal attention. In comparison\nto the baseline method, which utilizes a convolutional recurrent neural network\n(CRNN) followed by a temporal multi-head self-attention layer (MHSA), we\nintroduce a separate spectral attention layer that aggregates spectral features\nprior to the temporal MHSA. To achieve efficient spectral attention, we reduce\nthe frequency pooling size in the convolutional encoder of the baseline to\nobtain a 3D tensor that incorporates information about frequency, time, and\nchannel. As a result, we can implement spectral attention with channel\nembeddings, which is not possible in the baseline method dealing with only\ntemporal context in the RNN and MHSA layers. We demonstrate that the proposed\ndivided spectro-temporal attention significantly improves the performance of\nsound event detection and localization scores for real test data from the\nSTARSS23 development dataset.

This competition is widely thought to be\ncontrolled by \"packing frustration\" -- the incompatibility of uniformly filling\nmelts with a locally preferred chain packing motif. Here, we reassess the\nthermodynamics of cubic network formation in strongly-segregated diblock melts,\nbased on a recently developed medial strong segregation theory (\"mSST\")\napproach that directly connects the shape and thermodynamics of chain packing\nenvironments to the medial geometry of tubular network surfaces.

Very recent advances in artificial\nintelligence have resulted in code generation models that can produce source\ncode from natural language problem descriptions -- with impressive accuracy in\nmany cases. The wide availability of these models and their ease of use has\nraised concerns about potential impacts on many aspects of society, including\nthe future of computing education. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and\nopportunities such models present to computing educators, with a focus on\nintroductory programming classrooms. We summarize the results of two recent\narticles, the first evaluating the performance of code generation models on\ntypical introductory-level programming problems, and the second exploring the\nquality and novelty of learning resources generated by these models. We\nconsider likely impacts of such models upon pedagogical practice in the context\nof the most recent advances at the time of writing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 05:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Population update is a key component in\nmulti-objective EAs (MOEAs), and it is performed in a greedy, deterministic\nmanner. That is, the next-generation population is formed by selecting the\nfirst population-size ranked solutions (based on some selection criteria, e.g.,\nnon-dominated sorting, crowdedness and indicators) from the collections of the\ncurrent population and newly-generated solutions. In this paper, we question\nthis practice. We analytically present that introducing randomness into the\npopulation update procedure in MOEAs can be beneficial for the search. More\nspecifically, we prove that the expected running time of a well-established\nMOEA (SMS-EMOA) for solving a commonly studied bi-objective problem,\nOneJumpZeroJump, can be exponentially decreased if replacing its deterministic\npopulation update mechanism by a stochastic one. Empirical studies also verify\nthe effectiveness of the proposed stochastic population update method. This\nwork is an attempt to challenge a common practice for the population update in\nMOEAs.

Embracing transformative technologies such\nas Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language\nModels (LLMs) can potentially strengthen cyber security policies for Australian\nSMEs. However, their practical application, advantages, and limitations remain\nunderexplored, with prior research mainly focusing on large corporations.

With the growing concerns of algorithmic fairness, RSs are not only\nexpected to deliver high-quality personalized content, but are also demanded\nnot to discriminate against users based on their demographic information.\nHowever, existing RSs could capture undesirable correlations between sensitive\nfeatures and observed user behaviors, leading to biased recommendations. Most\nfair RSs tackle this problem by completely blocking the influences of sensitive\nfeatures on recommendations. But since sensitive features may also affect user\ninterests in a fair manner (e.g., race on culture-based preferences),\nindiscriminately eliminating all the influences of sensitive features\ninevitably degenerate the recommendations quality and necessary diversities. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a path-specific fair RS (PSF-RS) for\nrecommendations. Specifically, we summarize all fair and unfair correlations\nbetween sensitive features and observed ratings into two latent proxy\nmediators, where the concept of path-specific bias (PS-Bias) is defined based\non path-specific counterfactual inference. Inspired by Pearl's minimal change\nprinciple, we address the PS-Bias by minimally transforming the biased factual\nworld into a hypothetically fair world, where a fair RS model can be learned\naccordingly by solving a constrained optimization problem. For the technical\npart, we propose a feasible implementation of PSF-RS, i.e., PSF-VAE, with\nweakly-supervised variational inference, which robustly infers the latent\nmediators such that unfairness can be mitigated while necessary recommendation\ndiversities can be maximally preserved simultaneously. Experiments conducted on\nsemi-simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PSF-RS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 06:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Recently, the SOT induced\ndeterministic switching of the CoPt single layer has attracts a lot of\ninterests, as it could simplifies the structure and add new flexibility in the\ndesign of SOT devices, compared with the Ferromagnet/Heavy metal bilayer\ncounterparts. Unfortunately, under the field-free switching strategies used\nnowadays, the switching of the CoPt layer is often partial, which sets a major\nobstacle for the practical applications. In this study, by growing the CoPt on\nvicinal substrates, we could achieve the full-scale (100% switching ratio)\nfield-free switching of the CoPt layer. We demonstrate that when grown on\nvicinal substrates, the magnetic easy axis of the CoPt could be tilted from the\nnormal direction of the film plane; the strength of Dzyaloshinskii Moriya\ninteraction (DMI) would be also be tuned as well. Micromagnetic simulation\nfurther reveal that the field-free switching stems from tilted magnetic\nanisotropy induced by the vicinal substrate, while the enhancement of DMI help\nreducing the critical switching current. In addition, we also found that the\nvicinal substrates could also enhance the SOT efficiency.

Two experiments were designed to\ncharacterize the effect of this musical augmentation on human users. In the\nfirst experiment, a robot performed three tasks while playing three different\nsound mappings. Results showed that participants observing the robot perceived\nit as more safe, animate, intelligent, anthropomorphic, and likable when\nplaying the Music Mode Orchestral software. To test whether the results of the\nfirst experiment were due to the Music Mode algorithm, rather than music alone,\nwe conducted a second experiment.

At an interface between two crystals of\nopposite valley phases, the so-called valley topological edge states emerge,\nand they have been proven useful for wave transport with robustness against 120\ndegree bending and a certain level of disorder. However, whether these\nattractive transport features are bound with the valley topology or due to\ntopological-irrelevant mechanisms remains unclear. In this letter, we discuss\nthis question by examining transport properties of photonic edge states with\nvaried degrees of the P-breaking that tune the valley topology, and reveal that\nthe edge states preserve their transport robustness insensitive to the topology\neven when the P-symmetry is recovered. Instead, a unique modal character of the\nedge states--with localized momentum hotspots around high-symmetric K (K')\npoints--is recognized to play the key role, which only concerns the existence\nof the valleys in the bulk band structures, and has no special requirement on\nthe topology. The \"non-topological\" notion of valley edge states is introduced\nto conceptualize this modal character, leading to a coherent understanding of\nbending immunity in a range of edge modes implemented in C3 symmetric\ncrystals--such as valley topological edge states, topological edge states of 2D\nZak phase, topological-trivial edge states and so on--, and to new designs in\ngeneral rhombic lattices--with exemplified bending angle as large as 150\ndegree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 07:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

In addition to clarifying that the\nCheerios effect is neither sufficient nor essential for the ant raft, we\nperform the force-displacement and creep experiments on the ant raft and\nconcentrate on unearthing properties that derive from the unique combination of\nself-healing and activeness of its constituent. Varying pull speed results in\ndistinct mechanical responses and fracture patterns, characteristic of ductile\nand brittle material.

The latter information reveals that the\npull force expedites the alignment of fire ants, in analogy to the effect of an\nelectric field on liquid crystal polymers. In addition, the raft can be\ntailored not to transversely deform in response to the axial strain. Without\nresorting to specific geometry structures, this property of zero Poisson's\nratio is enabled by the active recruitment of ants from the top to bottom layer\nto keep the raft from disintegrating. Furthermore, effective Young's modulus\ncan also be customized and is proportion to either the raft length or its\ninverse, depending on whether the raft is in the elastic or plastic region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 07:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Existing methods often take a common\nassumption that the data from different hospitals have the same modalities.\nHowever, such a setting is difficult to fully satisfy in practical\napplications, since the imaging guidelines may be different between hospitals,\nwhich makes the number of individuals with the same set of modalities limited.\nTo this end, we formulate this practical-yet-challenging cross-modal vertical\nfederated learning task, in which shape data from multiple hospitals have\ndifferent modalities with a small amount of multi-modality data collected from\nthe same individuals. To tackle such a situation, we develop a novel framework,\nnamely Federated Consistent Regularization constrained Feature Disentanglement\n(Fed-CRFD), for boosting MRI reconstruction by effectively exploring the\noverlapping samples (individuals with multi-modalities) and solving the domain\nshift problem caused by different modalities. Particularly, our Fed-CRFD\ninvolves an intra-client feature disentangle scheme to decouple data into\nmodality-invariant and modality-specific features, where the modality-invariant\nfeatures are leveraged to mitigate the domain shift problem. In addition, a\ncross-client latent representation consistency constraint is proposed\nspecifically for the overlapping samples to further align the\nmodality-invariant features extracted from different modalities. Hence, our\nmethod can fully exploit the multi-source data from hospitals while alleviating\nthe domain shift problem. Extensive experiments on two typical MRI datasets\ndemonstrate that our network clearly outperforms state-of-the-art MRI\nreconstruction methods.

Of the different types of coupling that are often important,\nspin-lattice coupling is relevant to several sub-fields of condensed matter\nphysics; examples include spintronics, high-TC superconductivity, and\ntopological materials. While theories of materials where spin-lattice coupling\nis relevant can sometimes be used to infer the magnitude and character of this\ninteraction, experimental approaches that can directly measure it are rare and\nincomplete. Here we use time-resolved X-ray diffraction to directly access the\nspin-lattice coupling by measuring both ultrafast atomic motion and the\nassociated spin dynamics following the excitation of a coherent electromagnon\nby an intense THz pulse in a multiferroic hexaferrite. Comparing the dynamics\nof the two different components, one striking outcome is the different phase\nshifts relative to the driving field. This phase shift provides insight into\nthe excitation process of such a coupled mode.

Generally, fully-supervised algorithms for this\ntask require pixel-wise manual annotations, which is especially time-consuming\nand laborious for the high nuclei density. To alleviate the annotation burden,\nwe seek to solve the problem through image-level weakly supervised learning,\nwhich is underexplored for nuclei instance segmentation. Compared with most\nexisting methods using other weak annotations (scribble, point, etc.) for\nnuclei instance segmentation, our method is more labor-saving. The obstacle to\nusing image-level annotations in nuclei instance segmentation is the lack of\nadequate location information, leading to severe nuclei omission or overlaps.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel image-level weakly supervised method, called\ncyclic learning, to solve this problem. Cyclic learning comprises a front-end\nclassification task and a back-end semi-supervised instance segmentation task\nto benefit from multi-task learning (MTL). We utilize a deep learning\nclassifier with interpretability as the front-end to convert image-level labels\nto sets of high-confidence pseudo masks and establish a semi-supervised\narchitecture as the back-end to conduct nuclei instance segmentation under the\nsupervision of these pseudo masks. Most importantly, cyclic learning is\ndesigned to circularly share knowledge between the front-end classifier and the\nback-end semi-supervised part, which allows the whole system to fully extract\nthe underlying information from image-level labels and converge to a better\noptimum. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate the good generality of our\nmethod, which outperforms other image-level weakly supervised methods for\nnuclei instance segmentation, and achieves comparable performance to\nfully-supervised methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 08:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Despite their efficacy, they still fall short in comparison to\nfully supervised counterparts and are generally brittle to slight\nmodifications.

Our\nframework draws a precise decision boundary without accessing weights or\ngradients of the LM model or data labels. The core ideas of CELDA are twofold:\n(1) extracting a refined pseudo-labeled dataset from an unlabeled dataset, and\n(2) training a lightweight and robust model on the top of LM, which learns an\naccurate decision boundary from an extracted noisy dataset. Throughout in-depth\ninvestigations on various datasets, we demonstrated that CELDA reaches new\nstate-of-the-art in weakly-supervised text classification and narrows the gap\nwith a fully-supervised model.

For this\nwe consider the infinite sequence of all flat, Euclidean spacetimes\n$\\mathbb{R}^{d'}$ with $d'\\geq d$, and postulate a probability distribution for\neach $d'$ to occur. The distribution considered is that of a canonical ensemble\nat temperature $T$, the energy levels those of a 1-dimensional harmonic\noscillator. Since both the harmonic energy levels and the spacetime dimensions\nare evenly spaced, one can identify the canonical distribution of\nharmonic-oscillator eigenvalues with that of dimensions $d'$. The state\ndescribing this statistical ensemble has a mean square deviation in the\nposition operator, that can be interpreted as a quantum of length. Thus placing\nan oscillator in thermal equilibrium with a bath provides a thermal mechanism\nwhereby a zero-point length is generated.

To answer s-distance\nqueries, we first explore an oracle based on the line graph of the given\nhypergraph and discuss its limitations: the main one is that the line graph is\ntypically orders of magnitude larger than the original hypergraph. We then\nintroduce HypED, a landmark-based oracle with a predefined size, built directly\non the hypergraph, thus avoiding constructing the line graph. Our framework\nallows to approximately answer vertex-to-vertex, vertex-to-hyperedge, and\nhyperedge-to-hyperedge s-distance queries for any value of s. A key observation\nat the basis of our framework is that, as s increases, the hypergraph becomes\nmore fragmented. We show how this can be exploited to improve the placement of\nlandmarks, by identifying the s-connected components of the hypergraph. For\nthis task, we devise an efficient algorithm based on the union-find technique\nand a dynamic inverted index. We experimentally evaluate HypED on several\nreal-world hypergraphs and prove its versatility in answering s-distance\nqueries for different values of s. Our framework allows answering such queries\nin fractions of a millisecond, while allowing fine-grained control of the\ntrade-off between index size and approximation error at creation time.

Although FL has demonstrated remarkable success in\nvarious scenarios, recent studies mainly utilize shallow and small neural\nnetworks. In our research, we discover a significant performance decline when\napplying the existing FL framework to deeper neural networks, even when client\ndata are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Our further\ninvestigation shows that the decline is due to the continuous accumulation of\ndissimilarities among client models during the layer-by-layer back-propagation\nprocess, which we refer to as \"divergence accumulation.\" As deeper models\ninvolve a longer chain of divergence accumulation, they tend to manifest\ngreater divergence, subsequently leading to performance decline. Both\ntheoretical derivations and empirical evidence are proposed to support the\nexistence of divergence accumulation and its amplified effects in deeper\nmodels. To address this issue, we propose several technical guidelines based on\nreducing divergence, such as using wider models and reducing the receptive\nfield.

Therefore, it is advisable to make use of\nunsupervised or semi-supervised methods, especially for semi-supervised\nlearning which utilizes unsupervised learning as a feature extraction mechanism\nto aid the supervised part when only a small number of labels are available.\nThis study systematically compares semi-supervised learning methods applied for\nanomaly detection in hydraulic condition monitoring systems. Firstly, thorough\ndata analysis and feature learning were carried out to understand the\nopen-sourced hydraulic condition monitoring dataset. Then, various methods were\nimplemented and evaluated including traditional stand-alone semi-supervised\nlearning models (e.g., one-class SVM, Robust Covariance), ensemble models\n(e.g., Isolation Forest), and deep neural network based models (e.g.,\nautoencoder, Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (HELM)).

We first show that the marginal coverage guarantee of conformal\nprediction holds on imputed data for any missingness distribution and almost\nall imputation functions. However, we emphasize that the average coverage\nvaries depending on the pattern of missing values: conformal methods tend to\nconstruct prediction intervals that under-cover the response conditionally to\nsome missing patterns. This motivates our novel generalized conformalized\nquantile regression framework, missing data augmentation, which yields\nprediction intervals that are valid conditionally to the patterns of missing\nvalues, despite their exponential number.

Most existing methods\nattempt to model the changes of the environment explicitly, often requiring\nimpractical prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new perspective,\npositing that non-stationarity can propagate and accumulate through complex\ncausal relationships during state transitions, thereby compounding its\nsophistication and affecting policy learning. We believe that this challenge\ncan be more effectively addressed by tracing the causal origin of\nnon-stationarity. To this end, we introduce the Causal-Origin REPresentation\n(COREP) algorithm. COREP primarily employs a guided updating mechanism to learn\na stable graph representation for states termed as causal-origin\nrepresentation.

Specifically, the semantic ambiguity causes inconsistent\nannotation and negatively affects the model's convergence, leading to worse\naccuracy and instability prediction. To solve this problem, we propose a\nSelf-adapTive Ambiguity Reduction (STAR) loss by exploiting the properties of\nsemantic ambiguity. We find that semantic ambiguity results in the anisotropic\npredicted distribution, which inspires us to use predicted distribution to\nrepresent semantic ambiguity. Based on this, we design the STAR loss that\nmeasures the anisotropism of the predicted distribution. Compared with the\nstandard regression loss, STAR loss is encouraged to be small when the\npredicted distribution is anisotropic and thus adaptively mitigates the impact\nof semantic ambiguity. Moreover, we propose two kinds of eigenvalue restriction\nmethods that could avoid both distribution's abnormal change and the model's\npremature convergence. Finally, the comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nSTAR loss outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks, i.e.,\nCOFW, 300W, and WFLW, with negligible computation overhead.

Subsequently, BAD-X,\nan extension of the MAD-X framework, achieves improved transfer at the cost of\nMAD-X's modularity by creating \"bilingual\" adapters specific to the\nsource-target language pair. In this work, we aim to take the best of both\nworlds by (i) fine-tuning task adapters adapted to the target language(s)\n(so-called \"target language-ready\" (TLR) adapters) to maintain high transfer\nperformance, but (ii) without sacrificing the highly modular design of MAD-X.\nThe main idea of \"target language-ready\" adapters is to resolve the\ntraining-vs-inference discrepancy of MAD-X: the task adapter \"sees\" the target\nlanguage adapter for the very first time during inference, and thus might not\nbe fully compatible with it. We address this mismatch by exposing the task\nadapter to the target language adapter during training, and empirically\nvalidate several variants of the idea: in the simplest form, we alternate\nbetween using the source and target language adapters during task adapter\ntraining, which can be generalized to cycling over any set of language\nadapters. We evaluate different TLR-based transfer configurations with varying\ndegrees of generality across a suite of standard cross-lingual benchmarks, and\nfind that the most general (and thus most modular) configuration consistently\noutperforms MAD-X and BAD-X on most tasks and languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 10:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

We analyse the damping of coronal oscillations using a\nself-consistent 3D radiation-MHD simulation of the solar atmosphere spanning\nfrom the convection zone into the corona, the associated oscillation\ndissipation and heating, and finally the physical processes responsible for the\ndamping and dissipation.

Therefore, an extended analysis of the EUV magneto-optics\nis necessary. Via experimental determination of the dielectric tensor, we find\nhere that the non-equilibrium excitation in an ultrafast magnetization\nexperiment can cause a rotation of the off-diagonal element of the dielectric\ntensor in the complex plane.

We showcase such critical\nobservations for the case of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in Ni, and give\nguidelines for the future analysis of spectrally-resolved magneto-optical data\nand its comparison with theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 11:22:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 07:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Existing methods typically convert the OTS problem into a\nMixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) using big-M constants. However, the\ncomputational performance of these approaches relies significantly on the\ntightness of these big-Ms. In this paper, we propose an iterative tightening\nstrategy to strengthen the big-Ms by efficiently solving a series of bounding\nproblems that account for the economics of the OTS objective function through\nan upper-bound on the generating cost. We also discuss how the performance of\nthe proposed tightening strategy is enhanced if reduced line capacities are\nconsidered. Using the 118-bus test system we demonstrate that the proposed\nmethodology outperforms existing approaches, offering tighter bounds and\nsignificantly reducing the computational burden of the OTS problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 11:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

In\naddition to desiderata with respect to the counterfactual instance itself, the\nexistence of a viable path connecting it with the factual data point, known as\nalgorithmic recourse, has become an important technical consideration. While\nboth of these requirements ensure that the steps of the journey as well as its\ndestination are admissible, current literature neglects the multiplicity of\nsuch counterfactual paths.

One common way to improve this\ntransfer is to perform realignment steps before fine-tuning, i.e., to train the\nmodel to build similar representations for pairs of words from translated\nsentences. But such realignment methods were found to not always improve\nresults across languages and tasks, which raises the question of whether\naligned representations are truly beneficial for cross-lingual transfer. We\nprovide evidence that alignment is actually significantly correlated with\ncross-lingual transfer across languages, models and random seeds. We show that\nfine-tuning can have a significant impact on alignment, depending mainly on the\ndownstream task and the model. Finally, we show that realignment can, in some\ninstances, improve cross-lingual transfer, and we identify conditions in which\nrealignment methods provide significant improvements. Namely, we find that\nrealignment works better on tasks for which alignment is correlated with\ncross-lingual transfer when generalizing to a distant language and with smaller\nmodels, as well as when using a bilingual dictionary rather than FastAlign to\nextract realignment pairs. For example, for POS-tagging, between English and\nArabic, realignment can bring a +15.8 accuracy improvement on distilmBERT, even\noutperforming XLM-R Large by 1.7.

For example, while the\nquality of a model is commonly determined by the average loss assessed on a\ntesting set, this quantity does not reflect the existence of the true mean of\nthe loss distribution. Indeed, the finiteness of the statistical moments of the\nloss distribution is related to the thickness of its tails, which are generally\nunknown. Since typical cross-validation schemes determine a family of testing\nloss distributions conditioned on the training samples, the total loss\ndistribution must be recovered by marginalizing over the space of training\nsets. As we show in this work, the finiteness of the sampling procedure\nnegatively affects the reliability and efficiency of classical tail estimation\nmethods from the Extreme Value Theory, such as the Peaks-Over-Threshold\napproach. In this work we tackle this issue by developing a novel general\ntheory for estimating the tails of marginal distributions, when there exists a\nlarge variability between locations of the individual conditional distributions\nunderlying the marginal. To this end, we demonstrate that under some regularity\nconditions, the shape parameter of the marginal distribution is the maximum\ntail shape parameter of the family of conditional distributions. We term this\nestimation approach as Cross Tail Estimation (CTE). We test cross-tail\nestimation in a series of experiments on simulated and real data, showing the\nimproved robustness and quality of tail estimation as compared to classical\napproaches, and providing evidence for the relationship between overfitting and\nloss distribution tail thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 11:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

The recent invention of differentiable\nscore-based DAG learners is a crucial enabler, which reframes the combinatorial\noptimization problem into a differentiable optimization with a DAG constraint\nover directed graph space. Despite their great success, these cutting-edge DAG\nlearners incorporate DAG-ness independent score functions to evaluate the\ndirected graph candidates, lacking in considering graph structure. As a result,\nmeasuring the data fitness alone regardless of DAG-ness inevitably leads to\ndiscovering suboptimal DAGs and model vulnerabilities. Towards this end, we\npropose a dynamic causal space for DAG structure learning, coined CASPER, that\nintegrates the graph structure into the score function as a new measure in the\ncausal space to faithfully reflect the causal distance between estimated and\nground truth DAG. CASPER revises the learning process as well as enhances the\nDAG structure learning via adaptive attention to DAG-ness. Grounded by\nempirical visualization, CASPER, as a space, satisfies a series of desired\nproperties, such as structure awareness and noise robustness. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets clearly validate the\nsuperiority of our CASPER over the state-of-the-art causal discovery methods in\nterms of accuracy and robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 12:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Sparse-MoEs select a subset of the \"experts\" (thus, only a portion of\nthe overall network) for each input sample using a sparse, trainable gate.\nExisting sparse gates are prone to convergence and performance issues when\ntraining with first-order optimization methods. In this paper, we introduce two\nimprovements to current MoE approaches. First, we propose a new sparse gate:\nCOMET, which relies on a novel tree-based mechanism. COMET is differentiable,\ncan exploit sparsity to speed up computation, and outperforms state-of-the-art\ngates. Second, due to the challenging combinatorial nature of sparse expert\nselection, first-order methods are typically prone to low-quality solutions. To\ndeal with this challenge, we propose a novel, permutation-based local search\nmethod that can complement first-order methods in training any sparse gate,\ne.g., Hash routing, Top-k, DSelect-k, and COMET. We show that local search can\nhelp networks escape bad initializations or solutions. We performed large-scale\nexperiments on various domains, including recommender systems, vision, and\nnatural language processing. On standard vision and recommender systems\nbenchmarks, COMET+ (COMET with local search) achieves up to 13% improvement in\nROC AUC over popular gates, e.g., Hash routing and Top-k, and up to 9% over\nprior differentiable gates e.g., DSelect-k. When Top-k and Hash gates are\ncombined with local search, we see up to $100\\times$ reduction in the budget\nneeded for hyperparameter tuning.

This paper takes the traffic congestion\nanalysis as a concrete case, where a traffic intersection is usually regarded\nas a DAG. In a road network of multiple intersections, different intersections\ncan only have some overlapping and distinct variables observed. For example, a\nsignalized intersection has traffic light-related variables, whereas\nunsignalized ones do not. This encourages the multi-task design: with each DAG\nas a task, the MM-DAG tries to learn the multiple DAGs jointly so that their\nconsensus and consistency are maximized.

In these reactors,\nthere is already some amount of water moderator between the uranium fuel and\nthe irradiated sample.

Since it is difficult to annotate\nrecommendation-oriented dialogue datasets, existing CRS approaches often suffer\nfrom the issue of insufficient training due to the scarcity of training data.\nTo address this issue, in this paper, we propose a CounterFactual data\nsimulation approach for CRS, named CFCRS, to alleviate the issue of data\nscarcity in CRSs. Our approach is developed based on the framework of\ncounterfactual data augmentation, which gradually incorporates the rewriting to\nthe user preference from a real dialogue without interfering with the entire\nconversation flow. To develop our approach, we characterize user preference and\norganize the conversation flow by the entities involved in the dialogue, and\ndesign a multi-stage recommendation dialogue simulator based on a conversation\nflow language model. Under the guidance of the learned user preference and\ndialogue schema, the flow language model can produce reasonable, coherent\nconversation flows, which can be further realized into complete dialogues.\nBased on the simulator, we perform the intervention at the representations of\nthe interacted entities of target users, and design an adversarial training\nmethod with a curriculum schedule that can gradually optimize the data\naugmentation strategy.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel asymmetric patch sampling strategy for\ncontrastive learning, to further boost the appearance asymmetry for better\nrepresentations. Specifically, dual patch sampling strategies are applied to\nthe given image, to obtain asymmetric positive pairs. First, sparse patch\nsampling is conducted to obtain the first view, which reduces spatial\nredundancy of image and allows a more asymmetric view. Second, a selective\npatch sampling is proposed to construct another view with large appearance\ndiscrepancy relative to the first one.

In contrary to\nequivariant architectures, we use an arbitrary base model (such as an MLP or a\ntransformer) and symmetrize it to be equivariant to the given group by\nemploying a small equivariant network that parameterizes the probabilistic\ndistribution underlying the symmetrization. The distribution is end-to-end\ntrained with the base model which can maximize performance while reducing\nsample complexity of symmetrization. We show that this approach ensures not\nonly equivariance to given group but also universal approximation capability in\nexpectation. We implement our method on a simple patch-based transformer that\ncan be initialized from pretrained vision transformers, and test it for a wide\nrange of symmetry groups including permutation and Euclidean groups and their\ncombinations. Empirical tests show competitive results against tailored\nequivariant architectures, suggesting the potential for learning equivariant\nfunctions for diverse groups using a non-equivariant universal base\narchitecture.

Recent models\nsuch as CoCondenser, RetroMAE, and LexMAE argue that the MLM task is not\nsufficient enough to pre-train a transformer network for retrieval and hence\npropose various tasks to do so. Intrigued by those novel methods, we noticed\nthat all these models used different finetuning protocols, making it hard to\nassess the benefits of middle training. We propose in this paper a benchmark of\nCoCondenser, RetroMAE, and LexMAE, under the same finetuning conditions. We\ncompare both dense and sparse approaches under various finetuning protocols and\nmiddle training on different collections (MS MARCO, Wikipedia or Tripclick). We\nuse additional middle training baselines, such as a standard MLM finetuning on\nthe retrieval collection, optionally augmented by a CLS predicting the passage\nterm frequency. For the sparse approach, our study reveals that there is almost\nno statistical difference between those methods: the more effective the\nfinetuning procedure is, the less difference there is between those models. For\nthe dense approach, RetroMAE using MS MARCO as middle-training collection shows\nexcellent results in almost all the settings. Finally, we show that middle\ntraining on the retrieval collection, thus adapting the language model to it,\nis a critical factor. Overall, a better experimental setup should be adopted to\nevaluate middle training methods.

Even though we may not care whether a company operates online or\nin the physical world, however, the question has dramatic consequences for the\ncompanies themselves. Online and offline entities are governed by different\nrules. Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, online entities --\nbut not physical-world entities -- are immune from lawsuits related to content\nauthored by their users or customers. As a result, online entities have been\nable to avoid claims for harms caused by their negligence and defective product\ndesigns simply because they operate online.\n  The reason for the disparate treatment is the internet's dramatic evolution\nover the last two decades. The internet of 1996 served as an information\nrepository and communications channel and was well governed by Section 230,\nwhich treats internet entities as another form of mass media: Because Facebook,\nTwitter and other online companies could not possibly review the mass of\ncontent that flows through their systems, Section 230 immunizes them from\nclaims related to user content. But content distribution is not the internet's\nonly function, and it is even less so now than it was in 1996. The internet\nalso operates as a platform for the delivery of real-world goods and services\nand requires a correspondingly diverse immunity doctrine. This Article proposes\nrefining online immunity by limiting it to claims that threaten to impose a\ncontent-moderation burden on internet defendants. Where a claim is preventable\nother than by content moderation -- for example, by redesigning an app or\nwebsite -- a plaintiff could freely seek relief, just as in the physical world.\nThis approach empowers courts to identify culpable actors in the virtual world\nand treat like conduct alike wherever it occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 13:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

However, collecting a wide variety of low-light/clean paired images is\ntedious as the scene needs to remain static during imaging. In this paper, we\npropose an unsupervised low-light enhancement network using contextguided\nillumination-adaptive norm (CIN). Inspired by coarse to fine methods, we\npropose to address this task in two stages. In stage-I, a pixel amplifier\nmodule (PAM) is used to generate a coarse estimate with an overall improvement\nin visibility and aesthetic quality. Stage-II further enhances the saturated\ndark pixels and scene properties of the image using CIN. Different ablation\nstudies show the importance of PAM and CIN in improving the visible quality of\nthe image. Next, we propose a region-adaptive single input multiple output\n(SIMO) model that can generate multiple enhanced images from a single lowlight\nimage. The objective of SIMO is to let users choose the image of their liking\nfrom a pool of enhanced images. Human subjective analysis of SIMO results shows\nthat the distribution of preferred images varies, endorsing the importance of\nSIMO-type models. Lastly, we propose a low-light road scene (LLRS) dataset\nhaving an unpaired collection of low-light and clean scenes. Unlike existing\ndatasets, the clean and low-light scenes in LLRS are real and captured using\nfixed camera settings. Exhaustive comparisons on publicly available datasets,\nand the proposed dataset reveal that the results of our model outperform prior\nart quantitatively and qualitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 13:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

The stochastic processes we are interested in are akin to Brownian\nMotion and can be described by an overdamped Langevin equation comprised of a\ndeterministic drift term and a random noise term. In Part I we examine\nstochastic processes in the Mesoscale. For us this means that the Langevin\nequation is driven by thermal noise, with amplitude proportional to the\ntemperature $T$ and there exists a genuine equilibrium thermal state. We apply\na technique known as the Functional Renormalisation Group (FRG) which allows us\nto coarse-grain in temporal scales. We describe how to obtain effective\nequations of motion for the 1- and 2-point functions of a particle evolving in\nhighly non-trivial potentials and verify their accuracy by comparison to direct\nnumerical simulations. In this way we outline a novel procedure for describing\nthe behaviour of stochastic processes without having to resort to time\nconsuming numerical simulations. In Part II we turn to the Early Universe and\nin particular examine stochastic processes occurring during a period of\naccelerated expansion known as inflation. This inflationary period is driven by\na scalar field called the inflaton which also obeys a Langevin equation in the\nStochastic Inflation formalism. We use this to study the formation of\nPrimordial Black Holes during a period of Ultra Slow-Roll. We finish this\nthesis by applying the techniques developed in Part I to a spectator field\nduring inflation. FRG techniques can compute cosmologically relevant\nobservables such as the power spectrum and spectral tilt. We also extend the\nFRG formalism to solve first-passage time problems and verify that it gives the\ncorrect prediction for the average time taken for a field (or particle) to\novercome a barrier in the potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 13:53:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

However,\nusing a LoRa-based IoT network for SAR operations will have a limited coverage\ncaused by high signal attenuation due to the terrestrial blockages especially\nin highly remote areas.

In this paper,\nthe problem of the flying LoRa (FL) gateway control in the search-and-rescue\nsystem using the UAV-assisted LoRa network is modeled as a partially observable\nMarkov decision process.

However, they are known to be vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks -- small perturbations to the input that lead to a change in\nclassification. We address this issue from the perspective of backward error\nand condition number, concepts that have proved useful in numerical analysis.\nTo do this, we build on the work of Beuzeville et al. (2021). In particular, we\ndevelop a new class of attack algorithms that use componentwise relative\nperturbations. Such attacks are highly relevant in the case of handwritten\ndocuments or printed texts where, for example, the classification of\nsignatures, postcodes, dates or numerical quantities may be altered by changing\nonly the ink consistency and not the background. This makes the perturbed\nimages look natural to the naked eye. Such ``adversarial ink'' attacks\ntherefore reveal a weakness that can have a serious impact on safety and\nsecurity. We illustrate the new attacks on real data and contrast them with\nexisting algorithms. We also study the use of a componentwise condition number\nto quantify vulnerability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 14:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Different\nfactors affect the quality of satellite images, including changes in\natmosphere, surface reflectance, sun illumination, viewing geometries etc.,\nlimiting its application to downstream tasks. In supervised networks, the\navailability of paired datasets is a strong assumption. Consequently, many\nunsupervised algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. These\nmethods synthetically generate a large dataset of degraded images using image\nformation models. A neural network is then trained with an adversarial loss to\ndiscriminate between images from distorted and clean domains. However, these\nmethods yield suboptimal performance when tested on real images that do not\nnecessarily conform to the generation mechanism. Also, they require a large\namount of training data and are rendered unsuitable when only a few images are\navailable. We propose a distortion disentanglement and knowledge distillation\nframework for satellite image restoration to address these important issues.\nOur algorithm requires only two images: the distorted satellite image to be\nrestored and a reference image with similar semantics. Specifically, we first\npropose a mechanism to disentangle distortion. This enables us to generate\nimages with varying degrees of distortion using the disentangled distortion and\nthe reference image. We then propose the use of knowledge distillation to train\na restoration network using the generated image pairs. As a final step, the\ndistorted image is passed through the restoration network to get the final\noutput. Ablation studies show that our proposed mechanism successfully\ndisentangles distortion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 14:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

This extension can be achieved by allowing the\norientation of spatial hypersurfaces to dynamically change. Furthermore, a\ncrucial aspect of the analysis revolves around the formulation of the dynamical\nequations in terms of physical degrees of freedom, demonstrating their\nregularity at the singularity. Remarkably, singular behavior is found to be\nconfined solely to the gauge/unphysical degrees of freedom. This paper extends\nthese results to gravity coupled with Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields in a\nsymmetry-reduced model (homogeneous anisotropic universe). Near the Big Bang,\nthe dynamics of the geometry and the gauge fields is reformulated in a way that\nshows that determinism is preserved, assuming a change in orientation at the\nsingularity. The gauge fields are demonstrated to maintain their orientation\nthroughout the singularity, indicating that the predicted orientation change of\nspatial hypersurfaces holds physical significance. This observation suggests\nthat an observer can discern the specific side of the Big Bang they inhabit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 15:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

However, these approaches require a closed-form\nexpression of the degradation model and can not support complex degradations.\nTo overcome this limitation, we propose a method (INDigo) that combines\ninvertible neural networks (INN) and diffusion models for general inverse\nproblems. Specifically, we train the forward process of INN to simulate an\narbitrary degradation process and use the inverse as a reconstruction process.\nDuring the diffusion sampling process, we impose an additional data-consistency\nstep that minimizes the distance between the intermediate result and the\nINN-optimized result at every iteration, where the INN-optimized image is\ncomposed of the coarse information given by the observed degraded image and the\ndetails generated by the diffusion process.

Being a\nspace-based telescope, the TESS observations are devoid of any noise component\nresulting from the interference of Earth's atmosphere. TESS also provides a\nbetter probability to observe subsequent transit events owing to its longer\nuninterrupted time-series observations compared to the ground-based telescopes.\nEspecially, for the exoplanets around bright host-stars, TESS time-series\nobservations provides high SNR lightcurves, which can be used for higher\nprecision studies for these exoplanets. In this work, I have studied the TESS\ntransit photometric follow-up observations of 28 exoplanets around bright stars\nwith $V_{mag}\\le$10. The already high SNR lightcurves from TESS have been\nfurther processed with a critical noise treatment algorithm, using the wavelet\ndenoising and the Gaussian-process regression techniques, to effectively reduce\nthe noise components both correlated and uncorrelated in time, which were then\nused to estimate the physical properties of these exoplanets. The study has\nresulted in very precise values for the physical properties of the target\nexoplanets, with the improvements in precision being significant for most of\nthe cases compared to the previous studies. Also, since a comparatively large\nnumber of transit lightcurves from TESS observations were used to estimate\nthese physical properties for each of the target exoplanets, which removes any\nbias due to the lack of sufficient datasets, these updated physical properties\ncan be considered extremely accurate and reliable for future studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 15:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

It is natural to ask whether this is warranted, or an artifact.\n  For many such settings, we propose a first set of lower bounds which indeed\nconfirm that (negative) curvature is detrimental to complexity.

In contrast, the\nstandard Analog Neural Networks (ANNs1) fail to process event data effectively.\nHowever, training SNNs is difficult due to additional trainable parameters\n(thresholds and leaks), vanishing spikes at deeper layers, non-differentiable\nbinary activation function etc. Moreover, an additional data structure\n\"membrane potential\" responsible for keeping track of temporal information,\nmust be fetched and updated at every timestep in SNNs.

The motivation behind\nASTEROID is that inaccurate data, though incurring large bias, can help capture\nthe sophisticated structures of the underlying force field. Therefore, we first\ntrain a MLFF model on a large amount of inaccurate training data, employing a\nbias-aware loss function to prevent the model from overfitting tahe potential\nbias of this data. We then fine-tune the obtained model using a small amount of\naccurate training data, which preserves the knowledge learned from the\ninaccurate training data while significantly improving the model's accuracy.\nMoreover, we propose a variant of ASTEROID based on score matching for the\nsetting where the inaccurate training data are unlabeled.

Multiple annotators each complete their\nown small part of the annotations, where labeling mistakes that depend on\nannotators occur frequently. Modeling the label-noise generation process by the\nnoise transition matrix is a power tool to tackle the label noise. In\nreal-world crowd-sourcing scenarios, noise transition matrices are both\nannotator- and instance-dependent. However, due to the high complexity of\nannotator- and instance-dependent transition matrices (AIDTM),\n\\textit{annotation sparsity}, which means each annotator only labels a little\npart of instances, makes modeling AIDTM very challenging. Prior works simplify\nthe problem by assuming the transition matrix is instance-independent or using\nsimple parametric way, while lose modeling generality. Motivated by this, we\ntarget a more realistic problem, estimating general AIDTM in practice. Without\nlosing modeling generality, we parameterize AIDTM with deep neural networks. To\nalleviate the modeling challenge, we suppose every annotator shares its noise\npattern with similar annotators, and estimate AIDTM via \\textit{knowledge\ntransfer}. We hence first model the mixture of noise patterns by all\nannotators, and then transfer this modeling to individual annotators.\nFurthermore, considering that the transfer from the mixture of noise patterns\nto individuals may cause two annotators with highly different noise generations\nto perturb each other, we employ the knowledge transfer between identified\nneighboring annotators to calibrate the modeling. Experiments confirm the\nsuperiority of the proposed approach on synthetic and real-world crowd-sourcing\ndata.

A surprising anti-obstacle preemption coalition is forming as Justice\nThomas gradually positions himself alongside the Court's liberals to form a\nfive-justice voting bloc opposing obstacle preemption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 14:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Rev. 667 (2011)","doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"econ.GN q-fin.EC","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  Now almost three decades since its seminal Chevron decision, the Supreme\nCourt has yet to articulate how that case's doctrine of deference to agency\nstatutory interpretations relates to one of the most compelling federalism\nissues of our time: regulatory preemption of state law. Should courts defer to\npreemptive agency interpretations under Chevron, or do preemption's federalism\nimplications demand a less deferential approach? Commentators have provided no\nshortage of possible solutions, but thus far the Court has resisted all of\nthem.\n  This Article makes two contributions to the debate. First, through a detailed\nanalysis of the Court's recent agency-preemption decisions, I trace its\nhesitancy to adopt any of the various proposed rules to its high regard for\ncongressional intent where areas of traditional state sovereignty are at risk.\nRecognizing that congressional intent to delegate preemptive authority varies\nfrom case to case, the Court has hesitated to adopt an across-the-board rule.\nAny such rule would constrain the Court and risk mismatch with congressional\nintent -- a risk it accepts under Chevron generally but which it finds\nparticularly troublesome in the delicate area of federal preemption.\n  Second, building on this previously underappreciated factor in the Court's\nanalysis, I suggest a novel solution of variable deference that avoids the\ninflexibility inherent in an across-the-board rule while providing greater\npredictability than the Court's current haphazard approach. The proposed rule\nwould grant full Chevron-style deference in those cases where congressional\ndelegative intent is most likely -- where Congress has expressly preempted some\nstate law and the agency interpretation merely resolves preemptive scope --\nwhile withholding deference in those cases where Congress has remained\ncompletely silent as to preemption and delegative intent is least likely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 14:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Such model-based methods utilize mathematical formulations that\nrepresent the underlying physics, prior information and additional domain\nknowledge. Simple classical models are useful but sensitive to inaccuracies and\nmay lead to poor performance when real systems display complex or dynamic\nbehavior. More recently, deep learning approaches that use deep neural networks\nare becoming increasingly popular. Deep learning systems do not rely on\nmathematical modeling, and learn their mapping from data, which allows them to\noperate in complex environments. However, they lack the interpretability and\nreliability of model-based methods, typically require large training sets to\nobtain good performance, and tend to be computationally complex. Model-based\nsignal processing methods and data-centric deep learning each have their pros\nand cons. These paradigms can be characterized as edges of a continuous\nspectrum varying in specificity and parameterization. The methodologies that\nlie in the middle ground of this spectrum, thus integrating model-based signal\nprocessing with deep learning, are referred to as model-based deep learning,\nand are the focus here. This monograph provides a tutorial style presentation\nof model-based deep learning methodologies. These are families of algorithms\nthat combine principled mathematical models with data-driven systems to benefit\nfrom the advantages of both approaches. Such model-based deep learning methods\nexploit both partial domain knowledge, via mathematical structures designed for\nspecific problems, as well as learning from limited data. We accompany our\npresentation with running examples, in super-resolution, dynamic systems, and\narray processing. We show how they are expressed using the provided\ncharacterization and specialized in each of the detailed methodologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 03:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Although adaptive\nsecurity systems have been proposed to continuously protect assets from harm,\nthey can only mitigate threats arising from changes foreseen at design time. In\nthis paper, we propose the notion of Sustainable Adaptive Security (SAS) which\nreflects such enduring protection by augmenting adaptive security systems with\nthe capability of mitigating newly discovered threats. To achieve this\nobjective, a SAS system should be designed by combining automation (e.g., to\ndiscover and mitigate security threats) and human intervention (e.g., to\nresolve uncertainties during threat discovery and mitigation). In this paper,\nwe use a smart home example to showcase how we can engineer the activities of\nthe MAPE (Monitor, Analysis, Planning, and Execution) loop of systems\nsatisfying sustainable adaptive security. We suggest that using anomaly\ndetection together with abductive reasoning can help discover new threats and\nguide the evolution of security requirements and controls.

Levine the Supreme Court once again failed to reconcile the\ninterpretive presumption against preemption with the sometimes competing\nChevron doctrine of deference to agencies' reasonable statutory\ninterpretations. Rather than resolve the issue of which principle should govern\nwhere the two principles point toward opposite results, the Court continued its\nrecent practice of applying both principles halfheartedly, carving exceptions,\nand giving neither its proper weight.\n  This analysis situates Wyeth within the larger framework of the Court's\nrecent preemption decisions in an effort to explain the Court's hesitancy to\nresolve the conflict. The analysis concludes that the Court, motivated by its\nstrong respect for congressional intent and concern to protect federalism,\napplies both the presumption against preemption and the Chevron doctrine on a\nsliding scale. Where congressional intent to preempt is clear and vague only as\nto scope, the Court is usually quite deferential to agency determinations, but\nwhere congressional preemptive intent is unclear, agency views are accorded\nless weight.\n  The Court's variable approach to deference is defensible as necessary to\nprevent unauthorized incursion into areas of traditional state sovereignty, but\nits inherent unpredictability sows confusion among regulated parties, and the\nneed for flexibility prevents the Court from adopting any of the more\npredictable across-the-board approaches to deference proposed by the Court's\ncritics. A superior approach would combine the Court's concern for federalism\nwith the certainty of a bright-line rule by granting deference to agency views\nwhere Congress has spoken via a preemption clause of ambiguous scope and no\ndeference where Congress has remained silent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 14:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Such studies allow broad generalizations\nabout oral argument and judicial decision making: Justices tend to vote in\naccordance with their ideological preferences, and they tend to ask more\nquestions when they are skeptical of a party's position.
