Bayesian approaches to the problem\nare the gold standard as they allow for the quantification of uncertainties and\nenable the seamless fusion of different experimental modalities. When the\ndynamics are discrete and stochastic, one may employ powerful techniques such\nas Kalman, particle, or variational filters. Practitioners commonly apply these\nmethods to continuous-time, deterministic dynamical systems after discretizing\nthe dynamics and introducing fictitious transition probabilities. However,\napproaches based on time-discretization suffer from the curse of dimensionality\nsince the number of random variables grows linearly with the number of\ntime-steps. Furthermore, the introduction of fictitious transition\nprobabilities is an unsatisfactory solution because it increases the number of\nmodel parameters and may lead to inference bias. To address these drawbacks,\nthe objective of this paper is to develop a scalable Bayesian approach to state\nand parameter estimation suitable for continuous-time, deterministic dynamical\nsystems. Our methodology builds upon information field theory. Specifically, we\nconstruct a physics-informed prior probability measure on the function space of\nsystem responses so that functions that satisfy the physics are more likely.\nThis prior allows us to quantify model form errors. We connect the system's\nresponse to observations through a probabilistic model of the measurement\nprocess. The joint posterior over the system responses and all parameters is\ngiven by Bayes' rule. To approximate the intractable posterior, we develop a\nstochastic variational inference algorithm. In summary, the developed\nmethodology offers a powerful framework for Bayesian estimation in dynamical\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2023 16:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

In this study, we\npropose a novel approach that assumes the formation of a small, deconfined, and\nexpanding fireball even in pp collisions, where charm quarks can undergo\nrescattering and hadronization. We make use of the same in-medium hadronization\nmechanism developed for heavy-ion collisions, which involves local\ncolor-neutralization through recombination of charm quarks with nearby opposite\ncolor charges from the background fireball.

In this paper, we argue that the\nconnectivity of a tree is not sufficient to characterize a neural network. The\nnodes of the same level of a tree cannot be connected with each other, i.e.,\nthese neural unit cannot share information with each other, which is a major\ndrawback of ANN. Although ANN has been significantly improved in recent years\nto more complex structures, such as the directed acyclic graph (DAG), these\nmethods also have unidirectional and acyclic bias for ANN. In this paper, we\npropose a method to build a bidirectional complete graph for the nodes in the\nsame level of an ANN, which yokes the nodes of the same level to formulate a\nneural module. We call our model as YNN in short. YNN promotes the information\ntransfer significantly which obviously helps in improving the performance of\nthe method.

This study presents\nexperimental evidence and preliminary observations on the impact that\nincreasing velocity has on the tractive performance of planetary rovers.\nSingle-wheel driving tests were conducted using two different metallic,\ngrousered wheels-one rigid and one flexible-over two different soils, olivine\nsand and CaCO3-based silty soil. Experiments were conducted at speeds between\n0.01-1 m/s throughout an ample range of slip ratios (5-90%). Three performance\nmetrics were evaluated: drawbar pull coefficient, wheel sinkage, and tractive\nefficiency. Results showed similar data trends among all the cases\ninvestigated. Drawbar pull and tractive efficiency considerably decreased for\nspeeds beyond 0.2 m/s. Wheel sinkage, unlike what published evidence suggested,\nincreased with increasing velocities. The flexible wheel performed the best at\n1m/s, exhibiting 2 times higher drawbar pull and efficiency with 18% lower\nsinkage under low slip conditions. Although similar data trends were obtained,\na different wheel-soil interactive behavior was observed when driving over the\ndifferent soils. Overall, despite the performance reduction experienced at\nhigher velocities, a speed in the range of 0.2-0.3 m/s would enable 5-10 times\nfaster traverses, compared to current rovers driving capability, while only\ndiminishing drawbar pull and efficiency by 7%.

Two canonical problems here are to find a\nmaxcore (subgraph of maximum min degree) and to find a densest subgraph\n(subgraph of maximum average degree). Both of these problems can be solved in\npolynomial time. Veldt, Benson, and Kleinberg [VBK21] introduced the\ngeneralized $p$-mean densest subgraph problem which captures the maxcore\nproblem when $p=-\\infty$ and the densest subgraph problem when $p=1$. They\nobserved that the objective leads to a supermodular function when $p \\ge 1$ and\nhence can be solved in polynomial time; for this case, they also developed a\nsimple greedy peeling algorithm with a bounded approximation ratio. In this\npaper, we make several contributions. First, we prove that for any $p \\in\n(-\\frac{1}{8}, 0) \\cup (0, \\frac{1}{4})$ the problem is NP-Hard and for any $p\n\\in (-3,0) \\cup (0,1)$ the weighted version of the problem is NP-Hard, partly\nresolving a question left open in [VBK21]. Second, we describe two simple\n$1/2$-approximation algorithms for all $p < 1$, and show that our analysis of\nthese algorithms is tight. For $p > 1$ we develop a fast near-linear time\nimplementation of the greedy peeling algorithm from [VBK21].

We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms by\nrunning extensive experiments on large graphs. Together, our results provide a\ncomprehensive understanding of the complexity of the $p$-mean densest subgraph\nproblem and lead to fast and provably good algorithms for the full range of\n$p$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2023 18:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

The hydrogel\nis based on a swollen matrix of chemically crosslinked polyethylene glycol\ndiacrylate of molecular weight 12 kDa (PEGDA), and can be prepared with basic\nchemistry lab equipment. The PEGDA hydrogel is a powerful tool for \\textit{in\nvitro} studies of weak interactions, dynamics, and internal organization of\nphase-separated droplets in aqueous solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2023 21:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

On the other hand, however, the previous best regret upper bound is\nstill $O(K^{1/3} T^{2/3}\\log^{1/3}(T))$, which is achieved by the streaming\nimplementation of the simple uniform exploration. The $O(K^{1/3}\\log^{1/3}(T))$\ngap leaves the open question of the tight regret bound in the single-pass MABs\nwith sublinear arm memory.\n  In this paper, we answer this open problem and complete the picture of regret\nminimization in single-pass streaming MABs.

We also introduce FedRemoval, an efficient and\neffective removal strategy that tackles the computational challenges in FL by\napproximating the Hessian matrix using public server data from the pretrained\nmodel. Unlike the previous uncertified and heuristic machine unlearning methods\nin FL, we provide theoretical guarantees by bounding the differences of model\nweights by our FedRemoval and that from retraining from scratch. Experimental\nresults on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method in achieving a balance between model accuracy and information\nremoval, outperforming baseline strategies and approaching retraining from\nscratch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2023 23:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

They utilize a text encoder and cross-attention blocks to infuse\ntextual information into images at a pixel level. However, their capability to\ngenerate images with text containing multiple objects is still restricted.\nPrevious works identify the problem of information mixing in the CLIP text\nencoder and introduce the T5 text encoder or incorporate strong prior knowledge\nto assist with the alignment. We find that mixing problems also occur on the\nimage side and in the cross-attention blocks. The noisy images can cause\ndifferent objects to appear similar, and the cross-attention blocks inject\ninformation at a pixel level, leading to leakage of global object understanding\nand resulting in object mixing. In this paper, we introduce Detector Guidance\n(DG), which integrates a latent object detection model to separate different\nobjects during the generation process. DG first performs latent object\ndetection on cross-attention maps (CAMs) to obtain object information. Based on\nthis information, DG then masks conflicting prompts and enhances related\nprompts by manipulating the following CAMs. We evaluate the effectiveness of DG\nusing Stable Diffusion on COCO, CC, and a novel multi-related object benchmark,\nMRO. Human evaluations demonstrate that DG provides an 8-22\\% advantage in\npreventing the amalgamation of conflicting concepts and ensuring that each\nobject possesses its unique region without any human involvement and additional\niterations.

The\nstate-of-the-art dictionary by Bender, Farach-Colton, Kuszmaul, Kuszmaul and\nLiu [BFCK+22] has space consumption close to the information-theoretic optimum,\nusing a total of \\[\n  \\log\\binom{U}{n}+O(n\\log^{(k)} n) \\] bits, while supporting all operations in\n$O(k)$ time, for any parameter $k \\leq \\log^* n$. The term $O(\\log^{(k)} n) =\nO(\\underbrace{\\log\\cdots\\log}_k n)$ is referred to as the wasted bits per key.\n  In this paper, we prove a matching cell-probe lower bound: For\n$U=n^{1+\\Theta(1)}$, any dictionary with $O(\\log^{(k)} n)$ wasted bits per key\nmust have expected operational time $\\Omega(k)$, in the cell-probe model with\nword-size $w=\\Theta(\\log U)$. Furthermore, if a dictionary stores values of\n$\\Theta(\\log U)$ bits, we show that regardless of the query time, it must have\n$\\Omega(k)$ expected update time. It is worth noting that this is the first\ncell-probe lower bound on the trade-off between space and update time for\ngeneral data structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 03:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

In contrast,\nthe classic Gaussian mechanism and its variants all consider\n\\textbf{deterministic} full-rank covariance matrices.

However, it is challenging to develop efficient fully\ndecoupled numerical methods for solving degenerate interface problems in which\nthe coefficient of a PDE is discontinuous and greater than or equal to zero on\nthe interface. The main motivation in this paper is to construct fully\ndecoupled numerical methods for solving nonlinear degenerate interface problems\nwith ``double singularities\". An efficient fully decoupled numerical method is\nproposed for nonlinear degenerate interface problems. The scheme combines deep\nneural network on the singular subdomain with finite difference method on the\nregular subdomain. The key of the new approach is to split nonlinear degenerate\npartial differential equation with interface into two independent boundary\nvalue problems based on deep learning. The outstanding advantages of the\nproposed schemes are that not only the convergence order of the degenerate\ninterface problems on whole domain is determined by the finite difference\nscheme on the regular subdomain, but also can calculate $\\mathbf{VERY}$\n$\\mathbf{BIG}$ jump ratio(such as $10^{12}:1$ or $1:10^{12}$) for the interface\nproblems including degenerate and non-degenerate cases.

A popular family of DoA estimation algorithms are subspace methods,\nwhich operate by dividing the measurements into distinct signal and noise\nsubspaces. Subspace methods, such as Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) and\nRoot-MUSIC, rely on several restrictive assumptions, including narrowband\nnon-coherent sources and fully calibrated arrays, and their performance is\nconsiderably degraded when these do not hold. In this work we propose\nSubspaceNet; a data-driven DoA estimator which learns how to divide the\nobservations into distinguishable subspaces. This is achieved by utilizing a\ndedicated deep neural network to learn the empirical autocorrelation of the\ninput, by training it as part of the Root-MUSIC method, leveraging the inherent\ndifferentiability of this specific DoA estimator, while removing the need to\nprovide a ground-truth decomposable autocorrelation matrix. Once trained, the\nresulting SubspaceNet serves as a universal surrogate covariance estimator that\ncan be applied in combination with any subspace-based DoA estimation method,\nallowing its successful application in challenging setups. SubspaceNet is shown\nto enable various DoA estimation algorithms to cope with coherent sources,\nwideband signals, low SNR, array mismatches, and limited snapshots, while\npreserving the interpretability and the suitability of classic subspace\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 06:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

The main objective of this work is to design a decentralized\ndecision-making model that coordinates the agents in selecting strategies and\nallows them to asymptotically adopt the optimal strategies, e.g., the\nstrategies that minimize remaining jobs in all assigned tasks.\n  We formulate the problem using the population game formalism and refer to it\nas the task allocation game.

For this purpose, a\nnontrivial tailored driving field, consisting of two co-rotating laser pulses\nwith frequencies $\\omega$ and $2\\omega$, is utilized to generate harmonics from\ngraphene.

Simulating variants of the faulty program called\nmutants, several Mutation Based Fault Localisation (MBFL) techniques have been\nproposed to automatically locate faults. Despite their success, existing MBFL\ntechniques suffer from the cost of performing mutation analysis after the fault\nis observed. Method: To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a new MBFL\ntechnique named SIMFL (Statistical Inference for Mutation-based Fault\nLocalisation). SIMFL localises faults based on the past results of mutation\nanalysis that has been done on the earlier version in the project history,\nallowing developers to make predictions on the location of incoming faults in a\njust-in-time manner. Using several statistical inference methods, SIMFL models\nthe relationship between test results of the mutants and their locations, and\nsubsequently infers the location of the current faults. Results: The empirical\nstudy on Defects4J dataset shows that SIMFL can localise 113 faults on the\nfirst rank out of 224 faults, outperforming other MBFL techniques. Even when\nSIMFL is trained on the predicted kill matrix, SIMFL can still localise 95\nfaults on the first rank out of 194 faults. Moreover, removing redundant\nmutants significantly improves the localisation accuracy of SIMFL by the number\nof faults localised at the first rank up to 51. Conclusion: This paper proposes\na new MBFL technique called SIMFL, which exploits ahead-of-time mutation\nanalysis to localise current faults. SIMFL is not only cost-effective, as it\ndoes not need a mutation analysis after the fault is observed, but also capable\nof localising faults accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 10:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

However, due to the difficulty of\nprecise energy analysis and highly complicated real markets, no decisive\nevidence directly linking energy costs to the selling prices of individual\ncommodities has yet been found.

One promising\nsuggestion is the nano-selective driving of quantum optics with\nmulti-electrons, which can occur if laser-structured consecutive electrons are\nbunched within the decoherence time of the quantum system. Compressing electron\npulses with terahertz (THz) radiation formed in optical nonlinear crystals is\nan attractive methodology to generate the rapidly varying electric fields\nnecessary for electron compression, with an inherent temporal locking to\nlaser-triggered electrons. Sub-THz are especially appealing as they can\ncompress longer (picosecond-) pulses, however, the generation of such low\nfrequencies is inefficient and their focusability is fundamentally limited by\ndiffraction. This work proposes electron-pulse compression with sub-THz fields\ndirectly in the vicinity of their dipolar origin, thereby avoiding their\nmediation through radiation. We analyze the merits of such nearfields for\nelectron compression and find that it is particularly advantageous for small\nnumerical apertures and micro-joule-level optical pulses, and hence can be\nimplemented within the tight constraints of standard electron microscopes and\nwork at high repetition rates.

As a result, the generalized zero-shot industrial\nfault diagnosis has gained attention as it aims to diagnose both seen and\nunseen faults. Nevertheless, the lack of unseen fault data for training poses a\nchallenging domain shift problem (DSP), where unseen faults are often\nidentified as seen faults. In this article, we propose a knowledge space\nsharing (KSS) model to address the DSP in the generalized zero-shot industrial\nfault diagnosis task.

In recent years, neural retrievers based on pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLM), such as dual-encoders, have achieved huge success. Yet,\nstudies have found that the performance of dual-encoders are often limited due\nto the neglecting of the interaction information between queries and candidate\npassages. Therefore, various interaction paradigms have been proposed to\nimprove the performance of vanilla dual-encoders. Particularly, recent\nstate-of-the-art methods often introduce late-interaction during the model\ninference process. However, such late-interaction based methods usually bring\nextensive computation and storage cost on large corpus. Despite their\neffectiveness, the concern of efficiency and space footprint is still an\nimportant factor that limits the application of interaction-based neural\nretrieval models. To tackle this issue, we incorporate implicit interaction\ninto dual-encoders, and propose I^3 retriever. In particular, our implicit\ninteraction paradigm leverages generated pseudo-queries to simulate\nquery-passage interaction, which jointly optimizes with query and passage\nencoders in an end-to-end manner. It can be fully pre-computed and cached, and\nits inference process only involves simple dot product operation of the query\nvector and passage vector, which makes it as efficient as the vanilla dual\nencoders. We conduct comprehensive experiments on MSMARCO and TREC2019 Deep\nLearning Datasets, demonstrating the I^3 retriever's superiority in terms of\nboth effectiveness and efficiency.

It is demonstrated that when mode\ndamping is negligible the mode amplitude will generically grow in time for all\nvalues of orbital eccentricity and semi-major axis, even for small kicks\noutside the regime exhibiting diffusive growth. The origin of the small-kick\ngrowth is the change in kick size from orbit to orbit, an effect quadratic in\nthe mode amplitude. When damping of the mode is included, the growth is shut\noff when the damping time is shorter than the growth time.

It\nfirst exploits general texts to form queries for extracting commonsense\nknowledge from the neural commonsense knowledge model and then refines the\nlanguage model with two self-supervised objectives: commonsense mask infilling\nand commonsense relation prediction, which align human language with the\nunderlying commonsense knowledge.

In specific, most existing algorithms assume that views are\navailable in advance and overlook the scenarios where data observations of\nviews are accumulated over time. Due to privacy considerations or memory\nlimitations, previous views cannot be stored in these situations. Some works\nare proposed to handle it, but all fail to address incomplete views.
