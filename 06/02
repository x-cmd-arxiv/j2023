Existing planning\nmethods lack scalability to higher-dimensional spaces, while recent learning\nbased planners have shown promise in accelerating sampling-based motion\nplanners (SMP) but lack generalizability to out-of-distribution environments.\nTo address this, we present a novel approach, Vector Quantized-Motion Planning\nTransformers (VQ-MPT) that overcomes the key generalization and scaling\ndrawbacks of previous learning-based methods. VQ-MPT consists of two stages.\nStage 1 is a Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder model that learns to\nrepresent the planning space using a finite number of sampling distributions,\nand stage 2 is an Auto-Regressive model that constructs a sampling region for\nSMPs by selecting from the learned sampling distribution sets. By splitting\nlarge planning spaces into discrete sets and selectively choosing the sampling\nregions, our planner pairs well with out-of-the-box SMPs, generating\nnear-optimal paths faster than without VQ-MPT's aid. It is generalizable in\nthat it can be applied to systems of varying complexities, from 2D planar to\n14D bi-manual robots with diverse environment representations, including\ncostmaps and point clouds. Trained VQ-MPT models generalize to environments\nunseen during training and achieve higher success rates than previous methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 16:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Recently, large\npre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown promising generalization\ncapability. In this paper, we propose the first parameter-efficient tuning\napproach for deepfake detection, namely DeepFake-Adapter, to effectively and\nefficiently adapt the generalizable high-level semantics from large pre-trained\nViTs to aid deepfake detection. Given large pre-trained models but limited\ndeepfake data, DeepFake-Adapter introduces lightweight yet dedicated dual-level\nadapter modules to a ViT while keeping the model backbone frozen.

For both boundary\nconditions, the average field has the same non-Gaussian limit within a critical\nwindow of width $R^{-d/2}$ around the effective critical point, and in that\nwindow we compute the universal scaling profile for the susceptibility.

Consequently, this results in overfitting and\ndistribution shift, both of which adversely impact the generalizability to test\nthe target edges. Additionally, during test time, the failure to exclude the\ntest target edges leads to implicit test leakage caused by neighborhood\naggregation. In this paper, we analyze these three pitfalls and investigate the\nimpact of including or excluding target edges on the performance of nodes with\nvarying degrees during training and test phases.

Traditional CS solvers use\niterative optimizers with hand crafted sparsifiers, while early data-driven\nmethods directly learn an inverse mapping from the low-dimensional measurement\nspace to the original image space. The latter outperforms the former, but is\nrestrictive to a pre-defined measurement domain. More recent, deep unrolling\nmethods combine traditional proximal gradient methods and data-driven\napproaches to iteratively refine an image approximation. To achieve higher\naccuracy, it has also been suggested to learn both the sampling matrix, and the\nchoice of measurement vectors adaptively. Contrary to the current trend, in\nthis work we hypothesize that a general inverse mapping from a random set of\ncompressed measurements to the image domain exists for a given measurement\nbasis, and can be learned. Such a model is single-shot, non-restrictive and\ndoes not parametrize the sampling process. To this end, we propose MOSAIC, a\nnovel compressive sensing framework to reconstruct images given any random\nselection of measurements, sampled using a fixed basis. Motivated by the uneven\ndistribution of information across measurements, MOSAIC incorporates an\nembedding technique to efficiently apply attention mechanisms on an encoded\nsequence of measurements, while dispensing the need to use unrolled deep\nnetworks.

Despite showing impressive zero-shot capabilities, a\npre-defined set of categories, a.k.a. the vocabulary, is assumed at test time\nfor composing the textual prompts. However, such assumption can be impractical\nwhen the semantic context is unknown and evolving. We thus formalize a novel\ntask, termed as Vocabulary-free Image Classification (VIC), where we aim to\nassign to an input image a class that resides in an unconstrained\nlanguage-induced semantic space, without the prerequisite of a known\nvocabulary. VIC is a challenging task as the semantic space is extremely large,\ncontaining millions of concepts, with hard-to-discriminate fine-grained\ncategories. In this work, we first empirically verify that representing this\nsemantic space by means of an external vision-language database is the most\neffective way to obtain semantically relevant content for classifying the\nimage. We then propose Category Search from External Databases (CaSED), a\nmethod that exploits a pre-trained vision-language model and an external\nvision-language database to address VIC in a training-free manner. CaSED first\nextracts a set of candidate categories from captions retrieved from the\ndatabase based on their semantic similarity to the image, and then assigns to\nthe image the best matching candidate category according to the same\nvision-language model.

To isolate the issue, we\nintroduce flip-flop language modeling (FFLM), a parametric family of synthetic\nbenchmarks designed to probe the extrapolative behavior of neural language\nmodels.

In this study, we investigate the proposed association, carefully\nconsidering the constraint that the FRB signal must traverse the high-density\nmerger ejecta without experiencing noticeable attenuation to enable its\ndetection at 400 MHz.

The rest of the proof relies on compactness\nmethods. We also provide optimality conditions for the mean-field problem and\ndiscuss the regularity of the optimal controls. Finally we present some\napplications and connections with large deviations for weakly interacting\nparticle systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 17:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

The very high equivalent width of the putative HeII\nemission in this clump (170 A), and the lack of metal lines, can be explained\nin terms of photoionisation by PopIII stars, while photoionisation by PopII\nstars is inconsistent with the data. It would also indicate that the putative\nPopIII stars likely have a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF), with an upper\ncutoff reaching at least 500 M$_\\odot$.

(2) voxel-reconstruction ambiguity: 2D-to-3D lifting\nwith estimated single view depth only propagates 2D information onto the\nsurface of 3D regions, leading to ambiguity during the reconstruction of\nregions behind the frontal view surface. In this paper, we propose BUOL, a\nBottom-Up framework with Occupancy-aware Lifting to address the two issues for\npanoptic 3D scene reconstruction from a single image. For instance-channel\nambiguity, a bottom-up framework lifts 2D information to 3D voxels based on\ndeterministic semantic assignments rather than arbitrary instance id\nassignments. The 3D voxels are then refined and grouped into 3D instances\naccording to the predicted 2D instance centers. For voxel-reconstruction\nambiguity, the estimated multi-plane occupancy is leveraged together with depth\nto fill the whole regions of things and stuff. Our method shows a tremendous\nperformance advantage over state-of-the-art methods on synthetic dataset\n3D-Front and real-world dataset Matterport3D.

In this paper, we present accurate measurements of the quadratic\nshape bias parameters by combining the $\\textit{full three-dimensional}$ power\nspectrum of the intrinsic alignments (i.e., without any projection) with the\nquadratic field method. In order to benefit from the full three-dimensional\npower spectrum we employ the spherical tensor decomposition of the\nthree-dimensional shape field and measure their power spectra for the first\ntime. In particular, we detect the vector and tensor power spectra in this\nbasis, which cannot be explained by the widely-used nonlinear alignment model.\nFurther, by cross-correlating the three-dimensional halo shape field with the\nquadratic shape bias operators from the initial condition of the same\nsimulation to cancel cosmic variance, we effectively extract bispectrum\ninformation and detect quadratic shape bias parameters in the intrinsic\nalignments with high significance for the first time. We also compare these\nmeasurements with the prediction where quadratic shape biases are dynamically\ngenerated from the linear Lagrandian shape bias through the large-scale bulk\nflow.

In this paper, we first empirically\ndemonstrate that simply using high-quality pseudo labels can fairly mitigate\nthis problem in the setting of organ segmentation. Furthermore, we put forward\nan innovative architecture designed specifically for continuous organ and tumor\nsegmentation, which incurs minimal computational overhead.

Three-dimensional non-local thermodynamical equilibrium (NLTE)\nradiative transfer calculations are a fundamental tool for a detailed spectral\nanalysis in stellar atmospheres, but require vast amounts of computer power.\nThis prevents their broader application. Aims. We undertake a first exploration\nof the use of 3D irregular grids in stellar atmospheres. In particular, we aim\nto test whether irregular grids can be used to speed up the 3D NLTE problem, in\nthe same way as depth optimisation can lead to faster running times in 1D.\nMethods. We created irregular grids based on 3D Voronoi diagrams, sampling\ndifferent distributions from a 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic Bifrost\nsimulation. We developed a method for solving radiation on the 3D irregular\ngrid and implemented a simple NLTE solver using $\\Lambda$-iteration and\nstatistical equilibrium. We applied this to a simplified hydrogen-like atom and\nstudied the convergence properties and accuracy of the irregular grid methods.\nFor reference, we compared them to a standard short-characteristics solver on a\nregular grid. Results. We find that our method for radiation in irregular grids\ngives similar results to those from regular grids, and that it is possible to\nobtain nearly the same results with about ten times fewer points in the\nirregular grid for the continuum intensity in local thermodynamical\nequilibrium. We find that the irregular grid can give good results for the NLTE\nproblem, but it takes four times longer per iteration than the regular grid,\nand it converges in about the same number of iterations. This makes it\nparticularly inefficient. Our formulation therefore does not lead to an\nimprovement. We also find that the design of the irregular grid is crucial for\naccurate results, and find it non-trivial to design an irregular grid that can\nwork well across a wide range of heights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

In these notes we discuss a variant approach where part of the\ngauge group does not come from full isometries of $g_K^0$, but instead comes\nfrom weaker internal symmetries that only preserve the Einstein-Hilbert action\non $K$. Then the weaker symmetries are spontaneously broken by the choice of\nvacuum metric and generate massive gauge bosons within the Kaluza-Klein\nframework, with no need to introduce ad hoc Higgs fields. Using the language of\nRiemannian submersions, it is shown that a gauge boson's classical mass depends\non the Lie derivative of $g_K^0$ along the associated internal symmetry. The\npresence of gauge fields that are not associated with exact isometries of\n$g_K^0$ may help to circumvent certain no-go arguments against the existence of\nchiral fermions in Kaluza-Klein theories. In parallel, we also discuss the\ntraditional assumption that the Kaluza-Klein vacuum is represented by a product\nEinstein metric. This should not be true when that metric is unstable. In fact,\nthe unravelling of the Einstein metric along unstable perturbations may be a\ndesirable feature of the model. It allows certain components of the metric to\nchange length scale and become compatible with a small cosmological constant.\nIn the case of the Lie group $K=SU(3)$, the unravelling of the bi-invariant\nmetric along an unstable perturbation also breaks the isometry group from\n$(SU(3)\\times SU(3))/Z_3$ down to $(SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1))/ Z_6$, the\ngauge group of the Standard Model.

Moreover, we propose to apply two\nauxiliary tasks and contrastive learning to enable auxiliary supervisions to\nimprove the learned keypoints representation, which further enhances the\nperformance of major tasks. We validate our approach on a large-scale in-house\ndataset, as well as a public benchmark dataset, and show that our approach\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of evaluation metrics.\nThe effectiveness of each model component is validated in a detailed ablation\nstudy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 18:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

From these fringes, only the variations of the plate's surfaces and\nthickness are of interest. To measure these plates, one must use\nwavelength-stepping, which corresponds to phase-stepping in standard digital\ninterferometry. The designed PSA must phase-demodulate a single fringe sequence\nand filter out the remaining temporal fringes.

Sensor readings are translated into\nrepresentations, either derived through dedicated preprocessing, or integrated\ninto end-to-end learning. Independent of their origin, for the vast majority of\ncontemporary HAR, those representations are typically continuous in nature.\nThat has not always been the case. In the early days of HAR, discretization\napproaches have been explored - primarily motivated by the desire to minimize\ncomputational requirements, but also with a view on applications beyond mere\nrecognition, such as, activity discovery, fingerprinting, or large-scale\nsearch. Those traditional discretization approaches, however, suffer from\nsubstantial loss in precision and resolution in the resulting representations\nwith detrimental effects on downstream tasks.

While the majority of prior\nresearch has centered on employing purely time series-based methodologies for\nsolar forecasting, only a limited number of studies have taken into account\nfactors such as cloud cover or the surrounding physical context. In this paper,\nwe put forth a deep learning architecture designed to harness spatio-temporal\ncontext using satellite data, to attain highly accurate \\textit{day-ahead}\ntime-series forecasting for any given station, with a particular emphasis on\nforecasting Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI).

To\ndemonstrate these advantages, we convert Transformers into Python programs and\nuse off-the-shelf code analysis tools to debug model errors and identify the\n``circuits'' used to solve different sub-problems. We hope that Transformer\nPrograms open a new path toward the goal of intrinsically interpretable machine\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 20:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

The quality of the final representation can be measured\nby a unified objective function called sparse rate reduction. From this\nperspective, popular deep networks such as transformers can be naturally viewed\nas realizing iterative schemes to optimize this objective incrementally.\nParticularly, we show that the standard transformer block can be derived from\nalternating optimization on complementary parts of this objective: the\nmulti-head self-attention operator can be viewed as a gradient descent step to\ncompress the token sets by minimizing their lossy coding rate, and the\nsubsequent multi-layer perceptron can be viewed as attempting to sparsify the\nrepresentation of the tokens. This leads to a family of white-box\ntransformer-like deep network architectures which are mathematically fully\ninterpretable.

In this work, we use an\nAI-powered E-diagnosis system as an example to study AI liability insurance. We\nprovide a quantitative risk assessment model with evidence-based numerical\nanalysis. We discuss the insurability criteria for AI technologies and suggest\nnecessary adjustments to accommodate the features of AI products. We show that\nAI liability insurance can act as a regulatory mechanism to incentivize\ncompliant behaviors and serve as a certificate of high-quality AI systems.\nFurthermore, we suggest premium adjustment to reflect the dynamic evolution of\nthe inherent uncertainty in AI.

We first conduct an\nablation analysis informed by human annotations to understand which parts of a\ntask definition are most important, and find that model performance only drops\nsubstantially when removing contents describing the task output, in particular\nlabel information. Next, we propose an automatic algorithm to compress task\ndefinitions to a minimal supporting set of tokens, and find that 60\\% of tokens\ncan be removed while maintaining or even improving model performance.

In this work, we investigate this phenomenon by narrowing our focus\nto deep linear networks. Through our analysis, we reveal a surprising \"law of\nparsimony\" in the learning dynamics when the data possesses low-dimensional\nstructures. Specifically, we show that the evolution of gradient descent\nstarting from orthogonal initialization only affects a minimal portion of\nsingular vector spaces across all weight matrices. In other words, the learning\nprocess happens only within a small invariant subspace of each weight matrix,\ndespite the fact that all weight parameters are updated throughout training.\nThis simplicity in learning dynamics could have significant implications for\nboth efficient training and a better understanding of deep networks. First, the\nanalysis enables us to considerably improve training efficiency by taking\nadvantage of the low-dimensional structure in learning dynamics. We can\nconstruct smaller, equivalent deep linear networks without sacrificing the\nbenefits associated with the wider counterparts. Second, it allows us to better\nunderstand deep representation learning by elucidating the linear progressive\nseparation and concentration of representations from shallow to deep layers.

Hidden confounding can compromise the\nvalidity of any causal conclusion drawn from data and presents a major obstacle\nto effective offline RL. In the present paper, we tackle the problem of hidden\nconfounding in the nonidentifiable setting. We propose a definition of\nuncertainty due to hidden confounding bias, termed delphic uncertainty, which\nuses variation over world models compatible with the observations, and\ndifferentiate it from the well-known epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We\nderive a practical method for estimating the three types of uncertainties, and\nconstruct a pessimistic offline RL algorithm to account for them. Our method\ndoes not assume identifiability of the unobserved confounders, and attempts to\nreduce the amount of confounding bias.

For these\napplications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling\nquadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While\nmany works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce\nthe computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by\nimplementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over\nthe attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions\noften results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full\nattention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend\nFlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns\nthat, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention.\nThis leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a\nmulti-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low\ndegrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the\nsequence length increases.

This is due to the\ncomplex contextual information in the text and the lack of open-source\nbenchmarking datasets and evaluation frameworks that can be used to develop and\ntest model performance. In this work, we use ChatGPT, the latest breakthrough\nin the field of large language models (LLMs), together with the extractive\nsummarization model C2F-FAR (Coarse-to-Fine Facet-Aware Ranking) to propose a\nhybrid extraction and summarization pipeline for long documents such as\nbusiness articles and books.

This defect limits the\ndeployment of pre-trained models since they would suffer from large performance\ndegradation when are assembled to unseen hardware.

In this work, we present\nmeasurements and calculations that quantify the predissociation probabilities\naffecting the cooling cycle. The results allow us to design a laser cooling\nscheme that will enable the creation of an ultracold and optically trapped\ncloud of CaH molecules. In addition, we use the results to propose a two-photon\npathway to controlled dissociation of the molecules, in order to gain access to\ntheir ultracold fragments, including hydrogen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 22:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

Comparing scalar fields using their topological descriptors has many\napplications in topological data analysis and visualization of scientific data.\nRecently, Munch and Stefanou introduced a labeled interleaving distance for\ncomparing two labeled merge trees, which enjoys a number of theoretical and\nalgorithmic properties. In particular, the labeled interleaving distance\nbetween merge trees can be computed in polynomial time. In this work, we define\nthe labeled interleaving distance for labeled Reeb graphs.

In this setting, neural operators trained to minimize squared\nerror losses, while capable of accurate short-term forecasts, often fail to\nreproduce statistical or structural properties of the dynamics over longer time\nhorizons and can yield degenerate results. In this paper, we propose an\nalternative framework designed to preserve invariant measures of chaotic\nattractors that characterize the time-invariant statistical properties of the\ndynamics. Specifically, in the multi-environment setting (where each sample\ntrajectory is governed by slightly different dynamics), we consider two novel\napproaches to training with noisy data. First, we propose a loss based on the\noptimal transport distance between the observed dynamics and the neural\noperator outputs. This approach requires expert knowledge of the underlying\nphysics to determine what statistical features should be included in the\noptimal transport loss.

Existing VCA QoE estimation\nmethods use passive measurements of application-level Real-time Transport\nProtocol (RTP) headers. However, a network operator does not always have access\nto RTP headers in all cases, particularly when VCAs use custom RTP protocols\n(e.g., Zoom) or due to system constraints (e.g., legacy measurement systems).\nGiven this challenge, this paper considers the use of more standard features in\nthe network traffic, namely, IP and UDP headers, to provide per-second\nestimates of key VCA QoE metrics such as frames rate and video resolution. We\ndevelop a method that uses machine learning with a combination of flow\nstatistics (e.g., throughput) and features derived based on the mechanisms used\nby the VCAs to fragment video frames into packets.

Examples include path\nplanning for of tethered robots with cable-length constraints, systems\ninvolving cables, multi-robot topological exploration & coverage, and,\ncongestion reduction for mobile robots navigation without inter-robot\ncoordination. Existing paradigm is to use topological path planning methods\nthat can provide optimal paths from distinct topological classes available in\nthe underlying configuration space. However, these methods usually require\nnon-trivial and non-universal geometrical constructions, which are\nprohibitively complex or expensive in 3 or higher dimensional configuration\nspaces with complex topology. Furthermore, topological methods are unable to\ndistinguish between locally optimal paths that belong to the same topological\nclass but are distinct because of genus-zero obstacles in 3D or due to\nhigh-cost or high-curvature regions. In this paper we propose an universal and\ngeneralized approach to multi-class path planning using the concept of a novel\nneighborhood-augmented graph, search-based planning in which can compute paths\nin distinct topo-geometric classes. This approach can find desired number of\nlocally optimal paths in a wider variety of configuration spaces without\nrequiring any complex pre-processing or geometric constructions. Unlike the\nexisting topological methods, resulting optimal paths are not restricted to\ndistinct topological classes, thus making the algorithm applicable to many\nother problems where locally optimal and geometrically distinct paths are of\ninterest. For the demonstration of an application of the proposed approach, we\nimplement our algorithm to planning for shortest traversible paths for a\ntethered robot with cable-length constraint navigating in 3D and validate it in\nsimulations & experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 23:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

The principle of asynchronous federated\nlearning is to allow the server to aggregate the model once it receives an\nupdate from any client rather than waiting for updates from multiple clients or\nwaiting a specified amount of time in the synchronous mode. Due to the\nasynchronous setting, the stale model problem could occur, where the slow\nclients could utilize an outdated local model for their local data training.\nConsequently, when these locally trained models are uploaded to the server,\nthey may impede the convergence of the global training. Therefore, effective\nmodel aggregation strategies play a significant role in updating the global\nmodel. Besides, client scheduling is also critical when heterogeneous clients\nwith diversified computing capacities are participating in the federated\nlearning process. This work first investigates the impact of the convergence of\nasynchronous federated learning mode when adopting the aggregation coefficient\nin synchronous mode. The effective aggregation solutions that can achieve the\nsame convergence result as in the synchronous mode are then proposed, followed\nby an improved aggregation method with client scheduling.

Consequently, the generalizability and scalability of\nsemi-supervised learning are often hindered by this assumption.

Existing distributed learning paradigms, such as Federated Learning,\nenable this via model aggregation which enforces a strong form of modeling\nhomogeneity and synchronicity across clients.

For example, in distributed sensing, heterogeneous\nsensors reading data from different views of the same phenomenon would need to\nuse different models for different data modalities. Local learning therefore\nhappens in isolation but inference requires merging the local models to achieve\nconsensus. To enable consensus among local models, we propose a feature fusion\napproach that extracts local representations from local models and incorporates\nthem into a global representation that improves the prediction performance.\nAchieving this requires addressing two non-trivial problems. First, we need to\nlearn an alignment between similar feature components which are arbitrarily\narranged across clients to enable representation aggregation. Second, we need\nto learn a consensus graph that captures the high-order interactions between\nlocal feature spaces and how to combine them to achieve a better prediction.\nThis paper presents solutions to these problems and demonstrates them in\nreal-world applications on time series data such as power grids and traffic\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 02:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

The associated risks will be revealed as we\ndelegate an increasing number of tasks to machines for automated completion. A\nbig question emerges: how can we make machines behave responsibly when helping\nhumans automate tasks as personal copilots? In this paper, we explore this\nquestion in depth from the perspectives of feasibility, completeness and\nsecurity. In specific, we present Responsible Task Automation (ResponsibleTA)\nas a fundamental framework to facilitate responsible collaboration between\nLLM-based coordinators and executors for task automation with three empowered\ncapabilities: 1) predicting the feasibility of the commands for executors; 2)\nverifying the completeness of executors; 3) enhancing the security (e.g., the\nprotection of users' privacy). We further propose and compare two paradigms for\nimplementing the first two capabilities. One is to leverage the generic\nknowledge of LLMs themselves via prompt engineering while the other is to adopt\ndomain-specific learnable models. Moreover, we introduce a local memory\nmechanism for achieving the third capability.

Active learning is such a technique to address this issue\nthat allows developers to train a model with reduced data while producing\nmodels with desired performance, which has been well studied in computer vision\nand natural language processing domains. Unfortunately, there is no such work\nthat explores the effectiveness of active learning for code models.

RIG has many applications, including but not limited to autonomous\nexploration and mapping, 3D reconstruction or inspection, search and rescue,\nand environmental monitoring. A RIG system relies on a probabilistic model's\nprediction uncertainty to identify critical areas for informative data\ncollection. Gaussian Processes (GPs) with stationary kernels have been widely\nadopted for spatial modeling. However, real-world spatial data is typically\nnon-stationary -- different locations do not have the same degree of\nvariability. As a result, the prediction uncertainty does not accurately reveal\nprediction error, limiting the success of RIG algorithms. We propose a family\nof non-stationary kernels named Attentive Kernel (AK), which is simple, robust,\nand can extend any existing kernel to a non-stationary one. We evaluate the new\nkernel in elevation mapping tasks, where AK provides better accuracy and\nuncertainty quantification over the commonly used stationary kernels and the\nleading non-stationary kernels. The improved uncertainty quantification guides\nthe downstream informative planner to collect more valuable data around the\nhigh-error area, further increasing prediction accuracy.

The existence of the\nthin shell leads to a piecewise metric of the black hole spacetime beyond the\nhorizon, which is divided into two stationary spacetime parts by the radius of\nthe thin shell. As a result, the potential function $V(r)$ of the QNM equation\nis also discontinuous. To solve the QNM equation with the discontinuous\npotential function, we propose two methods, matrix method and generalized\nHorowitz-Hubeny Method.

By targeting\nthe hard (uncertain) instances with existing AL methods, the intermediate\ninstances with a novel label suggestion scheme using submodular mutual\ninformation functions on a per-class basis, and the easy (confident) instances\nwith highest-confidence auto-labeling, CLARIFIER can improve over the\nperformance of existing AL approaches on multiple datasets -- particularly on\nthose that have a large number of classes -- by almost 1.5$\\times$ to 2$\\times$\nin terms of relative labeling cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 05:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

Current fair trade protocols generally\ninvolve a trusted third-party (TTP), which achieves fairness by heavily relying\non the TTP's behaviors and the two parties' trust in the TTP. With the\nemergence of Blockchain, its decentralization and transparency make it a very\ngood candidate to replace the TTP.

Consequently, it is imperative to develop models\nthat can effectively generalize to unseen distributions where data is\ndistributed across different domains. In response to this challenge, there has\nbeen a surge of interest in federated domain generalization (FDG) in recent\nyears. FDG combines the strengths of federated learning (FL) and domain\ngeneralization (DG) techniques to enable multiple source domains to\ncollaboratively learn a model capable of directly generalizing to unseen\ndomains while preserving data privacy. However, generalizing the federated\nmodel under domain shifts is a technically challenging problem that has\nreceived scant attention in the research area so far.

Initially, we discuss the\ndevelopment process from traditional machine learning to domain adaptation and\ndomain generalization, leading to FDG as well as provide the corresponding\nformal definition. Then, we categorize recent methodologies into four classes:\nfederated domain alignment, data manipulation, learning strategies, and\naggregation optimization, and present suitable algorithms in detail for each\ncategory. Next, we introduce commonly used datasets, applications, evaluations,\nand benchmarks. Finally, we conclude this survey by providing some potential\nresearch topics for the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 07:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

Assuming fast radio bursts (FRBs) are produced by matter travelling\nultra-relativistically in a localised region of a smooth bundle of streamlines,\nwe study the constraints applied by geometry to the morphology and polarisation\nof the burst in time and frequency independently of the intrinsic radiative\nprocess. Methods. We express the problem only in terms of the local properties\nof direction and curvature of a streamline. This allows us to cast the general\nresults to any desired geometry. We illustrate by applying this framework to\ntwo geometries inspired by pulsar and magnetar magnetospheres, namely the\ndipolar polar-cap region and a magnetic dipole with an additional toroidal\ncomponent. Results. Geometry constrains bursts to occur within an envelope in\nthe frequency vs. time plane (dynamic spectrum). This envelope notably\ncharacterises spectral occupancy and frequency drifts (both burst-to-burst and\nwithin an individual burst). We illustrate how one can simulate bursts by\nspecifying some basic properties of an intrinsic emission process. In\nparticular we show that the typical properties of one-off bursts can be\nproduced in polar-cap geometry by a star with spin period > 1s, while bursts\nfrom repeating sources are better accounted for with an additional strong\ntoroidal component and a sub-second spin period. Conclusions. We propose that a\nrelationship between burst morphologies and the properties of the source, such\nas its spin period and magnetospheric properties, can be established at least\nqualitatively based on geometrical considerations. Our results favour models\nwhere repeaters are younger and faster magnetars with highly twisted\nmagnetospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 07:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

The spatial\nresolution, which can be reached, depends on one hand on the wavelength of the\nradiation, but also on the capability to measure - in the focal plane - Fourier\ncomponents with high spatial wave-vectors. This leads to a conflicting\nsituation at THz frequencies, because choosing a shorter wavelength for better\nresolution usually comes at the cost of less radiation power, concomitant with\na loss of dynamic range, which limits the detection of higher Fourier\ncomponents. Here, aiming at maintaining a high dynamic range and limiting the\nsystem costs, we adopt heterodyne detection at the 2nd sub-harmonic, working\nwith continuous-wave (CW) radiation for object illumination at 600 GHz and\nlocal-oscillator (LO) radiation at 300 GHz.

Recently, researchers have suggested that such bias is the combination\nof the annotator preference and stochastic error, which are modeled by\nconvolution blocks located after decoder and pixel-wise independent Gaussian\ndistribution, respectively. It is unlikely that convolution blocks can\neffectively model the varying degrees of preference at the full resolution\nlevel. Additionally, the independent pixel-wise Gaussian distribution\ndisregards pixel correlations, leading to a discontinuous boundary. This paper\nproposes a Transformer-based Annotation Bias-aware (TAB) medical image\nsegmentation model, which tackles the annotator-related bias via modeling\nannotator preference and stochastic errors. TAB employs the Transformer with\nlearnable queries to extract the different preference-focused features. This\nenables TAB to produce segmentation with various preferences simultaneously\nusing a single segmentation head. Moreover, TAB takes the multivariant normal\ndistribution assumption that models pixel correlations, and learns the\nannotation distribution to disentangle the stochastic error.

The main obstacle lies in\nthe modeling conundrum from distribution discrepancy across different scenes.\nTo remedy this, we first explore relationships between diverse low-light scenes\nbased on statistical analysis, i.e., the network parameters of the encoder\ntrained in different data distributions are close.

A preliminary important step can be to identify the most\ninfluential input parameters implied in dose estimation, before modelling and\naccounting for their related uncertainty in radiation-induced health risks\nestimates. In this work, a variance-based global sensitivity analysis was\nperformed to rank by influence the uncertain input parameters of the NCICT\nsoftware implied in brain and red bone marrow doses estimation, for four\nclasses of CT examinations. Two recent sensitivity indices, especially adapted\nto the case of dependent input parameters, were estimated, namely: the Shapley\neffects and the Proportional Marginal Effects (PME). This provides a first\ncomparison of the respective behavior and usefulness of these two indices on a\nreal medical application case. The conclusion is that Shapley effects and PME\nare intrinsically different, but complementary. Interestingly, we also observed\nthat the proportional redistribution property of the PME allowed for a clearer\nimportance hierarchy between the input parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 08:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

Although some progress\nhas been made in modeling neural responses to natural movies with deep neural\nnetworks, the visual representations of static and dynamic information under\nsuch time-series visual stimuli remain to be further explored. In this work,\nconsidering abundant recurrent connections in the mouse visual system, we\ndesign a recurrent module based on the hierarchy of the mouse cortex and add it\ninto Deep Spiking Neural Networks, which have been demonstrated to be a more\ncompelling computational model for the visual cortex. Using Time-Series\nRepresentational Similarity Analysis, we measure the representational\nsimilarity between networks and mouse cortical regions under natural movie\nstimuli. Subsequently, we conduct a comparison of the representational\nsimilarity across recurrent/feedforward networks and image/video training\ntasks. Trained on the video action recognition task, recurrent SNN achieves the\nhighest representational similarity and significantly outperforms feedforward\nSNN trained on the same task by 15% and the recurrent SNN trained on the image\nclassification task by 8%. We investigate how static and dynamic\nrepresentations of SNNs influence the similarity, as a way to explain the\nimportance of these two forms of representations in biological neural coding.\nTaken together, our work is the first to apply deep recurrent SNNs to model the\nmouse visual cortex under movie stimuli and we establish that these networks\nare competent to capture both static and dynamic representations and make\ncontributions to understanding the movie information processing mechanisms of\nthe visual cortex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 08:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

Despite\npublicly available trained models, their potential to be used for privacy\npreserving data sharing has not been fully explored yet. Training diffusion\nmodels on private data and disseminating the models and weights rather than the\nraw dataset paves the way for innovative large-scale data-sharing strategies,\nparticularly in healthcare, where safeguarding patients' personal health\ninformation is paramount. However, publishing such models without individual\nconsent of, e.g., the patients from whom the data was acquired, necessitates\nguarantees that identifiable training samples will never be reproduced, thus\nprotecting personal health data and satisfying the requirements of policymakers\nand regulatory bodies. This paper introduces a method for estimating the upper\nbound of the probability of reproducing identifiable training images during the\nsampling process. This is achieved by designing an adversarial approach that\nsearches for anatomic fingerprints, such as medical devices or dermal art,\nwhich could potentially be employed to re-identify training images.

We show that even for\nnon-integrable mappings in this class, the surfaces forming these spaces have\neffective anticanonical divisors and one can define a kind of period map\nsimilar to that in the theory of rational surfaces associated with discrete\nPainlev\\'e equations. This provides a bridge between the evolution of\ncoefficients in the deautonomised mapping and the induced dynamics on the\nPicard lattice which encode the dynamical degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 08:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

In this paper, we propose a\nneural network framework that utilizes chemical property information to improve\nthe performance of naphtha composition prediction. Our proposed framework\ncomprises two parts: a Watson K factor estimation network and a naphtha\ncomposition prediction network. Both networks share a feature extraction\nnetwork based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, while the\noutput layers use Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based networks to generate two\ndifferent outputs - Watson K factor and naphtha composition. The naphtha\ncomposition is expressed in percentages, and its sum should be 100%. To enhance\nthe naphtha composition prediction, we utilize a distillation simulator to\nobtain the distillation curve from the naphtha composition, which is dependent\non its chemical properties. By designing a loss function between the estimated\nand simulated Watson K factors, we improve the performance of both Watson K\nestimation and naphtha composition prediction. The experimental results show\nthat our proposed framework can predict the naphtha composition accurately\nwhile reflecting real naphtha chemical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 09:37:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

Learning-based approaches alleviate the manual efforts\nin designing patch synthesis rules. Among the learning-based approaches, the\nprompt-based approach which leverages the knowledge base of code pre-trained\nmodels via pre-defined prompts, obtains state-of-the-art performance in general\nprogram repair tasks. However, such prompts are manually defined and do not\ninvolve any specific clues for repairing Python type errors, resulting in\nlimited effectiveness.

TypeFix first mines generalized\nfix templates via a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm. The identified fix\ntemplates indicate the common edit patterns and contexts of existing type error\nfixes.

In most\nknowledge graphs, edges are typically used to either describe the relationships\nbetween entities or their associated attribute values.

The\nunderlying musculoskeletal structure then allows us to learn how their motion\ninfluences the geometrical deformations of the whole face.

The second model\nexpands such landmarks motion to a dense motion field, which is utilized to\nanimate a given 3D mesh in neutral state. Additionally, we introduce a novel\nloss function, named Cosine Loss, which minimizes the angle between the\ngenerated motion vectors and the ground truth ones. Using landmarks in 3D\ntalking head generation offers various advantages such as consistency,\nreliability, and obviating the need for manual-annotation.

Existing methods for counterfactual inference with continuous\noutcomes aim at point identification and thus make strong and unnatural\nassumptions about the underlying structural causal model. In this paper, we\nrelax these assumptions and aim at partial counterfactual identification of\ncontinuous outcomes, i.e., when the counterfactual query resides in an\nignorance interval with informative bounds. We prove that, in general, the\nignorance interval of the counterfactual queries has non-informative bounds,\nalready when functions of structural causal models are continuously\ndifferentiable. As a remedy, we propose a novel sensitivity model called\nCurvature Sensitivity Model. This allows us to obtain informative bounds by\nbounding the curvature of level sets of the functions. We further show that\nexisting point counterfactual identification methods are special cases of our\nCurvature Sensitivity Model when the bound of the curvature is set to zero. We\nthen propose an implementation of our Curvature Sensitivity Model in the form\nof a novel deep generative model, which we call Augmented Pseudo-Invertible\nDecoder.

The task of\nstructured reconstruction poses two fundamental challenges to DM: 1) A\nstructured geometry is a ``set'' (e.g., a set of polygons for a floorplan\ngeometry), where a sample of $N$ elements has $N!$ different but equivalent\nrepresentations, making the denoising highly ambiguous; and 2) A\n``reconstruction'' task has a single solution, where an initial noise needs to\nbe chosen carefully, while any initial noise works for a generation task. Our\ntechnical contribution is the introduction of a Guided Set Diffusion Model\nwhere 1) the forward diffusion process learns guidance networks to control\nnoise injection so that one representation of a sample remains distinct from\nits other permutation variants, thus resolving denoising ambiguity; and 2) the\nreverse denoising process reconstructs polygonal shapes, initialized and\ndirected by the guidance networks, as a conditional generation process subject\nto the sensor data.

In the physics literature, it has been shown that the\nhypermultiplet metric with such corrections must have an\n$\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ acting by isometries, related to S-duality. We give\na mathematical treatment of this result, specifying under which conditions\ninstanton corrected q-map spaces carry an action by isometries by\n$\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ or some of its subgroups. We further study the\nuniversal isometries of instanton corrected q-map spaces, and compare them to\nthe universal isometries of tree-level q-map spaces. Finally, we give an\nexplicit example of a non-trivial instanton corrected q-map space with full\n$\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ acting by isometries and admitting a quotient of\nfinite volume by a discrete group of isometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 11:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

Meanwhile, existing research on\naspect-based recommendations often relies on separate aspect extraction models\nor assumes the aspects are given, without accounting for the fact the optimal\nset of aspects could be dependent on the recommendation task at hand.\n  In this work, we propose to combine aspect extraction together with\naspect-based recommendations in an end-to-end manner, achieving the two goals\ntogether in a single framework. For the aspect extraction component, we\nleverage the recent advances in large language models and design a new prompt\nlearning mechanism to generate aspects for the end recommendation task.

In the UAV-to-centroid tier, each UAV can\nsimultaneously provide communications and illumination for the centroids of the\nground users over VLC links. In the D2D tier, the centroids retransmit received\ndata from UAV over D2D links to the cluster members. For network, the\noptimization problem of joint user association and deployment location of UAVs\nis formulated to maximize the received data, satisfy illumination constraint,\nand the user cluster size. An iterative algorithm is first proposed to\ntransform the optimization problem into a series of two interdependent sub\nproblems. Following the smallest enclosing disk theorem, a random incremental\nconstruction method is designed to find the optimal UAV locations. Then,\ninspired by unsupervised learning method, a clustering algorithm to find a\nsuboptimal user association is proposed. Our simulation results show that the\nproposed scheme on average guarantees the users brightness 0.77 lux more than\ntheir threshold requirements. Moreover, the received bitrate plus number of D2D\nconnected users under our proposed method is 50.69% more than the scenario in\nwhich we have RF Link instead of VLC link and do not optimize UAV location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 12:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

The second is the effective transfer and\naggregation of similar texture information from the Ref images. Nonetheless, an\nimportant detail of perceptual loss and adversarial loss has been\nunderestimated, which has a certain adverse effect on texture transfer and\nreconstruction. In this study, we propose a feature reuse framework that guides\nthe step-by-step texture reconstruction process through different stages,\nreducing the negative impacts of perceptual and adversarial loss. The feature\nreuse framework can be used for any RefSR model, and several RefSR approaches\nhave improved their performance after being retrained using our framework.\nAdditionally, we introduce a single image feature embedding module and a\ntexture-adaptive aggregation module. The single image feature embedding module\nassists in reconstructing the features of the LR inputs itself and effectively\nlowers the possibility of including irrelevant textures. The texture-adaptive\naggregation module dynamically perceives and aggregates texture information\nbetween the LR inputs and the Ref images using dynamic filters. This enhances\nthe utilization of the reference texture while reducing reference misuse.

However,\nmaintainers need to inspect a large volume of daily logs to identify the\nanomalous logs that reveal failure details for further diagnosis. Thus, how to\nautomatically distinguish these anomalous logs from normal logs becomes a\ncritical problem. Existing approaches alleviate the burden on software\nmaintainers, but they are built upon an improper yet critical assumption:\nlogging statements in the software remain unchanged. While software keeps\nevolving, our empirical study finds that evolving software brings three\nchallenges: log parsing errors, evolving log events, and unstable log\nsequences.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised approach named Evolving Log\nanalyzer (EvLog) to mitigate these challenges. We first build a multi-level\nrepresentation extractor to process logs without parsing to prevent errors from\nthe parser. The multi-level representations preserve the essential semantics of\nlogs while leaving out insignificant changes in evolving events. EvLog then\nimplements an anomaly discriminator with an attention mechanism to identify the\nanomalous logs and avoid the issue brought by the unstable sequence. EvLog has\nshown effectiveness in two real-world system evolution log datasets with an\naverage F1 score of 0.955 and 0.847 in the intra-version setting and\ninter-version setting, respectively, which outperforms other state-of-the-art\napproaches by a wide margin. To our best knowledge, this is the first study on\ntackling anomalous logs over software evolution. We believe our work sheds new\nlight on the impact of software evolution with the corresponding solutions for\nthe log analysis community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 12:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

In this work we study three\nscenarios for the production of dark matter via LED black holes: 1) Delayed\nEvaporating Black Holes (DEBHs) which grow to macroscopic sizes before\nultimately evaporating, 2) Instantly Evaporating Black Holes (IEBHs) which\nimmediately evaporate, and 3) stable black hole relics with a mass $M_*$ known\nas Planckeons. For a given reheating temperature, $T_\\mathrm{RH}$, we show that\nDEBHs produce significantly less dark matter than both IEBHs and Planckeons.\nIEBHs are able to produce the observed relic abundance of dark matter so long\nas the reheating scale is in the range $10^{-2} \\leq T_\\mathrm{RH}/M_* \\leq\n10^{-1}$. We calculate the average speed for the resulting dark matter and show\nthat it would be sufficiently cold for all dark matter masses $m_{dm} \\gtrsim\n10^{-4}$ GeV. This mechanism is viable for any scale of quantum gravity in the\nrange $10^4\\,\\mathrm{ GeV} \\leq M_* \\leq M_{Pl}$ and for any number of LEDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 13:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

Moreover,\nthese methods are mainly used in classification tasks, and rarely directly used\nin detection tasks. To address these issues, for the object detection network\nwe introduce a three-stage model compression method: dynamic sparse training,\ngroup channel pruning, and spatial attention distilling. Firstly, to select out\nthe unimportant channels in the network and maintain a good balance between\nsparsity and accuracy, we put forward a dynamic sparse training method, which\nintroduces a variable sparse rate, and the sparse rate will change with the\ntraining process of the network. Secondly, to reduce the effect of pruning on\nnetwork accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method called group channel\npruning. In particular, we divide the network into multiple groups according to\nthe scales of the feature layer and the similarity of module structure in the\nnetwork, and then we use different pruning thresholds to prune the channels in\neach group. Finally, to recover the accuracy of the pruned network, we use an\nimproved knowledge distillation method for the pruned network.

However, synthesizing novel views from these panoramas remains a\nkey challenge. Although existing neural radiance field methods can produce\nphotorealistic views under narrow-baseline and dense image captures, they tend\nto overfit the training views when dealing with \\emph{wide-baseline} panoramas\ndue to the difficulty in learning accurate geometry from sparse $360^{\\circ}$\nviews.

In this\npaper, a user evaluation based on crowdsourcing (subjective) and the Comparison\nCategory Rating (CCR) method is compared against the DNSMOS, ViSQOL and 3QUEST\n(objective) metrics. The overall quality scores of three speech enhancement\nalgorithms from real time communications (RTC) are used in the comparison using\nthe P.808 toolkit. Results indicate that while the CCR scale allows\nparticipants to identify differences between processed and unprocessed audio\nsamples, two groups of preferences emerge: some users rate positively by\nfocusing on noise suppression processing, while others rate negatively by\nfocusing mainly on speech quality. We further present results on the\nparameters, size considerations and speaker variations that are critical and\nshould be considered when designing the CCR-based crowdsourcing evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 13:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

Recently, \"hybrid\" methods\nhave been developed through which measured confounding is first attenuated via\npropensity scores and unmeasured confounding is addressed through (Bayesian)\ndynamic borrowing. Most efforts to date have focused on augmenting control arms\nwith historical controls. Here we consider augmenting treatment arms through\n\"expanded access\", which is a pathway of non-trial access to investigational\nmedicine for patients with seriously debilitating or life-threatening\nillnesses. Motivated by a case study on expanded access, we developed a novel\nmethod (the ProPP) that provides a conceptually simple and easy-to-use\ncombination of propensity score weighting and the modified power prior. Our\nweighting scheme is based on the estimation of the average treatment effect of\nthe patients in the trial, with the constraint that external patients cannot\nreceive higher weights than trial patients. The causal implications of the\nweighting scheme and propensity-score integrated approaches in general are\ndiscussed. In a simulation study our method compares favorably with existing\n(hybrid) borrowing methods in terms of precision and type-I error rate. We\nillustrate our method by jointly analysing individual patient data from the\ntrial and expanded access program for vemurafenib to treat metastatic melanoma.\nOur method provides a double safeguard against prior-data conflict and forms a\nstraightforward addition to evidence synthesis methods of trial and real-world\n(expanded access) data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 14:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

This study\nproposes an attention-based dual contrast generative model, called\nADC-cycleGAN, which can synthesize medical images from unpaired data with\nmultiple slices.

We address the problem\nof fatigue detection from biomechanical data from different sources, consisting\nof lower extremity joint angles and ground reaction forces from running\nathletes with the goal of better understanding the impact of fatigue on the\nbiomechanics of runners in general and on an individual level. This is done by\nsequentially testing for change in a datastream using a simple martingale test\nstatistic. Time-uniform probabilistic martingale bounds are provided which are\nused as thresholds for the test statistic. Sharp bounds can be developed by a\nhybrid of a piece-wise linear- and a law of iterated logarithm- bound over all\ntime regimes, where the probability of an early detection is controlled in a\nuniform way. If the underlying distribution of the data gradually changes over\nthe course of a run, then a timely upcrossing of the martingale over these\nbounds is expected. The methods are developed for a setting when change sets in\ngradually in an incoming stream of data.

The main obstacle to this measurement\nis the contamination by bright foregrounds. We evaluate our ability to retrieve\nthe [CII] signal in mock observations using the Simulated Infrared Dusty\nExtragalactic Sky. We compared two methods for dealing with the dust continuum\nemission from galaxies: the standard PCA and the arPLS method.

With the trend of\ndecreasing pressure in applications such as plasma etching, kinetic simulations\nare necessary to self-consistently capture the particle dynamics. The standard,\nexplicit, electrostatic, momentum-conserving Particle-In-Cell method suffers\nfrom tight stability constraints to resolve the electron plasma length (i.e.\nDebye length) and time scales (i.e. plasma period). This results in very high\ncomputational cost, making this technique generally prohibitive for the large\nvolume entire device modeling (EDM). We explore the Direct Implicit algorithm\nand the explicit Energy Conserving algorithm as alternatives to the standard\napproach, which can reduce computational cost with minimal (or controllable)\nimpact on results. These algorithms are implemented into the well-tested\nEDIPIC-2D and LTP-PIC codes, and their performance is evaluated by testing on a\n2D capacitively coupled plasma discharge scenario. The investigation revels\nthat both approaches enable the utilization of cell sizes larger than the Debye\nlength, resulting in reduced runtime, while incurring only a minor compromise\nin accuracy. The methods also allow for time steps larger than the electron\nplasma period, however this can lead to numerical heating or cooling. The study\nfurther demonstrates that by appropriately adjusting the ratio of cell size to\ntime step, it is possible to mitigate this effect to acceptable level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 14:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

Source-free domain adaptation, as a more\npractical technique, addresses the concerns of data privacy and storage\nlimitations in typical unsupervised domain adaptation methods. It utilizes a\nwell-trained source model and unlabeled target data to achieve adaptation in\nthe target domain. However, in the absence of source data and target labels,\ncurrent solutions cannot sufficiently reduce the impact of domain shift and\nfully leverage the information from the target data. In this paper, we propose\nan end-to-end source-free domain adaptation semantic segmentation method via\nImportance-Aware and Prototype-Contrast (IAPC) learning. The proposed IAPC\nframework effectively extracts domain-invariant knowledge from the well-trained\nsource model and learns domain-specific knowledge from the unlabeled target\ndomain. Specifically, considering the problem of domain shift in the prediction\nof the target domain by the source model, we put forward an importance-aware\nmechanism for the biased target prediction probability distribution to extract\ndomain-invariant knowledge from the source model. We further introduce a\nprototype-contrast strategy, which includes a prototype-symmetric cross-entropy\nloss and a prototype-enhanced cross-entropy loss, to learn target intra-domain\nknowledge without relying on labels. A comprehensive variety of experiments on\ntwo domain adaptive semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrates that the\nproposed end-to-end IAPC solution outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods.

Morphological parameters such as Sersic\nindex, effective radius, position angle, and axis ratio for the bulge and the\ndisk are thus derived at all the wavebands, which enables quantifying the\nmorphological K-correction for M81 and makes it possible to reproduce images\nfor the bulge and the disk in the galaxy at any waveband. The morphology as a\nfunction of wavelength appears as a variable-slope trend of the Sersic index\nand the effective radius, in which the variations are steep at UV--optical and\nshallow at optical--NIR bands; the position angle and the axis ratio keep\ninvariable at least at optical--NIR bands. It is worth noting that, the Sersic\nindex for the bulge reaches to about 4--5 at optical and NIR bands, but drops\nto about 1 at UV bands.

To tackle this problem, a\npossible solution is to use performance testing to determine how many\nrepetitions of a serverless function with a given input are needed to cater to\nthe performance fluctuation.

Using controlled few-cycle optical waveforms, the study\nof sub-cycle electron emission has enabled the generation of attosecond\nultraviolet pulses and the control of attosecond currents inside of solids.\nHowever, these experiments rely on high-energy laser systems not suitable for\nintegration with microcircuits. To move towards integrated optical frequency\nelectronics, a system suitable for integration into microcircuits capable of\ngenerating detectable signals with low pulse energies is needed. While current\nfrom plasmonic nanoantenna emitters can be driven at optical frequencies, low\ncharge yields have been a significant limitation. In this work we demonstrate\nthat large-scale electrically-connected plasmonic nanoantenna networks, when\ndriven in concert, enable a much higher charge yield sufficient for\nshot-to-shot carrier-envelope phase detection, which is a hallmark of the\nunderlying sub-cycle processes.

Based on our recent results, we aim to address a\nrelated question of how chiral information might have flowed in a prebiotic\nnetwork. Utilizing the crystallization properties of the central RNA precursor\nknown as ribose-aminooxazoline (RAO), we showed that its homochiral crystals\ncan be obtained from its fully racemic solution on a magnetic mineral surface,\ndue to the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. Moreover, we\nuncovered a mechanism facilitated by the CISS effect through which chiral\nmolecules, like RAO, can uniformly magnetize such surfaces in a variety of\nplanetary environments in a persistent manner. All this is very tantalizing,\nbecause recent experiments with tRNA analogs demonstrate high stereoselectivity\nin the attachment of L-amino acids to D-ribonucleotides, enabling the transfer\nof homochirality from RNA to peptides. Therefore the biological homochirality\nproblem may be reduced to ensuring that a single common RNA precursor (e.g.\nRAO) can be made homochiral. The emergence of homochirality at RAO then allows\nfor the chiral information to propagate through RNA, then to peptides, and\nultimately, through enantioselective catalysis, to metabolites.

In addition to the dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) technique,\nthe edge-cloud architecture provides a collaborative approach to efficient DNN\ninference. However, current edge-cloud collaborative inference methods have not\noptimized various compute resources on edge devices. Thus, we propose DVFO, a\nnovel DVFS-enabled edge-cloud collaborative inference framework, which jointly\noptimize DVFS and offloading parameters via deep reinforcement learning (DRL).\nSpecifically, DVFO automatically co-optimizes 1) CPU, GPU and memory\nfrequencies of edge devices, and 2) feature maps to be offloaded to cloud\nservers. In addition, it leverages a thinking-while-moving concurrent mechanism\nto accelerate the DRL learning process, and a spatialchannel attention\nmechanism to extract DNN feature maps of secondary importance for workload\noffloading. This approach improves energy efficiency and inference latency for\ndifferent DNN models under various edge-cloud network conditions.

Genetic\ncounselling and early diagnosis are essential for treating thalassemia and\nstopping it from being passed on to future generations. It may be hard for\nhealthcare professionals to differentiate between people with thalassemia\ncarriers and those without. The current blood tests for beta thalassemia\ncarriers are too expensive, take too long, and require too much screening\nequipment. The World Health Organization says there is a high death rate for\npeople with thalassemia. Therefore, it is essential to find thalassemia\ncarriers to act quickly. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the\nstandard test method, has problems such as cost, time, and equipment needs. So,\nthere must be a quick and cheap way to find people carrying the thalassemia\ngene. Using federated learning (FL) techniques, this study shows a new way to\nfind people with the beta-thalassemia gene.

We explore the potential of ChatGPT to enhance\nproductivity, streamline problem-solving processes, and improve writing style.\nFurthermore, we highlight the potential risks associated with excessive\nreliance on ChatGPT in these fields. These limitations encompass factors like\nincorrect and fictitious responses, inaccuracies in code, limited logical\nreasoning abilities, overconfidence, and critical ethical concerns of\ncopyrights and privacy violation. We outline areas and objectives where ChatGPT\nproves beneficial, applications where it should be used judiciously, and\nscenarios where its reliability may be limited. In light of observed\nlimitations, and given that the tool's fundamental errors may pose a special\nchallenge for non-experts, ChatGPT should be used with a strategic methodology.\nBy drawing from comprehensive experimental studies, we offer methods and flow\ncharts for effectively using ChatGPT. Our recommendations emphasize iterative\ninteraction with ChatGPT and independent verification of its outputs.\nConsidering the importance of utilizing ChatGPT judiciously and with expertise,\nwe recommend its usage for experts who are well-versed in the respective\ndomains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 06:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Writing is personal\nand usually the processing is done on-device. Ink generative models thus need\nto produce high quality content quickly, in a resource constrained environment.\n  In this work, we study ways to maximize the quality of the output of a\ntrained digital ink generative model, while staying within an inference time\nbudget. We use and compare the effect of multiple sampling and ranking\ntechniques, in the first ablation study of its kind in the digital ink domain.\n  We confirm our findings on multiple datasets - writing in English and\nVietnamese, as well as mathematical formulas - using two model types and two\ncommon ink data representations. In all combinations, we report a meaningful\nimprovement in the recognizability of the synthetic inks, in some cases more\nthan halving the character error rate metric, and describe a way to select the\noptimal combination of sampling and ranking techniques for any given\ncomputational budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 09:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

With self-supervised learning (SSL) models as a starting\npoint, we evaluate transfer learning and direct classification from SSL\nfeatures. We undertake our evaluation under rich conditions, with a goal to\ndevelop ADI systems from pretrained models and ultimately evaluate performance\non newly collected data. In order to understand what factors contribute to\nmodel decisions, we carry out a careful human study of a subset of our data.\nOur analysis confirms that domain shift is a major challenge for ADI models.

Italy has, unfortunately, been one of the first countries to be\nmassively involved in the outbreak of the disease. In this paper we present an\nextensive scientometric analysis of the research production both at global\n(entire literature produced in the first 2 years after the beginning of the\npandemic) and local level (COVID-19 literature produced by authors with an\nItalian affiliation). Our results showed that US and China are the most active\ncountries in terms of number of publications and that the number of\ncollaborations between institutions varies according to geographical distance.\nMoreover, we identified the medical-biological as the fields with the greatest\ngrowth in terms of literature production. Furthermore, we also better explored\nthe relationship between the number of citations and variables obtained from\nthe data set (e.g. number of authors per article). Using multiple\ncorrespondence analysis and quantile regression we shed light on the role of\njournal topics and impact factor, the type of article, the field of study and\nhow these elements affect citations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 18:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Earth Observation (EO) data and machine\nlearning algorithms play a key role in providing a comprehensive and timely\nview of crop conditions from field to national scales. However, machine\nlearning algorithms' prediction accuracy is often harmed by spatial\nheterogeneity caused by exogenous factors not reflected in remote sensing data,\nsuch as differences in crop management strategies. In this paper, we propose\nand investigate a simple technique called state-wise additive bias to\nexplicitly address the cross-region yield heterogeneity in Kazakhstan. Compared\nto baseline machine learning models (Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost), our\nmethod reduces the overall RMSE by 8.9\\% and the highest state-wise RMSE by\n28.37\\%. The effectiveness of state-wise additive bias indicates machine\nlearning's performance can be significantly improved by explicitly addressing\nthe spatial heterogeneity, motivating future work on spatial-aware machine\nlearning algorithms for yield forecasts as well as for general geospatial\nforecasting problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 19:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}
