In such a way, the distance between two qubits can be\nincreased considerably to a few millimeters, leaving enough space for arranging\ncontrol lines, readout resonators and other necessary structures. The increased\ninter-qubit distance provides more wiring space for flip-chip process and\nreduces crosstalk between qubits and from control lines to qubits. We use the\nterm Tunable Coupler with Capacitively Connecting Pad (TCCP) to name the\ntunable coupling part that consists of a transmon coupler and capacitively\nconnecting pads. With the different placement of connecting pads, different\nTCCP architectures can be realized. We have designed and fabricated a few\nmulti-qubit devices in which TCCP is used for coupling. The measured results\nshow that the performance of the qubits coupled by the TCCP, such as $T_1$ and\n$T_2$, was similar to that of the traditional transmon qubits without TCCP.\nMeanwhile, our TCCP also exhibited a wide tunable range of the effective\ncoupling strength and a low residual ZZ interaction between the qubits by\nproperly tuning the parameters on the design.

Furthermore, by introducing TCCP,\nwe also discuss the realization of the flip-chip process and tunable coupling\nqubits between different chips.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 16:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

We propose sequential tests based on adaptive stopping boundaries that\nensure shrinkage of the continue sampling region as the sample size increases.\nUnder minimal assumptions on the data sequence, we first develop a test based\non an oracle test statistic such that both false discovery rate (FDR) and false\nnondiscovery rate (FNR) are nearly equal to some prefixed levels with strong\ncontrol. Under a two-group mixture model assumption, we propose a data-driven\nstopping and decision rule based on local false discovery rate statistic that\nmimics the oracle rule and guarantees simultaneous control of FDR and FNR\nasymptotically as $m$ tends to infinity.

In each of\nthese, biological functionality requires collective flows to occur while\nself-organized structures are protected; however, the mechanisms by which\nactive flows can spontaneously constrain their dynamics to preserve structure\nhave not previously been explained. By studying collective flows and defect\ndynamics in active nematic films, we demonstrate the existence of a\nself-constraint -- a two-way, spontaneously arising relationship between\nactivity-driven isosurfaces of flow boundaries and mesoscale nematic\nstructures. Our results show that self-motile defects are tightly constrained\nto viscometric surfaces -- contours along which vorticity and strain-rate\nbalance. This in turn reveals that self-motile defects break mirror symmetry\nwhen they move along a single viscometric surface, in contrast with\nexpectations. This is explained by an interdependence between viscometric\nsurfaces and bend walls -- elongated narrow kinks in the orientation field.\nAlthough we focus on extensile nematic films, numerical results show the\nconstraint holds whenever activity leads to motile half-charge defects.

Modeling such inclusions as randomly pinned\nparticles that move only affinely and do not participate in plastic relaxation,\nwe study how the pinning influences the process of cavitation-driven fracture\nin an amorphous solid. Using extensive numerical simulations and probing in the\nathermal quasistatic limit, we show that just by pinning a very small fraction\nof particles, the tensile strength is increased and also the cavitation is\ndelayed. Further, the cavitation that is expected to be spatially heterogeneous\nbecomes spatially homogeneous by forming a large number of small cavities\ninstead of a dominant cavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 16:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

The\npresence of mixed data complicates the assessment of the associations between\nthem while adjusting for covariates. In our study, of particular interest are\nthe associations between college students' wellbeing and other mental health\nmeasures and how other risk factors moderate these associations during the\npandemic. To this end, we propose a unifying framework for studying partial\nassociation between mixed data. This is achieved by defining a unified residual\nusing the surrogate method.

It was recently observed that the Elo rating fails at\npreserving transitive relations among strategies and therefore cannot correctly\nextract the transitive component of a game. Our first contribution is to show\nthat the Elo rating actually does preserve transitivity when computed in the\nright space. Precisely, using a suitable invertible mapping $\\varphi$, we first\napply $\\varphi$ to the game, then compute Elo ratings, then go back to the\noriginal space by applying $\\varphi^{-1}$. We provide a characterization of\ntransitive games as a weak variant of ordinal potential games with additively\nseparable potential functions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce the\nconcept of transitivity order, the minimum number of invertible mappings\nrequired to transform the payoff of a transitive game into (differences of) its\npotential function. The transitivity order is a tool to classify transitive\ngames, with Elo games being an example of transitive games of order one. Most\nreal-world games have both transitive and non-transitive (cyclic) components,\nand we use our analysis of transitivity to extract the transitive (potential)\ncomponent of an arbitrary game.

However, the processes\ngoverning atmosphere erosion and replenishment are fundamentally different for\ninner and outer planets. Here, an atmosphere-interior evolution model is used\nto show that an airless Trappist-1b (and c) only weakly constrains stellar\nevolution, and that the odds of outer planets e and f retaining substantial\natmospheres remain largely unchanged. This is true even if the initial volatile\ninventories of planets in the Trappist-1 system are highly correlated. The\nreason for this result is that b and c sit unambiguously interior to the\nrunaway greenhouse limit, and so have potentially experienced ~8 Gyr of\nXUV-driven hydrodynamic escape; complete atmospheric erosion in this\nenvironment only weakly constrains stellar evolution and escape\nparameterizations. In contrast, e and f reside within the habitable zone, and\nlikely experienced a comparatively short steam atmosphere during Trappist-1's\npre-main sequence, and consequently complete atmospheric erosion remains\nunlikely across a broad swath of parameter space (e and f retain atmospheres in\n~98% of model runs). Naturally, it is still possible that all Trappist-1\nplanets formed volatile-poor and are all airless today. But the airlessness of\nb (and c) does not require this, and as such, JWST transit spectroscopy of e\nand f remains the best near-term opportunity to characterize the atmospheres of\nhabitable zone terrestrial planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 17:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

With the recent trend towards general-purpose representation\nlearning, the development of general representations for both recognition and\ngeneration tasks is also promoted. However, preliminary attempts mainly focus\non generation performance, but are still inferior on recognition tasks. These\nmethods are modeled in the vector-quantized (VQ) space, whereas leading\nrecognition methods use pixels as inputs. Our key insights are twofold: (1)\npixels as inputs are crucial for recognition tasks; (2) VQ tokens as\nreconstruction targets are beneficial for generation tasks. These observations\nmotivate us to propose an Alternating Denoising Diffusion Process (ADDP) that\nintegrates these two spaces within a single representation learning framework.\nIn each denoising step, our method first decodes pixels from previous VQ\ntokens, then generates new VQ tokens from the decoded pixels. The diffusion\nprocess gradually masks out a portion of VQ tokens to construct the training\nsamples. The learned representations can be used to generate diverse\nhigh-fidelity images and also demonstrate excellent transfer performance on\nrecognition tasks.

The MLE objective weights sequences\nproportionally to their frequency under the data distribution, with no guidance\nfor the model's behaviour out of distribution (OOD): leading to compounding\nerror during autoregressive generation. In order to address this compounding\nerror problem, we formulate sequence generation as an imitation learning (IL)\nproblem. This allows us to minimize a variety of divergences between the\ndistribution of sequences generated by an autoregressive model and sequences\nfrom a dataset, including divergences with weight on OOD generated sequences.\nThe IL framework also allows us to incorporate backtracking by introducing a\nbackspace action into the generation process.
