Analysis of fairness in real-world vision systems,\nsuch as object detection in driving scenes, has been limited to observing\npredictive inequity across attributes such as pedestrian skin tone, and lacks a\nconsistent methodology to disentangle the role of confounding variables e.g.\ndoes my model perform worse for a certain skin tone, or are such scenes in my\ndataset more challenging due to occlusion and crowds? In this work, we\nintroduce ICON$^2$, a framework for robustly answering this question. ICON$^2$\nleverages prior knowledge on the deficiencies of object detection systems to\nidentify performance discrepancies across sub-populations, compute correlations\nbetween these potential confounders and a given sensitive attribute, and\ncontrol for the most likely confounders to obtain a more reliable estimate of\nmodel bias. Using our approach, we conduct an in-depth study on the performance\nof object detection with respect to income from the BDD100K driving dataset,\nrevealing useful insights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 17:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Vision systems could help cope with these\nchallenges by offering tools to make better and more sustainable field\nmanagement decisions and support the breeding of new varieties of crops by\nallowing temporally dense and reproducible measurements. Recently, tackling\nperception tasks in the agricultural domain got increasing interest in the\ncomputer vision and robotics community since agricultural robotics are one\npromising solution for coping with the lack of workers and enable a more\nsustainable agricultural production at the same time. While large datasets and\nbenchmarks in other domains are readily available and have enabled significant\nprogress toward more reliable vision systems, agricultural datasets and\nbenchmarks are comparably rare. In this paper, we present a large dataset and\nbenchmarks for the semantic interpretation of images of real agricultural\nfields. Our dataset recorded with a UAV provides high-quality, dense\nannotations of crops and weeds, but also fine-grained labels of crop leaves at\nthe same time, which enable the development of novel algorithms for visual\nperception in the agricultural domain. Together with the labeled data, we\nprovide novel benchmarks for evaluating different visual perception tasks on a\nhidden test set comprised of different fields: known fields covered by the\ntraining data and a completely unseen field. The tasks cover semantic\nsegmentation, panoptic segmentation of plants, leaf instance segmentation,\ndetection of plants and leaves, and hierarchical panoptic segmentation for\njointly identifying plants and leaves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 16:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

In this work, we simulate the acceleration of\ncosmic-ray protons in a nearby Supernova remnant (SNR) by solving numerically\nthe hydrodynamic equations and the equation for the quasi-isotropic CR momentum\ndistribution in the spherically symmetrical case to derive the spectrum of\nprotons injected into the interstellar medium (ISM), and then simulate the\npropagation process of those accelerated CR particles to calculate the proton\nfluxes reaching the Earth.

An FEA model based on T-A formula\ntreats the cross-section of thin superconducting layers as 1D lines and,\ntherefore, only can predict the AC loss generated by the perpendicular magnetic\nfield.

One of the\nkey implicit assumptions when solving cooperative multi-robot problems is that\nall robots use the same (homogeneous) underlying algorithm. However, in\npractice, we want to allow collaboration between robots possessing different\ncapabilities and that therefore must rely on heterogeneous algorithms. We\npresent a system architecture and the supporting theory, to enable\ncollaboration in a decentralized network of robots, where each robot relies on\ndifferent estimation algorithms. To develop our approach, we focus on\nmulti-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with multi-target\ntracking. Our theoretical framework builds on our idea of exploiting the\nconditional independence structure inherent to many robotics applications to\nseparate between each robot's local inference (estimation) tasks and fuse only\nrelevant parts of their non-equal, but overlapping probability density function\n(pdfs). We present a new decentralized graph-based approach to the multi-robot\nSLAM and tracking problem. We leverage factor graphs to split between different\nparts of the problem for efficient data sharing between robots in the network\nwhile enabling robots to use different local sparse\nlandmark/dense/metric-semantic SLAM algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 16:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

For THA, it is of clinical significance to analyze the bone\nstructure from the CT images, especially to observe the structure of the\nacetabulum and femoral head, before the surgical procedure. For such bone\nstructure analyses, deep learning technologies are promising but require\nhigh-quality labeled data for the learning, while the data labeling is costly.\nWe address this issue and propose an efficient data annotation pipeline for\nproducing a deep learning-oriented dataset. Our pipeline consists of\nnon-learning-based bone extraction (BE) and acetabulum and femoral head\nsegmentation (AFS) and active-learning-based annotation refinement (AAR). For\nBE we use the classic graph-cut algorithm. For AFS we propose an improved\nalgorithm, including femoral head boundary localization using first-order and\nsecond-order gradient regularization, line-based non-maximum suppression, and\nanatomy prior-based femoral head extraction. For AAR, we refine the\nalgorithm-produced pseudo labels with the help of trained deep models: we\nmeasure the uncertainty based on the disagreement between the original pseudo\nlabels and the deep model predictions, and then find out the samples with the\nlargest uncertainty to ask for manual labeling.

Classical transmissions are recognized to be vulnerable to\nquantum computer attacks. Remarkably, the same quantum mechanics that engenders\nquantum computers offer guaranteed protection against these attacks via a\nquantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. Yet, long-distance transmission is\nproblematic since the signal decay in optical channels occurs at distances of\nabout a hundred kilometers. We resolve this problem by creating a QKD protocol,\nfurther referred to as the Terra Quantum QKD protocol (TQ-QKD protocol), using\nsemiclassical pulses containing enough photons for random bit encoding and\nexploiting erbium amplifiers to retranslate photon pulses and, at the same\ntime, ensuring that at this intensity only a few photons could go outside the\nchannel even at distances about hundred meters. As a result, an eavesdropper\nwill not be able to efficiently utilize the lost part of the signal. A central\nTQ-QKD protocol's component is the end-to-end control over losses in the\ntransmission channel which, in principle, could allow an eavesdropper to obtain\nthe transmitted information. However, our control precision is such that if the\ndegree of the leak falls below the control border, then the leaking states are\nquantum since they contain only a few photons. Therefore, available to an\neavesdropper parts of the bit encoding states representing `0' and `1' are\nnearly indistinguishable. Our work presents the experimental realization of the\nTQ-QKD protocol ensuring secure communication over 1032 kilometers. Moreover,\nfurther refining the quality of the scheme's components will greatly expand the\nattainable transmission distances.

However, our findings demonstrate that focusing solely\non CPU energy consumption for energy-efficient scheduling while neglecting\nmemory energy consumption leaves room for further energy savings. We propose\nJOSS, a runtime scheduling framework that leverages both CPU DVFS and memory\nDVFS in conjunction with core asymmetry and task characteristics to enable\nenergy-efficient execution of task-based applications. JOSS also enables the\nexploration of energy and performance trade-offs by supporting user-defined\nperformance constraints. JOSS uses a set of models to predict task execution\ntime, CPU and memory power consumption, and then selects the configuration for\nthe tunable knobs to achieve the desired energy performance trade-off. Our\nevaluation shows that JOSS achieves 21.2% energy reduction, on average,\ncompared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we demonstrate that even in the\nabsence of a memory DVFS knob, taking energy consumption of both CPU and memory\ninto account achieves better energy savings compared to only accounting for CPU\nenergy.

However,\nwe still wish to ensure a balanced unlabeled distribution during inference,\nwhich is the second challenge. To address both of these challenges, we propose\na three-faceted solution: a flexible distribution alignment that progressively\naligns the classifier from a dynamically estimated unlabeled prior towards a\nbalanced distribution, a soft consistency regularization that exploits\nunderconfident pseudo-labels discarded by threshold-based methods, and a schema\nfor expanding the unlabeled set with input data from the labeled partition.\nThis last facet comes in as a response to the commonly-overlooked fact that\ndisjoint partitions of labeled and unlabeled data prevent the benefits of\nstrong data augmentation on the labeled set.

Unlike traditional methods\nthat learn a diffusion model in pixel space, StableDiffusion learns a diffusion\nmodel in the latent space via a VQGAN, ensuring both efficiency and quality. It\nnot only supports image generation tasks, but also enables image editing for\nreal images, such as image inpainting and local editing. However, we have\nobserved that the vanilla VQGAN used in StableDiffusion leads to significant\ninformation loss, causing distortion artifacts even in non-edited image\nregions. To this end, we propose a new asymmetric VQGAN with two simple\ndesigns. Firstly, in addition to the input from the encoder, the decoder\ncontains a conditional branch that incorporates information from task-specific\npriors, such as the unmasked image region in inpainting. Secondly, the decoder\nis much heavier than the encoder, allowing for more detailed recovery while\nonly slightly increasing the total inference cost. The training cost of our\nasymmetric VQGAN is cheap, and we only need to retrain a new asymmetric decoder\nwhile keeping the vanilla VQGAN encoder and StableDiffusion unchanged.

With the learned multi-level content\ncorrespondences, GP-UNIT is able to perform valid translations between both\nclose domains and distant domains. For close domains, GP-UNIT can be\nconditioned on a parameter to determine the intensity of the content\ncorrespondences during translation, allowing users to balance between content\nand style consistency. For distant domains, semi-supervised learning is\nexplored to guide GP-UNIT to discover accurate semantic correspondences that\nare hard to learn solely from the appearance.

Whereas X-ray clusters are extensively used for cosmology, their\nidealistic modelling, through the hypotheses of spherical symmetry and\nhydrostatic equilibrium, are more and more being questioned. Along these lines,\nthe soft X-ray emission detected in tens of clusters with ROSAT was found to be\nhigher than what expected from the idealistic hot gas modelling, pointing to\nour incomplete understanding of these objects.

Method. By using the most massive halos in\nIllustrisTNG at z=0, we have predicted the hydrodynamical properties of the gas\nfrom cluster centers to their outskirts (5 R200), and modelled their X-ray\nradiation for various plasma phases. Results. First, we found that the radial\nprofile of temperature, density, metallicity and clumpiness of the ICM are in\ngood agreement with recent X-ray observations of clusters. Secondly, we have\ndeveloped a method to predict the radial profile of soft X-ray emission in\ndifferent bands, the column density of ions and the X-ray absorption lines (O\nVIII, O VII, Ne IX, and Ne IX) of warm-hot gas inside and around clusters.\nConclusion. The warm gas (in the form of both WCGM and WHIM gas) is a strong\nemitter in soft X-ray bands, and is qualitatively consistent with the\nobservational measurements.

An observational signature of\npre-SN mass loss is the detection of an early, short-lived peak prior to the\nradioactive-powered peak in the lightcurve of the SN. This is usually\nattributed to the SN shock passing through an extended envelope or\ncircumstellar medium (CSM). Such an early peak is common for double-peaked Type\nIIb SNe with an extended Hydrogen envelope but is uncommon for normal Type Ibc\nSNe with very compact progenitors. In this paper, we systematically study a\nsample of 14 double-peaked Type Ibc SNe out of 475 Type Ibc SNe detected by the\nZwicky Transient Facility. The rate of these events is ~ 3-9 % of Type Ibc SNe.\nA strong correlation is seen between the peak brightness of the first and the\nsecond peak. We perform a holistic analysis of this sample's photometric and\nspectroscopic properties. We find that six SNe have ejecta mass less than 1.5\nMsun. Based on the nebular spectra and lightcurve properties, we estimate that\nthe progenitor masses for these are less than ~ 12 Msun. The rest have an\nejecta mass > 2.4 Msun and a higher progenitor mass. This sample suggests that\nthe SNe with low progenitor masses undergo late-time binary mass transfer.\nMeanwhile, the SNe with higher progenitor masses are consistent with\nwave-driven mass loss or pulsation-pair instability-driven mass loss\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 18:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

For oriented stars $F$ of degree\nexactly four, we show the only heroes in $F$-free digraphs are transitive\ntournaments, or possibly special joins of transitive tournaments. Aboulker et\nal. characterized the set of heroes of $\\{H, K_{1} + \\vec{P_{2}}\\}$-free\ndigraphs almost completely, and we show the same characterization for the class\nof $\\{H, rK_{1} + \\vec{P_{3}}\\}$-free digraphs. Lastly, we show that if we\nforbid two \"valid\" orientations of brooms, then every transitive tournament is\na hero for this class of digraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 18:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

A high-resolution\nmethod (in angle) is used to approximate the uncollided components and a\nlow-resolution method is used to approximate the the collided component. After\neach time step, the kinetic distribution is reinitialized to be entirely\nuncollided. For this analysis, we consider a mono-energetic problem on a\nperiodic domains, with constant material cross-sections of arbitrary size.

However,\nimage-text pairs for pre-training are restricted to the intersection of images\nand texts, limiting their ability to cover a large distribution of real-world\ndata, where noise can also be introduced as misaligned pairs during\npre-processing. Conversely, unimodal models trained on text or image data alone\nthrough unsupervised techniques can achieve broader coverage of diverse\nreal-world data and are not constrained by the requirement of simultaneous\npresence of image and text. In this paper, we demonstrate that using\nlarge-scale unsupervised unimodal models as pre-training can enhance the\nzero-shot performance of image-text pair models.

The core idea is to decompose multi-variable symbolic\nregression into a set of single-variable SR problems, which are then combined\nin a bottom-up manner.

The\nKSC Granular Mechanics and Regolith Operations Lab tools have now been expanded\nto address volatile contamination of the lunar surface (Stern, 1999). Landing\nnearby such a crater will result in the migration of significant exhaust plume\ngas into the cold trap of the crater, and will also create an unnatural\natmosphere over the volatile reservoirs that are to be studied. Our\ncalculations address: 1) the time for the plume-induced local atmosphere above\ncold traps to decay to normal levels, 2) the efficiency of gas migration into a\npermanently shadowed crater when the landing is outside it but nearby, and 3)\nreduction on contamination afforded by moving the landing site further from the\ncrater or by topographically shielding the crater from the direct flux of a\nlander's ground jet. We also address plume volatiles adsorbed onto and driven\ninside soil ejecta particles from their residence in the high pressure\nstagnation region of the engine exhaust plume, and how their mechanical\ndispersal across the lunar surface contributes to the induced atmosphere. One\nadditional question is whether the collection of soil ejecta along the base of\na topographic feature will produce a measurable plume volatile release distinct\nfrom the background. We mostly address item 2). Item 3) is obvious from our\nresults excepting that the removal distances may be large, but changes to\nlanding strategy can improve the situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 18:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Recent experiments\nhave shown that the helimagnetic state survives down to the monolayer limit\nwith a layer-dependent magnetic transition temperature that suggests a relevant\nrole of the interlayer coupling.

We\nthen examine the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic exchange\ninteractions via first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We\nfind that the leading interlayer coupling is an antiferromagnetic\nsecond-nearest neighbor interaction that increases monotonically with pressure.\nThe ratio between isotropic third- and first-nearest neighbor intralayer\nexchanges, which controls the magnetic frustration and determines the magnetic\npropagation vector $\\mathbf{q}$ of the helimagnetic ground state, is also\nenhanced by pressure. As a consequence, our Monte Carlo simulations show a\nmonotonic increase in the magnetic transition temperature, indicating that\npressure is an effective means to tune the magnetic response of NiI$_{2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 18:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Traditionally, the value function is\napproximated by computing trajectories in a prediction horizon (never executed)\nthat foresees the future beyond the execution horizon. However, given the\nnon-convex dynamics of multi-contact motions, this approach is computationally\nexpensive. To enable online Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) of multi-contact\nmotions, we find efficient approximations of the value function. Specifically,\nwe propose a trajectory-based and a learning-based approach. In the former,\nnamely RHP with Multiple Levels of Model Fidelity, we approximate the value\nfunction by computing the prediction horizon with a convex relaxed model. In\nthe latter, namely Locally-Guided RHP, we learn an oracle to predict local\nobjectives for locomotion tasks, and we use these local objectives to construct\nlocal value functions for guiding a short-horizon RHP. We evaluate both\napproaches in simulation by planning centroidal trajectories of a humanoid\nrobot walking on moderate slopes, and on large slopes where the robot cannot\nmaintain static balance. Our results show that locally-guided RHP achieves the\nbest computation efficiency (95\\%-98.6\\% cycles converge online).

While it is relatively\neasy to capture large amounts of human point clouds, annotating 3D keypoints is\nexpensive, subjective, error prone and especially difficult for long-tail cases\n(pedestrians with rare poses, scooterists, etc.). In this work, we propose\nGC-KPL - Geometry Consistency inspired Key Point Leaning, an approach for\nlearning 3D human joint locations from point clouds without human labels. We\nachieve this by our novel unsupervised loss formulations that account for the\nstructure and movement of the human body. We show that by training on a large\ntraining set from Waymo Open Dataset without any human annotated keypoints, we\nare able to achieve reasonable performance as compared to the fully supervised\napproach. Further, the backbone benefits from the unsupervised training and is\nuseful in downstream fewshot learning of keypoints, where fine-tuning on only\n10 percent of the labeled training data gives comparable performance to\nfine-tuning on the entire set. We demonstrated that GC-KPL outperforms by a\nlarge margin over SoTA when trained on entire dataset and efficiently leverages\nlarge volumes of unlabeled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 19:46:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

In most scenarios, CSS researchers\nfirst obtain labels for documents and then explain labels using interpretable\nregression analyses in the second step. The recent advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) can lower costs for CSS research by annotating documents\ncheaply at scale, but such surrogate labels are often imperfect and biased. We\npresent a new algorithm for using outputs from LLMs for downstream statistical\nanalyses while guaranteeing statistical properties -- like asymptotic\nunbiasedness and proper uncertainty quantification -- which are fundamental to\nCSS research. We show that direct use of LLM-predicted surrogate labels in\ndownstream statistical analyses leads to substantial bias and invalid\nconfidence intervals, even with high surrogate accuracy of 80--90\\%. To address\nthis, we build on debiased machine learning to propose the design-based\nsemi-supervised learning (DSL) estimator. DSL employs a doubly-robust procedure\nto combine surrogate labels with a smaller number of gold-standard labels. Our\napproach guarantees valid inference for downstream statistical analyses, even\nwhen surrogates are arbitrarily biased, without requiring stringent\nassumptions, by controlling the probability of sampling documents for\ngold-standard labeling. Both our theoretical analysis and experimental results\nshow that DSL provides valid statistical inference while achieving root mean\nsquared errors comparable to existing alternatives that focus only on\nprediction without statistical guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 19:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

In this study, we develop a generalised transfer-learned OBS\nphase picker - OBSTransformer, based on automated labelling and transfer\nlearning. First, we compile a comprehensive dataset of catalogued earthquakes\nrecorded by 423 OBSs from 11 temporary deployments worldwide. Through automated\nprocesses, we label the P and S phases of these earthquakes by analysing the\nconsistency of at least three arrivals from four widely used machine learning\npickers (EqTransformer, PhaseNet, Generalized Phase Detection, and PickNet), as\nwell as the AIC picker. This results in an inclusive OBS dataset containing\n~36,000 earthquake samples.

Moreover, we extract 25,000 OBS noise samples from the same\nOBS networks using the Kurtosis method, which are then used for model training\nalongside the labelled earthquake samples. Using three groups of test datasets\nat sub-global, regional, and local scales, we demonstrate that OBSTransformer\noutperforms EqTransformer. Particularly, the P and S recall rates at large\ndistances (>200 km) are increased by 68% and 76%, respectively.

Since context, such as topological\nfeatures in the tumor surroundings, may hold important information for cancer\ngrading and diagnosis, a graph representation capturing all dependencies among\nregions in the WSI is very intuitive. Graph convolutional network (GCN) is\ndeployed to include context from the tumor and adjacent tissues, and\nself-supervised learning is used to enhance training through unlabeled data.\nMore specifically, the entire slide is presented as a graph, where the nodes\ncorrespond to the patches from the WSI. The proposed framework is then tested\nusing WSIs from prostate and kidney cancers. To assess the performance\nimprovement through self-supervised mechanism, the proposed context-aware model\nis tested with and without use of pre-trained self-supervised layer. The\noverall model is also compared with multi-instance learning (MIL) based and\nother existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 20:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

To compensate for the instability under such conditions, corrective\nactions must be taken. In comparison to a mechanical differential, an\nelectronic differential can independently control the two drive wheels and\nprovide means of generating more effective corrective actions. As a solution\nfor traction and stability issues in automobiles, this paper has developed a\ncontroller for a vehicle electronic differential consisting of two\nprogram-controlled rear motors. The control algorithm adjusts to changing road\nconditions. Traction was controlled using a motor reaction torque\nobserver-based slip ratio estimation, and yaw stability was achieved by\ntracking a reference yaw rate calculated using estimated tyre cornering\nstiffnesses. A recursive least squares algorithm was used to estimate cornering\nstiffness. The yaw rate of the vehicle, as well as its longitudinal and lateral\naccelerations, were measured, and the body slip angle was estimated using an\nobserver.

In this paper, we present a framework that\nleverages rapid prototyping of the hand using 3D-printing, and utilizes\nteleoperation to evaluate the hand in real world manipulation tasks. Using this\nframework, we design a 3D-printed 16-DoF dexterous anthropomorphic soft hand\n(DASH) and iteratively improve its design over three iterations. Rapid\nprototyping techniques such as 3D-printing allow us to directly evaluate the\nfabricated hand without modeling it in simulation.

The\nsources of the plasmas were removed from the etched sample to exclude a\ndamaging from UV emission and ion bombardment. Optical emission spectroscopy\nand mass-spectroscopy were used during the etching. The reaction mechanisms\nwere studied using quantum chemistry methods. It was suggested analytical\nmodels, which quantitively describe dependence of Si3N4 and SiO2 etch rate on\nthe fluxes of key reactants in NF3/O2 and NF3/O2/N2/H2 downstream plasmas. The\ndensities of the kye reagents were measured and calculated using plasma\nsimulation. Thus, the Si3N4 etch rate curve in NF3/O2 mixture has a peak, where\nNO density peaks.

To address these\nchallenges, we present Generative Text-Guided 3D Vision-Language Pretraining\nfor Unified Medical Image Segmentation (GTGM), a framework that extends of VLP\nto 3D medical images without relying on paired textual descriptions.\nSpecifically, GTGM utilizes large language models (LLM) to generate\nmedical-style text from 3D medical images.

To address this challenge,\nNeighboring Extremal (NE) has been developed as an efficient optimal adaption\nstrategy to adapt a pre-computed nominal control solution to perturbations from\nthe nominal trajectory. The resulting control law is a time-varying feedback\ngain that can be pre-computed along with the original optimal control problem,\nand it takes negligible online computation.

In NLP tasks such as machine translation and\npre-trained language modeling, we observe that given the same model\narchitecture, there is a large performance gap between supernet and training\nfrom scratch. Hence, supernet cannot be directly used and retraining is\nnecessary after finding the optimal architectures.\n  In this work, we propose mixture-of-supernets, a generalized supernet\nformulation where mixture-of-experts (MoE) is adopted to enhance the expressive\npower of the supernet model, with negligible training overhead.

The two components have competing\neffects, as they favour spreading by linear diffusion and blow-up by nonlocal\nattractive interactions, respectively. We find necessary and sufficient\nconditions for existence of ground states for manifolds with sectional\ncurvatures bounded above and below, respectively. In particular, for general\nCartan-Hadamard manifolds, superlinear growth at infinity of the attractive\npotential prevents the spreading. The behaviour can be relaxed for homogeneous\nmanifolds, for which only linear growth of the potential is sufficient for this\npurpose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 01:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Model\nquantization offers a solution which simultaneously reduces memory footprint\nand compute requirements. However, aggressive quantization may lead to an\nunacceptable loss in model accuracy owing to differences in sensitivity to\nnumerical imperfection across different layers in the model. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a mixed-precision post training quantization (PTQ)\napproach that assigns different numerical precisions to tensors in a network\nbased on their specific needs, for a reduced memory footprint and improved\nlatency while preserving model accuracy. Previous works rely on layer-wise\nHessian information to determine numerical precision, but as we demonstrate,\nHessian estimation is typically insufficient in determining an effective\nordering of layer sensitivities. We address this by augmenting the estimated\nHessian with additional information to capture inter-layer dependencies. We\ndemonstrate that this consistently improves PTQ performance along the\naccuracy-latency Pareto frontier across multiple models.

We further show that\nthe presence of cyclotron waves significantly weakens observed signatures of\nintermittency in sub-ion-kinetic turbulence, which are known to be another\npathway for dissipation. These observations results suggest that in the absence\nof cyclotron resonant waves, non-Gaussian, coherent structures are able to form\nat sub-ion-kinetic scales, and are likely responsible for turbulent heating.

Assessing the effectiveness of transfer\nlearning relies on understanding the similarity between the ground truth of the\nsource and target tasks. In real-world applications, tasks often exhibit\npartial similarity, where certain aspects are similar while others are\ndifferent or irrelevant. To investigate the impact of partial similarity on\ntransfer learning performance, we focus on a linear regression model with two\ndistinct sets of features: a common part shared across tasks and a\ntask-specific part. Our study explores various types of transfer learning,\nencompassing two options for parameter transfer. By establishing a theoretical\ncharacterization on the error of the learned model, we compare these transfer\nlearning options, particularly examining how generalization performance changes\nwith the number of features/parameters in both underparameterized and\noverparameterized regimes. Furthermore, we provide practical guidelines for\ndetermining the number of features in the common and task-specific parts for\nimproved generalization performance.

Moreover, in specific\nscenarios, particularly those characterized by high noise levels and small true\nparameters, sacrificing certain true features in the common part in favor of\nemploying more redundant features in the task-specific part can yield notable\nbenefits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 03:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

We propose test-time style shifting, which shifts the style of the\ntest sample (that has a large style gap with the source domains) to the nearest\nsource domain that the model is already familiar with, before making the\nprediction. This strategy enables the model to handle any target domains with\narbitrary style statistics, without additional model update at test-time.\nAdditionally, we propose style balancing, which provides a great platform for\nmaximizing the advantage of test-time style shifting by handling the\nDG-specific imbalance issues.

The yielding\nprocess is characterized by local plastic events leading to non-affine\ndisplacements, and their interactions. Despite the lack of long-range\nstructural order, these disordered materials exhibit long-range spatial\ncorrelations in the non-affine displacement fields, which stems from the\nunderlying elasticity. Measuring a correlation length scale in deformed\namorphous solids, during the plastic process, is a non-trivial challenge, often\nrequiring an ad-hoc definition of localized regions. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel computational approach called the \"soft matrix\" that enables\nsystematic analysis of mechanical response of local regions within a disordered\nsolid. In this method, we subject the amorphous solid to a quasistatic shear\nand allow a local region of interest to relax freely while allowing for elastic\nrelaxation of the background. The dependence of the yield strain upon the size\nof the probe region naturally reveals the existence of an intrinsic length\nscale ($\\zeta$) that governs the elasto-plastic properties, as observed in four\ndistinct model amorphous solids. This finding demonstrates the universality of\nthis characteristic length scale across a wide range of materials.

Existing methods usually first transform image-view features into\nbird-eye-view (BEV) by aid of inverse perspective mapping (IPM), and then\ndetect lane lines based on the BEV features. However, IPM ignores the changes\nin road height, leading to inaccurate view transformations. Additionally, the\ntwo separate stages of the process can cause cumulative errors and increased\ncomplexity. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient transformer\nfor 3D lane detection. Different from the vanilla transformer, our model\ncontains a decomposed cross-attention mechanism to simultaneously learn lane\nand BEV representations.

The novelty of the framework is that splitting error is\ndistinguished from the process time integration errors, i.e., the errors caused\nby discrete time integration of individual processes, leading to expressions\nthat are more easily interpreted utilizing existing physical understanding of\nthe processes that the terms represent. This application of this framework to\ndust life cycle in EAMv1 showcases such an interpretation, using the\nleading-order splitting error that results from the framework to confirm (i)\nthat the original EAMv1 scheme artificially strengthens the effect of dry\nremoval processes, and (ii) that the revised splitting reduces that artificial\nstrengthening. While the error analysis framework is presented in the context\nof the dust life cycle in EAMv1, the framework can be broadly leveraged to\nevaluate process coupling schemes, both in other physical problems and for any\nnumber of processes. This framework will be particularly powerful when the\nvarious process implementations support a variety of time integration\napproaches. Whereas traditional local truncation error approaches require\nseparate consideration of each combination of time integration methods, this\nframework enables evaluation of coupling schemes independent of particular time\nintegration approaches for each process while still allowing for the\nincorporation of these specific time integration errors if so desired. The\nframework also explains how the splitting error terms result from (i) the\nintegration of individual processes in isolation from other processes, and (ii)\nthe choices of input state and timestep size for the isolated integration of\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 04:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

In this paper, we propose an alternative but easy-to-use and effective\nsolution, Contrastive with Out-of-distribution (OOD) data for Long-Tail\nlearning (COLT), which can effectively exploit OOD data to dynamically\nre-balance the feature space. We empirically identify the counter-intuitive\nusefulness of OOD samples in SSL long-tailed learning and principally design a\nnovel SSL method. Concretely, we first localize the `head' and `tail' samples\nby assigning a tailness score to each OOD sample based on its neighborhoods in\nthe feature space. Then, we propose an online OOD sampling strategy to\ndynamically re-balance the feature space. Finally, we enforce the model to be\ncapable of distinguishing ID and OOD samples by a distribution-level supervised\ncontrastive loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets and\nseveral state-of-the-art SSL frameworks to verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.

In mean-field\napproximations of a quantum problem, one usually focuses on attaining the\nglobal minimum of the resulting energy function, while other minimum solutions\nare usually ignored. For frustrated systems, a strict distinction between\nglobal and local minimum is often not tenable since first-order type\ntransitions can interchange the roles played by two different minima. This begs\nthe question of whether there is any physical interpretation for the local\nminima encountered in mean-field approximations of quantum systems. We look at\nthe problem from the perspective of quantum spin systems. Two models are\nstudied, a frustrated model with quenched disorder, and a pure system without\nfrustration. Accurate classical energies of the minima are compared with the\nfull spectrum of energy levels, allowing us to search for signs of\ncorrespondence between them.

Recent end-to-end learning methods go from raw sensor\ndata to a trajectory output via Bird's Eye View(BEV) segmentation as an\ninterpretable intermediate representation. Motion planning over cost maps\ngenerated via Birds Eye View (BEV) segmentation has emerged as a prominent\napproach in autonomous driving. However, the current approaches have two\ncritical gaps. First, the optimization process is simplistic and involves just\nevaluating a fixed set of trajectories over the cost map. The trajectory\nsamples are not adapted based on their associated cost values. Second, the\nexisting cost maps do not account for the uncertainty in the cost maps that can\narise due to noise in RGB images, and BEV annotations. As a result, these\napproaches can struggle in challenging scenarios where there is abrupt cut-in,\nstopping, overtaking, merging, etc from the neighboring vehicles.\n  In this paper, we propose UAP-BEV: A novel approach that models the noise in\nSpatio-Temporal BEV predictions to create an uncertainty-aware occupancy grid\nmap. Using queries of the distance to the closest occupied cell, we obtain a\nsample estimate of the collision probability of the ego-vehicle. Subsequently,\nour approach uses gradient-free sampling-based optimization to compute low-cost\ntrajectories over the cost map. Importantly, the sampling distribution is\nadapted based on the optimal cost values of the sampled trajectories. By\nexplicitly modeling probabilistic collision avoidance in the BEV space, our\napproach is able to outperform the cost-map-based baselines in collision\navoidance, route completion, time to completion, and smoothness. To further\nvalidate our method, we also show results on the real-world dataset NuScenes,\nwhere we report improvements in collision avoidance and smoothness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 05:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Traditional approaches\nlike Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) guarantee asymptotically unbiased samples\nfrom such distributions but suffer from computational inefficiency,\nparticularly when dealing with high-dimensional targets, as they require\nnumerous iterations to generate a batch of samples. In this paper, we propose\nan efficient and scalable neural implicit sampler that overcomes these\nlimitations. Our sampler can generate large batches of samples with low\ncomputational costs by leveraging a neural transformation that directly maps\neasily sampled latent vectors to target samples without the need for iterative\nprocedures. To train the neural implicit sampler, we introduce two novel\nmethods: the KL training method and the Fisher training method. The former\nminimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence, while the latter minimizes the\nFisher divergence. By employing these training methods, we effectively optimize\nthe neural implicit sampler to capture the desired target distribution. To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our proposed\nsamplers, we evaluate them on three sampling benchmarks with different scales.\nThese benchmarks include sampling from 2D targets, Bayesian inference, and\nsampling from high-dimensional energy-based models (EBMs).

Starting with a parametric\nvector-autoregressive model, the parametric likelihood is nonparametrically\nadjusted in the frequency domain to account for potential deviations from\nparametric assumptions. We show mutual contiguity of the nonparametrically\ncorrected likelihood, the multivariate Whittle likelihood approximation and the\nexact likelihood for Gaussian time series. A multivariate extension of the\nnonparametric Bernstein-Dirichlet process prior for univariate spectral\ndensities to the space of Hermitian positive definite spectral density matrices\nis specified directly on the correction matrices. An infinite series\nrepresentation of this prior is then used to develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo\nalgorithm to sample from the posterior distribution.

Understanding the heat and fluid flow\nin complex urban environments is crucial for improving urban climate\nresilience. In order to gain a better understanding of the physical processes\nin urban areas, specifically in street canyons, we investigated simultaneous\nheat and flow fields at high spatial and temporal resolutions using\nLaser-induced Fluorescence (LIF) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV),\nrespectively. Our results of heat and flow in low-density urban models with a\nsite cover ratio and sky view factor of 0.21 and 0.6, respectively, indicate\nthat the flow is significantly influenced by a combination of factors,\nincluding canyon configuration, the presence of buoyant force, and the\nmagnitude of the approaching flow. The ventilation rate and heat flux from the\nstreet canyon, which are key factors shaping the urban microclimate, are found\ndominated significantly by the street canyon morphology. For instance, changing\nthe aspect ratio of a street canyon results in a significant change of air\nventilation rate, ranging from as low as 0.02 to as high as 1.5 under the same\nflow conditions. Additionally, canyons with high air ventilation rates exhibit\nsignificant heat flux removal at the canyon roof level, which is accurately\ndescribed by the local Richardson number.

However, detecting unusual or difficult examples is notably\nchallenging, as it is impossible to anticipate all potential inputs at test\ntime. To address this issue, prior work has proposed to minimize the model's\nconfidence on an auxiliary pseudo-OOD dataset.

Nevertheless, FL remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks in which an\nattacker compromises malicious clients, and injects poisoned model weights into\nthe aggregation process to yield attacker-chosen predictions for particular\nsamples. Existing countermeasures, mainly based on anomaly detection, may\nerroneously reject legitimate weights while accepting malicious ones, which is\ndue to inadequacies in quantifying client model similarities. Other defense\nmechanisms prove effective exclusively when confronted with a restricted number\nof malicious clients, e.g., less than 10%. To address these vulnerabilities, we\npresent G$^2$uardFL, a protective framework that reframes the detection of\nmalicious clients as an attributed graph clustering problem, thereby\nsafeguarding FL systems. This framework employs a client graph clustering\ntechnique to identify malicious clients and incorporates an adaptive method to\namplify the disparity between the aggregated model and poisoned client models,\nthereby eliminating previously embedded backdoors. A theoretical analysis of\nconvergence is also performed to demonstrate that the global model closely\napproximates the model untouched by any backdoor.

We propose a more generalized definition of calibration\nerror called Partitioned Calibration Error (PCE), revealing that the key\ndifference among these calibration error metrics lies in how the data space is\npartitioned. We put forth an intuitive proposition that an accurate model\nshould be calibrated across any partition, suggesting that the input space\npartitioning can extend beyond just the partitioning of prediction\nprobabilities, and include partitions directly related to the input. Through\nsemantic-related partitioning functions, we demonstrate that the relationship\nbetween model accuracy and calibration lies in the granularity of the\npartitioning function.

To validate the aforementioned\nanalysis, we propose a method that involves jointly learning a semantic aware\ngrouping function based on deep model features and logits to partition the data\nspace into subsets.

This is particularly challenging in\nthe ultraviolet (UV) range, where spin coating with hydrogen silsesquioxane\n(HSQ) appears as an interesting approach in terms of transmittance and\nrefractive index.

This facilitates the\nonset of magnetic reconnection in either place but with partly opposing effects\non the eruption.

At the same time, the upper reconnection begins\nto reduce the poloidal flux of the rope, decreasing its hoop force; eventually\nthis cuts the rope completely.

Yet the response of the integral perovskite-terahertz\noptical cavity system depends critically on the interaction strength of the\ncavity with the phonon: the transient terahertz response to optical excitation\ncan be increased up to 3-fold by tuning the cavity-perovskite interaction\nstrength. These results enable tunable switches and frequency-controlled\ninduced transparency devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 07:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Previous experimental studies\ninvestigated chemical reactions in porous media by visualizing reaction product\nor reactants mostly in uniform flow. However, the local reaction rate, which is\nnecessary to infer mechanisms of reaction in pore space, could not be obtained\nwithout considering transport of reaction products and reactants. Thus, the\ninterpretation remained elusive. We visualized the reaction rate field using\nchemiluminescnece within index-matched 3D porous media under zero acceleration\nand constant acceleration flow fields to investigate how pore scale chaotic\nmixing and Darcy scale fluid acceleration rectify reactive transport. We found\nthat the reaction rate kept increasing from upstream to downstream in constant\nacceleration field, whereas it increased only at the upstream zone in zero\nacceleration field. The ratio of dispersion rate and size of the mixing\ninterface determined such an effect of acceleration. Moreover, the experimental\nresults showed stronger dependency of reaction rate on velocity compared to the\nnumerical simulations that assume complete mixing in pore space. To explain\nthis, we suggested the mechanistic model that includes the pore scale folding\nof lamellae due to chaotic mixing and the pore scale concentration gradients\nagainst compression. Such a pore scale mechanism was consistent with the\nexperimentally observed change in reaction rate over the space. These results\ngive new insights on underlying mechanisms of reactive transport in porous\nmedia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 08:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

To address this issue,\nwe propose a methodology for adapting existing neural networks so that\nnormalization-equivariance holds by design. Our main claim is that not only\nordinary convolutional layers, but also all activation functions, including the\nReLU (rectified linear unit), which are applied element-wise to the\npre-activated neurons, should be completely removed from neural networks and\nreplaced by better conditioned alternatives. To this end, we introduce\naffine-constrained convolutions and channel-wise sort pooling layers as\nsurrogates and show that these two architectural modifications do preserve\nnormalization-equivariance without loss of performance. Experimental results in\nimage denoising show that normalization-equivariant neural networks, in\naddition to their better conditioning, also provide much better generalization\nacross noise levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 08:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Simply sharing the same visual feature representations for these\ntasks impairs the performance of tasks, while independent task-specific feature\nextractors lead to parameter redundancy and latency. Thus, we design two\nfeature-merge branches to learn feature basis, which can be useful to, and thus\nshared by, multiple perception tasks.

While radio galaxies and radio\nquasars dominate at the bright end, star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and\nradio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are more common at fainter flux\ndensities. Our aim is to develop a machine learning classifier that can\nefficiently and reliably separate AGNs and SFGs in radio continuum surveys. We\nperform supervised classification of SFGs vs AGNs using the Light Gradient\nBoosting Machine (LGBM) on three LOFAR Deep Fields (Lockman Hole, Bootes and\nELAIS-N1), which benefit from a wide range of high-quality multi-wavelength\ndata and classification labels derived from extensive spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) analyses. Our trained model has a precision of 0.92(0.01)\nand a recall of 0.87(0.02) for SFGs. For AGNs, the model has slightly worse\nperformance, with a precision of 0.87(0.02) and recall of 0.78(0.02). These\nresults demonstrate that our trained model can successfully reproduce the\nclassification labels derived from detailed SED analysis. The model performance\ndecreases towards higher redshifts, mainly due to smaller training sample\nsizes. To make the classifier more adaptable to other radio galaxy surveys, we\nalso investigate how our classifier performs with a poorer multi-wavelength\nsampling of the SED. In particular, we find that the far-infrared (FIR) and\nradio bands are of great importance. We also find that higher S/N in some\nphotometric bands leads to a significant boost in the model's performance. In\naddition to using the 150 MHz radio data, our model can also be used with 1.4\nGHz radio data.

The interest in such a\nsetting ranges from interventions related to criminal justice and welfare, all\nthe way to clinical decision-making and public health.

Building on the Transformer-based\nmodels with the domain adaptation, we compare fine-tuning with multi-task\nlearning and show that each subtask requires a different system configuration.\nIn our experiments, multi-task learning performs on par with standard\nfine-tuning for sexism detection and noticeably better for coarse-grained\nsexism classification, while fine-tuning is preferable for fine-grained\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 09:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Moreover, existing SE benchmarks mainly consider\nsentence pairs with low lexical overlap, so it is unclear how the SEs behave\nwhen two sentences have high lexical overlap. We introduce a high-quality SE\ndiagnostic dataset, HEROS. HEROS is constructed by transforming an original\nsentence into a new sentence based on certain rules to form a \\textit{minimal\npair}, and the minimal pair has high lexical overlaps. The rules include\nreplacing a word with a synonym, an antonym, a typo, a random word, and\nconverting the original sentence into its negation. Different rules yield\ndifferent subsets of HEROS. By systematically comparing the performance of over\n60 supervised and unsupervised SEs on HEROS, we reveal that most unsupervised\nsentence encoders are insensitive to negation. We find the datasets used to\ntrain the SE are the main determinants of what kind of sentence pairs an SE\nconsiders similar.

Thus, stellar spectra are\nproduced on an \"industrial scale\" with numbers well above those for current and\nanticipated ground based surveys.

As models are being increasingly used, on devices, to\nautomate tasks and power new applications, there have been concerns that such\nwhite-box access to its parameters, as opposed to the black-box setting which\nonly provides query access to the model, increases the attack surface. Directly\nextending the shadow modelling technique from the black-box to the white-box\nsetting has been shown, in general, not to perform better than black-box only\nattacks. A key reason is misalignment, a known characteristic of deep neural\nnetworks. We here present the first systematic analysis of the causes of\nmisalignment in shadow models and show the use of a different weight\ninitialisation to be the main cause of shadow model misalignment. Second, we\nextend several re-alignment techniques, previously developed in the model\nfusion literature, to the shadow modelling context, where the goal is to\nre-align the layers of a shadow model to those of the target model.We show\nre-alignment techniques to significantly reduce the measured misalignment\nbetween the target and shadow models.

RESULTS:\nThe V and I band light curves showed a phenomenon never before observed with\nsuch recurrence in any symbiotic system, namely short outbursts, starting\nbetween orbital phase 0.3 and 0.5 and lasting about a month, with a fast rise\nand a slower decline, and amplitude of 0.5-1 mag. In the Kepler light curve we\ndiscovered three frequencies with sidebands. We attribute a stable frequency of\n127.5 d$^{-1}$ (corresponding to an 11.3 minutes period) to the white dwarf\nrotation. We suggest that this detection probably implies that the white dwarf\naccretes through a magnetic stream, like in intermediate polars. The small\noutbursts may be ascribed to the stream-disc interaction. Another possibility\nis that they are due to localized thermonuclear burning, perhaps confined by\nthe magnetic field, like recently inferred in intermediate polars, albeit on\ndifferent timescales. We measured also a second frequency around 116.9 d$^{-1}$\n(corresponding to about 137 minutes), which is much less stable and has a\ndrift. It may be due to rocky detritus around the white dwarf, but it is more\nlikely to be caused by an inhomogeneity in the accretion disk. Finally, there\nis a third frequency close to the first one that appears to correspond to the\nbeating between the rotation and the second frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 10:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Our reasoning is that, in contrastive learning based\nmethods, the task-specific loss would suffer from decreasing diversity of\nnegative samples and the regularizer may hinder learning new distinctive\nrepresentations.

While FL ensures that a user's data always remain with the user, the\ngradients of the locally trained models must be communicated with the\ncentralized server to build the global model. This results in privacy leakage,\nwhere the server can infer private information of the users' data from the\nshared gradients. To mitigate this flaw, the next-generation FL architectures\nproposed encryption and anonymization techniques to protect the model updates\nfrom the server. However, this approach creates other challenges, such as a\nmalicious user might sabotage the global model by sharing false gradients.\nSince the gradients are encrypted, the server is unable to identify and\neliminate rogue users which would protect the global model. Therefore, to\nmitigate both attacks, this paper proposes a novel fully homomorphic encryption\n(FHE) based scheme suitable for FL. We modify the one-to-one single-key\nCheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS)-based FHE scheme into a distributed multi-key\nadditive homomorphic encryption scheme that supports model aggregation in FL.\nWe employ a novel aggregation scheme within the encrypted domain, utilizing\nusers' non-poisoning rates, to effectively address data poisoning attacks while\nensuring privacy is preserved by the proposed encryption scheme. Rigorous\nsecurity, privacy, convergence, and experimental analyses have been provided to\nshow that FheFL is novel, secure, and private, and achieves comparable accuracy\nat reasonable computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 11:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

To\naddress challenges posed by nonlinear and unknown distortion in received\nsignals, two learning-based detection methods, referred to as model-driven and\ndata-driven, are presented. The model-driven method employs a generalized\nGaussian distortion model to approximate the conditional distribution of the\ndistorted received signal. By using the outputs of coarse data detection as\nnoisy training data, the model-driven method avoids the need for additional\ntraining overhead beyond traditional pilot overhead for channel estimation. An\nexpectation-maximization algorithm is devised to accurately learn the\nparameters of the distortion model from noisy training data. To resolve a model\nmismatch problem in the model-driven method, the data-driven method employs a\ndeep neural network (DNN) for approximating a-posteriori probabilities for each\nreceived signal. This method uses the outputs of the model-driven method as\nnoisy labels and therefore does not require extra training overhead. To avoid\nthe overfitting problem caused by noisy labels, a robust DNN training algorithm\nis devised, which involves a warm-up period, sample selection, and loss\ncorrection. Simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed methods\noutperform existing solutions with the same overhead under various hardware\nimpairment scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 12:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

In particular, under a suitable\nscaling, the quadratic observables converge in the large $N$ limit to a\nmean-zero (singular) Gaussian field denoted by $\\mathcal{Q}$ with an explicit\ncovariance; and the observables which are renormalized powers of order $2n$\nconverge in the large $N$ limit to suitably renormalized $n$-th powers of\n$\\mathcal{Q}$.

To address this issue,\nwe propose an episodic memory optimization for meta-learning, we call\n\\emph{EMO}, which is inspired by the human ability to recall past learning\nexperiences from the brain's memory. EMO retains the gradient history of past\nexperienced tasks in external memory, enabling few-shot learning in a\nmemory-augmented way. By learning to retain and recall the learning process of\npast training tasks, EMO nudges parameter updates in the right direction, even\nwhen the gradients provided by a limited number of examples are uninformative.\nWe prove theoretically that our algorithm converges for smooth, strongly convex\nobjectives. EMO is generic, flexible, and model-agnostic, making it a simple\nplug-and-play optimizer that can be seamlessly embedded into existing\noptimization-based few-shot meta-learning approaches. Empirical results show\nthat EMO scales well with most few-shot classification benchmarks and improves\nthe performance of optimization-based meta-learning methods, resulting in\naccelerated convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 13:39:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

However, there are still many open questions about\nsuch events, in particular regarding their temperature range and dynamics. In\nthis article, we aim to determine whether any transition region response can be\ndetected for small-scale EUV brightenings and, if so, to identify whether the\nmeasured spectra correspond to any previously reported bursts in the transition\nregion, such as Explosive Events (EEs). EUV brightenings were detected in a\n~29.4 minute dataset sampled by Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on 8\nMarch 2022 using an automated detection algorithm. Any potential transition\nregion response was inferred through analysis of imaging and spectral data\nsampled through coordinated observations conducted by the Interface Region\nImaging Spectrograph (IRIS). EUV brightenings display a range of responses in\nIRIS slit-jaw imager (SJI) data. Some events have clear signatures in the Mg II\nand Si IV SJI filters, whilst others have no discernible counterpart. Both\nextended and more complex EUV brightenings are found to, sometimes, have\nresponses in IRIS SJI data. Examples of EUI intensities peaking before, during,\nand after their IRIS counterparts were found in lightcurves constructed\nco-spatial to EUV brightenings. Importantly, therefore, it is likely that not\nall EUV brightenings are driven in the same way, with some seemingly being\nmagnetic reconnection driven and others not. A single EUV brightening occurred\nco-spatial to the IRIS slit, with its spectra matching the properties of EEs.\nEUV brightenings is a term used to describe a range of small-scale event in the\nsolar corona. The physics responsible for all EUV brightenings is likely not\nthe same and, therefore, more research is required to assess their importance\ntowards global questions in the field, such as coronal heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 13:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Spatial relationships are effectively extracted while\npreserving the channel prior by employing a multi-scale depth-wise\nconvolutional module.

In this paper, we propose a time-optimal control policy based on\nTime-Optimal Path Parameterization (TOPP) to guarantee such a behavior.\nSpecifically, we show that: for any robot motion that is strictly faster than\nthe motion recommended by our policy, there exists a human motion that results\nin a collision with the robot in a non-stationary state.

Since\ndirectly optimizing the gradient regularization norm is computationally\nexpensive and intractable for generating adversarial examples, we propose an\napproximation optimization method to simplify the gradient update of the\nobjective function.

After that, one popular way is to leverage a graph model which treats the\nsparse points/voxels as nodes and adopts graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn\nthe representation for event data. Although good performance can be obtained,\nhowever, their results are still limited mainly due to two issues. (1) Existing\nevent GNNs generally adopt the additional max (or mean) pooling layer to\nsummarize all node embeddings into a single graph-level representation for the\nwhole event data representation. However, this approach fails to capture the\nimportance of graph nodes and also fails to be fully aware of the node\nrepresentations. (2) Existing methods generally employ either a sparse point or\nvoxel graph representation model which thus lacks consideration of the\ncomplementary between these two types of representation models. To address\nthese issues, in this paper, we propose a novel dual point-voxel absorbing\ngraph representation learning for event stream data representation. To be\nspecific, given the input event stream, we first transform it into the sparse\nevent cloud and voxel grids and build dual absorbing graph models for them\nrespectively.

Nevertheless, news videos from different perspectives\nregarding the same event are commonly posted together, which contain\ncomplementary or contradictory information and thus can be used to evaluate\neach other mutually. To this end, we introduce a new and practical paradigm,\ni.e., cross-sample fake news video detection, and propose a novel framework,\nNeighbor-Enhanced fakE news video Detection (NEED), which integrates the\nneighborhood relationship of new videos belonging to the same event.

Furthermore, high density outflows\nshow evidence of dust-gas interactions. The classical chemical model of these\noutflows - a gas-phase only, spherically symmetric chemical kinetics model - is\nhence not appropriate for a majority of observed outflows. We have included\nseveral physical and chemical advancements step-by-step: a porous density\ndistribution, dust-gas chemistry, and internal UV photons originating from a\nclose-by stellar companion. Now, we combine these layers of complexity into the\nmost chemically and physically advanced chemical kinetics model of AGB outflows\nto date. By varying over all model parameters, we obtain a holistic view of the\noutflow's composition and how it (inter)depends on the different complexities.\nA stellar companion has the largest influence, especially when combined with a\nporous outflow. We compile sets of gas-phase molecules that trace the\nimportance of dust-gas chemistry and allow us to infer the presence of a\ncompanion and porosity of the outflow. This shows that our new chemical model\ncan be used to infer physical and chemical properties of specific outflows, as\nlong as a suitable range of molecules is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 14:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Previous approaches focused on local shapes and textures in\nsMRI that may be significant only within a particular domain. The learned\nrepresentations are likely to contain spurious information and have a poor\ngeneralization ability in other diseases and datasets. To facilitate capturing\nmeaningful and robust features, it is necessary to first comprehensively\nunderstand the intrinsic pattern of the brain that is not restricted within a\nsingle data/task domain. Considering that the brain is a complex connectome of\ninterlinked neurons, the connectional properties in the brain have strong\nbiological significance, which is shared across multiple domains and covers\nmost pathological information. In this work, we propose a connectional style\ncontextual representation learning model (CS-CRL) to capture the intrinsic\npattern of the brain, used for multiple brain disease diagnosis. Specifically,\nit has a vision transformer (ViT) encoder and leverages mask reconstruction as\nthe proxy task and Gram matrices to guide the representation of connectional\ninformation. It facilitates the capture of global context and the aggregation\nof features with biological plausibility. The results indicate that CS-CRL\nachieves superior accuracy in multiple brain disease diagnosis tasks across six\ndatasets and three diseases and outperforms state-of-the-art models.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that CS-CRL captures more brain-network-like\nproperties, better aggregates features, is easier to optimize and is more\nrobust to noise, which explains its superiority in theory.

Existing approaches to tool\nlearning have primarily relied on either extremely large language models, such\nas GPT-4, to attain generalized tool-use abilities in a zero-shot manner, or\nhave utilized supervised learning to train limited types of tools on compact\nmodels. However, it remains uncertain whether smaller language models can\nachieve generalized tool-use abilities without specific tool-specific training.\nTo address this question, this paper introduces ToolAlpaca, a novel framework\ndesigned to automatically generate a tool-use corpus and learn generalized\ntool-use abilities on compact language models with minimal human intervention.\nSpecifically, ToolAlpaca first collects a comprehensive dataset by building a\nmulti-agent simulation environment, which contains 3938 tool-use instances from\nmore than 400 real-world tool APIs spanning 50 distinct categories.\nSubsequently, the constructed corpus is employed to fine-tune compact language\nmodels, resulting in two models, namely ToolAlpaca-7B and ToolAlpaca-13B,\nrespectively. Finally, we evaluate the ability of these models to utilize\npreviously unseen tools without specific training. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ToolAlpaca achieves effective generalized tool-use\ncapabilities comparable to those of extremely large language models like\nGPT-3.5. This validation supports the notion that learning generalized tool-use\nabilities is feasible for compact language models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 15:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can generate\nrealistic images from any viewpoint.

The potential spatial\ncorrespondences displayed by NeRF between reconstructed scenes and real-world\nscenes offer a wide range of practical applications possibilities. Despite\nsignificant progress in 3D reconstruction since NeRF were introduced, there\nremains considerable room for exploration and experimentation. NeRF-based\nmodels are susceptible to interference issues caused by colored \"fog\" noise.\nAdditionally, they frequently encounter instabilities and failures while\nattempting to reconstruct unbounded scenes.
