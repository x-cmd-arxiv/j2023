From the perspective of scattering\ntheory, the effects of a $\\mathrm{T}\\overline{\\mathrm{T}}$ perturbation (and\nhigher spin versions thereof) is encoded in a universal deformation of the\ntwo-body scattering matrix by a CDD factor. It is then natural to ask how these\nperturbations influence the form factor equations and, more generally, the form\nfactor program. In this paper, we address this question for free theories,\nalthough some of our results extend more generally.

A common source of concern about automation in these\nsettings is that experts may exercise intuition that is difficult to model\nand/or have access to information (e.g., conversations with a patient) that is\nsimply unavailable to a would-be algorithm. This raises a natural question\nwhether human experts add value which could not be captured by an algorithmic\npredictor. We develop a statistical framework under which we can pose this\nquestion as a natural hypothesis test. Indeed, as our framework highlights,\ndetecting human expertise is more subtle than simply comparing the accuracy of\nexpert predictions to those made by a particular learning algorithm. Instead,\nwe propose a simple procedure which tests whether expert predictions are\nstatistically independent from the outcomes of interest after conditioning on\nthe available inputs (`features'). A rejection of our test thus suggests that\nhuman experts may add value to any algorithm trained on the available data, and\nhas direct implications for whether human-AI `complementarity' is achievable in\na given prediction task. We highlight the utility of our procedure using\nadmissions data collected from the emergency department of a large academic\nhospital system, where we show that physicians' admit/discharge decisions for\npatients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (AGIB) appear to be incorporating\ninformation not captured in a standard algorithmic screening tool.

However, CSS along with omnidirectional sensing, is not\nefficient at mmWave frequencies due to their directional nature of\ntransmission, as this limits secondary networks' ability to access the\nspectrum. This inspired us to create an analytical approach using stochastic\ngeometry to examine the implications of directional cognitive sensing in mmWave\nnetworks. We explore a scenario where multiple secondary transmitter-receiver\npairs coexist with a primary transmitter-receiver pair, forming a cognitive\nnetwork. The positions of the secondary transmitters are modelled using a\nhomogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) with corresponding secondary receivers\nlocated around them.

Although our results are derived in the\nframework of a viscous alpha-disk we also discuss the case of disks driven by\nangular momentum removal in magnetized winds.\n  Results: When giant planets are far from the star, dust and pebbles are\nconfined in a pressure bump at the outer edge of the planet-induced gap.\nInstead, when the planets reach the inner part of the disk (r << 2 au), dust\npenetrates the gap together with the gas. The dust/gas ratio can be enhanced by\nmore than an order of magnitude if radial drift of dust is not impeded farther\nout by other barriers. Thus, hot planets undergoing runaway gas accretion can\nswallow a large amount of dust.\n  Conclusions: Whereas the gas accreted by giant planets in the outer disk is\nvery dust-poor, that accreted by hot planets can be extremely dust-rich.

Our goal is to infer the unknown\nlabels of a sequence of data by using weak supervision sources that provide\nindependent noisy signals of the correct classification for each data point.\nThis setting includes crowdsourcing and programmatic weak supervision. We focus\non the non-stationary case, where the accuracy of the weak supervision sources\ncan drift over time, e.g., because of changes in the underlying data\ndistribution. Due to the drift, older data could provide misleading information\nto infer the label of the current data point. Previous work relied on a priori\nassumptions on the magnitude of the drift to decide how much data to use from\nthe past. Comparatively, our algorithm does not require any assumptions on the\ndrift, and it adapts based on the input. In particular, at each step, our\nalgorithm guarantees an estimation of the current accuracies of the weak\nsupervision sources over a window of past observations that minimizes a\ntrade-off between the error due to the variance of the estimation and the error\ndue to the drift. Experiments on synthetic and real-world labelers show that\nour approach indeed adapts to the drift. Unlike fixed-window-size strategies,\nit dynamically chooses a window size that allows it to consistently maintain\ngood performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 16:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

However, a major obstacle is the\nlimited availability of labeled data. We study the use of pseudolabels, i.e.,\nheuristic labels for unlabeled data, to enhance CLIP via prompt tuning.\nConventional pseudolabeling trains a model on labeled data and then generates\nlabels for unlabeled data. VLMs' zero-shot capabilities enable a ``second\ngeneration'' of pseudolabeling approaches that do not require task-specific\ntraining on labeled data. By using zero-shot pseudolabels as a source of\nsupervision, we observe that learning paradigms such as semi-supervised,\ntransductive zero-shot, and unsupervised learning can all be seen as optimizing\nthe same loss function. This unified view enables the development of versatile\ntraining strategies that are applicable across learning paradigms. We\ninvestigate them on image classification tasks where CLIP exhibits limitations,\nby varying prompt modalities, e.g., textual or visual prompts, and learning\nparadigms. We find that (1) unexplored prompt tuning strategies that\niteratively refine pseudolabels consistently improve CLIP accuracy, by 19.5\npoints in semi-supervised learning, by 28.4 points in transductive zero-shot\nlearning, and by 15.2 points in unsupervised learning, and (2) unlike\nconventional semi-supervised pseudolabeling, which exacerbates model biases\ntoward classes with higher-quality pseudolabels, prompt tuning leads to a more\nequitable distribution of per-class accuracy.

To\nfacilitate informed public health decision-making, the concerned parties\nusually rely on short-term daily and weekly projections generated via\npredictive modeling. Several deterministic and stochastic epidemiological\nmodels, including growth and compartmental models, have been proposed in the\nliterature. These models assume that an epidemic would last over a short\nduration and the observed cases/deaths would attain a single peak. However,\nsome infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, extend over a longer duration than\nexpected.

However, such holistic feedback conveys limited\ninformation on long text outputs; it does not indicate which aspects of the\noutputs influenced user preference; e.g., which parts contain what type(s) of\nerrors. In this paper, we use fine-grained human feedback (e.g., which sentence\nis false, which sub-sentence is irrelevant) as an explicit training signal. We\nintroduce Fine-Grained RLHF, a framework that enables training and learning\nfrom reward functions that are fine-grained in two respects: (1) density,\nproviding a reward after every segment (e.g., a sentence) is generated; and (2)\nincorporating multiple reward models associated with different feedback types\n(e.g., factual incorrectness, irrelevance, and information incompleteness). We\nconduct experiments on detoxification and long-form question answering to\nillustrate how learning with such reward functions leads to improved\nperformance, supported by both automatic and human evaluation.

To address this, we propose our method, TrIm, Elect Sign & Merge\n(TIES-Merging), which introduces three novel steps when merging models: (1)\nresetting parameters that only changed a small amount during fine-tuning, (2)\nresolving sign conflicts, and (3) merging only the parameters that are in\nalignment with the final agreed-upon sign. We find that TIES-Merging\noutperforms several existing methods in diverse settings covering a range of\nmodalities, domains, number of tasks, model sizes, architectures, and\nfine-tuning settings. We further analyze the impact of different types of\ninterference on model parameters, highlight the importance of resolving sign\ninterference.

While these are pretrained to\nrepresent hundreds of languages, end users of NLP systems are often interested\nonly in individual languages. For such purposes, the MMTs' language coverage\nmakes them unnecessarily expensive to deploy in terms of model size, inference\ntime, energy, and hardware cost. We thus propose to extract compressed,\nlanguage-specific models from MMTs which retain the capacity of the original\nMMTs for cross-lingual transfer. This is achieved by distilling the MMT\nbilingually, i.e., using data from only the source and target language of\ninterest. Specifically, we use a two-phase distillation approach, termed\nBiStil: (i) the first phase distils a general bilingual model from the MMT,\nwhile (ii) the second, task-specific phase sparsely fine-tunes the bilingual\n\"student\" model using a task-tuned variant of the original MMT as its\n\"teacher\". We evaluate this distillation technique in zero-shot cross-lingual\ntransfer across a number of standard cross-lingual benchmarks. The key results\nindicate that the distilled models exhibit minimal degradation in target\nlanguage performance relative to the base MMT despite being significantly\nsmaller and faster. Furthermore, we find that they outperform multilingually\ndistilled models such as DistilmBERT and MiniLMv2 while having a very modest\ntraining budget in comparison, even on a per-language basis. We also show that\nbilingual models distilled from MMTs greatly outperform bilingual models\ntrained from scratch.

In this work a novel,\nmultiscale model is developed for capturing the combined effect of plasticity\nmediated by multiple GBs simultaneously. This model is referred to as \"network\nplasticity\" (NP). The mathematical framework of graph theory is used to\ndescribe the microstructure connectedness, and the evolution of microstructure\nis represented as volume flow along the graph. By using the principle of\nminimum dissipation potential, which has previously been applied to grain\nboundary migration, a set of evolution equations are developed that transfer\nvolume and eigendeformation along the graph edges in a physically consistent\nway. It is shown that higher-order geometric effects, such as the pinning\neffect of triple points, may be accounted for through the incorporation of a\ngeometric hardening that causes geometry-induced GB stagnation. The result is a\ncomputationally efficient reduced order model that can be used to simulate the\ninitial motion of grain boundaries in a polycrystal with parameters informed by\natomistic simulations. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated through\ncomparison to multiple bicrystal atomistic simulations, as well as a select\nnumber of GB engineered and non-GB engineered data obtained from the\nliterature.

Such\nsystems are prohibitive to fully characterize with electronic structure\ncalculations. Machine-learned potentials offer a scalable solution; however,\nsuch potentials are only reliable if representative training data can be\nemployed, which typically requires large electronic structure calculations.\nHere, we use the nearsighted-force training approach to make high-fidelity\nmachine-learned predictions on large nanoparticles with $>$5,000 atoms using\nonly systematically generated small structures ranging from 38-168 atoms. The\nresulting ensemble model shows good accuracy and transferability in describing\nrelative energetics for CoPt nanoparticles with various shapes, sizes and Co\ncompositions. It is found that the fcc(100) surface is more likely to form a\nL1$_0$ ordered structure than the fcc(111) surface. The energy convex hull of\nthe icosahedron shows the most stable particles have Pt-rich skins and Co-rich\nunderlayers. Although the truncated octahedron is the most stable shape across\nall sizes of Pt nanoparticles, a crossover to icosahedron exists due to a large\ndownshift of surface energy for CoPt nanoparticle alloys. The downshift can be\nattributed to strain release on the icosahedron surface due to Co alloying. We\nintroduced a simple empirical model to describe the role of Co alloying in the\ncrossover for CoPt nanoparticles. With Monte-Carlo simulations we additionally\nsearched for the most stable atomic arrangement for a truncated octahedron with\nequal Pt and Co compositions, and also we studied its order-disorder phase\ntransition. We validated the most stable configurations with a new highly\nscalable density functional theory code called SPARC. Lastly, the\norder-disorder phase transition for a CoPt nanoparticle exhibits a lower\ntransition temperature and a smoother transition, compared to the bulk CoPt\nalloy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 18:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

To generate and evaluate the pancreas atlas\ntemplate, multi-contrast modality CT scans of 443 subjects (without reported\nhistory of pancreatic disease, age: 15-50 years old) are processed.

These two equations can be\ncombined to form a nonlinear semiclassical version of the KvH equation in\nconfiguration space. Every solution of the configuration space KvH equation\nsatisfies both the semiclassical phase space KvH equation and the\nHamilton-Jacobi constraint. For configuration space solutions, this constraint\nresolves the paradox that there are two different conserved densities in phase\nspace. For integrable systems, the KvH spectrum is the Cartesian product of a\nclassical and a semiclassical spectrum. If the classical spectrum is\neliminated, then, with the correct choice of Jeffreys-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin\n(JWKB) matching conditions, the semiclassical spectrum satisfies the\nEinstein-Brillouin-Keller quantization conditions which include the correction\ndue to the Maslov index. However, semiclassical analysis uses different choices\nfor boundary conditions, continuity requirements, and the domain of definition.\nFor example, use of the complex JWKB method allows for the treatment of\ntunneling through the complexification of phase space. Finally, although KvH\nwavefunctions include the possibility of interference effects, interference is\nnot observable when all observables are approximated as local operators on\nphase space. Observing interference effects requires consideration of nonlocal\noperations, e.g. through higher orders in the asymptotic theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 18:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

First, the RLVW V2I\nalgorithm is tested in the HIL simulator and then implemented in an\nOn-Board-Unit (OBU) in our experimental vehicle and tested at real world\nintersections. This same approach of HIL testing followed by testing in real\nintersections using our experimental vehicle is later extended to the GLOSA\napplication. The GLOSA application that is tested in this paper has both an\noptimal speed advisory for passing at the green light and also includes a red\nlight violation warning system. The paper presents the HIL and experimental\nvehicle evaluation systems, information about RLVW and GLOSA and HIL simulation\nand road testing results and their interpretations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 19:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

In such settings, we show that deep RL agents\ncan diverge into unseen states from which they can never recover due to the\nlack of resets, especially in highly stochastic environments. Towards\novercoming this divergence, we introduce a Lyapunov-inspired reward shaping\napproach that encourages the agent to first learn to be stable (i.e. to achieve\nbounded cost) and then to learn to be optimal. We theoretically show that our\nreward shaping technique reduces the rate of divergence of the agent and\nempirically find that it prevents it.

To tackle these\nissues, we propose a method, Unlearnable Diffusion Perturbation, to safeguard\nimages from unauthorized exploitation. Our approach involves designing an\nalgorithm to generate sample-wise perturbation noise for each image to be\nprotected. This imperceptible protective noise makes the data almost\nunlearnable for diffusion models, i.e., diffusion models trained or fine-tuned\non the protected data cannot generate high-quality and diverse images related\nto the protected training data. Theoretically, we frame this as a max-min\noptimization problem and introduce EUDP, a noise scheduler-based method to\nenhance the effectiveness of the protective noise.

During the accretion phase, comparable -- if not stronger -- GW\namplitudes are generated along the axis of rotation, which can be enhanced by\nthe low T/|W| instability. We show two dominant factors influencing the\ndirectionality of GW emission are the degree of initial rotation and explosion\nmorphology. Lastly, looking forward, we note the sensitive interplay between GW\ndetector site and supernova orientation, along with its effect on detecting\nindividual polarization modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 21:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

In this work, we introduce a Bayesian network to\ninaugurate correlations between agents' action selections in their joint\npolicy. Theoretically, we establish a theoretical justification for why action\ndependencies are beneficial by deriving the multi-agent policy gradient formula\nunder such a Bayesian network joint policy and proving its global convergence\nto Nash equilibria under tabular softmax policy parameterization in cooperative\nMarkov games. Further, by equipping existing MARL algorithms with a recent\nmethod of differentiable directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we develop practical\nalgorithms to learn the context-aware Bayesian network policies in scenarios\nwith partial observability and various difficulty. We also dynamically decrease\nthe sparsity of the learned DAG throughout the training process, which leads to\nweakly or even purely independent policies for decentralized execution.\nEmpirical results on a range of MARL benchmarks show the benefits of our\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 21:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

We consider a variant of this problem from the\nperspective of active learning, where the learner is endowed with the power to\ndecide which examples are labeled from each distribution in the collection, and\nthe goal is to minimize the number of label queries while maintaining\nPAC-learning guarantees. Our main challenge is that standard active learning\ntechniques such as disagreement-based active learning do not directly apply to\nthe multi-group learning objective. We modify existing algorithms to provide a\nconsistent active learning algorithm for an agnostic formulation of multi-group\nlearning, which given a collection of $G$ distributions and a hypothesis class\n$\\mathcal{H}$ with VC-dimension $d$, outputs an $\\epsilon$-optimal hypothesis\nusing $\\tilde{O}\\left( (\\nu^2/\\epsilon^2+1) G d \\theta_{\\mathcal{G}}^2\n\\log^2(1/\\epsilon) + G\\log(1/\\epsilon)/\\epsilon^2 \\right)$ label queries, where\n$\\theta_{\\mathcal{G}}$ is the worst-case disagreement coefficient over the\ncollection.

Second, we provide a more systematic study of the generalization\nability of RL methods to new networks with different traffic regimes. Again, we\nidentify the limitations of recent approaches.

(Nature, 2023) suggests that publications and patents are becoming\nless disruptive over time. Here we show that the reported decrease in\ndisruptiveness is an artifact of systematic shifts in the structure of citation\nnetworks unrelated to innovation system capacity. Instead, the decline is\nattributable to 'citation inflation', an unavoidable characteristic of real\ncitation networks that manifests as a systematic time-dependent bias and\nrenders cross-temporal analysis challenging. One driver of citation inflation\nis the ever-increasing lengths of reference lists over time, which in turn\nincreases the density of links in citation networks, and causes the disruption\nindex to converge to 0. A second driver is attributable to shifts in the\nconstruction of reference lists, which is increasingly impacted by\nself-citations that increase in the rate of triadic closure in citation\nnetworks, and thus confounds efforts to measure disruption, which is itself a\nmeasure of triadic closure. Combined, these two systematic shifts render the\ndisruption index temporally biased, and unsuitable for cross-temporal analysis.\nThe impact of this systematic bias further stymies efforts to correlate\ndisruption to other measures that are also time-dependent, such as team size\nand citation counts. In order to demonstrate this fundamental measurement\nproblem, we present three complementary lines of critique (deductive, empirical\nand computational modeling), and also make available an ensemble of synthetic\ncitation networks that can be used to test alternative citation-based indices\nfor systematic bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 23:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

This\npaper is motivated by the fact that balance across time is too stringent a\nrequirement for some applications; rather, the only desideratum is approximate\nbalance at the end of the horizon. In this work we design\n``limited-flexibility'' algorithms for three instantiations of the\nend-of-horizon balance problem: the balls-into-bins problem, opaque selling\nstrategies for inventory management, and parcel delivery for e-commerce\nfulfillment. For the balls-into-bins model, we show that a simple policy which\nbegins exerting flexibility toward the end of the time horizon (i.e., when\n$\\Theta\\left(\\sqrt{T\\log T}\\right)$ periods remain), suffices to achieve an\napproximately balanced load (i.e., a maximum load within ${O}(1)$ of the\naverage load). Moreover, with just a small amount of adaptivity, a threshold\npolicy achieves the same result, while only exerting flexibility in\n${O}\\left(\\sqrt{T}\\right)$ periods, matching a natural lower bound. We then\nadapt these algorithms to develop order-wise optimal policies for the opaque\nselling problem. Finally, we show via a data-driven case study that the\nadaptive policy designed for the balls-into-bins model can be modified to (i)\nachieve approximate balance at the end of the horizon and (ii) yield\nsignificant cost savings relative to policies which either never exert\nflexibility, or exert flexibility aggressively enough to achieve anytime\nbalance. The unifying motivation behind our algorithms is the observation that\nexerting flexibility at the beginning of the horizon is likely wasted when\nsystem balance is only evaluated at the end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2023 00:28:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 16:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

This might enable a strong resonant\nplasmonic response of the GC-FET detectors despite relatively lower electron\nmobility in the GC section covered by the b-P window BL.

However,\nreal-world data are complex and vary significantly across different domains. No\nsingle assumption can describe such complexity and be valid in all scenarios.\nThis is also confirmed by recent research that shows no UAD method is\nomnipotent.

This is a\nchallenging task given the heterogeneous model structures and assumptions\nadopted by existing UAD methods.

On the other hand, most tumors are measured with lower MRI\ndiffusion (despite being oedematous). The reason why malignant tumors have\nlower diffusion value [apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and Dslow] are\npoorly understood but has been proposed to be related to a combination of\nhigher cellularity, tissue disorganization, and increased extracellular space\ntortuosity. These explanations may be true, but it is also possible to that\nmany tumors have MRI properties similar to the spleen such as longer T2\n(relative to the liver) and these MRI properties may also contribute to the\nlower MRI measured ADC and Dslow . In other words, if we could hypothetically\nplant a piece of spleen tissue in the liver, MRI would recognize this planted\nspleen tissue as being similar to a tumor and measure it to have lower\ndiffusion than the liver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2023 05:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

We perform some initial developments of this\nidea. We first propose more sharply how to define a metric on conformal\nvariations of AdS through the action. This metric is negative, making the\ndistance ill-defined, a property relating to the famous conformal factor\nproblem of quantum gravity. However, in string theory, variations of the AdS\nconformal factor are accompanied by variations of the internal dimensions and\nof the background flux. We propose an $\\textit{action metric}$, which accounts\nfor all of these variations simultaneously. Accounting for the variations of\nthe overall volume of the internal dimensions can flip the sign of the action\nmetric making it positive. This positivity is related to the absence of scale\nseparation between the internal and external dimensions: the negative external\nconformal contribution must be sub-dominant to the positive internal\ncontribution. We then focus specifically on the families of solutions of\neleven-dimensional supergravity on AdS$_4 \\times S^7$ and AdS$_7 \\times S^4$.\nFor these, there is only a single further additional contribution to the action\nmetric coming from variations of the Freund-Rubin flux. This contribution is\nsubtle to implement, and the unique prescription we find requires singling out\nthe radial direction of AdS as special. Adding the flux contribution yields an\noverall total action metric which becomes positive for both the AdS$_4$ and\nAdS$_7$ families of solutions.

It is common\npractice to leverage a surrogate outlier dataset to regularize the model during\ntraining, and recent studies emphasize the role of uncertainty in designing the\nsampling strategy for outlier dataset. However, the OOD samples selected solely\nbased on predictive uncertainty can be biased towards certain types, which may\nfail to capture the full outlier distribution. In this work, we empirically\nshow that diversity is critical in sampling outliers for OOD detection\nperformance. Motivated by the observation, we propose a straightforward and\nnovel sampling strategy named DOS (Diverse Outlier Sampling) to select diverse\nand informative outliers. Specifically, we cluster the normalized features at\neach iteration, and the most informative outlier from each cluster is selected\nfor model training with absent category loss. With DOS, the sampled outliers\nefficiently shape a globally compact decision boundary between ID and OOD data.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DOS, reducing the average\nFPR95 by up to 25.79% on CIFAR-100 with TI-300K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2023 07:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

This work focuses on two primary CD-NOMA techniques:\nsparse-code multiple access (SCMA) and dense-code multiple access (DCMA). One\nof the primary challenges in implementing MIMO-CD-NOMA systems is designing the\noptimal detector with affordable computation cost and complexity. This paper\nproposes an iterative linear detector based on the alternating direction method\nof multipliers (ADMM). First, the maximum likelihood (ML) detection problem is\nconverted into a sharing optimization problem. The set constraint in the ML\ndetection problem is relaxed into the box constraint sharing problem. An\nalternative variable is introduced via the penalty term, which compensates for\nthe loss incurred by the constraint relaxation. The system models, i.e., the\nrelation between the input signal and the received signal, are reformulated so\nthat the proposed sharing optimization problem can be readily applied.\n  The ADMM is a robust algorithm to solve the sharing problem in a distributed\nmanner. The proposed detector leverages the distributive nature to reduce\nper-iteration cost and time. An ADMM-based linear detector is designed for\nthree MIMO-CD-NOMA systems: single input multi output CD-NOMA (SIMO-CD-NOMA),\nspatial multiplexing CD-NOMA (SMX-CD-NOMA), and spatial modulated CD-NOMA\n(SM-CD-NOMA).

Federated learning (FL) strategy is an\nalternative way to train the models without centralizing data from\nmulti-institutions. In this work, we propose a novel peer-to-peer federated\ncontinual learning strategy to improve low-dose CT imaging performance from\nmultiple institutions. The newly proposed method is called peer-to-peer\ncontinual FL with intermediate controllers, i.e., icP2P-FL.

In the proposed icP2P-FL method, the peer-to-peer federated continual\nlearning is introduced wherein the DL-based model is continually trained one\nclient after another via model transferring and inter institutional parameter\nsharing due to the common characteristics of CT data among the clients.\nFurthermore, an intermediate controller is developed to make the overall\ntraining more flexible. Numerous experiments were conducted on the AAPM\nlow-dose CT Grand Challenge dataset and local datasets, and the experimental\nresults showed that the proposed icP2P-FL method outperforms the other\ncomparative methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, and reaches an\naccuracy similar to a model trained with pooling data from all the\ninstitutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2023 07:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Our findings\nindicate that when the perturbation occurs at the end of the generative\nprocess, the ODE model outperforms the SDE model (with a large diffusion\ncoefficient).

The\nlimiting problem was solved in 1989 by Hoff-Liu in [13] for isentropic gas with\nsingle shock, but was left open for non-isentropic case. In this paper, we\nsolve the non-isentropic case, i.e., we first establish the global existence of\nsolutions to the non-isentropic Navier-Stokes equations with initial\ndiscontinuous shock data, and then show these solutions converge in\n$L^{\\infty}$ norm to a single shock wave of the corresponding Euler equations\naway from the shock curve in any finite time interval, as both the viscosity\nand heat-conductivity tend to zero.\n  Different from [13] in which an integrated system was essentially used,\nmotivated by [21,22], we introduce a time-dependent shift\n$\\mathbf{X}^\\varepsilon(t)$ to the viscous shock so that a weighted\nPoincar\\'{e} inequality can be applied to overcome the difficulty generated\nfrom the ``bad\" sign of the derivative of viscous shock velocity, and the\nanti-derivative technique is not needed. We also obtain an intrinsic property\nof non-isentropic viscous shock, see Lemma 2.2 below. With the help of Lemma\n2.2, we can derive the desired uniform a priori estimates of solutions, which\ncan be shown to converge in $L^{\\infty}$ norm to a single inviscid shock in any\ngiven finite time interval away from the shock, as the vanishing dissipation\nlimit. Moreover, the shift $\\mathbf{X}^\\varepsilon(t)$ tends to zero in any\nfinite time as viscosity tends to zero. The proof consists of a scaling\nargument, $L^2$-contraction technique with time-dependent shift to the shock,\nand relative entropy method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2023 09:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

The Shapley value has\nrecently been proposed as a principled tool to achieve this goal due to formal\naxiomatic justification. Since its computation often requires exponential time,\nstandard approximation strategies based on Monte Carlo integration have been\nconsidered. Such generic approximation methods, however, remain expensive in\nsome cases. In this paper, we exploit the knowledge about the structure of the\ndataset valuation problem to devise more efficient Shapley value estimators.

The KR axion is a pseudoscalar, which is dual to the field\nstrength of the spin-one field present in the massless gravitational multiplet\nin the theory of closed bosonic strings (compactified to four dimensions).\nMicroscopic models for the emergence of such backgrounds are provided both by\nlow-energy string-inspired gravitational theories with torsion (including\n(primordial) gravitational and axial gauge anomalies) and by Einstein-Cartan\ngravity, a closely related simpler model. In this work we examine the\npseudoscalar quanta of the KR axion in this background using the methods of\neffective field theory. In our model for leptogenesis there is a single sterile\n{right-handed} neutrino (RHN) with mass $m_N$. At energies lower than $m_N$, an\naxion potential is derived by integrating out {at one loop} the sterile\nneutrino in the spirit of effective field theory. The stability of this axion\npotential is important for the viability of our model. The vacuum of this\npotential is generally metastable. The stability of the vacuum is determined by\nthe ratio of the torsion-induced-axion coupling (which depends on the string\nmass scale) to $m_N$, which should be larger or equal to one, for the validity\nof our effective field theory. The vacuum is metastable only for axion\ncouplings much larger than the sterile neutrino mass (large string mass scales,\ne.g. comparable to the four-dimensional Planck mass), with a lifetime much\nlarger than the age of the observable Universe. By contrast, if axion couplings\nare comparable to the RHN mass the false vacuum is highly unstable, with a\nlifetime much smaller than the age of the observable Universe; in this case the\nCPTV leptogenesis scenario is not viable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2023 14:28:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 22:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Unfortunately, previous\nunsupervised approaches using the usage sequence of objects usually require a\nproper description of activities manually prepared by humans. Instead, we\nleverage the knowledge embedded in a Large Language Model (LLM) of ChatGPT.\nBecause the sequence of objects robustly characterizes the activity identity,\nit is possible that ChatGPT already learned the association between activities\nand objects from existing contexts. However, previous prompt engineering for\nChatGPT exhibits limited generalization ability when dealing with a list of\nwords (i.e., sequence of objects) due to the similar weighting assigned to each\nword in the list.

Each of these graphs was weighted and undirected and could thus\nincorporate the spatial or hierarchical relationships in all directions. In\naddition, each variant of the proposed neighborhood graphs was composed of a\nspatial feature-based subgraph and an aspatial prior-based subgraph. It\nexpanded on a random walker graph by using novel mechanisms to derive the edge\nweights of its spatial feature-based subgraph. These mechanisms included\nimplicit and explicit edge detection to enhance detection of weak boundaries\nbetween different classes in spatial domain. The implicit edge detection relied\non the outlier detection capability of the Tukey's function and the\nclassification reliabilities of the samples estimated by a hierarchical random\nforest classifier. Similar mechanism was used to derive the edge weights and\nthus the energy function of the hierarchical conditional random field. This\nway, the classification problem boiled down to a system of linear equations and\na minimization of the energy function which could be done via fast and\nefficient techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2023 15:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Phys. $\\textbf{64}$, 176 (2016), Alvarez-Gaume et al established\nthat pure $R^2$ theory propagates $\\textit{massless}$ spin-2 graviton on a de\nSitter (dS) background but $\\textit{not}$ on a locally flat background. We\nbuild on this insight to derive a Newtonian limit for the theory. Unlike most\nprevious works that linearized the metric around a locally flat background, we\nexplicitly employ the dS background to start with. We directly solve the field\nequation of the action $(2\\kappa)^{-1}\\int d^{4}x\\sqrt{-g}\\,R^2$ coupled with\nthe stress-energy tensor of normal matter in the form\n$T_{\\mu\\nu}=Mc^2\\,\\delta(\\vec{r})\\,\\delta_\\mu^0\\,\\delta_\\nu^0$.

The parameter $\\Lambda$ plays a dual role: (i) it sets the\nscalar curvature for the background dS metric, and (ii) it partakes in the\nNewtonian potential $V(r)$. We reach two key findings. Firstly, the Newtonian\nlimit only emerges owing to the de Sitter background. Most existing studies of\nthe Newtonian limit in modified gravity chose to linearize the metric around a\nlocally flat background. However, this is a $\\textit{false}$ vacuum to start\nwith for pure $R^2$ gravity. These studies unknowingly omitted the information\nabout $\\Lambda$ of the de Sitter background, hence incapable of attaining a\nNewtonian behavior in pure $R^2$ gravity. Secondly, as $\\Lambda$ appears in\n$V(r)$ in a $\\textit{singular}$ manner, viz. $V(r)\\propto\\Lambda^{-1}$, the\nNewtonian limit for pure $R^2$ gravity cannot be obtained by any perturbative\napproach treating $\\Lambda$ as a small parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 18:18:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 17:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}
