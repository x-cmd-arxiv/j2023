To resolve those information\nasymmetries, we propose a Multimodal Dynamic Knowledge-driven Dropout\nPrediction (MDKDP) framework that learns implicit and explicit knowledge from\ndoctor-patient dialogues and the dynamic and complex networks of various\nstakeholders in both online and offline healthcare delivery systems. We\nevaluate MDKDP by partnering with one of the largest virtual health platforms\nin China. MDKDP improves the F1-score by 3.26 percentage points relative to the\nbest benchmark. Comprehensive robustness analyses show that integrating\nstakeholder attributes, knowledge dynamics, and compact bilinear pooling\nsignificantly improves the performance. Our work provides significant\nimplications for healthcare IT by revealing the value of mining relations and\nknowledge across different service modalities. Practically, MDKDP offers a\nnovel design artifact for virtual health platforms in patient dropout\nmanagement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 16:23:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 14:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

In contrast, deep\nneural networks can learn low-dimensional features efficiently, and in\nparticular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown promising results in\nclassifying Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data. A key factor in the success of\ndeep neural networks is this astonishing expressive power. However, this power\ncomes at the cost of complex, black-boxed models, conflicting with the goals of\nbuilding reliable and human-understandable models. An essential criterion in\nunderstanding such predictive deep models involves quantifying the contribution\nof time-varying input variables to the classification. Hence, in this work, we\nintroduce a new framework for interpreting multivariate time series data by\nextracting and clustering the input representative patterns that highly\nactivate CNN neurons. This way, we identify each signal's role and\ndependencies, considering all possible combinations of signals in the MTS\ninput. Then, we construct a graph that captures the temporal relationship\nbetween the extracted patterns for each layer. An effective graph merging\nstrategy finds the connection of each node to the previous layer's nodes.\nFinally, a graph embedding algorithm generates new representations of the\ncreated interpretable time-series features. To evaluate the performance of our\nproposed framework, we run extensive experiments on eight datasets of the\nUCR/UEA archive, along with HAR and PAM datasets. The experiments indicate the\nbenefit of our time-aware graph-based representation in MTS classification\nwhile enriching them with more interpretability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 16:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Most current research focuses on the single-label ECG\nclassification, i.e., each ECG record corresponds to one cardiac disorder,\nignoring ECG records with multi-label phenomenon. In this paper, we propose an\nensemble of attention-based temporal convolutional neural network (ATCNN)\nmodels for the multi-label classification of 12-lead ECG records. Specifically,\na set of ATCNN-based single-lead binary classifiers are trained one for each\ncardiac disorder, and the predictions from these classifiers with simple\nthresholding generate the final multi-label decisions.

Through time-resolved Faraday rotation and Kerr ellipticity, we found\nthe transient magnetization is only excited by pulses resonant with phonons,\nproportional to the angular momentum of the phonons, and growing with magnetic\nsusceptibility at cryogenic temperatures, as expected from the spin-phonon\ncoupling model.

KPA extracts the main points in\nthe data as a list of concise sentences or phrases, termed key points, and\nquantifies their prevalence. While key points are more expressive than word\nclouds and key phrases, making sense of a long, flat list of key points, which\noften express related ideas in varying levels of granularity, may still be\nchallenging. To address this limitation of KPA, we introduce the task of\norganizing a given set of key points into a hierarchy, according to their\nspecificity. Such hierarchies may be viewed as a novel type of Textual\nEntailment Graph. We develop ThinkP, a high quality benchmark dataset of key\npoint hierarchies for business and product reviews, obtained by consolidating\nmultiple annotations. We compare different methods for predicting pairwise\nrelations between key points, and for inferring a hierarchy from these pairwise\npredictions. In particular, for the task of computing pairwise key point\nrelations, we achieve significant gains over existing strong baselines by\napplying directional distributional similarity methods to a novel\ndistributional representation of key points, and further boost performance via\nweak supervision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 16:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

To bridge this gap, we propose the use of dynamic mode\ndecomposition (DMD) as a purely data-driven technique that generates an\naccurate and computationally efficient model of an oscillating surge WEC\n(OSWEC).

Estimating the size of this\norbiting solid body requires modeling the accretion rate of the polluting\nmaterial that is observed mixing into the WD surface. That material is supplied\nvia sublimation from the surface of the orbiting solid body. The sublimation\nrate can be estimated as a simple function of the surface area of the solid\nbody and the incident flux from the nearby hot WD.

While CoT allows models\nto produce more comprehensive reasoning processes, its emphasis on intermediate\nreasoning steps can inadvertently introduce hallucinations and accumulated\nerrors, thereby limiting models' ability to solve complex reasoning tasks.\nInspired by how humans engage in careful and meticulous deductive logical\nreasoning processes to solve tasks, we seek to enable language models to\nperform explicit and rigorous deductive reasoning, and also ensure the\ntrustworthiness of their reasoning process through self-verification. However,\ndirectly verifying the validity of an entire deductive reasoning process is\nchallenging, even with advanced models like ChatGPT.

Such contamination is inherent in maps\nbased on infrared emission, which pick up not only Galactic dust but also the\ncosmic infrared background (CIB). When SFD is used for extinction correction,\nover-correction occurs in a spatially correlated and redshift-dependent manner,\nwhich could impact precision cosmology using galaxy clustering, lensing, and\nsupernova Ia distances. Similarly, LSS imprints in other Galactic templates can\naffect intensity mapping and cosmic microwave background experiments. This\npaper presents a generic way to remove LSS traces in Galactic maps and applies\nit to SFD. First, we measure descriptive summary statistics of the CIB in SFD\nby cross-correlating the map with spectroscopic galaxies and quasars in SDSS\ntomographically as functions of redshift and angular scale. To reconstruct the\nLSS on the map level, however, additional information on the phases is needed.\nWe build a large set of 180 overcomplete, full-sky basis template maps from the\ndensity fields of over 450 million galaxies in WISE and find a linear\ncombination that reproduces all the high-dimensional tomographic two-point\nstatistics of the CIB in SFD.

However, since their\npredictions are not perfect, these systems also need to make human experts\nunderstand when and how to use these predictions to update their own\npredictions. Unfortunately, this has been proven challenging. In this context,\nit has been recently argued that an alternative type of decision support\nsystems may circumvent this challenge. Rather than providing a single label\nprediction, these systems provide a set of label prediction values constructed\nusing a conformal predictor, namely a prediction set, and forcefully ask\nexperts to predict a label value from the prediction set. However, the design\nand evaluation of these systems have so far relied on stylized expert models,\nquestioning their promise. In this paper, we revisit the design of this type of\nsystems from the perspective of online learning and develop a methodology that\ndoes not require, nor assumes, an expert model.

While recent machine learning methods to retrospectively\nanalyze sequential decision making processes promise to aid decision makers in\nidentifying such cases, they have focused on environments with finitely many\ndiscrete states. However, in many practical applications, the state of the\nenvironment is inherently continuous in nature. In this paper, we aim to fill\nthis gap. We start by formally characterizing a sequence of discrete actions\nand continuous states using finite horizon Markov decision processes and a\nbroad class of bijective structural causal models. Building upon this\ncharacterization, we formalize the problem of finding counterfactually optimal\naction sequences and show that, in general, we cannot expect to solve it in\npolynomial time. Then, we develop a search method based on the $A^*$ algorithm\nthat, under a natural form of Lipschitz continuity of the environment's\ndynamics, is guaranteed to return the optimal solution to the problem.\nExperiments on real clinical data show that our method is very efficient in\npractice, and it has the potential to offer interesting insights for sequential\ndecision making tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 18:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

In this paper, we comprehensively\nevaluate popular language models for their ability to correctly use English\ngender-neutral pronouns (e.g., singular they, them) and neo-pronouns (e.g., ze,\nxe, thon) that are used by individuals whose gender identity is not represented\nby binary pronouns. We introduce MISGENDERED, a framework for evaluating large\nlanguage models' ability to correctly use preferred pronouns, consisting of (i)\ninstances declaring an individual's pronoun, followed by a sentence with a\nmissing pronoun, and (ii) an experimental setup for evaluating masked and\nauto-regressive language models using a unified method.

A range of methods are available to include\nlonger-term information, but there has previously been no comprehensive and\naccessible tool for implementing these. This paper introduces a novel model and\nsoftware package for parametric survival modelling of individual-level,\nright-censored data, optionally combined with summary survival data on one or\nmore time periods. It could be used to estimate long-term survival based on\nshort-term data from a clinical trial, combined with longer-term disease\nregistry or population data, or elicited judgements. All data sources are\nrepresented jointly in a Bayesian model. The hazard is modelled as an M-spline\nfunction, which can represent potential changes in the hazard trajectory at any\ntime. Through Bayesian estimation, the model automatically adapts to fit the\navailable data, and acknowledges uncertainty where the data are weak. Therefore\nlong-term estimates are only confident if there are strong long-term data, and\ninferences do not rely on extrapolating parametric functions learned from\nshort-term data. The effects of treatment or other explanatory variables can be\nestimated through proportional hazards or with a flexible non-proportional\nhazards model. Some commonly-used mechanisms for survival can also be assumed:\ncure models, additive hazards models with known background mortality, and\nmodels where the effect of a treatment wanes over time. All of these features\nare provided for the first time in an R package, $\\texttt{survextrap}$, in\nwhich models can be fitted using standard R survival modelling syntax. This\npaper explains the model, and demonstrates the use of the package to fit a\nrange of models to common forms of survival data used in health technology\nassessments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 18:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

However, estimating a single hyperparameter gradient\nrequires a pass through the entire dataset, limiting the scalability of such\nalgorithms. In this work, we overcome this issue by introducing lower bounds to\nthe linearized Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood. In contrast to\nprevious estimators, these bounds are amenable to stochastic-gradient-based\noptimization and allow to trade off estimation accuracy against computational\ncomplexity. We derive them using the function-space form of the linearized\nLaplace, which can be estimated using the neural tangent kernel.\nExperimentally, we show that the estimators can significantly accelerate\ngradient-based hyperparameter optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 19:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

We then consider the case the case when the activation\nfunction is pointwise bijective and obtain sufficient conditions for the layer\nto be injective. We remark that this question, while trivial in the finite-rank\ncase, is subtler in the infinite-rank case and is proved using tools from\nFredholm theory. Next, we prove that our supplied injective neural operators\nare universal approximators and that their implementation, with finite-rank\nneural networks, are still injective.

In this project, we have developed a pipeline that simulates\nthe stock trading environment and have trained an agent to automate the stock\ntrading process with deep reinforcement learning methods, including deep\nQ-learning, deep SARSA, and the policy gradient method. We evaluate our\nplatform during relatively good (before 2021) and bad (2021 - 2022) situations.\nThe stocks we've evaluated on including Google, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft,\nand IBM. These stocks are among the popular ones, and the changes in trends are\nrepresentative in terms of having good and bad situations. We showed that\nbefore 2021, the three reinforcement methods we have tried always provide\npromising profit returns with total annual rates around $70\\%$ to $90\\%$, while\nmaintain a positive profit return after 2021 with total annual rates around 2%\nto 7%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 19:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Moreover, we also show that this\nscenario leads to large amplitude induced second-order tensor perturbations\npropagating as Gravitational Waves (GW) with amplitude $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}h^2 \\sim\n10^{-17}$ and peak frequency $f_{\\rm peak} \\sim$ (0.1 - 1) Hz, which can be\ndetected in the next generation GW observatories like LISA, BBO, ET, etc. Thus,\nwe unify the $SU(5)$ framework with PBH via inflection-point inflation showing\nhow the upcoming measurements of PBH and GW will enable us to probe the scale\nof $SU(5)$ symmetry breaking, and thereby complementing the laboratory based\nexperiments. We also discuss scenarios involving the Pati-Salam and\nTrinification gauge groups and its impact on quartic and mixed-quartic\ncouplings that may lead to PBH and detectable GW signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 20:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Cloud platforms have deployed\nsuch systems to improve overall system memory utilization, but performance can\nvary across workloads. High-performance computing (HPC) is crucial in\nscientific and engineering applications, where HPC machines also face the issue\nof underutilized memory. As a result, improving system memory utilization while\nunderstanding workload performance is essential for HPC operators. Therefore,\nlearning the potential of a disaggregated memory system before deployment is a\ncritical step. This paper proposes a methodology for exploring the design space\nof a disaggregated memory system. It incorporates key metrics that affect\nperformance on disaggregated memory systems: memory capacity, local and remote\nmemory access ratio, injection bandwidth, and bisection bandwidth, providing an\nintuitive approach to guide machine configurations based on technology trends\nand workload characteristics.

Lett.\n130, 106401 (2023)] discoveries about the high- and low- density limits of\nelectronic ground and excited states. Exact results are presented for kinetic,\nHartree and exchange energies. A parametrization is also provided for\ncorrelation energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 21:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

To ensure the simulations\nare sufficiently realistic for studies of large-scale structure, the subgrid\nprescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback are calibrated to the observed\nlow-redshift galaxy stellar mass function and cluster gas fractions. The\ncalibration is performed using machine learning, separately for three\nresolutions. This approach enables specification of the model by the\nobservables to which they are calibrated. The calibration accounts for a number\nof potential observational biases and for random errors in the observed stellar\nmasses. The two most demanding simulations have box sizes of 1.0 and 2.8 Gpc\nand baryonic particle masses of $1\\times10^8$ and $1\\times10^9 \\text{M}_\\odot$,\nrespectively. For the latter resolution the suite includes 12 model variations\nin a 1 Gpc box. There are 8 variations at fixed cosmology, including shifts in\nthe stellar mass function and/or the cluster gas fractions to which we\ncalibrate, and two alternative implementations of AGN feedback (thermal or\njets). The remaining 4 variations use the unmodified calibration data but\ndifferent cosmologies, including different neutrino masses. The 2.8 Gpc\nsimulation follows $3\\times10^{11}$ particles, making it the largest ever\nhydrodynamical simulation run to $z=0$. Lightcone output is produced on-the-fly\nfor up to 8 different observers. We investigate numerical convergence, show\nthat the simulations reproduce the calibration data, and compare with a number\nof galaxy, cluster, and large-scale structure observations, finding very good\nagreement with the data for converged predictions. Finally, by comparing\nhydrodynamical and `dark-matter-only' simulations, we confirm that baryonic\neffects can suppress the halo mass function and the matter power spectrum by up\nto $\\approx20$ per cent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 21:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

A guide can be invoked by the model to\nconstrain its own generation to a set of valid statements given by the tool. In\nturn, the model's choices can change the guide's state.

For galaxies resolved by >1.3 beams, we find that galaxies\nwith higher stellar masses and stellar surface densities tend to have less\nextended HI discs and lower HI surface densities: the isodensity HI structural\nparameters show a weak negative dependence on stellar mass and stellar mass\nsurface density.

Our research shows that this approach not only provides\nsolid protection against poisoning attacks but can also be used to reduce group\nbias and subsequently promote fairness while maintaining the system's\ncapability for differential privacy. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10,\nFEMNIST, and PUMS ACSIncome datasets in different configurations demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method, resulting in state-of-the-art performances. We\nhave proven robustness in situations where 80% of participating clients are\nmalicious. Additionally, we have shown a significant increase in accuracy for\nunderrepresented labels from 32% to 53%, and increase in recall rate for\nunderrepresented features from 19% to 50%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 22:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

This class\nof operators includes the quasi-Hermitian operators, which reformulate quantum\ntheory while retaining real-valued measurement outcomes and unitary time\nevolution. This thesis is devoted to the study of locality in quasi-Hermitian\ntheory, the symmetries and conserved quantities associated with non-Hermitian\noperators, and the perturbative features of pseudo-Hermitian matrices. In\naddition to the presented original research, scholars will appreciate the\nlengthy introduction to non-Hermitian physics.\n  Local quasi-Hermitian observable algebras are examined. Expectation values of\nlocal quasi-Hermitian observables equal expectation values of local Hermitian\nobservables. Thus, quasi-Hermitian theories do not increase the values of\nnonlocal games set by Hermitian theories. Furthermore, Bell's inequality\nviolations in quasi-Hermitian theories never exceed the Tsirelson bound of\nHermitian quantum theory.\n  Exceptional points, which are branch points in the spectrum, are a\nperturbative feature unique to non-Hermitian operators. Cusp singularities of\nalgebraic curves are related to higher-order exceptional points.\n  To exemplify novelties of non-Hermiticity, one-dimensional lattice models\nwith a pair of non-Hermitian defect potentials with balanced loss and gain,\n$\\Delta \\pm i \\gamma$, are explored.

The model is\ntested on four types of pneumatic actuators used in these robots (series,\ncompression, embedded, and fabric pneumatic artificial muscles) and can be\nextended to other designs. Actuators rely on two types of bending mechanisms:\ngeometry-based contraction and material-based contraction. Geometry-based\ncontraction implies shape-change of the muscles from a flat to an inflated\nshortened configuration that causes buckling of the inflated beam.\nMaterial-based contraction relies on material anisotropy to produce a\ncontraction effect. The model depicts both mechanisms and accommodates for the\ncomplex and highly nonlinear effects of buckling and anisotropy. Simulation\nresults are verified experimentally for each actuator type at three working\npressures (10, 20, and 30 kPa). Geometry-based contraction achieves the largest\ndeformation at accuracy values of 92.1% and higher once the buckling pattern is\nestablished, and 80.7% and higher for lower pressures due to the stress\nsingularities occurring with buckling formation. Material-based contraction\nachieves smaller bending angles but is at least 96.7% accurate. The models are\nfreely available online, and can thus be used by others to design inflated-beam\nrobots, such as tip-everting vine robots. Labor and material waste can be\nreduced with this tool by optimizing designs that use knowledge of material\nproperties and stress to distributions to enable bending and manage stress\npeaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 22:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

The electromagnetic enhancement comes from local surface plasmon\nresonance induced at the nanogap, which could reach ~10-11 orders of magnitude,\nwhile the chemical enhancement comes from monolayer WS2 2D material, which\ncould reach 4-5 orders of magnitudes. The synergic implementation and action of\nthese two prestigious Raman scattering enhancement mechanisms in this specially\ndesigned 2D material-plasmon nanogap composite nanoscale system enables\nunambiguous experimental observation of single-molecule Raman spectroscopy of\nRhB molecule. This route of Raman enhancement devices could open up a new\nfrontier of single molecule science, allowing detection, identification, and\nmonitor of single molecules and their spatial-temporal evolution under various\ninternal and external stimuli.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 23:15:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

At parsec\nscale distances in AGN, energy transfer can dominate, in which case the only\nforce needed to launch an outflow is that from gas pressure. Much closer to the\nblack hole, gravity dominates thermal energy due to insufficient heating by the\nradiation and the gas is in the so-called `cold' regime. Only magnetic or\nradiation forces can then lead to outflow, but it is unclear at what\ntemperature and ionization state the radiation force weakens, as these\nproperties depend on the spectral energy distribution (SED). In this work, we\nsurvey the parameter space of radiation forces due to spectral lines resulting\nfrom blackbody SEDs with varying temperatures in the range $\\sim 10^4 - 10^6$~K\nto identify the radiation temperature at which line-driving begins to lose\nefficiency.

One can\ncompare the observed gravitational-wave signals with theoretical waveform\nmodels to constrain possible deviations from GR. Any physics that is not\nincluded in these waveform models might show up as apparent GR deviations. The\nwaveform models used in current tests of GR describe binaries on quasicircular\norbits, since most of the binaries detected by ground-based gravitational-wave\ndetectors are expected to have negligible eccentricities. Thus, a signal from\nan eccentric binary in GR is likely to show up as a deviation from GR in the\ncurrent implementation of these tests. We study the response of four standard\ntests of GR to eccentric binary black hole signals with the forecast O4\nsensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo network. Specifically, we consider two\nparameterized tests (TIGER and FTI), the modified dispersion relation test, and\nthe inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test. To model eccentric signals, we\nuse non-spinning numerical relativity simulations from the SXS catalog with\nthree mass ratios $(1,2,3)$, which we scale to a redshifted total mass of\n$80M_\\odot$ and luminosity distance of $400$ Mpc. For each of these mass\nratios, we consider signals with eccentricities of $\\sim0.05$ and $\\sim 0.1$ at\n$17$ Hz. We find that signals with larger eccentricity lead to very significant\nfalse GR deviations in most tests while signals having smaller eccentricity\nlead to significant deviations in some tests. For the larger eccentricity\ncases, one would even get a deviation from GR with TIGER at $\\sim 90\\%$\ncredibility at a distance of $\\gtrsim 1.5$ Gpc. Thus, it will be necessary to\nexclude the possibility of an eccentric binary in order to make any claim about\ndetecting a deviation from GR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 23:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Namely, a massive brane curves the spacetime and affects the\ntrajectory of a signal in a way that allows a signal sent from the brane\nthrough the bulk to arrive (upon returning) to a distant point on the brane\nfaster than the light can propagate along the brane. In particular, the signal\nsent along the brane suffers a greater gravitational time delay than the bulk\nsignal due to the presence of matter on the brane.

Directly imaged companions often present poorly constrained\neccentricities. A recently developed prior framework for orbit fitting called\n''observable-based priors'' has the advantage of improving biases in derived\norbit parameters for objects with minimal phase coverage, which is the case for\nthe majority of directly imaged companions. We use observable-based priors to\nfit the orbits of 21 exoplanets and brown dwarfs in an effort to obtain the\neccentricity distributions with minimized biases. We present the objects'\nindividual posteriors compared to their previously derived distributions,\nshowing in many cases a shift toward lower eccentricities.

By exploiting the momentum mismatch in\nreciprocal space, we suppress single particle tunneling between both bilayers.\nSince the bilayers are spatially separated by only 0.34 nm, the stack benefits\nfrom strong interlayer Coulomb interactions. These interactions can cause the\nformation of a Bose-Einstein condensate. Indeed, such a condensate is observed\nfor half filling in each bilayer sheet. However, only when the partially filled\nlevels have orbital index 1. It is absent for partially filled levels with\norbital index 0.

However, the\nexisting networks based on the hybrid architecture suffer from two problems.\nFirst, although the CNN branch can capture image local features by using\nconvolution operation, the vanilla convolution is unable to achieve adaptive\nextraction of image features. Second, although the Transformer branch can model\nthe global information of images, the conventional self-attention only focuses\non the spatial self-attention of images and ignores the channel and\ncross-dimensional self-attention leading to low segmentation accuracy for\nmedical images with complex backgrounds. To solve these problems, we propose\nvision Transformer embrace convolutional neural networks for medical image\nsegmentation (TEC-Net). Our network has two advantages. First, dynamic\ndeformable convolution (DDConv) is designed in the CNN branch, which not only\novercomes the difficulty of adaptive feature extraction using fixed-size\nconvolution kernels, but also solves the defect that different inputs share the\nsame convolution kernel parameters, effectively improving the feature\nexpression ability of CNN branch.

These GNN-based models primarily focus on analyzing\nusers' positive feedback while overlooking the valuable insights provided by\ntheir negative feedback. In this paper, we propose PANE-GNN, an innovative\nrecommendation model that unifies Positive And Negative Edges in Graph Neural\nNetworks for recommendation. By incorporating user preferences and\ndispreferences, our approach enhances the capability of recommender systems to\noffer personalized suggestions. PANE-GNN first partitions the raw rating graph\ninto two distinct bipartite graphs based on positive and negative feedback.\nSubsequently, we employ two separate embeddings, the interest embedding and the\ndisinterest embedding, to capture users' likes and dislikes, respectively. To\nfacilitate effective information propagation, we design distinct\nmessage-passing mechanisms for positive and negative feedback. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a distortion to the negative graph, which exclusively consists of\nnegative feedback edges, for contrastive training. This distortion plays a\ncrucial role in effectively denoising the negative feedback. The experimental\nresults provide compelling evidence that PANE-GNN surpasses the existing\nstate-of-the-art benchmark methods across four real-world datasets. These\ndatasets include three commonly used recommender system datasets and one\nopen-source short video recommendation dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 01:31:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 02:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

In this study, we introduce X-DeepONet, a novel variant of deep\noperator networks (DeepONets), for learning moving-solution operators of\nparametric partial differential equations (PDEs), with application to real-time\nearthquake localization. Leveraging the power of neural operators, X-DeepONet\nlearns to estimate traveltime fields associated with earthquake sources by\nincorporating information from seismic arrival times and velocity models.\nSimilar to the DeepONet, X-DeepONet includes a trunk net and a branch net.\nAdditionally, we introduce a root network that not only takes the standard\nDeepONet's multiplication operator as input, it also takes addition and\nsubtraction operators. We show that for problems with moving fields, the\nstandard multiplication operation of DeepONet is insufficient to capture field\nrelocation, while addition and subtraction operators along with the eXtended\nroot significantly improve its accuracy both under data-driven (supervised) and\nphysics-informed (unsupervised) training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nX-DeepONet through various experiments, including scenarios with variable\nvelocity models and arrival times. The results show remarkable accuracy in\nearthquake localization, even for heterogeneous and complex velocity models.\nThe proposed framework also exhibits excellent generalization capabilities and\nrobustness against noisy arrival times. The method provides a computationally\nefficient approach for quantifying uncertainty in hypocenter locations\nresulting from traveltime pick errors and velocity model variations.

Recent\nresearch has shown that in the context of supervised learning different active\nlearning strategies need to be applied at various stages of the training\nprocess to ensure improved performance over the random baseline. We refer to\nthe point where the number of available annotations changes the suitable active\nlearning strategy as the phase transition point. In this paper, we establish\nthat when combining active learning with self-supervised models to achieve\nimproved performance, the phase transition point occurs earlier. It becomes\nchallenging to determine which strategy should be used for previously unseen\ndatasets. We argue that existing active learning algorithms are heavily\ninfluenced by the phase transition because the empirical risk over the entire\nactive learning pool estimated by these algorithms is inaccurate and influenced\nby the number of labeled samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nactive learning strategy, neural tangent kernel clustering-pseudo-labels\n(NTKCPL). It estimates empirical risk based on pseudo-labels and the model\nprediction with NTK approximation. We analyze the factors affecting this\napproximation error and design a pseudo-label clustering generation method to\nreduce the approximation error.

Label-only membership inference attack is a\nvariant that exploits sample robustness and attracts more attention since it\nassumes a practical scenario in which the adversary only has access to the\npredicted labels of the input samples. However, since the decision boundary\ndistance, which measures robustness, is strongly affected by the random initial\nimage, the adversary may get opposite results even for the same input samples.\nIn this paper, we propose a new attack method, called muti-class adaptive\nmembership inference attack in the label-only setting. All decision boundary\ndistances for all target classes have been traversed in the early attack\niterations, and the subsequent attack iterations continue with the shortest\ndecision boundary distance to obtain a stable and optimal decision boundary\ndistance.

However, factors like sampling distribution\nimbalance can lead to issues of bias and unfairness in healthcare data.\nSensitive attributes, such as race, gender, age, and medical condition, are\ncharacteristics of individuals that are commonly associated with discrimination\nor bias. In healthcare AI, these attributes can play a significant role in\ndetermining the quality of care that individuals receive. For example, minority\ngroups often receive fewer procedures and poorer-quality medical care than\nwhite individuals in US. Therefore, detecting and mitigating bias in data is\ncrucial to enhancing health equity. Bias mitigation methods include\npre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. Among them, Reweighting\n(RW) is a widely used pre-processing method that performs well in balancing\nmachine learning performance and fairness performance. RW adjusts the weights\nfor samples within each (group, label) combination, where these weights are\nutilized in loss functions. However, RW is limited to considering only a single\nsensitive attribute when mitigating bias and assumes that each sensitive\nattribute is equally important. This may result in potential inaccuracies when\naddressing intersectional bias. To address these limitations, we propose\nM3Fair, a multi-level and multi-sensitive-attribute reweighting method by\nextending the RW method to multiple sensitive attributes at multiple levels.\nOur experiments on real-world datasets show that the approach is effective,\nstraightforward, and generalizable in addressing the healthcare fairness\nissues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 03:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

The initial\nperturbations of the instability correspond to the distribution of active\nregions observed during the solar cycles.

This stochastic trajectory planner is\nformulated as a Bayesian Inference problem with a time-normalized Gaussian\nprocess prior and exponential likelihood function. The Gaussian process prior\ncan enforce initial and goal position constraints in Configuration Space.\nBesides, it can encode the correlation of waypoints in time series. The\nlikelihood function aims at encoding task-related cost terms, such as collision\navoidance, trajectory length penalty, boundary avoidance, etc. The kernel\nupdating strategies combined with model-predictive path integral (MPPI) is\nproposed to solve the maximum a posteriori inference problems. Lastly, we\nintegrate the learned composite SDF networks into the trajectory planning\nalgorithm and apply it to a Franka Emika Panda robot. The simulation and\nexperiment results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 04:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Owing to the practical setting and privacy\npreservation of federated learning (FL), it is a suitable and appealing\ndistributed learning paradigm to deploy these applications at the network edge.\nDespite the many successful efforts made to apply FL to wireless edge networks,\nthe adopted algorithms mostly follow the same spirit as FedAvg, thereby heavily\nsuffering from the practical challenges of label deficiency and device\nheterogeneity. These challenges not only decelerate the model training in FL\nbut also downgrade the application performance. In this paper, we focus on the\nalgorithm design and address these challenges by investigating the personalized\nsemi-supervised FL problem and proposing an effective algorithm, namely\nFedCPSL. In particular, the techniques of pseudo-labeling, and\ninterpolation-based model personalization are judiciously combined to provide a\nnew problem formulation for personalized semi-supervised FL. The proposed\nFedCPSL algorithm adopts novel strategies, including adaptive client variance\nreduction, local momentum, and normalized global aggregation, to combat the\nchallenge of device heterogeneity and boost algorithm convergence. Moreover,\nthe convergence property of FedCPSL is thoroughly analyzed and shows that\nFedCPSL is resilient to both statistical and system heterogeneity, obtaining a\nsublinear convergence rate.

However,\nit is risky to assume that the knowledge and strategies robots learned from one\ngroup of people can apply to other groups. The discriminatory performance of\nrobots will undermine their service quality for some people, ignore their\nservice requests, and even offend them. Therefore, it is critically important\nto mitigate bias in robot decision-making for more fair services. In this\npaper, we designed a self-reflective mechanism -- Fairness-Sensitive Policy\nGradient Reinforcement Learning (FSPGRL), to help robots to self-identify\nbiased behaviors during interactions with humans. FSPGRL identifies bias by\nexamining the abnormal update along particular gradients and updates the policy\nnetwork to support fair decision-making for robots. To validate FSPGRL's\neffectiveness, a human-centered service scenario, \"A robot is serving people in\na restaurant,\" was designed. A user study was conducted; 24 human subjects\nparticipated in generating 1,000 service demonstrations. Four commonly-seen\nissues \"Willingness Issue,\" \"Priority Issue,\" \"Quality Issue,\" \"Risk Issue\"\nwere observed from robot behaviors. By using FSPGRL to improve robot decisions,\nrobots were proven to have a self-bias detection capability for a more fair\nservice.

Such models have\nsimple exible dependence structures, possess fast computation algorithms and\ngenerate a sufficiently large number of parametric families. It has been\nstrongly argued that the pseudo-Poisson model will be the first choice to\nconsider in modelling bivariate over-dispersed data with positive correlation\nand having one of the marginal equi-dispersed. Yet, before we start fitting, it\nis necessary to test whether the given data is compatible with the assumed\npseudo-Poisson model. Hence, in the present note we derive and propose a few\ngoodness-of-fit tests for the bivariate pseudo-Poisson distribution. Also we\nemphasize two tests, a lesser known test based on the supremes of the absolute\ndifference between the estimated probability generating function and its\nempirical counterpart. A new test has been proposed based on the difference\nbetween the estimated bivariate Fisher dispersion index and its empirical\nindices.

R.C. Tolman initiated a correlation between gravity and\nthermodynamics. The development of black hole thermodynamics and the\ngeneralized second law of thermodynamics led to Penrose's conjecture that the\nWeyl tensor should serve as a measure of the entropy of the free gravitational\nfield. This entropy reflects the degrees of freedom associated with the free\ngravitational field. The proposition of gravitational entropy justifies the\ninitial entropy of the universe. This entropy function had to be associated\nwith the dynamics of the free gravitational field from the time of the big\nbang, so that a gravity-dominated evolution of the universe preserves the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. Moreover, the concept of black hole entropy\nemerges as a particular case of the entropy of the free gravitational field.\nHowever, a self-consistent notion of gravitational entropy in the context of\ncosmological structure formation has eluded us till today. Various proposals\nhave been put forward, initially based on Penrose's Weyl Curvature Hypothesis,\nand subsequently modified to fit the needs of specific geometries and matter\ndistributions. Such proposals were basically geometric in nature. A few years\nback a new definition of gravitational entropy was proposed from the\nconsiderations of the relativistic Gibb's equation and based on the square root\nof the Bel-Robinson tensor, the simplest divergence-free tensor derived from\nthe Weyl tensor. Even this proposal is valid only for a restricted class of\nspacetimes. A complete self-consistent description of gravitational entropy\nencompassing black hole physics and cosmological dynamics is yet to emerge. In\nthis article, we gather an overview of the concept of gravitational entropy,\nfollowing it up with the development of the various proposals of gravitational\nentropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 05:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

To enable such\ncomputations, we relax the restrictions that typically accompany domain\nrecursion and generalise the circuits used to express a solution to an FOMC\nproblem to directed graphs that may contain cycles. To this end, we adapt the\nmost well-established (weighted) FOMC algorithm ForcLift to work with such\ngraphs and introduce new compilation rules that can create cycle-inducing edges\nthat encode recursive function calls. These improvements allow the algorithm to\nfind efficient solutions to counting problems that were previously beyond its\nreach, including those that cannot be solved efficiently by any other exact\nFOMC algorithm.

However, the open inference APIs\nmay be utilized by malicious customers to conduct model extraction attacks,\ni.e., attackers can replicate a cloud-based black-box model merely via querying\nmalicious examples. Existing model extraction attacks mainly depend on the\nposterior knowledge (i.e., predictions of query samples) from Oracle. Thus,\nthey either require high query overhead to simulate the decision boundary, or\nsuffer from generalization errors and overfitting problems due to query budget\nlimitations. To mitigate it, this work proposes an efficient model extraction\nattack based on prior knowledge for the first time. The insight is that prior\nknowledge of unlabeled proxy datasets is conducive to the search for the\ndecision boundary (e.g., informative samples). Specifically, we leverage\nself-supervised learning including autoencoder and contrastive learning to\npre-compile the prior knowledge of the proxy dataset into the feature extractor\nof the substitute model. Then we adopt entropy to measure and sample the most\ninformative examples to query the target model. Our design leverages both prior\nand posterior knowledge to extract the model and thus eliminates\ngeneralizability errors and overfitting problems. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on open APIs like Traffic Recognition, Flower Recognition,\nModeration Recognition, and NSFW Recognition from real-world platforms, Azure\nand Clarifai.

During the passage of seismic waves,\nrocks exhibit a decrease in elastic moduli, slowly recovering after.Yet,\ncomprehensive physical models describing these moduli alterations remain sparse\nand insufficiently validated against observations. Here, we demonstrate the\napplicability of two physical damage models - the internal variable model (IVM)\nand the continuum damage model (CDM) - to provide quantitative descriptions of\nnonlinear co-seismic elastic wave propagation observations. We recast the IVM\nand CDM models as nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations and\nimplement 1D and 2D numerical simulations using an arbitrary high-order\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method. We verify the modeling results with\nco-propagating acousto-elastic experimental measurements.

Subsequently, we infer the parameters for these nonlinear models\nfrom laboratory experiments using probabilistic Bayesian inversion and 2D\nsimulations. By adopting the Adaptive Metropolis Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nmethod, we quantify the uncertainties of inferred parameters for both physical\nmodels, investigating their interplay in 70,000 simulations.

However, such behavior is\nnot ubiquitous but rather contingent on whether the total system is in\nresonance. The resonances are usually determined by the ratios of\ncharacteristic frequencies associated with the system and the perturbation.\nUnder the resonance condition, the classical dynamics are highly susceptible to\nvariations in the system parameters. In this work, we employ out-of-time-order\ncorrelators (OTOCs) to study the dynamical sensitivity of a perturbed non-KAM\nsystem in the quantum limit as the parameter that characterizes the resonances\nand non-resonances is slowly varied. For this purpose, we consider a quantized\nkicked harmonic oscillator (KHO) model with the kick being the external\ntime-dependent perturbation. Although the Lyapunov exponent of the KHO at\nresonances remains close to zero in the weak perturbative regime, making the\nsystem weakly chaotic in the conventional sense, the classical phase space\nundergoes significant structural changes. Motivated by this, we study the OTOCs\nwhen the system is in resonance and contrast the results with the non-resonant\ncase. At resonances, we observe that the asymptotic dynamics of the OTOCs are\nsensitive to these structural changes, where they grow quadratically as opposed\nto linear or stagnant growth at non-resonances. On the other hand, our findings\nsuggest that the short-time dynamics remain relatively more stable to the\nvariations in the parameter. We will back our results by providing analytical\nexpressions for the OTOCs for a few special cases. We will then extend our\nfindings concerning the non-resonant cases to a broad class of KAM systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 07:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Recently, a caching\ntechnique called Radix-based additive caching of homomorphic encryption (Rache)\nwas proposed in SIGMOD'23. The primary objective of this paper is to address\nthe performance overhead resulting from the expensive randomization process in\nRache. To achieve this, we propose a novel encryption algorithm called $ASEnc$,\nwhich replaces the computationally intensive full scan of radixes with the\ncaching of a polynomial number of radix-powers during an offline stage. This\ndesign significantly reduces the performance impact caused by randomization.\nFurthermore, this paper aims to extend Rache's capabilities to support\nfloating-point numbers. To accomplish this, we introduce a new encryption\nalgorithm named $FSEnc$, leveraging efficient constant multiplication available\nin state-of-the-art fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes. Notably,\n$FSEnc$ offers the flexibility to cache the coefficients instead of the radixes\nthemselves, which may result in a large number of cached ciphertexts. However,\nwe manage this efficiently by streaming the dynamically cached ciphertexts\nthrough a vector of circular buffers. We demonstrate that both encryption\nalgorithms guarantee semantic security (IND-CPA). To validate their\nperformance, we implement both algorithms as loadable functions in MySQL 8.0\nand deploy the system prototype on a 96-core server hosted in the Chameleon\nCloud. Experimental results showcase that $ASEnc$ outperforms Rache by\n2.3--3.3$\\times$, while $FSEnc$ surpasses the state-of-the-art floating-point\nFHE CKKS by 1.8--5.6$\\times$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 08:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

To know \\textit{when and where to trust} the encoded\ncoordinates, we implement PCFs in a probabilistic network termed PCF-Net, which\nparameterizes the distribution of coordinate fields as Gaussian mixture models.\nBy jointly optimizing coordinate fields and their confidence conditioned on\ndense flows, PCF-Net can work with various feature descriptors when quantifying\nthe reliability of PCFs by confidence maps. An interesting observation of this\nwork is that the learned confidence map converges to geometrically coherent and\nsemantically consistent regions, which facilitates robust coordinate\nrepresentation.

Nighttime flare removal is challenging due\nto the unique luminance and spectrum of artificial lights, as well as the\ndiverse patterns and image degradation of the flares. The scarcity of the\nnighttime flare removal dataset constraints the research on this crucial task.\nIn this paper, we introduce Flare7K++, the first comprehensive nighttime flare\nremoval dataset, consisting of 962 real-captured flare images (Flare-R) and\n7,000 synthetic flares (Flare7K). Compared to Flare7K, Flare7K++ is\nparticularly effective in eliminating complicated degradation around the light\nsource, which is intractable by using synthetic flares alone.

The structural scaling relations (SSRs) of galaxies, i.e. the\nobserved correlations between effective radius, effective surface intensity and\nvelocity dispersion, are important tools for understanding how evolution\nproceeds. Aims. In this paper we aim to demonstrate that the evolution of the\nSSRs back in time is governed by the combination of the virial theorem (VT) and\nthe relation $L=L'_0 \\sigma^{\\beta(t)}$, where the parameters $\\beta$ and\n$L'_0$ vary with time and from galaxy to galaxy. Methods. Using the WINGS\ndatabase for the galaxies at redshift $z=0$ and the Illustris-1 and\nIllustris-TNG databases of artificial galaxies, for the galaxies up to redshift\n$z=4$, we analyse the SSRs back in time and, by means of simple algebraic\nexpressions for $L'_0$ and $\\beta$ (functions of time and other physical\nquantities), we derive the expected paths followed by galaxies in the various\nSSRs toward the distributions observed at $z=0$. Results. The distribution of\ngalaxies in the SSRs is ultimately related to the evolution in luminosity and\nvelocity dispersion that are empirically mirrored by the $L=L'_0\n\\sigma^{\\beta(t)}$ law. Furthermore, the $\\beta$ parameter works as a\nthermometer of the virialization of a galaxy. This parameter can assume either\npositive or negative values, and its absolute value attains high values when\nthe galaxy is close to the virial condition, while it tends to zero when the\ngalaxy is far from it.

A first\ngoal was to develop mass spectrometry approaches to detect non-covalent\ninteractions between antitumor drugs and their DNA target. Twenty years ago,\nour attention turned towards specific DNA structures such as the G-quadruplex\n(a structure formed by guanine-rich strands). Mass spectrometry allows to\ndiscern which molecules interact with one another by measuring the masses of\nthe complexes, and quantity the affinities by measuring their abundance. The\nmost important findings came from unexpected masses. For example, we showed the\nformation of higher- or lower-order structures by G-quadruplexes used in\ntraditional biophysical assays. We can also derive complete thermodynamic and\nkinetic description of G-quadruplex folding pathways by measuring cation\nbinding, one at a time. Getting quantitative information required accounting\nfor nonspecific adduct formation and for the response factors of the different\nmolecular forms. But with these caveats in mind, the approach is mature enough\nfor routine biophysical characterization of nucleic acids. A second goal is to\nobtain more detailed structural information on each of the complexes separated\nby the mass spectrometer. One such approaches is ion mobility spectrometry, and\neven today the challenge lies in the structural interpretation of the\nmeasurements. We showed that, although structures such as G-quadruplexes are\nwell-preserved in the MS conditions, double helices actually get more compact\nin the gas phase. These major rearrangements forced us to challenge comfortable\nassumptions. Further work is still needed to generalize how to deduce\nstructures in solution from ion mobility spectrometry data, and in particular\nhow to account for the electrospray charging mechanisms and for ion internal\nenergy effects. These studies also called for complementary approaches to ion\nmobility. Recently, we applied isotope exchange labeling mass spectrometry to\ncharacterize nucleic acid structures for the first time, and we reported the\nfirst ever circular dichroism ion spectroscopy measurement on mass-selected\ntrapped ions. Circular dichroism plays a key role in assigning the stacking\ntopology, and our new method now opens the door to characterizing a wide\nvariety of chiral molecule by mass spectrometry. In summary, advanced mass\nspectrometry approaches to characterize gas-phase structures work well for\nG-quadruplexes because they are stiffened by inner cations. The next objective\nwill be to generalize these methodologies to a wider range of nucleic acid\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 08:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

In this paper, by\ndrawing an intrinsic connection between MMCL and asymmetric matrix\nfactorization, we establish the first generalization guarantees of MMCL for\nvisual downstream tasks.

By carefully\nobserving numerical deviations from Artin's originally predicted asymptotic,\nDerrick and Emma Lehmer (1957) identified the need for an additional correction\nfactor; leading to a modified conjecture which was eventually proved to be\ncorrect by Hooley (1967) under the assumption of the generalised Riemann\nhypothesis. An appropriate analogue of Artin's primitive root conjecture may\nmoreover be formulated for an algebraic function field $K$ of $r$ variables\nover $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Relying on a soon to be established theorem of Weil\n(1948), Bilharz (1937) provided a proof in the particular case that $K$ is a\nglobal function field (i.e. $r=1$), which is correct under the assumption that\n$g \\in K$ is a $\\textit{geometric}$ element.

Additionally, we explore the interplay between magnetic\nfield and rotation, identifying a critical angular velocity that determines the\ndominant effect. As a parallel study, we also examine the rotation effect in\nthe holographic inverse magnetic catalysis model, although the magnetic field\nexhibits distinctly different behaviors in these two models, the impact of\nrotation on the dissociation effect of $J/\\Psi$ is similar. Finally, we\ninvestigate the influence of electric field and demonstrate that it also speeds\nup the $J/\\Psi$ dissociation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 10:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

One of the possibilities offered by semantic\ncommunication is the capability to regenerate, at the destination side, images\nor videos semantically equivalent to the transmitted ones, without necessarily\nrecovering the transmitted sequence of bits. The current solutions still lack\nthe ability to build complex scenes from the received partial information.\nClearly, there is an unmet need to balance the effectiveness of generation\nmethods and the complexity of the transmitted information, possibly taking into\naccount the goal of communication. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by\nproposing a novel generative diffusion-guided framework for semantic\ncommunication that leverages the strong abilities of diffusion models in\nsynthesizing multimedia content while preserving semantic features. We reduce\nbandwidth usage by sending highly-compressed semantic information only. Then,\nthe diffusion model learns to synthesize semantic-consistent scenes through\nspatially-adaptive normalizations from such denoised semantic information. We\nprove, through an in-depth assessment of multiple scenarios, that our method\noutperforms existing solutions in generating high-quality images with preserved\nsemantic information even in cases where the received content is significantly\ndegraded. More specifically, our results show that objects, locations, and\ndepths are still recognizable even in the presence of extremely noisy\nconditions of the communication channel.

To tackle it, in-storage processing (ISP) within storage\ndevices, such as Solid-State Drives (SSDs), has been explored actively. The\nintroduction of computational storage drives (CSDs) enabled ISP within the same\nform factor as regular SSDs and made it easy to replace SSDs within traditional\ncompute nodes. With CSDs, host systems can offload various operations such as\nsearch, filter, and count. However, commercialized CSDs have different hardware\nresources and performance characteristics. Thus, it requires careful\nconsideration of hardware, performance, and workload characteristics for\nbuilding a CSD-based storage system within a compute node. Therefore, storage\narchitects are hesitant to build a storage system based on CSDs as there are no\ntools to determine the benefits of CSD-based compute nodes to meet the\nperformance requirements compared to traditional nodes based on SSDs. In this\nwork, we proposed an analytical model-based storage capacity planner called\nCSDPlan for system architects to build performance-effective CSD-based compute\nnodes.

Precisely, if $k$ is the rank of the matroid, we obtain $(1 -\n\\varepsilon)$ approximation using $(1/\\varepsilon)^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$ time for\npartition and laminar matroids and using $(1/\\varepsilon+k)^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$\ntime for transversal matroids.

Our\nequalizer is based on a projected quasi-Newton method for one-bit uplink\nmassive MIMO systems applicable for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(OFDM) and single carrier (SC) transmission under frequency-selective fading.\nThe proposed low-complexity detector can outperform the benchmark detector from\nthe literature with very similar complexity. We analyze the effects of PRQ\nunder frequency-selective fading for different scenarios and show that the PRQ\nscheme can close the performance gap between SC and OFDM systems by\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 11:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

However,\nthese models have shown limited performance in instance-level tasks that demand\nprecise localization and recognition. Previous works have suggested that\nincorporating visual prompts, such as colorful boxes or circles, can improve\nthe ability of models to recognize objects of interest. Nonetheless, compared\nto language prompting, visual prompting designs are rarely explored. Existing\napproaches, which employ coarse visual cues such as colorful boxes or circles,\noften result in sub-optimal performance due to the inclusion of irrelevant and\nnoisy pixels. In this paper, we carefully study the visual prompting designs by\nexploring more fine-grained markings, such as segmentation masks and their\nvariations. In addition, we introduce a new zero-shot framework that leverages\npixel-level annotations acquired from a generalist segmentation model for\nfine-grained visual prompting. Consequently, our investigation reveals that a\nstraightforward application of blur outside the target mask, referred to as the\nBlur Reverse Mask, exhibits exceptional effectiveness. This proposed prompting\nstrategy leverages the precise mask annotations to reduce focus on weakly\nrelated regions while retaining spatial coherence between the target and the\nsurrounding background. Our Fine-Grained Visual Prompting (FGVP) demonstrates\nsuperior performance in zero-shot comprehension of referring expressions on the\nRefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg benchmarks. It outperforms prior methods by an\naverage margin of 3.0% to 4.6%, with a maximum improvement of 12.5% on the\nRefCOCO+ testA subset. The part detection experiments conducted on the PACO\ndataset further validate the preponderance of FGVP over existing visual\nprompting techniques.

Despite its successes and unfailing surge\nof interest in recent years, a limitation of the PAC-Bayesian framework is that\nmost bounds involve a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term (or its\nvariations), which might exhibit erratic behavior and fail to capture the\nunderlying geometric structure of the learning problem - hence restricting its\nuse in practical applications. As a remedy, recent studies have attempted to\nreplace the KL divergence in the PAC-Bayesian bounds with the Wasserstein\ndistance. Even though these bounds alleviated the aforementioned issues to a\ncertain extent, they either hold in expectation, are for bounded losses, or are\nnontrivial to minimize in an SRM framework.

Yet, our understanding of the influence of grain\ngeometries on macroscopic response is often only qualitative, due to the\nlimited availability of high-quality 3D grain geometry data. In this paper, we\nintroduce a denoising diffusion algorithm that uses a set of point clouds\ncollected from the surface of individual sand grains to generate grains in the\nlatent space. By employing a point cloud autoencoder, the three-dimensional\npoint cloud structures of sand grains are first encoded into a\nlower-dimensional latent space. A generative denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodel is trained to produce synthetic sand that maximizes the log-likelihood of\nthe generated samples belonging to the original data distribution measured by a\nKullback-Leibler divergence. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed\nmethod is capable of generating realistic grains with morphology, shapes and\nsizes consistent with the training data inferred from an F50 sand database. We\nthen use a rigid contact dynamic simulator to pour the synthetic sand in a\nconfined volume to form granular assemblies in a static equilibrium state with\ntargeted distribution properties. To ensure third-party validation, 50,000\nsynthetic sand grains and the 1,542 real synchrotron microcomputed tomography\n(SMT) scans of the F50 sand, as well as the granular assemblies composed of\nsynthetic sand grains are made available in an open-source repository.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 13:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

However, a delay in observing the primary outcome variable can\nharm this added efficiency. In this paper, we aim to ascertain the size of such\noutcome delay that results in the realised efficiency gains of ADs becoming\nnegligible compared to classical fixed sample RCTs.\n  We measure the impact of delay by developing formulae for the no. of overruns\nin 2 arm GSDs with normal data, assuming different recruitment models. The\nefficiency of a GSD is usually measured in terms of the expected sample size\n(ESS), with GSDs generally reducing the ESS compared to a standard RCT. Our\nformulae measures the efficiency gain from a GSD in terms of ESS reduction that\nis lost due to delay. We assess whether careful choice of design (e.g.,\naltering the spacing of the IAs) can help recover the benefits of GSDs in\npresence of delay. We also analyse the efficiency of GSDs with respect to time\nto complete the trial.\n  Comparing the expected efficiency gains, with and without consideration of\ndelay, it is evident GSDs suffer considerable losses due to delay. Even a small\ndelay can have a significant impact on the trial's efficiency. In contrast,\neven in the presence of substantial delay, a GSD will have a smaller expected\ntime to trial completion in comparison to a simple RCT. Although the no. of\nstages have little influence on the efficiency losses, the timing of IAs can\nimpact the efficiency of a GSDs with delay.

However,\nconsiderable variances in ECG signals between individuals is a significant\nchallenge. Changes in data distribution limit cross-domain utilization of a\nmodel. In this study, we propose a solution to classify ECG in an unlabeled\ndataset by leveraging knowledge obtained from labeled source domain. We present\na domain-adaptive deep network based on cross-domain feature discrepancy\noptimization. Our method comprises three stages: pre-training, cluster-centroid\ncomputing, and adaptation. In pre-training, we employ a Distributionally Robust\nOptimization (DRO) technique to deal with the vanishing worst-case training\nloss. To enhance the richness of the features, we concatenate three temporal\nfeatures with the deep learning features. The cluster computing stage involves\ncomputing centroids of distinctly separable clusters for the source using true\nlabels, and for the target using confident predictions. We propose a novel\ntechnique to select confident predictions in the target domain. In the\nadaptation stage, we minimize compacting loss within the same cluster,\nseparating loss across different clusters, inter-domain cluster discrepancy\nloss, and running combined loss to produce a domain-robust model. Experiments\nconducted in both cross-domain and cross-channel paradigms show the efficacy of\nthe proposed method.

Detecting and\nmodeling opinion leaders is crucial as they play a vital role in shaping public\nopinion and driving online conversations. Existing research have extensively\nexplored various methods for detecting opinion leaders, but there is a lack of\nconsensus between definitions and methods. It is important to note that the\nterm \"important node\" in graph theory does not necessarily align with the\nconcept of \"opinion leader\" in social psychology. This paper aims to address\nthis issue by introducing the methodologies for identifying influential nodes\nin OSNs and providing a corresponding definition of opinion leaders in relation\nto social psychology. The key novelty is to review connections and\ncross-compare different approaches that have origins in: graph theory, natural\nlanguage processing, social psychology, control theory, and graph sampling. We\ndiscuss how they tell a different technical tale of influence and also propose\nhow some of the approaches can be combined via networked dynamical systems\nmodeling.

We introduce the concept of conditional method\nagreement and propose a respective modeling approach to alleviate this\nconstraint. Therefore, the Bland-Altman analysis is embedded in the framework\nof recursive partitioning to explicitly define subgroups with heterogeneous\nagreement in dependence of covariates in an exploratory analysis. Three\ndifferent modeling approaches, conditional inference trees with an appropriate\ntransformation of the modeled differences (CTreeTrafo), distributional\nregression trees (DistTree), and model-based trees (MOB) are considered. The\nperformance of these models is evaluated in terms of type-I error probability\nand power in several simulation studies. Further, the adjusted rand index (ARI)\nis used to quantify the models' ability to uncover given subgroups. An\napplication example to real data of accelerometer device measurements is used\nto demonstrate the applicability. Additionally, a two-sample Bland-Altman test\nis proposed for exploratory or confirmatory hypothesis testing of differences\nin agreement between subgroups.

However, the long-period planets in these systems often\nescape detection. HD 22946 is a bright star around which 3 transiting planets\nwere identified via TESS photometry, but the true orbital period of the\noutermost planet d was unknown until now. We aim to use CHEOPS to uncover the\ntrue orbital period of HD 22946d and to refine the orbital and planetary\nproperties of the system, especially the radii of the planets. We used the\navailable TESS photometry of HD 22946 and observed several transits of the\nplanets b, c, and d using CHEOPS. We identified 2 transits of planet d in the\nTESS photometry, calculated the most probable period aliases based on these\ndata, and then scheduled CHEOPS observations. The photometric data were\nsupplemented with ESPRESSO radial velocity data. Finally, a combined model was\nfitted to the entire dataset. We successfully determined the true orbital\nperiod of the planet d to be 47.42489 $\\pm$ 0.00011 d, and derived precise\nradii of the planets in the system, namely 1.362 $\\pm$ 0.040 R$_\\oplus$, 2.328\n$\\pm$ 0.039 R$_\\oplus$, and 2.607 $\\pm$ 0.060 R$_\\oplus$ for planets b, c, and\nd, respectively. Due to the low number of radial velocities, we were only able\nto determine 3$\\sigma$ upper limits for these respective planet masses, which\nare 13.71 M$_\\oplus$, 9.72 M$_\\oplus$, and 26.57 M$_\\oplus$. We estimated that\nanother 48 ESPRESSO radial velocities are needed to measure the predicted\nmasses of all planets in HD 22946.

This phase is\nsupposed to exist in the extreme conditions prevailing, e.g., in neutron star\ncores. These conditions are, apart from high densities and strong magnetic\nfields, a relatively large angular velocity. To answer the question of whether\nthe rotation enhances or suppresses the formation of this phase, we first\ndetermine the effect of rotation on the energy dispersion relation of a\nfermionic system in the presence of a constant magnetic field, and then focus\non the thermodynamic potential of the model at zero temperature and finite\nchemical potential. The thermodynamic potential consists, in particular, of an\nanomalous part leading to certain topological effects.

To\naddress these issues, a Focus and Separation Network (FoSp) is proposed. We\nfirst introduce a Focus module employing bidirectional cascade which guides\nlow-resolution and high-resolution features towards mid-resolution to locate\nand determine the scope of smoke, reducing the miss detection rate. Next, we\npropose a Separation module that separates smoke images into a pure smoke\nforeground and a smoke-free background, enhancing the contrast between smoke\nand background fundamentally, improving segmentation precision.

We construct a novel\nMulti-Relational Nested contract Graph (MRNG) to better characterize the rich\nsyntactic and semantic information in the smart contract code, including the\nrelationships between data and instructions. An MRNG represents a smart\ncontract, where each node represents a function in the smart contract and each\nedge describes the calling relationship between the functions.

Bokeh rendering mimics aesthetic shallow depth-of-field\n(DoF) in professional photography, but these visual effects generated by\nexisting methods suffer from simple flat background blur and blurred in-focus\nregions, giving rise to unrealistic rendered results. In this work, we argue\nthat realistic bokeh rendering should (i) model depth relations and distinguish\nin-focus regions, (ii) sustain sharp in-focus regions, and (iii) render\nphysically accurate Circle of Confusion (CoC). To this end, we present a\nDefocus to Focus (D2F) framework to learn realistic bokeh rendering by fusing\ndefocus priors with the all-in-focus image and by implementing radiance priors\nin layered fusion. Since no depth map is provided, we introduce defocus\nhallucination to integrate depth by learning to focus. The predicted defocus\nmap implies the blur amount of bokeh and is used to guide weighted layered\nrendering. In layered rendering, we fuse images blurred by different kernels\nbased on the defocus map. To increase the reality of the bokeh, we adopt\nradiance virtualization to simulate scene radiance. The scene radiance used in\nweighted layered rendering reassigns weights in the soft disk kernel to produce\nthe CoC. To ensure the sharpness of in-focus regions, we propose to fuse\nupsampled bokeh images and original images. We predict the initial fusion mask\nfrom our defocus map and refine the mask with a deep network. We evaluate our\nmodel on a large-scale bokeh dataset.

It is therefore crucial to compare how current modelling\nstrategies perform, and discuss the limitations and remaining challenges for\nPLATO, such as the so-called surface effects, the choice of physical\ningredients, and stellar activity. In this context, we carried out a systematic\nstudy of the impact of surface effects on the estimation of stellar parameters.\nIn this work, we demonstrated how combining a mean density inversion with a fit\nof frequencies separation ratios can efficiently damp the surface effects and\nachieve precise and accurate stellar parameters for ten Kepler LEGACY targets,\nwell within the PLATO mission requirements.\n  We applied and compared two modelling approaches, directly fitting the\nindividual frequencies, or coupling a mean density inversion with a fit of the\nratios, to six synthetic targets with a patched 3D atmosphere from Sonoi et al.\n(2015) and ten actual targets from the LEGACY sample. The fit of the individual\nfrequencies is unsurprisingly very sensitive to surface effects and the stellar\nparameters tend to be biased, which constitutes a fundamental limit to both\naccuracy and precision. In contrast, coupling a mean density inversion and a\nfit of the ratios efficiently damps the surface effects, and allows us to get\nboth precise and accurate stellar parameters. The average statistical precision\nof our selection of LEGACY targets with this second strategy is 1.9% for the\nmass, 0.7% for the radius, and 4.1% for the age, well within the PLATO\nrequirements. Using the mean density in the constraints significantly improves\nthe precision of the mass, radius and age determinations, on average by 20%,\n33%, and 16%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 15:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Currently, there are a few working\nprototypes of RISs operating in the mmWave frequency band and all of them are\nbased on passive reflective elements. However, to fabricate an efficiently\nworking RIS at mmWave frequencies, it is crucial to take care of the strong\nsignal attenuation, reflective element losses and undesired radio frequency\n(RF) circuit effects. In this paper, we provide measurement campaign results\nfor an active RIS in the mmWave frequency band as well as its analysis and\nsystem design. The obtained results demonstrate that an active RIS outperforms\na RIS working in passive mode and provides a higher signal-to-noise-ratio\n(SNR). The active RIS consists of active reflective elements that amplify the\nimpinging signal and reflect the signal to the desired beam direction. To\nobtain an efficient RIS in terms of power consumption and RIS state switch\ntime, we design a hexagonal RIS with 37 elements working at 26 GHz. These\nelements are designed to work whether in passive state (binary phase shifting)\nor in active state (switch OFF or amplifying). We provide a comparison between\nthe performance of a RIS working in passive and active mode using numerical\nsimulations and empirical measurements. This comparison reveals that the active\nreflective intelligent surface (RIS) provides a received power that is at least\n4 dB higher than that of the equivalent passive RIS. These results demonstrate\nthe strong advantage of using active RISs for future ultra-reliable low-latency\nwireless communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 15:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

Recently, the first runtime\nanalyses of the famous and highly cited EMO algorithm NSGA-II have emerged,\ndemonstrating that practical algorithms with thousands of applications can be\nrigorously analysed. However, these results only show that NSGA-II has the same\nperformance guarantees as GSEMO and it is unclear how and when NSGA-II can\noutperform GSEMO. We study this question in noisy optimisation and consider a\nnoise model that adds large amounts of posterior noise to all objectives with\nsome constant probability $p$ per evaluation. We show that GSEMO fails badly on\nevery noisy fitness function as it tends to remove large parts of the\npopulation indiscriminately. In contrast, NSGA-II is able to handle the noise\nefficiently on \\textsc{LeadingOnesTrailingZeroes} when $p<1/2$, as the\nalgorithm is able to preserve useful search points even in the presence of\nnoise. We identify a phase transition at $p=1/2$ where the expected time to\ncover the Pareto front changes from polynomial to exponential. To our\nknowledge, this is the first proof that NSGA-II can outperform GSEMO and the\nfirst runtime analysis of NSGA-II in noisy optimisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 15:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

A key component of reliability is the ability to estimate\nuncertainty, which enables the identification of areas of high and low\nconfidence and helps to minimize the risk of error. In this study, we propose a\nmachine learning pipeline called U-PASS tailored for clinical applications that\nincorporates uncertainty estimation at every stage of the process, including\ndata acquisition, training, and model deployment. The training process is\ndivided into a supervised pre-training step and a semi-supervised finetuning\nstep. We apply our uncertainty-guided deep learning pipeline to the challenging\nproblem of sleep staging and demonstrate that it systematically improves\nperformance at every stage. By optimizing the training dataset, actively\nseeking informative samples, and deferring the most uncertain samples to an\nexpert, we achieve an expert-level accuracy of 85% on a challenging clinical\ndataset of elderly sleep apnea patients, representing a significant improvement\nover the baseline accuracy of 75%. U-PASS represents a promising approach to\nincorporating uncertainty estimation into machine learning pipelines, thereby\nimproving their reliability and unlocking their potential in clinical settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 08:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

The vast majority of reconstruction\nmethods in PET imaging, both iterative and deep learning, return a single\nestimate without quantifying the associated uncertainty. Due to ill-posedness\nand noise, a single solution can be misleading or inaccurate. Thus, providing a\nmeasure of uncertainty in PET image reconstruction can help medical\npractitioners in making critical decisions. This paper proposes a deep\nlearning-based method for uncertainty quantification in PET image\nreconstruction via posterior sampling. The method is based on training a\nconditional generative adversarial network whose generator approximates\nsampling from the posterior in Bayesian inversion. The generator is conditioned\non reconstruction from a low-dose PET scan obtained by a conventional\nreconstruction method and a high-quality magnetic resonance image and learned\nto estimate a corresponding standard-dose PET scan reconstruction. We show that\nthe proposed model generates high-quality posterior samples and yields\nphysically-meaningful uncertainty estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 10:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Most current\napproaches struggle to efficiently integrate the wealth of information\ncontained in the protein sequence and structure. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework for embedding protein graphs in geometric vector spaces, by\nlearning an encoder function that preserves the structural distance between\nprotein graphs. Utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language\nModels (LLMs), the proposed framework generates structure- and sequence-aware\nprotein representations. We demonstrate that our embeddings are successful in\nthe task of comparing protein structures, while providing a significant\nspeed-up compared to traditional approaches based on structural alignment. Our\nframework achieves remarkable results in the task of protein structure\nclassification; in particular, when compared to other work, the proposed method\nshows an average F1-Score improvement of 26% on out-of-distribution (OOD)\nsamples and of 32% when tested on samples coming from the same distribution as\nthe training data. Our approach finds applications in areas such as drug\nprioritization, drug re-purposing, disease sub-type analysis and elsewhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 14:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

For stars other\nthan the Sun, the spectral signatures of faculae are poorly understood,\nlimiting our ability to account for stellar pollution in exoplanet transit\nobservations. Here we present the first facular contrasts derived from\nmagnetoconvection simulations for K0, M0 and M2 main-sequence stars and compare\nthem to previous calculations for G2 main-sequence stars. We simulate\nphotospheres and immediate subsurface layers of main-sequence spectral types\nbetween K0 and M2, with different injected vertical magnetic fields (0 G, 100\nG, 300 G and 500 G) using MURaM, a 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code. We\nshow synthetic spectra and contrasts from the UV (300 nm) to the IR (10000 nm)\ncalculated using the ATLAS9 radiative transfer code. The calculations are\nperformed for nine viewing angles to characterise the facular radiation across\nthe disc. The brightness contrasts of magnetic regions are found to change\nsignificantly across spectral type, wavelength and magnetic field strength,\nleading to the conclusion that accurate contrasts cannot be found by scaling\nsolar values. This is due to features of different size, apparent structure and\nspectral brightness emerging in the presence of a given magnetic field for\ndifferent spectral types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 15:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}
