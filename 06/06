Here, we derive an analytical solution to the\ndecision-making problem of storage operators who sell frequency regulation\npower to grid operators and trade electricity on day-ahead markets.\nMathematically, we treat future frequency deviation trajectories as functional\nuncertainties in a receding horizon robust optimization problem. We constrain\nthe expected terminal state-of-charge to be equal to some target to allow\nstorage operators to make good decisions not only for the present but also the\nfuture. Thanks to this constraint, the amount of electricity traded on\nday-ahead markets is an implicit function of the regulation power sold to grid\noperators. The implicit function quantifies the amount of power that needs to\nbe purchased to cover the expected energy loss that results from providing\nfrequency regulation. We show how the marginal cost associated with the\nexpected energy loss decreases with roundtrip efficiency and increases with\nfrequency deviation dispersion. We find that the profits from frequency\nregulation over the lifetime of energy-constrained storage devices are roughly\ninversely proportional to the length of time for which regulation power must be\ncommitted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 16:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV)-mounted edge devices are particularly advantageous for\nFEEL due to their flexibility and mobility in efficient data collection. In\nUAV-assisted FEEL, sensing, computation, and communication are coupled and\ncompete for limited onboard resources, and UAV deployment also affects sensing\nand communication performance. Therefore, the joint design of UAV deployment\nand resource allocation is crucial to achieving the optimal training\nperformance. In this paper, we address the problem of joint UAV deployment\ndesign and resource allocation for FEEL via a concrete case study of human\nmotion recognition based on wireless sensing. We first analyze the impact of\nUAV deployment on the sensing quality and identify a threshold value for the\nsensing elevation angle that guarantees a satisfactory quality of data samples.\nDue to the non-ideal sensing channels, we consider the probabilistic sensing\nmodel, where the successful sensing probability of each UAV is determined by\nits position.

Based on this analysis, we formulate a training time minimization\nproblem by jointly optimizing UAV deployment, integrated sensing, computation,\nand communication (ISCC) resources under a desirable optimality gap constraint.\nTo solve this challenging mixed-integer non-convex problem, we apply the\nalternating optimization technique, and propose the bandwidth, batch size, and\nposition optimization (BBPO) scheme to optimize these three decision variables\nalternately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 16:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

We\nmeasured the acoustic constraints imposed by the human skull to design an\nultrasound sensor suitable for transcranial PA imaging and sensing. We imaged\nthe phantoms using a planar Fabry-Perot sensor and employed a range of\npiezoelectric and optical ultrasound sensors to measure the frequency dependent\nacoustic transmission through human cranial bone.

The proposed SAA\nalgorithm removes the need for a primary radar and a clock synchronization\nsince it relies on the estimate of the aviation obstacle's elevation angle for\nranging.

We also propose a new radial velocity estimator for the\nMode S operation of the SSR which is employed in the proposed SAA system.

X-risks refer to a family of compositional\nfunctions in which the loss function of each data point is defined in a way\nthat contrasts the data point with a large number of others. They have broad\napplications in AI for solving classical and emerging problems, including but\nnot limited to classification for imbalanced data (CID), learning to rank\n(LTR), and contrastive learning of representations (CLR). The motivation of\ndeveloping LibAUC is to address the convergence issues of existing libraries\nfor solving these problems. In particular, existing libraries may not converge\nor require very large mini-batch sizes in order to attain good performance for\nthese problems, due to the usage of the standard mini-batch technique in the\nempirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. Our library is for deep X-risk\noptimization (DXO) that has achieved great success in solving a variety of\ntasks for CID, LTR and CLR. The contributions of this paper include: (1) It\nintroduces a new mini-batch based pipeline for implementing DXO algorithms,\nwhich differs from existing DL pipeline in the design of controlled data\nsamplers and dynamic mini-batch losses; (2) It provides extensive benchmarking\nexperiments for ablation studies and comparison with existing libraries. The\nLibAUC library features scalable performance for millions of items to be\ncontrasted, faster and better convergence than existing libraries for\noptimizing X-risks, seamless PyTorch deployment and versatile APIs for various\nloss optimization.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is widely recognized as one\nof the most popular sports leagues globally. However, an unfortunate aspect\nthat has emerged in recent years is the presence of abusive fans within the\nleague. Consequently, the focus of this research is to identify which NBA\nathletes experience abuse on Twitter and delve deeper into the underlying\nreasons behind such mistreatment. To address the research questions at hand,\nthe study employs a curated set of keywords to query the Twitter API, gathering\na comprehensive collection of tweets that potentially contain hate speech\ndirected toward NBA players.

They are connected among them by filaments, elongated structures\ncomposed of dark matter, galaxies, and gas. The connection of galaxy clusters\nto filaments is important, as it is related to the process of matter accretion\nonto the former. For this reason, investigating the connections to the cosmic\nweb of massive clusters, especially well known ones for which a lot of\ninformation is available, is a hot topic in astrophysics. In a previous work we\nperformed an analysis of the filament connections of the Coma cluster of\ngalaxies, as detected from the observed galaxy distribution. In this work we\nresort to a numerical simulation whose initial conditions are constrained to\nreproduce the Local Universe, including the region of the Coma cluster to\ninterpret our observations in an evolutionary context. We detect the filaments\nconnected to the simulated Coma cluster and perform an accurate comparison with\nthe cosmic web configuration we detected in observations. We perform an\nanalysis of the halos' spatial and velocity distributions close to the\nfilaments in the cluster outskirts. We conclude that, although not\nsignificantly larger than the average, the flux of accreting matter on the\nsimulated Coma cluster is significantly more collimated close to the filaments\nwith respect to the general isotropic accretion flux. This paper is the first\nexample of such a result and the first installment in a series of publications\nwhich will explore the build-up of the Coma cluster system in connection to the\nfilaments of the cosmic web as a function of redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

The current theoretical modeling of\nthis estimator involves an approximate treatment only applicable at small\nscales. As the measurement fidelity rapidly improves, we find it necessary to\nmove beyond the original treatment and hence derive an improved theoretical\nmodel for this estimator without these previous approximations.

However, the magnitude of the crystallization-powered\ncooling delay required to match observed white dwarfs is larger than predicted\nby conventional models, requiring additional mechanisms of energy release in\nwhite dwarf interiors. The most ideal benchmarks for understanding this\ndiscrepancy would be bright and nearby crystallizing white dwarfs with total\nages that can be externally constrained. In this work we report that a recently\ndiscovered white dwarf is a bound companion to the triple star HD 190412,\nforming a new Sirius-like system in the solar neighbourhood. The location of HD\n190412 C on the $T_{\\text{eff}}-\\text{mass}$ diagram implies it is undergoing\ncrystallization, making this the first confirmed crystallizing white dwarf\nwhose total age can be externally constrained. Motivated by the possibility\nthat a cooling delay caused by crystallization can be directly detected for\nthis white dwarf we employ a variety of methods to constrain the age of the\nsystem; however, our empirical age anomaly of $+3.1\\pm1.9$ Gyr is ultimately\ntoo imprecise to reach statistical significance, preventing us from making\nstrong constraints to models of white dwarf crystallization. Our results are\nnonetheless compatible with the recent hypothesis that $^{22}$Ne phase\nseparation is responsible for the excess cooling delay of crystallizing white\ndwarfs. The discovery of this system at only 32 parsecs suggests that similar\nbenchmark systems are likely to be common; future discoveries may therefore\nprovide powerful tests for models of white dwarf crystallization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Recent advances in the\nfield of astrophysical feedback strongly suggest that cosmic rays (CRs) may be\ncrucially important for our understanding of cosmological galaxy formation and\nevolution. The appealing features of CRs are their relatively long cooling\ntimes and relatively strong dynamical coupling to the gas. In galaxies, CRs can\nbe close to equipartition with the thermal, magnetic, and turbulent energy\ndensity in the interstellar medium, and can be dynamically very important in\ndriving large-scale galactic winds. Similarly, CRs may provide a significant\ncontribution to the pressure in the circumgalactic medium. In galaxy clusters,\nCRs may play a key role in addressing the classic cooling flow problem by\nfacilitating efficient heating of the intracluster medium and preventing\nexcessive star formation. Overall, the underlying physics of CR interactions\nwith plasmas exhibit broad parallels across the entire range of scales\ncharacteristic of the interstellar, circumgalactic, and intracluster media.\nHere we present a review of the state-of-the-art of this field and provide a\npedagogical introduction to cosmic ray plasma physics, including the physics of\nwave-particle interactions, acceleration processes, CR spatial and spectral\ntransport, and important cooling processes.

In this work, we aim at characterizing the history of cold CGM\ngas, in order to identify the dominant origin channels at different\nevolutionary stages of the main galaxy. To this goal, we track gas particles in\ndifferent snapshots of the SPH cosmological zoom-in simulation Eris2k.

We\nalso perform a forward tracking of gas in different components of the galaxy\n(such as the disk and outflows). We find a clear transition between two epochs.\nFor $z>2$, most cold gas (up to 80%) in the CGM comes from cold accretion\nstreams as the galaxy is accreting in the \"cold mode\" from the IGM. At lower\n$z$, gas either cools down in-situ after several recycles (with 10-20% of the\ngas cooling in outflow), or it is ejected directly from the disk (up to 30%).\nOutflows have a major contribution to the cold CGM gas budget at $z<1$, with\nalmost 50% of hot gas cooling in outflow.

Remarkably the cumulative probabilities\nof these three observables all follows the same distribution, the Arcsine\ndistribution. But in real systems, space is often heterogeneous, and these laws\nare likely to hold no longer. In this paper we explore such a scenario and\nstudy how the presence of a spatial heterogeneity alters these Arcsine laws.\nSpecifically we consider the case of a thin permeable barrier, which is often\nemployed to represent diffusion impeding heterogeneities in physical and\nbiological systems such as multilayer electrodes, electrical gap junctions,\ncell membranes and fragmentation in the landscape for dispersing animals. Using\nthe Feynman-Kac formalism and path decomposition techniques we are able to find\nthe exact time-dependence of the probability distribution of the three\nstatistical quantities of interest. We show that a permeable barrier has a\nlarge impact on these distributions at short times, but this impact is less\ninfluential as time becomes long. In particular, the presence of a barrier\nmeans that the three distributions are no longer identical with symmetry about\ntheir means being broken. We also study a closely related statistical quantity,\nnamely, the distribution of the maximum displacement of a Brownian particle and\nshow that it deviates significantly from the usual half-Gaussian form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 18:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

The beat varies in response\nto changes in the fluid rheology, including elasticity, but there is limited\ndata on how systematic changes in elasticity alters the beat. This work\nanalyzes a related problem with fixed-strength driving force: the emergence of\nbeating of an elastic planar filament driven by a follower force at the tip in\na viscoelastic fluid. This analysis examines how the onset of oscillations\ndepends on the strength of the force and viscoelastic parameters. Compared to a\nNewtonian fluid, it takes more force to induce the instability in viscoelastic\nfluids, and the frequency of the oscillation is higher. The linear analysis\npredicts that the frequency increases with the fluid relaxation time.

We further quantitatively rationalize the deviation from the TUR bound,\nillustrating that we can anticipate the degree to which a motor fails to\nsaturate the TUR in terms of four physical parameters: the chemical potential\ndriving the motor, the rate of fuel decomposition, the coupling between fuel\ndecomposition and motor motion, and the rate of undriven motor motion.

A\nsignificant limitation of weighted majority quorum systems lies in their\ndependence on static weights, which are inappropriate for systems subject to\nthe dynamic nature of networked environments. To overcome this limitation, such\nquorum systems require mechanisms for reassigning weights over time according\nto the performance variations. We study the problem of node weight reassignment\nin asynchronous systems with a static set of servers and static fault\nthreshold. We prove that solving such a problem is as hard as solving\nconsensus, i.e., it cannot be implemented in asynchronous failure-prone\ndistributed systems. This result is somewhat counter-intuitive, given the\nrecent results showing that two related problems -- replica set reconfiguration\nand asset transfer -- can be solved in asynchronous systems.

Our key\ncontribution is a personalized graph adaptation model that bridges the gap\nbetween recent literature on federated GNNs and (non-graph) personalized\nfederated learning, which either does not optimize for the adaptability of the\nfederated model or is restricted to local models with homogeneous\nparameterization, excluding GNNs with heterogeneous local graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 19:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

This\npatterning is made possible by assuming the plates are chemically reactive or\nrelease reagents into the fluid, both of which we model as chemical fluxes. We\nconsider this as a specific example of boundary-bound reactions. When the\nchemical reagents do not produce significant solutal buoyancy forces, chemical\ninstabilities such as the diffusion-driven instabilities described by Turing\nare still possible with nonlinear reactions. In the other extreme, constant\nfluxes at the two plates do not produce diffusion-driven instabilities but\ncould give rise to hydrodynamic instabilities analogous to Rayleigh-Benard\ninstabilities. If we are able to influence the chemical fluxes along the domain\nand select suitable reaction systems, then this presents a mechanism for the\ncontrol of chemical and hydrodynamic instabilities and pattern formation. We\nstudy a generic class of models and find necessary conditions for a bifurcation\nto pattern formation. Two examples derived from the Schnakenberg-Selkov\nreaction are presented. Our results demonstrate that buoyancy-driven\ninstabilities can occur even in the absence of density variations in the steady\nstate. We also find parameter combinations that result in the formation of\nconvective cells whether gravity acts upwards or downwards relative to the\nreactive plate. The wavenumber of the cells and the direction of the flow at\nregions of high/low concentration depend on the orientation, hence, different\npatterns can be elicited by simply inverting the device. More generally, our\nresults suggest methods for controlling pattern formation and convection by\ntuning reaction parameters.

In statistical omics, networks can be used to\nmodel and study the functional relationships between genes, proteins, and other\ntypes of omics data. If a Gaussian graphical model is assumed, a gene\nassociation network can be determined from the non-zero entries of the inverse\ncovariance matrix of the data. Due to the high-dimensional nature of such\nproblems, integrative methods that leverage similarities between multiple\ngraphical structures have become increasingly popular. The joint graphical\nlasso is a powerful tool for this purpose, however, the current AIC-based\nselection criterion used to tune the network sparsities and similarities leads\nto poor performance in high-dimensional settings. We propose stabJGL, which\nequips the joint graphical lasso with a stable and accurate penalty parameter\nselection approach that combines the notion of model stability with\nlikelihood-based similarity selection. The resulting method makes the powerful\njoint graphical lasso available for use in omics settings, and outperforms the\nstandard joint graphical lasso, as well as state-of-the-art joint methods, in\nterms of all performance measures we consider.

Do adversarial attacks continue to pose\na threat to DNNs?\n  Here, we investigate how the robustness of DNNs to adversarial attacks has\nevolved as their accuracy on ImageNet has continued to improve. We measure\nadversarial robustness in two different ways: First, we measure the smallest\nadversarial attack needed to cause a model to change its object categorization\ndecision. Second, we measure how aligned successful attacks are with the\nfeatures that humans find diagnostic for object recognition. We find that\nadversarial attacks are inducing bigger and more easily detectable changes to\nimage pixels as DNNs grow better on ImageNet, but these attacks are also\nbecoming less aligned with features that humans find diagnostic for\nrecognition. To better understand the source of this trade-off, we turn to the\nneural harmonizer, a DNN training routine that encourages models to leverage\nthe same features as humans to solve tasks. Harmonized DNNs achieve the best of\nboth worlds and experience attacks that are detectable and affect features that\nhumans find diagnostic for recognition, meaning that attacks on these models\nare more likely to be rendered ineffective by inducing similar effects on human\nperception. Our findings suggest that the sensitivity of DNNs to adversarial\nattacks can be mitigated by DNN scale, data scale, and training routines that\nalign models with biological intelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 20:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

On the\none hand, human developers tend to write repetitive programs referencing\nexisting code snippets from the current codebase or online resources (e.g.,\nStack Overflow website) rather than implementing functions from scratch; such\nbehaviors result in a vast number of code clones. In contrast, a deviant clone\nby mistake might trigger malicious program behaviors.\n  Thus, as a proxy to incorporate developers' coding behavior into the\npre-training scheme, we propose to include code clones and their deviants. In\nparticular, we propose CONCORD, a self-supervised, contrastive learning\nstrategy to place benign clones closer in the representation space while moving\ndeviants further apart. We show that CONCORD's clone-aware contrastive learning\ndrastically reduces the need for expensive pre-training resources while\nimproving the performance of downstream SE tasks.

Current methods use some combination of\nglobal novelty bonuses, computed using the agent's entire training experience,\nand \\textit{episodic novelty bonuses}, computed using only experience from the\ncurrent episode. However, the use of these two types of bonuses has been ad-hoc\nand poorly understood. In this work, we shed light on the behavior of these two\ntypes of bonuses through controlled experiments on easily interpretable tasks\nas well as challenging pixel-based settings. We find that the two types of\nbonuses succeed in different settings, with episodic bonuses being most\neffective when there is little shared structure across episodes and global\nbonuses being effective when more structure is shared. We develop a conceptual\nframework which makes this notion of shared structure precise by considering\nthe variance of the value function across contexts, and which provides a\nunifying explanation of our empirical results. We furthermore find that\ncombining the two bonuses can lead to more robust performance across different\ndegrees of shared structure, and investigate different algorithmic choices for\ndefining and combining global and episodic bonuses based on function\napproximation.

To this\nend, we introduce a fully automatic method that exploits the exceptional\nreasoning capabilities of recent foundation models in language and vision to\ntackle difficult shape correspondence problems. Our approach comprises multiple\nstages. First, we classify the 3D shapes in a zero-shot manner by feeding\nrendered shape views to a language-vision model (e.g., BLIP2) to generate a\nlist of class proposals per shape. These proposals are unified into a single\nclass per shape by employing the reasoning capabilities of ChatGPT. Second, we\nattempt to segment the two shapes in a zero-shot manner, but in contrast to the\nco-segmentation problem, we do not require a mutual set of semantic regions.\nInstead, we propose to exploit the in-context learning capabilities of ChatGPT\nto generate two different sets of semantic regions for each shape and a\nsemantic mapping between them. This enables our approach to match strongly\nnon-isometric shapes with significant differences in geometric structure.\nFinally, we employ the generated semantic mapping to produce coarse\ncorrespondences that can further be refined by the functional maps framework to\nproduce dense point-to-point maps. Our approach, despite its simplicity,\nproduces highly plausible results in a zero-shot manner, especially between\nstrongly non-isometric shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 21:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Given a\nsilent video, we first predict the spoken text using a pre-trained lip-reading\nnetwork.

However, their\nexpressive power is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test.\nSome works are inspired by $k$-WL/FWL (Folklore WL) and design the\ncorresponding neural versions. Despite the high expressive power, there are\nserious limitations in this line of research. In particular, (1) $k$-WL/FWL\nrequires at least $O(n^k)$ space complexity, which is impractical for large\ngraphs even when $k=3$; (2) The design space of $k$-WL/FWL is rigid, with the\nonly adjustable hyper-parameter being $k$. To tackle the first limitation, we\npropose an extension, $(k, t)$-FWL. We theoretically prove that even if we fix\nthe space complexity to $O(n^2)$ in $(k, t)$-FWL, we can construct an\nexpressiveness hierarchy up to solving the graph isomorphism problem. To tackle\nthe second problem, we propose $k$-FWL+, which considers any equivariant set as\nneighbors instead of all nodes, thereby greatly expanding the design space of\n$k$-FWL. Combining these two modifications results in a flexible and powerful\nframework $(k, t)$-FWL+. We demonstrate $(k, t)$-FWL+ can implement most\nexisting models with matching expressiveness. We then introduce an instance of\n$(k,t)$-FWL+ called Neighborhood$^2$-FWL (N$^2$-FWL), which is practically and\ntheoretically sound. We prove that N$^2$-FWL is no less powerful than 3-WL, can\nencode many substructures while only requiring $O(n^2)$ space. Finally, we\ndesign its neural version named N$^2$-GNN and evaluate its performance on\nvarious tasks. N$^2$-GNN achieves superior performance on almost all tasks,\nwith record-breaking results on ZINC-Subset (0.059) and ZINC-Full (0.013),\noutperforming previous state-of-the-art results by 10.6% and 40.9%,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 21:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Models in OpenAI's GPT series now dwarf\nGoogle's BERT and Meta's RoBERTa, which previously set new benchmarks on a wide\nrange of NLP applications. These models are trained on massive corpora of\nheterogeneous data from web crawls, which enables them to learn general\nlanguage patterns and semantic relationships. However, the largest models are\nboth expensive to train and deploy and are often closed-source, so we lack\naccess to their data and design decisions.

As a result, we categorize 18 rules regarding the\nconstruction of malicious inputs, which we believe can be used to generate\neffective malformed inputs for testing DL libraries.

In\nthis work we present RTXRMQ, a new approach that can compute range minimum\nqueries (RMQs) with RT cores. The main contribution is the proposal of a\ngeometric solution for RMQ, where elements become triangles that are placed and\nshaped according to the element's value and position in the array,\nrespectively, such that the closest hit of a ray launched from a point given by\nthe query parameters corresponds to the result of that query.

Moreover, it gives offline RL a degree of robustness that is\nuncharacteristic of its online RL counterparts, which are known to be sensitive\nto reward design. We demonstrate that this surprising robustness property is\nattributable to an interplay between the notion of pessimism in offline RL\nalgorithms and a certain bias implicit in common data collection practices. As\nwe prove in this work, pessimism endows the agent with a \"survival instinct\",\ni.e., an incentive to stay within the data support in the long term, while the\nlimited and biased data coverage further constrains the set of survival\npolicies. Formally, given a reward class -- which may not even contain the true\nreward -- we identify conditions on the training data distribution that enable\noffline RL to learn a near-optimal and safe policy from any reward within the\nclass.

ARHMMs permit exact inference and\neasy parameter estimation, but are parameter intensive when modeling long\ndependencies, and hence are prone to overfitting.

To leverage such information, we proposed a\nframework that enables statistical inference in the presence of distribution\nshifts which obey user-specified constraints in the form of functions whose\nexpectation is known under the target distribution. The output is\nhigh-probability bounds on the value an estimand takes on the target\ndistribution. Hence, our method leverages domain knowledge in order to\npartially identify a wide class of estimands. We analyze the computational and\nstatistical properties of methods to estimate these bounds, and show that our\nmethod can produce informative bounds on a variety of simulated and\nsemisynthetic tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 23:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

To advance research in LLDM, we introduce\nLIBERO, a novel benchmark of lifelong learning for robot manipulation.\nSpecifically, LIBERO highlights five key research topics in LLDM: 1) how to\nefficiently transfer declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, or the\nmixture of both; 2) how to design effective policy architectures and 3)\neffective algorithms for LLDM; 4) the robustness of a lifelong learner with\nrespect to task ordering; and 5) the effect of model pretraining for LLDM.

To mitigate the\nwildfire ignition risk, many electric utilities de-energize power lines to\nprevent electric faults and failures.

Advanced technology, such as networked microgrids, can help reduce the\nsize of the resulting power outages; however, even microgrid technology might\nnot be sufficient to supply power to everyone, thus forcing hard questions\nabout how to prioritize the provision of power among customers.

A proper quantum mechanical treatment for such a\nsystem under a periodic potential is the band theory of solids. The effect of\nband structure on the effective mass of dripped neutrons, the so-called\n\\textit{entrainment effect}, is currently in a debatable situation, and it has\nbeen highly desired to develop a nuclear band theory taking into account\nneutron superfluidity in a fully self-consistent manner.\n  Purpose: The main purpose of the present work is twofold: 1) to develop a\nformalism of the time-dependent self-consistent band theory, taking full\naccount of nuclear superfluidity, based on time-dependent density functional\ntheory (TDDFT) extended for superfluid systems, and 2) to quantify the effects\nof band structure and superfluidity on crustal properties, applying the\nformalism to the slab phase of nuclear matter in the $\\beta$ equilibrium.\n  Results: Static calculations have been performed for a range of baryon\n(nucleon) number density ($n_b=0.04$--0.07 fm$^{-3}$) under the\n$\\beta$-equilibrium condition with and without superfluidity, for various\ninter-slab spacings. From a dynamic response to an external potential, we\nextract the collective mass of a slab and that of protons immersed in neutron\nsuperfluid.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we have developed AVIDa-hIL6, a large-scale dataset for predicting\nantigen-antibody interactions in the variable domain of heavy chain of heavy\nchain antibodies (VHHs), produced from an alpaca immunized with the human\ninterleukin-6 (IL-6) protein, as antigens. By leveraging the simple structure\nof VHHs, which facilitates identification of full-length amino acid sequences\nby DNA sequencing technology, AVIDa-hIL6 contains 573,891 antigen-VHH pairs\nwith amino acid sequences.

Here we\nshow control and single-shot readout of qudits with up to 13 computational\nstates, using protocols which can be extended directly to manipulate qudits of\nup to 25 levels in our chosen information host, $^{137}\\text{Ba}^{+}$. This\nrepresents more than twice as many computational states per qudit compared with\nprior work in trapped ions. In addition to the preparation and readout\nprotocols we demonstrate, universal quantum computation requires other quantum\nlogic primitives such as entangling gates.

Previous studies have documented evidence of functional\nlocalization in the brain, with different anatomical regions preferentially\nactivating for different types of sensory input. Many such localized structures\nare known, including the fusiform face area and parahippocampal place area.\nThis raises the question of whether additional brain regions (or conjunctions\nof brain regions) are also specialized for other important semantic concepts.\nTo identify such brain regions, we developed a data-driven approach to uncover\nvisual concepts that are decodable from a massive functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI) dataset. Our analysis is broadly split into three sections.\nFirst, a fully connected neural network is trained to map brain responses to\nthe outputs of an image-language foundation model, CLIP (Radford et al., 2021).\nSubsequently, a contrastive-learning dimensionality reduction method reveals\nthe brain-decodable components of CLIP space. In the final section of our\nanalysis, we localize shared decodable concepts in the brain using a\nvoxel-masking optimization method to produce a shared decodable concept (SDC)\nspace.

To achieve this, there are four\nproperties that a watch time prediction framework should satisfy: first,\ndespite its continuous value, watch time is also an ordinal variable and the\nrelative ordering between its values reflects the differences in user\npreferences. Therefore the ordinal relations should be reflected in watch time\npredictions. Second, the conditional dependence between the video-watching\nbehaviors should be captured in the model. For instance, one has to watch half\nof the video before he/she finishes watching the whole video. Third, modeling\nwatch time with a point estimation ignores the fact that models might give\nresults with high uncertainty and this could cause bad cases in recommender\nsystems. Therefore the framework should be aware of prediction uncertainty.\nForth, the real-life recommender systems suffer from severe bias amplifications\nthus an estimation without bias amplification is expected. Therefore we propose\nTPM for watch time prediction. Specifically, the ordinal ranks of watch time\nare introduced into TPM and the problem is decomposed into a series of\nconditional dependent classification tasks which are organized into a tree\nstructure. The expectation of watch time can be generated by traversing the\ntree and the variance of watch time predictions is explicitly introduced into\nthe objective function as a measurement for uncertainty.

Existing works aiming at addressing\nthis problem are usually based on global variance reduction, which requires a\nsubstantial amount of additional memory in a multiplicative factor equal to the\ntotal number of clients. An important open problem is to find a lightweight\nmethod for FL in the presence of clients with unknown participation rates. In\nthis paper, we address this problem by adapting the aggregation weights in\nfederated averaging (FedAvg) based on the participation history of each client.\nWe first show that, with heterogeneous participation probabilities, FedAvg with\nnon-optimal aggregation weights can diverge from the optimal solution of the\noriginal FL objective, indicating the need of finding optimal aggregation\nweights. However, it is difficult to compute the optimal weights when the\nparticipation probabilities are unknown. To address this problem, we present a\nnew algorithm called FedAU, which improves FedAvg by adaptively weighting the\nclient updates based on online estimates of the optimal weights without knowing\nthe probabilities of client participation. We provide a theoretical convergence\nanalysis of FedAU using a novel methodology to connect the estimation error and\nconvergence. Our theoretical results reveal important and interesting insights,\nwhile showing that FedAU converges to an optimal solution of the original\nobjective and has desirable properties such as linear speedup.

We\npropose an intent-aware FAQ retrieval system consisting of (1) an intent\nclassifier that predicts when a user's information need can be answered by an\nFAQ; (2) a reformulation model that rewrites a query into a natural question.\nOffline evaluation demonstrates that our approach improves Hit@1 by 13% on\nretrieving ground-truth FAQs, while reducing latency by 95% compared to\nbaseline systems. These improvements are further validated by real user\nfeedback, where 71% of displayed FAQs on top of product search results received\nexplicit positive user feedback. Overall, our findings show promising\ndirections for integrating FAQ retrieval into product search at scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 05:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

This study aims to predict the network traffic volume demand using\ndeep sequence methods that incorporate Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) based\nnoise reduction, Empirical rule based outlier detection, and $K$-Nearest\nNeighbour (KNN) based outlier mitigation. In contrast to the former studies,\nthe proposed model does not rely on a particular EMD decomposed component\ncalled Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) for signal denoising. In our proposed\ntraffic prediction model, we used an average of all IMFs components for signal\ndenoising. Moreover, the abnormal data points are replaced by $K$ nearest data\npoints average, and the value for $K$ has been optimized based on the KNN\nregressor prediction error measured in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Finally,\nwe selected the best time-lagged feature subset for our prediction model based\non AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Akaike Information\nCriterion (AIC) value.

Existing methods\noften underperform on complex and long videos in real world, primarily due to\ntwo factors. Firstly, offline methods are limited by the tightly-coupled\nmodeling paradigm, which treats all frames equally and disregards the\ninterdependencies between adjacent frames. Consequently, this leads to the\nintroduction of excessive noise during long-term temporal alignment. Secondly,\nonline methods suffer from inadequate utilization of temporal information. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose a decoupling strategy for VIS by dividing\nit into three independent sub-tasks: segmentation, tracking, and refinement.\nThe efficacy of the decoupling strategy relies on two crucial elements: 1)\nattaining precise long-term alignment outcomes via frame-by-frame association\nduring tracking, and 2) the effective utilization of temporal information\npredicated on the aforementioned accurate alignment outcomes during refinement.\nWe introduce a novel referring tracker and temporal refiner to construct the\n\\textbf{D}ecoupled \\textbf{VIS} framework (\\textbf{DVIS}). DVIS achieves new\nSOTA performance in both VIS and VPS, surpassing the current SOTA methods by\n7.3 AP and 9.6 VPQ on the OVIS and VIPSeg datasets, which are the most\nchallenging and realistic benchmarks. Moreover, thanks to the decoupling\nstrategy, the referring tracker and temporal refiner are super light-weight\n(only 1.69\\% of the segmenter FLOPs), allowing for efficient training and\ninference on a single GPU with 11G memory.

However, in\nmany scenarios involving the interaction between light and matter, the exchange\nof linear or angular momentum between electrons and photons is not feasible, a\ncondition known as the dipole-approximation limit. An example of a case beyond\nthis limit that has remained experimentally elusive is when the interplay\nbetween chiral electrons and vortex light is considered, where the orbital\nangular momentum of light can be transferred to electrons. Here, we present a\nnovel mechanism for such an orbital angular momentum transfer from optical\nvortex beams to electronic quantum Hall states.

Additional heating of the corona associated with Alfv\\'en\nwaves or other MHD turbulence, which has been the foundation of many earlier\nmodels, is neglected. For this simplified model a sufficient condition for\ninterchange reconnection to overcome gravity to drive the wind is derived.

However, while enhancing the robustness, the clean accuracy will\ndecline to a certain extent, implying a trade-off existed between the accuracy\nand robustness. In this paper, we firstly empirically find an obvious\ndistinction between standard and robust models in the filters' weight\ndistribution of the same architecture, and then theoretically explain this\nphenomenon in terms of the gradient regularization, which shows this difference\nis an intrinsic property for DNNs, and thus a static network architecture is\ndifficult to improve the accuracy and robustness at the same time. Secondly,\nbased on this observation, we propose a sample-wise dynamic network\narchitecture named Adversarial Weight-Varied Network (AW-Net), which focuses on\ndealing with clean and adversarial examples with a ``divide and rule\" weight\nstrategy. The AW-Net dynamically adjusts network's weights based on regulation\nsignals generated by an adversarial detector, which is directly influenced by\nthe input sample. Benefiting from the dynamic network architecture, clean and\nadversarial examples can be processed with different network weights, which\nprovides the potentiality to enhance the accuracy and robustness\nsimultaneously. A series of experiments demonstrate that our AW-Net is\narchitecture-friendly to handle both clean and adversarial examples and can\nachieve better trade-off performance than state-of-the-art robust models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 06:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Here, we show an alternative way to enable multi-mode lasing in\nplasmonic nanoparticle arrays. We design a supercell in a square lattice by\nleaving part of the lattice sites empty.

This assumption is\noften violated in practice. Existing methods partly address this issue through\nfeature imputation. However, these techniques (i) assume uniformity of feature\nset across nodes, (ii) are transductive by nature, and (iii) fail to work when\nfeatures are added or removed over time. In this work, we address these\nlimitations through a novel GNN framework called GRAFENNE. GRAFENNE performs a\nnovel allotropic transformation on the original graph, wherein the nodes and\nfeatures are decoupled through a bipartite encoding. Through a carefully chosen\nmessage passing framework on the allotropic transformation, we make the model\nparameter size independent of the number of features and thereby inductive to\nboth unseen nodes and features. We prove that GRAFENNE is at least as\nexpressive as any of the existing message-passing GNNs in terms of\nWeisfeiler-Leman tests, and therefore, the additional inductivity to unseen\nfeatures does not come at the cost of expressivity. In addition, as\ndemonstrated over four real-world graphs, GRAFENNE empowers the underlying GNN\nwith high empirical efficacy and the ability to learn in continual fashion over\nstreaming feature sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 07:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

This disappearance is taken as the\nhigh-energy input for the dispersion relation, which must be obeyed by the\nwidth difference between two meson mass eigenstates. The solution to the\ndispersion relation at low energy, i.e., in the symmetry broken phase, then\nconnects the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements to the quark\nmasses involved in the box diagrams responsible for meson mixing. It is\ndemonstrated via the analysis of the $D$ meson mixing that the typical $d$, $s$\nand $b$ quark masses demand the CKM matrix elements in agreement with measured\nvalues. In particular, the known numerical relation $V_{us}\\approx\n\\sqrt{m_s/m_b}$ with the $s$ ($b$) quark mass $m_s$ ($m_b$) can be derived\nanalytically from our solution. Next we apply the same formalism to the mixing\nof the $\\mu^- e^+$ and $\\mu^+ e^-$ states through similar box diagrams with\nintermediate neutrino channels. It is shown that the neutrino masses in the\nnormal hierarchy (NH), instead of in the inverted hierarchy or quasi-degenerate\nspectrum, match the observed Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix elements.\nThe lepton mixing angles larger than the quark ones are explained by means of\nthe inequality $m_2^2/m_3^2\\gg m_s^2/m_b^2$, $m_{2,3}$ being the neutrino\nmasses in the NH. At last, the solution for the $\\tau^-e^+$-$\\tau^+e^-$ mixing\nspecifies the mixing angle $\\theta_{23}\\approx 45^\\circ$ with slight preference\nfor the first octant.

Current PnP schemes rely on data-fidelity\nterms that have either Lipschitz gradients or closed-form proximal operators,\nwhich is not applicable to Poisson inverse problems. Based on the observation\nthat the Gaussian noise is not the adequate noise model in this setting, we\npropose to generalize PnP using theBregman Proximal Gradient (BPG) method. BPG\nreplaces the Euclidean distance with a Bregman divergence that can better\ncapture the smoothness properties of the problem.

State variables of such systems often\nexhibit aperiodic fluctuations, either chaotic or stochastic in nature. Often,\nthe parameters describing a system vary with time, showing time dependency.\nConstrained by these effects, it becomes difficult to be warned of an impending\ncritical transition, as such effects contaminate the precursory signals of the\ntransition. Therefore, a need for efficient and reliable early-warning signals\n(EWS) in such complex systems is in pressing demand. Motivated by this fact, in\nthe present work, we analyze various EWS in the context of a non-autonomous\nturbulent thermoacoustic system. In particular, we investigate the efficacy of\ndifferent EWS in forecasting the onset of thermoacoustic instability (TAI) and\ntheir reliability with respect to the rate of change of the control parameter.\nWe consider the Reynolds number (Re) as the control parameter, which is varied\nlinearly with time at finite rates. The considered EWS are derived from\ncritical slowing down, spectral properties, and fractal characteristics of the\nsystem variables. The state of TAI is associated with large amplitude acoustic\npressure oscillations that could lead thermoacoustic systems to break down. Our\nanalysis shows that irrespective of the rate of variation of the control\nparameter, the Hurst exponent and variance of autocorrelation coefficients warn\nof an impending transition well in advance and are more reliable than other EWS\nmeasures. We also investigate the variation of amplitudes of the most\nsignificant modes of acoustic pressure oscillations with the Hurst exponent.\nSuch variations lead to scaling laws which could be significant in prediction\nand devising control actions to mitigate TAI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 08:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

In DPQA, atomic qubits\nare selectively loaded into arrays of optical traps that can be reconfigured\nduring the computation itself. Leveraging qubit transport and parallel,\nentangling quantum operations, different pairs of qubits, even those initially\nfar away, can be entangled at different stages of the quantum program\nexecution. Such reconfigurability and non-local connectivity present new\nchallenges for compilation, especially in the layout synthesis step which\nplaces and routes the qubits and schedules the gates. In this paper, we\nconsider a DPQA architecture that contains multiple arrays and supports 2D\narray movements, representing cutting-edge experimental platforms. Within this\narchitecture, we discretize the state space and formulate layout synthesis as a\nsatisfactory modulo theories problem, which can be solved by existing solvers\noptimally in terms of circuit depth. For a set of benchmark circuits generated\nby random graphs with complex connectivities, our compiler OLSQ-DPQA reduces\nthe number of two-qubit entangling gates on small problem instances by 1.7x\ncompared to optimal compilation results on a fixed planar architecture. To\nfurther improve scalability and practicality of the method, we introduce a\ngreedy heuristic inspired by the iterative peeling approach in classical\nintegrated circuit routing. Using a hybrid approach that combined the greedy\nand optimal methods, we demonstrate that our DPQA-based compiled circuits\nfeature reduced scaling overhead compared to a grid fixed architecture,\nresulting in 5.1X less two-qubit gates for 90 qubit quantum circuits.

The\nrecently proposed deep-learning-based approaches could somehow alleviate the\nproblem but there is still a long way to go in obtaining an industrial-class\nanomaly detector for real-world applications. On the other hand, in some\nparticular AD tasks, a few anomalous samples are labeled manually for achieving\nhigher accuracy. However, this performance gain is at the cost of considerable\nannotation efforts, which can be intractable in many practical scenarios.\n  In this work, the above two problems are addressed in a unified framework.\nFirstly, inspired by the success of the patch-matching-based AD algorithms, we\ntrain a sliding vision transformer over the residuals generated by a novel\nposition-constrained patch-matching. Secondly, the conventional pixel-wise\nsegmentation problem is cast into a block-wise classification problem. Thus the\nsliding transformer can attain even higher accuracy with much less annotation\nlabor. Thirdly, to further reduce the labeling cost, we propose to label the\nanomalous regions using only bounding boxes. The unlabeled regions caused by\nthe weak labels are effectively exploited using a highly-customized\nsemi-supervised learning scheme equipped with two novel data augmentation\nmethods.

To explore the impact of\nsubstructure interactions on graph representations, we propose a novel\nframework called subgraph network-based contrastive learning (SGNCL).

However, previous works usually encode speech\ninto latent using audio codec and use autoregressive language models or\ndiffusion models to generate it, which ignores the intrinsic nature of speech\nand may lead to inferior or uncontrollable results. We argue that speech can be\ndecomposed into several attributes (e.g., content, timbre, prosody, and phase)\nand each of them should be modeled using a module with appropriate inductive\nbiases. From this perspective, we carefully design a novel and large zero-shot\nTTS system called Mega-TTS, which is trained with large-scale wild data and\nmodels different attributes in different ways: 1) Instead of using latent\nencoded by audio codec as the intermediate feature, we still choose spectrogram\nas it separates the phase and other attributes very well. Phase can be\nappropriately constructed by the GAN-based vocoder and does not need to be\nmodeled by the language model. 2) We model the timbre using global vectors\nsince timbre is a global attribute that changes slowly over time. 3) We further\nuse a VQGAN-based acoustic model to generate the spectrogram and a latent code\nlanguage model to fit the distribution of prosody, since prosody changes\nquickly over time in a sentence, and language models can capture both local and\nlong-range dependencies. We scale Mega-TTS to multi-domain datasets with 20K\nhours of speech and evaluate its performance on unseen speakers. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that Mega-TTS surpasses state-of-the-art TTS systems on\nzero-shot TTS, speech editing, and cross-lingual TTS tasks, with superior\nnaturalness, robustness, and speaker similarity due to the proper inductive\nbias of each module.

To preserve the model\nperformance across multiple testing domains, this work proposes the\nCurriculum-based Augmented Fourier Domain Adaptation (Curri-AFDA) for robust\nmedical image segmentation. In particular, our curriculum learning strategy is\nbased on the causal relationship of a model under different levels of data\nshift in the deployment phase, where the higher the shift is, the harder to\nrecognize the variance. Considering this, we progressively introduce more\namplitude information from the target domain to the source domain in the\nfrequency space during the curriculum-style training to smoothly schedule the\nsemantic knowledge transfer in an easier-to-harder manner.

Existing studies on SSB mainly employ sample re-weighting\ntechniques which suffer from high variance and poor model calibration.

In this paper we investigate several adaptions\nthat try to account for these differences between the observed behaviour and\nthe simple power-law model. Firstly, we propose to include an additional term\nthat models the quasi-periodic spin-down variations known to be present in many\npulsars.

Its novel architecture allows\nBackpropTools to be used seamlessly on a heterogeneous set of platforms, from\nHPC clusters over workstations and laptops to smartphones, smartwatches, and\nmicrocontrollers. Specifically, due to the tight integration of the RL\nalgorithms with simulation environments, BackpropTools can solve popular RL\nproblems like the Pendulum-v1 swing-up about 7 to 15 times faster in terms of\nwall-clock training time compared to other popular RL frameworks when using\nTD3.

It divides each epoch into one Key-Block and multiple Micro-Blocks,\neffectively improving transaction processing capacity. Bitcoin-NG adopts a\nspecial incentive mechanism (i.e., the transaction fees in each epoch are split\nto the current and next leader) to maintain its security. However, there are\nsome limitations to the existing incentive analysis of Bitcoin-NG in recent\nworks. First, the incentive division method of Bitcoin-NG only includes some\nspecific mining attack strategies of adversary, while ignoring more stubborn\nattack strategies. Second, once adversaries find a whale transaction, they will\ndeviate from honest mining strategy to obtain extra reward. In this paper, we\nare committed to solving these two limitations. First, we propose a novel\nmining strategy named Greedy-Mine attack. Then, we formulate a Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP) model to analyze the competition of honest miners and\nadversaries. Furthermore, we analysis the extra reward of adversaries and\nsummarize the mining power proportion range required for malicious adversaries\nto launch Greedy-Mine to obtain extra returns. Finally, we make a\nbackward-compatibility progressive modification to Bitcoin-NG protocol that\nwould raise the threshold of propagation factor from 0 to 1. Meanwhile, we get\nthe winning condition of adversaries when adopting Greedy-Mine, compared with\nhonest mining. Simulation and experimental results indicate that Bitcoin-NG is\nnot incentive compatible, which is vulnerable to Greedy-Mine attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 09:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

However, motivated primarily\nby privacy and computational constraints, the fact that data may change,\ndistributions drift, or even tasks advance individually on clients, is seldom\ntaken into account. The field of continual learning addresses this separate\nchallenge and first steps have recently been taken to leverage synergies in\ndistributed supervised settings, in which several clients learn to solve\nchanging classification tasks over time without forgetting previously seen\nones. Motivated by these prior works, we posit that such federated continual\nlearning should be grounded in unsupervised learning of representations that\nare shared across clients; in the loose spirit of how humans can indirectly\nleverage others' experience without exposure to a specific task. For this\npurpose, we demonstrate that masked autoencoders for distribution estimation\nare particularly amenable to this setup.

It comes with the vulnerability of being accessed by\nthird parties. Security is one of the major hurdles in the cloud server for the\nuser when the user data that reside in local storage is outsourced to the\ncloud. It has given rise to security concerns involved in data confidentiality\neven after the deletion of data from cloud storage. Though, it raises a serious\nproblem when the encrypted data needs to be shared with more people than the\ndata owner initially designated. However, searching on encrypted data is a\nfundamental issue in cloud storage. The method of searching over encrypted data\nrepresents a significant challenge in the cloud.\n  Searchable encryption allows a cloud server to conduct a search over\nencrypted data on behalf of the data users without learning the underlying\nplaintexts. While many academic SE schemes show provable security, they usually\nexpose some query information, making them less practical, weak in usability,\nand challenging to deploy. Also, sharing encrypted data with other authorized\nusers must provide each document's secret key. However, this way has many\nlimitations due to the difficulty of key management and distribution.\n  We have designed the system using the existing cryptographic approaches,\nensuring the search on encrypted data over the cloud. The primary focus of our\nproposed model is to ensure user privacy and security through a less\ncomputationally intensive, user-friendly system with a trusted third party\nentity. To demonstrate our proposed model, we have implemented a web\napplication called CryptoSearch as an overlay system on top of a well-known\ncloud storage domain. It exhibits secure search on encrypted data with no\ncompromise to the user-friendliness and the scheme's functional performance in\nreal-world applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 09:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

In many cases it is\nof interest to increase the connectivity of disparate groups so as to, e.g.,\nminimize social friction, or expose individuals to diverse viewpoints. A\ncommonly-used mechanism for increasing the network connectivity is to add edge\nshortcuts between pairs of nodes. In many applications of interest, edge\nshortcuts typically translate to recommendations, e.g., what video to watch, or\nwhat news article to read next. The problem of reducing structural bias or\nsegregation via edge shortcuts has recently been studied in the literature, and\nrandom walks have been an essential tool for modeling navigation and\nconnectivity in the underlying networks. Existing methods, however, either do\nnot offer approximation guarantees, or engineer the objective so that it\nsatisfies certain desirable properties that simplify the optimization~task. In\nthis paper we address the problem of adding a given number of shortcut edges in\nthe network so as to directly minimize the average hitting time and the maximum\nhitting time between two disparate groups. Our algorithm for minimizing average\nhitting time is a greedy bicriteria that relies on supermodularity. In\ncontrast, maximum hitting time is not supermodular.

The analysis starts\nwith modeling the electricity demand. The model uses Elexon electricity\nsettlement profiles, and assembles them into the demand profile according to\nthe quantity and types of buildings in Oxford. Then, solar generation is\nmodeled using Pfenninger and Staffell's method. Solar photovoltaic and lithium\nstorage systems are sized using a hybridized analytical and iterative method.\nFirst, the method calculates the solar system size search range, then iterates\nthrough the range. At each solar size, the method calculates and iterates\nthrough the storage system size search range. Within each iteration, the\nrenewable system is simulated using demand and generation data with a\nsimplified system set-up and the conventional operation strategy. The method\noutputs combinations of solar system capacity, storage system capacity, and\ngrid electricity import. Each combination's levelized cost of electricity is\ncalculated, and the lowest cost combination is the optimal sizing. Solar and\nstorage system costs are projected from 2019 to 2100, and the optimal sizing is\ncalculated for each year. The result shows that solar photovoltaic is\neconomically competitive, but lithium storage cost is still too high.

For fission, an observer may have multiple futures, whereas for\ndivergence they always have a single future. Divergence was explicitly\nintroduced to resolve the problem of pre-measurement uncertainty for Everettian\ntheory, which is universally believed to be absent for fission. Here, I\nmaintain that there is indeed uncertainty about future observations prior to\nfission, so long as objective probability is a property of Everettian branches.\nThis is made possible if the universe is a set and branches are subsets with\nprobability measure.

The incomplete\ndepth map with missing values burdens many downstream vision tasks, and a\nrising number of depth completion methods have been proposed to alleviate this\nissue. While most existing methods can generate accurate dense depth maps from\nsparse and uniformly sampled depth maps, they are not suitable for\ncomplementing large contiguous regions of missing depth values, which is common\nand critical in images captured in indoor environments. To overcome these\nchallenges, we design a novel two-branch end-to-end fusion network named\nRDFC-GAN, which takes a pair of RGB and incomplete depth images as input to\npredict a dense and completed depth map. The first branch employs an\nencoder-decoder structure, by adhering to the Manhattan world assumption and\nutilizing normal maps from RGB-D information as guidance, to regress the local\ndense depth values from the raw depth map. In the other branch, we propose an\nRGB-depth fusion CycleGAN to transfer the RGB image to the fine-grained\ntextured depth map. We adopt adaptive fusion modules named W-AdaIN to propagate\nthe features across the two branches, and we append a confidence fusion head to\nfuse the two outputs of the branches for the final depth map. Extensive\nexperiments on NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D demonstrate that our proposed method\nclearly improves the depth completion performance, especially in a more\nrealistic setting of indoor environments, with the help of our proposed pseudo\ndepth maps in training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 11:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Complete and partial sketch\nregression estimates can be constructed using information from only the\nsketched data set or a combination of the full and sketched data sets. Previous\nwork has obtained the distribution of these estimators under repeated\nsketching, along with the first two moments for both estimators. Using a\ndifferent approach, we also derive the distribution of the complete sketch\nestimator, but additionally consider the error term under both repeated\nsketching and sampling. Importantly, we obtain pivotal quantities which are\nbased solely on the sketched data set which specifically not requiring\ninformation from the full data model fit. These pivotal quantities can be used\nfor inference on the full data set regression estimates or the model\nparameters. For partial sketching, we derive pivotal quantities for a marginal\ntest and an approximate distribution for the partial sketch under repeated\nsketching or repeated sampling, again avoiding reliance on a full data model\nfit. We extend these results to include the Hadamard and Clarkson-Woodruff\nsketches then compare them in a simulation study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 11:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Much effort has been\ndevoted to designing various probes in order to understand what PLMs capture.\nBut few studies have delved into factors influencing PLM-based classifiers'\npredictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called\nCUE, which aims to interpret uncertainties inherent in the predictions of\nPLM-based models.

We then generate text\nrepresentations by perturbing the latent space which causes fluctuation in\npredictive uncertainty. By comparing the difference in predictive uncertainty\nbetween the perturbed and the original text representations, we are able to\nidentify the latent dimensions responsible for uncertainty and subsequently\ntrace back to the input features that contribute to such uncertainty.

However, previous works didn't\nconsider real-world adversaries and data distributions. To support our\nstatement, we define a new notion of strong adaptive adversaries that can\nsimultaneously adapt to multiple objectives and demonstrate through extensive\ntests, that existing defense methods can be circumvented in this adversary\nmodel.

We show that MESAS\noutperforms existing defenses in distinguishing backdoors from distortions\noriginating from different data distributions within and across the clients.\nOverall, MESAS is the first defense that is robust against strong adaptive\nadversaries and is effective in real-world data scenarios while introducing a\nlow overhead of 24.37s on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 11:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

However, a significant\nchallenge lies in the need of substantial human labels, which is costly and\ntime-consuming. Additionally, the expensive preference data obtained from prior\ntasks is not typically reusable for subsequent task learning, leading to\nextensive labeling for each new task. In this paper, we propose a novel\nzero-shot preference-based RL algorithm that leverages labeled preference data\nfrom source tasks to infer labels for target tasks, eliminating the requirement\nfor human queries. Our approach utilizes Gromov-Wasserstein distance to align\ntrajectory distributions between source and target tasks.

However, learning directly from inferred labels\nthat contains a fraction of noisy labels will result in an inaccurate reward\nfunction, subsequently affecting policy performance.

To show the validity of the proposed metric, we\nbuild up a large-scale benchmark with various degrees of semantic similarities\nbetween labeled/unlabeled datasets on ImageNet by leveraging its hierarchical\nclass structure. The results based on the proposed benchmark show that the\nproposed transfer flow is in line with the hierarchical class structure; and\nthat NCD performance is consistent with the semantic similarities (measured by\nthe proposed metric). Next, by using the proposed transfer flow, we conduct\nvarious empirical experiments with different levels of semantic similarity,\nyielding that supervised knowledge may hurt NCD performance. Specifically,\nusing supervised information from a low-similarity labeled set may lead to a\nsuboptimal result as compared to using pure self-supervised knowledge. These\nresults reveal the inadequacy of the existing NCD literature which usually\nassumes that supervised knowledge is beneficial. Finally, we develop a\npseudo-version of the transfer flow as a practical reference to decide if\nsupervised knowledge should be used in NCD. Its effectiveness is supported by\nour empirical studies, which show that the pseudo transfer flow (with or\nwithout supervised knowledge) is consistent with the corresponding accuracy\nbased on various datasets.

Joint analysis of humans' multi-modal sarcasm, sentiment, and\nemotion is an important yet challenging topic, as it is a complex cognitive\nprocess involving both cross-modality interaction and cross-affection\ncorrelation. From the probability theory perspective, cross-affection\ncorrelation also means that the judgments on sarcasm, sentiment, and emotion\nare incompatible. However, this exposed phenomenon cannot be sufficiently\nmodelled by classical probability theory due to its assumption of\ncompatibility.

These models learn a vector representation of knowledge graph\nentities and relations, a.k.a. knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). Learning\nversatile KGEs is desirable as it makes them useful for a broad range of tasks.\nHowever, KGEMs are usually trained for a specific task, which makes their\nembeddings task-dependent. In parallel, the widespread assumption that KGEMs\nactually create a semantic representation of the underlying entities and\nrelations (e.g., project similar entities closer than dissimilar ones) has been\nchallenged. In this work, we design heuristics for generating protographs --\nsmall, modified versions of a KG that leverage schema-based information. The\nlearnt protograph-based embeddings are meant to encapsulate the semantics of a\nKG, and can be leveraged in learning KGEs that, in turn, also better capture\nsemantics.

A recent\nanalysis of Auger and TA data exposed strong evidence for a correlation between\nUHECRs and nearby starburst galaxies, with a global significance post-trial of\n$4.7\\sigma$. Since these galaxies are in our cosmic backyard, the flux\nattenuation factor due to cosmic ray interactions en route to Earth turns out\nto be negligible. This implies that for each source, the shape of the observed\nspectrum should roughly match the emission spectrum, providing a unique testing\nground for the dark dimension hypothesis. Using Auger data, we carry out a\nmaximum likelihood analysis to characterize the shape of the UHECR emission\nfrom the galaxies dominating the anisotropy signal. We show that the observed\nspectra could be universal only if $\\lambda \\lesssim 10^{-3}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 13:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

The importance of these definitions is justified by three\nmajor reasons. First, the TEGR is a well established and widely accepted\nformulation of the gravitational field, whose basic field strength is the\ntorsion tensor of the Weitzenb\\\"ock connection. Second, in the phase space of\nthe TEGR there exists an algebra of the Poincar\\'e group. Not only the\ndefinitions of the gravitational energy-momentum and 4-angular momentum satisfy\nthis algebra, but also the first class constraints related to these definitions\nsatisfy the algebra. And third, innumerous applications of these definitions\nlead to physically consistent results. These definitions follow from a well\nestablished Hamiltonian formulation, and rely on the idea of localization of\nthe gravitational energy. In this review we revisit the concept of\nlocalizability of the gravitational energy, in light of results obtained in\nrecent years. We have studied the behaviour of free particles in the space-time\nof plane fronted gravitational waves (pp-waves). Free particles are here\nunderstood as particles that are not subject to external forces other than the\ngravitational acceleration due to pp-waves. Since these particles acquire or\nloose kinetic energy locally, the transfer of energy from or to the\ngravitational field must also be localized.

To take\nfull advantage of low power consumption and improve the efficiency of these\nmodels further, the pruning methods have been explored to find sparse SNNs\nwithout redundancy connections after training. However, parameter redundancy\nstill hinders the efficiency of SNNs during training. In the human brain, the\nrewiring process of neural networks is highly dynamic, while synaptic\nconnections maintain relatively sparse during brain development. Inspired by\nthis, here we propose an efficient evolutionary structure learning (ESL)\nframework for SNNs, named ESL-SNNs, to implement the sparse SNN training from\nscratch. The pruning and regeneration of synaptic connections in SNNs evolve\ndynamically during learning, yet keep the structural sparsity at a certain\nlevel. As a result, the ESL-SNNs can search for optimal sparse connectivity by\nexploring all possible parameters across time. Our experiments show that the\nproposed ESL-SNNs framework is able to learn SNNs with sparse structures\neffectively while reducing the limited accuracy. The ESL-SNNs achieve merely\n0.28% accuracy loss with 10% connection density on the DVS-Cifar10 dataset. Our\nwork presents a brand-new approach for sparse training of SNNs from scratch\nwith biologically plausible evolutionary mechanisms, closing the gap in the\nexpressibility between sparse training and dense training.

However, the graph isomorphism objective is inherently\nbinary, not giving insights into the degree of similarity between two given\ngraphs. This work resolves this issue by considering continuous extensions of\nboth $1$-WL and MPNNs to graphons. Concretely, we show that the continuous\nvariant of $1$-WL delivers an accurate topological characterization of the\nexpressive power of MPNNs on graphons, revealing which graphs these networks\ncan distinguish and the level of difficulty in separating them. We identify the\nfinest topology where MPNNs separate points and prove a universal approximation\ntheorem.

While there is evidence that noiseless Gaussian boson\nsampling is hard to efficiently simulate using a classical computer, the\ncurrent Gaussian boson sampling experiments inevitably suffer from loss and\nother noise models. Despite a high photon loss rate and the presence of noise,\nthey are currently claimed to be hard to classically simulate with the\nbest-known classical algorithm. In this work, we present a classical\ntensor-network algorithm that simulates Gaussian boson sampling and whose\ncomplexity can be significantly reduced when the photon loss rate is high. By\ngeneralizing the existing thermal-state approximation algorithm of lossy\nGaussian boson sampling, the proposed algorithm enables us to achieve increased\naccuracy as the running time of the algorithm scales, as opposed to the\nalgorithm that samples from the thermal state, which can give only a fixed\naccuracy. The generalization allows us to assess the computational power of\ncurrent lossy experiments even though their output state is not believed to be\nclose to a thermal state. We then simulate the largest Gaussian boson sampling\nimplemented in experiments so far. Much like the actual experiments,\nclassically verifying this large-scale simulation is challenging. To do this,\nwe first observe that in our smaller-scale simulations the total variation\ndistance, cross-entropy, and two-point correlation benchmarks all coincide.\nBased on this observation, we demonstrate for large-scale experiments that our\nsampler matches the ground-truth two-point and higher-order correlation\nfunctions better than the experiment does, exhibiting evidence that our sampler\ncan simulate the ground-truth distribution better than the experiment can.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 14:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

We benchmark the performance of the FNXL dataset by formulating the\ntask as (a) a sequence labelling problem and (b) a pipeline with span\nextraction followed by Extreme Classification. Although the two approaches\nperform comparably, the pipeline solution provides a slight edge for the least\nfrequent labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 14:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Currently, the speed/accuracy demands are usually only met by\nsymplectic integrators. For example, the most up-to-date long-term astronomical\nsolutions for the solar system in the past (widely used in, e.g.,\nastrochronology and high-precision geological dating) have been obtained using\nsymplectic integrators.

Polluted\nwhite dwarf stars offer a unique way to address this question as they provide\nmeasurements of the bulk compositions of exoplanetary material. We present a\nstatistical analysis of the rocks polluting oxygen-bearing white dwarfs and\ncompare their compositions to rocks in the Solar System. We find that the\nmajority of the extrasolar rocks are consistent with the composition of typical\nchondrites. Measurement uncertainties prevent distinguishing between chondrites\nand bulk Earth, but do permit detecting the differences between chondritic\ncompositions and basaltic or continental crust. We find no evidence of crust\namongst the polluted white dwarfs. We show that the chondritic nature of\nextrasolar rocks is also supported by the compositions of local stars. While\ngalactic chemical evolution results in variations in the relative abundances of\nrock-forming elements spatially and temporally on galaxy-wide scales, the\ncurrent sample of polluted white dwarfs are sufficiently young and close to\nEarth that they are not affected by this process. We conclude that exotic\ncompositions are not required to explain the majority of observed rock types\naround polluted white dwarfs, and that variations between exoplanetary\ncompositions in the stellar neighborhood are generally not due to significant\ndifferences in the initial composition of protoplanetary disks. Nonetheless,\nthere is evidence from stellar observations that planets formed in the first\nseveral billion years in the Galaxy have lower metal core fractions compared\nwith Earth on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 15:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Realistic 3D time-dependent simulations of stellar near-surface\nconvection employ the opacity binning method for efficient and accurate\ncomputation of the radiative energy exchange. The method provides several\norders of magnitude of speed-up, but its implementation includes a number of\nfree parameters. Aims. Our aim is to evaluate the accuracy of the opacity\nbinning method as a function of the choice of these free parameters. Methods.\nThe monochromatic opacities computed with the SYNSPEC code are used to\nconstruct opacity distribution function (ODF) that is then verified through\ndetailed comparison with the results of the ATLAS code. The opacity binning\nmethod is implemented with the SYNSPEC opacities for four representative cool\nmain-sequence stellar spectral types (F3V, G2V, K0V, and M2V). Results. The\nODFs from SYNSPEC and ATLAS show consistent results for the opacity and\nbolometric radiative energy exchange rate Q in case of the F, G, and K -- type\nstars. Significant differences, coming mainly from the molecular line lists,\nare found for the M -- type star. It is possible to optimise a small number of\nbins to reduce the deviation of the results coming from the opacity grouping\nwith respect to the ODF for the F, G, and K -- type stars. In the case of the M\n-- type star, the inclusion of splitting in wavelength is needed in the\ngrouping to get similar results, with a subsequent increase in computing time.\nIn the limit of a large number of bins, the deviation for all the binning\nconfigurations tested saturates and the results do not converge to the ODF\nsolution. Due to this saturation, the Q rate cannot be improved by increasing\nthe number of bins to more than about 20 bins. The more effective strategy is\nto select the optimal location of fewer bins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 15:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

This study describes the design and evaluation of a\nrealistic head phantom for pre-clinical implant-induced artefact testing in a\nrelevant environment. A case study is performed where a state-of-the-art\npiezoelectric bone conduction implant is used in the 1.5 T and 3 T MRI\nenvironments. Images were acquired using clinical and novel metal artefact\nreducing (MARS) sequences at both field strengths. Artefact width and length\nwere measured in a healthy volunteer and compared with artefact sizes obtained\nin the phantom. Artefact sizes are reported that are similar in shape between\nthe phantom and a volunteer, yet with dimensions differing up to 20% between\nboth. When the implant magnet is removed, the artefact size can be reduced\nbelow a diameter of 5 cm, whilst the presence of an implant magnet and splint\ncreates higher artefacts up to 20 cm in diameter. Pulse sequences have been\naltered to reduce the scan time up to 7 minutes, while preserving the image\nquality. These results show that the anthropomorphic phantom can be used at a\npreclinical stage to provide clinically relevant images, illustrating the\nimpact of the artefact on important brain structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 15:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

When conducting a meta-analysis, a\nconservative approach would be to combine only trials conducted in the\nbiomarker-positive subgroup.

We extend\nstandard random-effects meta-analysis to combine treatment effects obtained\nfrom trials with different populations to estimate pooled treatment effects in\na biomarker subgroup of interest.

This discovery supported the\nlong-held theory that object recognition is a core objective of the visual\ncortex, and suggested that more accurate DNNs would serve as better models of\nIT neuron responses to images. Since then, deep learning has undergone a\nrevolution of scale: billion parameter-scale DNNs trained on billions of images\nare rivaling or outperforming humans at visual tasks including object\nrecognition. Have today's DNNs become more accurate at predicting IT neuron\nresponses to images as they have grown more accurate at object recognition?\n  Surprisingly, across three independent experiments, we find this is not the\ncase. DNNs have become progressively worse models of IT as their accuracy has\nincreased on ImageNet. To understand why DNNs experience this trade-off and\nevaluate if they are still an appropriate paradigm for modeling the visual\nsystem, we turn to recordings of IT that capture spatially resolved maps of\nneuronal activity elicited by natural images.

In this paper, we\naddress these problems by enhancing the alignment of the unimodal features in\norder to aid feature fusion, as well as enhancing the alignment between the\ncameras' perspective view (PV) and BEV representations. We propose X-Align, a\nnovel end-to-end cross-modal and cross-view learning framework for BEV\nsegmentation consisting of the following components: (i) a novel Cross-Modal\nFeature Alignment (X-FA) loss, (ii) an attention-based Cross-Modal Feature\nFusion (X-FF) module to align multi-modal BEV features implicitly, and (iii) an\nauxiliary PV segmentation branch with Cross-View Segmentation Alignment (X-SA)\nlosses to improve the PV-to-BEV transformation. We evaluate our proposed method\nacross two commonly used benchmark datasets, i.e., nuScenes and KITTI-360.\nNotably, X-Align significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3 absolute\nmIoU points on nuScenes. We also provide extensive ablation studies to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the individual components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 15:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

How cognition arises from neural activity is a\ncentral open question in neuroscience, inextricable from the study of\nintelligence itself. A simple formal model of neural activity was proposed in\nPapadimitriou [2020] and has been subsequently shown, through both mathematical\nproofs and simulations, to be capable of implementing certain simple cognitive\noperations via the creation and manipulation of assemblies of neurons. However,\nmany intelligent behaviors rely on the ability to recognize, store, and\nmanipulate temporal sequences of stimuli (planning, language, navigation, to\nlist a few). Here we show that, in the same model, time can be captured\nnaturally as precedence through synaptic weights and plasticity, and, as a\nresult, a range of computations on sequences of assemblies can be carried out.\nIn particular, repeated presentation of a sequence of stimuli leads to the\nmemorization of the sequence through corresponding neural assemblies: upon\nfuture presentation of any stimulus in the sequence, the corresponding assembly\nand its subsequent ones will be activated, one after the other, until the end\nof the sequence. Finally, we show that any finite state machine can be learned\nin a similar way, through the presentation of appropriate patterns of\nsequences. Through an extension of this mechanism, the model can be shown to be\ncapable of universal computation. We support our analysis with a number of\nexperiments to probe the limits of learning in this model in key ways. Taken\ntogether, these results provide a concrete hypothesis for the basis of the\nbrain's remarkable abilities to compute and learn, with sequences playing a\nvital role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 15:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

A\nSymmetric High-Dimensional and Incomplete (SHDI) matrix can smoothly illustrate\nsuch an UWN, which contains rich knowledge like node interaction behaviors and\nlocal complexes. To extract desired knowledge from an SHDI matrix, an analysis\nmodel should carefully consider its symmetric-topology for describing an UWN's\nintrinsic symmetry. Representation learning to an UWN borrows the success of a\npyramid of symmetry-aware models like a Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix\nFactorization (SNMF) model whose objective function utilizes a sole Latent\nFactor (LF) matrix for representing SHDI's symmetry rigorously. However, they\nsuffer from the following drawbacks: 1) their computational complexity is high;\nand 2) their modeling strategy narrows their representation features, making\nthem suffer from low learning ability. Aiming at addressing above critical\nissues, this paper proposes a Multi-constrained Symmetric Nonnegative\nLatent-factor-analysis (MSNL) model with two-fold ideas: 1) introducing\nmulti-constraints composed of multiple LF matrices, i.e., inequality and\nequality ones into a data-density-oriented objective function for precisely\nrepresenting the intrinsic symmetry of an SHDI matrix with broadened feature\nspace; and 2) implementing an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM)-incorporated learning scheme for precisely solving such a\nmulti-constrained model.

The new data\nindicate that galaxy formation must have taken place much earlier than expected\nin this model. Another viable class of cosmological models is that of the\nso-called coasting models, in which the scale factor of the universe varies\nproportionately with time. In these models, the universe at redshift $z=12$ has\nample time ($\\sim 1070$ Myrs) for galaxy formation. The earliest such model is\nthe one proposed by E.A. Milne, based on his `kinematic relativity', but it is\nconsidered unrealistic for not treating gravity as relevant at cosmological\nscales. A closed version of an eternal coasting FLRW model was proposed by the\npresent authors even before SNe Ia data began to pour in. Subsequently we\ndeveloped a more general model of the same class, which is valid for all the\nthree possible geometries, with open, closed or flat spatial sections. In the\nnonrelativistic era, this model makes the falsifiable prediction that the ratio\nof matter density to dark energy density is 2. This avoids the cosmic\ncoincidence problem. Moreover, this eternal coasting model allows room for\ncreation of matter from dark energy, that may speed up galaxy and structure\nformation at the early epochs, as implied by the JWST data. The paper also\nattempts to review some similar coasting models, but emphasizes the eternal\ncoasting cosmology as the most probable candidate model capable of explaining\nthe presence of high redshift galaxies discovered by JWST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 18:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

To exploit the spatial information that the dense prediction\ntasks require but neglected by the existing self-supervised transformers, we\nintroduce point-level supervision across views in a novel token-based way.\nSpecifically, DenseDINO introduces some extra input tokens called reference\ntokens to match the point-level features with the position prior. With the\nreference token, the model could maintain spatial consistency and deal with\nmulti-object complex scene images, thus generalizing better on dense prediction\ntasks. Compared with the vanilla DINO, our approach obtains competitive\nperformance when evaluated on classification in ImageNet and achieves a large\nmargin (+7.2% mIoU) improvement in semantic segmentation on PascalVOC under the\nlinear probing protocol for segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 15:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

In conflict zones where freedom of\nexpression is constrained and information warfare is pervasive, social media\nhas emerged as an indispensable lifeline. Anonymous social media platforms, as\npublicly available sources for disseminating war-related information, have the\npotential to serve as effective instruments for monitoring and documenting\nHuman Rights Violations (HRV). Our research focuses on the analysis of data\nfrom Telegram, the leading social media platform for reading independent news\nin post-Soviet regions. We gathered a dataset of posts sampled from 95 public\nTelegram channels that cover politics and war news, which we have utilized to\nidentify potential occurrences of HRV. Employing a mBERT-based text classifier,\nwe have conducted an analysis to detect any mentions of HRV in the Telegram\ndata. Our final approach yielded an $F_2$ score of 0.71 for HRV detection,\nrepresenting an improvement of 0.38 over the multilingual BERT base model. We\nrelease two datasets that contains Telegram posts: (1) large corpus with over\n2.3 millions posts and (2) annotated at the sentence-level dataset to indicate\nHRVs. The Telegram posts are in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war. We posit\nthat our findings hold significant implications for NGOs, governments, and\nresearchers by providing a means to detect and document possible human rights\nviolations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2023 12:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

We explore existing research on FATE in AI, highlighting the benefits and\nlimitations of current solutions, and provide future research directions. We\nfound that statistical and intersectional fairness can support fairness in\nhealthcare on social media platforms, and transparency in AI is essential for\naccountability.
