This is\nparticularly apparent in their dynamics, where scaling relations display much\nregularity and little intrinsic scatter. However, the parameters responsible\nfor this simplicity have not been identified. Using the Spitzer Photometry &\nAccurate Rotation Curves galaxy catalogue, we argue that the radial\nacceleration relation (RAR) between galaxies' baryonic and total dynamical\naccelerations is the fundamental correlation governing the radial (in-disk)\ndynamics of late-type galaxies. In particular, we show that the RAR cannot be\ntightened by the inclusion of any other available galaxy property, that it is\nthe strongest projection of galaxies' radial dynamical parameter space, and\nthat all other statistical radial dynamical correlations stem from the RAR plus\nthe non-dynamical correlations present in our sample. We further provide\nevidence that the RAR's fundamentality is unique in that the second most\nsignificant dynamical relation does not possess any of these features. Our\nanalysis reveals the root cause of the correlations present in galaxies' radial\ndynamics: they are nothing but facets of the RAR. These results have important\nramifications for galaxy formation theory because they imply that to explain\nstatistically late-type galaxy dynamics within the disk it is necessary and\nsufficient to explain the RAR and lack of any significant, partially\nindependent correlation.

In this case, data can be naturally represented by\nan order-three tensor where the views are stacked. Given such a tensor, we\nconsider the estimation of the hidden clusters via performing a best rank-one\ntensor approximation. In order to study the theoretical performance of this\napproach, we characterize the behavior of this best rank-one approximation in\nterms of the alignments of the obtained component vectors with the hidden model\nparameter vectors, in the large-dimensional regime. In particular, we show that\nour theoretical results allow us to anticipate the exact accuracy of the\nproposed clustering approach.

Despite its potential, deriving generalizable knowledge from EHR data\nremains challenging. First, EHR data are generated as part of clinical care\nwith data elements too detailed and fragmented for research. Despite recent\nprogress in mapping EHR data to common ontology with hierarchical structures,\nmuch development is still needed to enable automatic grouping of local EHR\ncodes to meaningful clinical concepts at a large scale. Second, the total\nnumber of unique EHR features is large, imposing methodological challenges to\nderive reproducible knowledge graph, especially when interest lies in\nconditional dependency structure. Third, the detailed EHR data on a very large\npatient cohort imposes additional computational challenge to deriving a\nknowledge network. To overcome these challenges, we propose to infer the\nconditional dependency structure among EHR features via a latent graphical\nblock model (LGBM). The LGBM has a two layer structure with the first providing\nsemantic embedding vector (SEV) representation for the EHR features and the\nsecond overlaying a graphical block model on the latent SEVs. The block\nstructures on the graphical model also allows us to cluster synonymous features\nin EHR.

Integrated Gradients (IG) is an influential attribution\nmethod due to its strong axiomatic foundation. The algorithm is based on\nintegrating the gradients along a path from a reference image to the input\nimage. Unfortunately, it can be observed that gradients computed from regions\nwhere the output logit changes minimally along the path provide poor\nexplanations for the model decision, which is called the saturation effect\nproblem. In this paper, we propose an attribution algorithm called integrated\ndecision gradients (IDG). The algorithm focuses on integrating gradients from\nthe region of the path where the model makes its decision, i.e., the portion of\nthe path where the output logit rapidly transitions from zero to its final\nvalue. This is practically realized by scaling each gradient by the derivative\nof the output logit with respect to the path. The algorithm thereby provides a\nprincipled solution to the saturation problem. Additionally, we minimize the\nerrors within the Riemann sum approximation of the path integral by utilizing\nnon-uniform subdivisions determined by adaptive sampling.

Due to ultrasound's poor ability\nto capture information pertaining to the lateral direction, the existing\ndisplacement estimation techniques fail to generate an accurate lateral\ndisplacement or strain map. The attempts made in the literature to mitigate\nthis well-known issue suffer from one of the following limitations: 1) Sampling\nsize is substantially increased, rendering the method computationally and\nmemory expensive. 2) The lateral displacement estimation entirely depends on\nthe axial one, ignoring data fidelity and creating large errors.

Due to the heterogeneity of the map data and\ntrajectory data, many data-driven models for trajectory prediction and motion\nplanning extract vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-lane interactions in a\nseparate and sequential manner. However, such a manner may capture biased\ninterpretation of interactions, causing lower prediction and planning accuracy.\nMoreover, separate extraction leads to a complicated model structure and hence\nthe overall efficiency and scalability are sacrificed. To address the above\nissues, we propose an environment representation, Temporal Occupancy Flow Graph\n(TOFG). Specifically, the occupancy flow-based representation unifies the map\ninformation and vehicle trajectories into a homogeneous data format and enables\na consistent prediction. The temporal dependencies among vehicles can help\ncapture the change of occupancy flow timely to further promote model\nperformance. To demonstrate that TOFG is capable of simplifying the model\narchitecture, we incorporate TOFG with a simple graph attention (GAT) based\nneural network and propose TOFG-GAT, which can be used for both trajectory\nprediction and motion planning. Experiment results show that TOFG-GAT achieves\nbetter or competitive performance than all the SOTA baselines with less\ntraining time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 17:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

Recently, Diffsuion-QL significantly boosts the performance of\noffline RL by representing a policy with a diffusion model, whose success\nrelies on a parametrized Markov Chain with hundreds of steps for sampling.\nHowever, Diffusion-QL suffers from two critical limitations. 1) It is\ncomputationally inefficient to forward and backward through the whole Markov\nchain during training. 2) It is incompatible with maximum likelihood-based RL\nalgorithms (e.g., policy gradient methods) as the likelihood of diffusion\nmodels is intractable.

CLIP models are trained using contrastive loss,\nwhich typically relies on data augmentations to prevent overfitting and\nshortcuts. However, in the CLIP training paradigm, data augmentations are\nexclusively applied to image inputs, while language inputs remain unchanged\nthroughout the entire training process, limiting the exposure of diverse texts\nto the same image. In this paper, we introduce Language augmented CLIP\n(LaCLIP), a simple yet highly effective approach to enhance CLIP training\nthrough language rewrites. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of\nlarge language models, we rewrite the text descriptions associated with each\nimage. These rewritten texts exhibit diversity in sentence structure and\nvocabulary while preserving the original key concepts and meanings. During\ntraining, LaCLIP randomly selects either the original texts or the rewritten\nversions as text augmentations for each image. Extensive experiments on CC3M,\nCC12M, RedCaps and LAION-400M datasets show that CLIP pre-training with\nlanguage rewrites significantly improves the transfer performance without\ncomputation or memory overhead during training. Specifically for ImageNet\nzero-shot accuracy, LaCLIP outperforms CLIP by 8.2% on CC12M and 2.4% on\nLAION-400M.

In this work, we explore how to model\ncontacts in an explicit way to benefit the implicit reconstruction of hand-held\nobjects.

In the first part, we propose a new subtask of\ndirectly estimating 3D hand-object contacts from a single image. The part-level\nand vertex-level graph-based transformers are cascaded and jointly learned in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner for more accurate contact probabilities.

These phenomena are difficult to observe in\nconventional experiments because, in order to distinguish the effects of\nmeasurement from dephasing, it is necessary to post-select on sets of\nmeasurement outcomes whose Born probabilities are exponentially small in the\nnumber of measurements performed. An unconventional approach, which avoids this\nexponential `post-selection problem', is to construct cross-correlations\nbetween experimental data and the results of simulations on classical\ncomputers. However, these cross-correlations generally have no definite\nrelation to physical quantities. We first show how to incorporate shadow\ntomography into this framework, thereby allowing for the construction of\nquantum information-theoretic cross-correlations. We then identify\ncross-correlations which both upper and lower bound the measurement-averaged\nvon Neumann entanglement entropy. These bounds show that experiments can be\nperformed to constrain post-measurement entanglement without the need for\npost-selection. To illustrate our technique we consider how it could be used to\nobserve the measurement-induced entanglement transition in Haar-random quantum\ncircuits. We use exact numerical calculations as proxies for quantum\nsimulations and, to highlight the fundamental limitations of classical memory,\nwe construct cross-correlations with tensor-network calculations at finite bond\ndimension.

The axion couples\nnonlinearly to electric and magnetic fields and possesses a signature\ntopological magnetoelectric response, leading to a modified form of Maxwell's\nequations known as axion electrodynamics. Axions are naturally present in Weyl\nsemimetals relating to the separation of the Weyl nodes in energy and in\ncrystal momentum. In the presence of strong interactions, charge density-wave\n(CDW) order may develop which serves to gap the Weyl nodes and introduces\ncorresponding collective excitations. When the inherent chiral symmetry of Weyl\nsemimetals is spontaneously broken by the formation of CDW order, the resultant\nchiral condensate is endowed with intrinsic dynamics which yields a dynamical\ncontribution to the axion field. However, unambiguous identification of this\ndynamical axion mode is challenging due to its inherent nonlinear coupling to\nelectromagnetic fields. Therefore, we propose an all-optical protocol for\nverifying and characterizing dynamical axion collective modes in Weyl\nsemimetals with CDW order.

Then, the\ndecision maker is supposed to use the confidence value to calibrate how much to\ntrust the prediction. In this context, it has been often argued that the\nconfidence value should correspond to a well calibrated estimate of the\nprobability that the predicted label matches the ground truth label. However,\nmultiple lines of empirical evidence suggest that decision makers have\ndifficulties at developing a good sense on when to trust a prediction using\nthese confidence values. In this paper, our goal is first to understand why and\nthen investigate how to construct more useful confidence values. We first argue\nthat, for a broad class of utility functions, there exist data distributions\nfor which a rational decision maker is, in general, unlikely to discover the\noptimal decision policy using the above confidence values -- an optimal\ndecision maker would need to sometimes place more (less) trust on predictions\nwith lower (higher) confidence values. However, we then show that, if the\nconfidence values satisfy a natural alignment property with respect to the\ndecision maker's confidence on her own predictions, there always exists an\noptimal decision policy under which the level of trust the decision maker would\nneed to place on predictions is monotone on the confidence values, facilitating\nits discoverability. Further, we show that multicalibration with respect to the\ndecision maker's confidence on her own predictions is a sufficient condition\nfor alignment. Experiments on four different AI-assisted decision making tasks\nwhere a classifier provides decision support to real human experts validate our\ntheoretical results and suggest that alignment may lead to better decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 18:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

A\npotential avenue for this unseen accretion is an inflow in the volume-filling\nhot phase ($\\sim10^6$ K) of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), as suggested by\nsome cosmological simulations. We derive an approximate axisymmetric analytic\nsolution of such hot CGM accretion flows, and validate it with hydrodynamic\nsimulations. We show that a hot inflow spins up as it approaches the galaxy,\nwhile remaining hot, subsonic and quasi-spherical. At the radius of angular\nmomentum support ($\\approx15$ kpc for the Milky-Way) the hot flow flattens into\na disk geometry and then cools from $\\sim10^6$ K to $\\sim10^4$ K at the\ndisk-halo interface. Cooling affects all hot gas, rather than just a subset of\nindividual gas clouds, implying that accretion via hot inflows does not rely on\nlocal thermal instability in contrast with 'precipitation' models for galaxy\naccretion. Prior to cooling and accretion the inflow completes $\\sim t_{\\rm\ncool}/t_{\\rm ff}$ radians of rotation, where $t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff}$ is the\ncooling time to free-fall time ratio in hot gas immediately outside the galaxy.\nThe ratio $t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff}$ may thus govern the development of\nturbulence and enhancement of magnetic fields in gas accreting onto\nlow-redshift spirals. We argue that accretion via hot inflows can explain the\nobserved truncation of nearby thin stellar disks at $\\approx4$ disk radii. We\nalso show that if rotating hot inflows are common in Milky-Way size disk\ngalaxies, as predicted, then signatures should be observable with X-ray\ntelescopes, kinetic SZ measurements, and FRB surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 18:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

While some approaches\nutilize texts to control music audio generation, editing musical elements in\ngenerated audio is challenging for users. In contrast, symbolic music offers\nease of editing, making it more accessible for users to manipulate specific\nmusical elements. In this paper, we propose MuseCoco, which generates symbolic\nmusic from text descriptions with musical attributes as the bridge to break\ndown the task into text-to-attribute understanding and attribute-to-music\ngeneration stages. MuseCoCo stands for Music Composition Copilot that empowers\nmusicians to generate music directly from given text descriptions, offering a\nsignificant improvement in efficiency compared to creating music entirely from\nscratch. The system has two main advantages: Firstly, it is data efficient. In\nthe attribute-to-music generation stage, the attributes can be directly\nextracted from music sequences, making the model training self-supervised. In\nthe text-to-attribute understanding stage, the text is synthesized and refined\nby ChatGPT based on the defined attribute templates. Secondly, the system can\nachieve precise control with specific attributes in text descriptions and\noffers multiple control options through attribute-conditioned or\ntext-conditioned approaches. MuseCoco outperforms baseline systems in terms of\nmusicality, controllability, and overall score by at least 1.27, 1.08, and 1.32\nrespectively. Besides, there is a notable enhancement of about 20% in objective\ncontrol accuracy. In addition, we have developed a robust large-scale model\nwith 1.2 billion parameters, showcasing exceptional controllability and\nmusicality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 18:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

However, it suffers from two serious defects: 1) the predefined\norder introduces a wrong bias during training, which highly penalizes shifts in\nthe order between rows; 2) the error propagation problem becomes serious when\nthe model outputs a long token sequence.

Our ultimate aims are to reconstruct the HRT data by\ndeconvolving with the HRT point spread function (PSF) and to correct for the\neffects of optical aberrations on the data. We use a pair of focused--defocused\nimages to compute the wavefront error and derive the PSF of HRT by means of a\nphase diversity (PD) analysis. The wavefront error of HRT depends on the\norbital distance of SO to the Sun. At distances $>0.5$\\,au, the wavefront error\nis small, and stems dominantly from the inherent optical properties of HRT. At\ndistances $<0.5$\\,au, the thermo-optical effect of the Heat Rejection Entrance\nWindow (HREW) becomes noticeable. We develop an interpolation scheme for the\nwavefront error that depends on the thermal variation of the HREW with the\ndistance of SO to the Sun. We also introduce a new level of image\nreconstruction, termed `aberration correction', which is designed to reduce the\nnoise caused by image deconvolution while removing the aberrations caused by\nthe HREW. The computed PSF via phase diversity significantly reduces the\ndegradation caused by the HREW in the near-perihelion HRT data. In addition,\nthe aberration correction increases the noise by a factor of only $1.45$\ncompared to the factor of $3$ increase that results from the usual PD\nreconstructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 20:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

The crucial challenge lies in the nature of\nsequentially-revealed online item information, based on which we make\nirreversible matching decisions at each step. While numerous expert online\nalgorithms have been proposed with bounded worst-case competitive ratios, they\nmay not offer satisfactory performance in average cases. On the other hand,\nreinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to improve the average\nperformance, but it lacks robustness and can perform arbitrarily poorly. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel RL-based approach to edge-weighted online\nbipartite matching with robustness guarantees (LOMAR), achieving both good\naverage-case and worst-case performance. The key novelty of LOMAR is a new\nonline switching operation which, based on a judicious condition to hedge\nagainst future uncertainties, decides whether to follow the expert's decision\nor the RL decision for each online item.

This leads to a specific\nprediction about the waveform of gravitational waves, which they emit during a\nbinary black hole inspiral and to the vanishing of their Love numbers. However,\nif astrophysical black holes do possess an internal structure, their Love\nnumbers would no longer vanish, and they could be excited during an inspiral by\nthe transfer of orbital energy. This would affect the orbital period and lead\nto an observable imprint on the emitted gravitational waves waveform. The\neffect is enhanced if one of the binary companions is resonantly excited. We\ndiscuss the conditions for resonant excitation of a hypothetical internal\nstructure of black holes and calculate the phase change of the gravitational\nwaves waveform that is induced due to such resonant excitation during\nintermediate- and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. We then relate the phase change\nto the electric quadrupolar Love number of the larger companion, which is\nresonantly excited by its smaller companion. We discuss the statistical error\non measuring the Love number by LISA and show that, because of this phase\nchange, the statistical error is small even for small values of the Love\nnumber. Our results provide a strong indication that the Love number could be\ndetected by LISA with remarkable accuracy, much higher than what can be\nachieved via tidal deformation effects. Our results further indicate that\nresonant excitation of the central black hole during an extreme- or\nintermediate-mass-ratio inspirals is the most promising effect for putting\nbounds on, or detecting, non-vanishing tidal Love numbers of black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 20:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

For example, a linear probe\ntrained on $20\\%$ of randomly picked neurons from a ResNet50 pre-trained on\nImageNet1k achieves an accuracy within $5\\%$ of a linear probe trained on the\nfull layer of neurons for downstream CIFAR10 classification.

In this work, we study the use of a\ndata-driven reduced order model, namely dynamic mode decomposition, and a deep\ngenerative model, namely conditional generative adversarial networks, to\nresemble the numerical simulations of the pore collapse process at\nrepresentative training shock pressures. Since the simulations are expensive,\nthe training data are scarce, which makes training an accurate surrogate model\nchallenging. To overcome the difficulties posed by the complex physics\nphenomena, we make several crucial treatments to the plain original form of the\nmethods to increase the capability of approximating and predicting the\ndynamics.

In this paper, we\npropose one explanation of why Adam converges faster than SGD using a new\nconcept directional sharpness. We argue that the performance of optimization\nalgorithms is closely related to the directional sharpness of the update steps,\nand show SGD has much worse directional sharpness compared to adaptive\nalgorithms.

Two obstacles,\nhowever, have made it difficult to understand the applicability of these\nmodels, especially to topological features: they have thermodynamically large\nground state degeneracies, and they tacitly assume spin conservation. We show\nthat neither are essential to HK models and that both can be avoided by\nintroducing interactions between tight-binding states in the orbital basis,\nrather than between energy eigenstates. To solve these \"orbital\" models, we\nintroduce a general technique for solving HK models and show that previous\nmodels appear as special cases. We illustrate our method by exactly solving\ngraphene and the Kane-Mele model with HK interactions. Both realize Mott\ninsulating phases with finite magnetic susceptibility; the graphene model has a\nfourfold degenerate ground state while the Kane-Mele model has a nondegenerate\nground state in the presence of interactions. Our technique then allows us to\nstudy the effect of strong interactions on symmetry-enforced degeneracy in\nspin-orbit coupled double-Dirac semimetals. We show that adding HK interactions\nto a double Dirac semi-metal leads to a Mott insulating, spin liquid phase. We\nthen use a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to express the low-energy\nHamiltonian in terms of the spin degrees of freedom, making the spin-charge\nseparation explicit. Finally, we enumerate a broader class of\nsymmetry-preserving HK interactions and show how they can violate insulating\nfilling constraints derived from space group symmetries. This suggests that new\napproaches are needed to study topological order in the presence of long-range\ninteractions of the HK type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 22:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

To address this, some mathematical models have been\nproposed to explain how the brain can represent the discriminative structure of\nqualia, but they remain unresolved due to a lack of validation methods. To\nunderstand the qualia discrimination mechanism, we need to ask how the brain\nautonomously develops such a mathematical structure using the constructive\napproach. Here we show that a brain model that learns to satisfy an algebraic\nindependence between neural networks separates metric spaces corresponding to\nqualia types. We formulate the algebraic independence to link it to the\nother-qualia-type invariant transformation, a familiar formulation of the\npermanence of perception. The learning of algebraic independence proposed here\nexplains downward causation, i.e. the macro-level relationship has the causal\npower over its components, because algebra is the macro-level relationship that\nis irreducible to a law of neurons, and a self-evaluation of algebra is used to\ncontrol neurons.

To that end, we build a social network of 6,949\ndevelopers across the collaboration activity from 1,644 Rust packages.

A domain\ndiscriminator is added to train the generator adversarially to exclude domain\nspecific features from the DIRep.

In this paper,\nwe present a novel approach that integrates the adversarial model with a\nvariational autoencoder.

We further\npenalize the size of the DDRep to drive as much information as possible to the\nDIRep, which maximizes the accuracy of the classifier in labeling samples in\nboth domains. We empirically evaluate our model using synthetic datasets and\ndemonstrate that spurious class-related features introduced in the source\ndomain are successfully absorbed by the DDRep.

Communication bandwidth is a scarce\nresource; in each round, the PS aggregates the updates from a subset of clients\nonly. In this paper, we focus on non-convex minimization that is vulnerable to\nnon-uniform and time-varying communication failures between the PS and the\nclients. Specifically, in each round $t$, the link between the PS and client\n$i$ is active with probability $p_i^t$, which is $\\textit{unknown}$ to both the\nPS and the clients. This arises when the channel conditions are heterogeneous\nacross clients and are changing over time.\n  We show that when the $p_i^t$'s are not uniform, $\\textit{Federated Average}$\n(FedAvg) -- the most widely adopted FL algorithm -- fails to minimize the\nglobal objective.

With an optomechanical system\noperating in the regime of unresolved sideband, where its mechanical frequency\nis lower than the cavity field damping rate, we illustrate the existence of a\nspecial nonlinear resonance phenomenon. This type of previously unknown\nresonance manifests an organized pattern of the coupled cavity field and\nmechanical oscillation, so that the cavity field precisely pushes the\nmechanical oscillator within an appropriate small time window in each\nmechanical oscillation period and the mechanical energy will increase by a jump\nof almost fixed amount after each oscillation cycle. The scenario is realized\nat a resonance point where the frequency difference of two driving fields\nmatches the mechanical frequency of the system, and this condition of\ndrive-frequency match is found to trigger a mechanism to lock the two\nsubsystems of an unresolved-sideband optomechanical system into a highly\nordered energy transfer as the above mentioned. Due to a significantly enhanced\nnonlinearity in the vicinity of the resonance point, optical frequency combs\ncan be generated under pump powers of thousand times lower, as compared to the\nuse of a single-tone driving field for the purpose. An unresolved sideband\nsystem under the drives without satisfying the resonance condition also\ndemonstrates other interesting dynamical behaviors.

With the carbon footprint of large generative AI models like\nChatGPT or GPT-4 adding urgency to this goal, the paper develops a roadmap to\nmake AI, and technology more broadly, environmentally sustainable. It explores\ntwo key dimensions: legal instruments to make AI greener; and methods to render\nAI regulation more sustainable. Concerning the former, transparency mechanisms,\nsuch as the disclosure of the GHG footprint under Article 11 AI Act, could be a\nfirst step. However, given the well-known limitations of disclosure, regulation\nneeds to go beyond transparency. Hence, I propose a mix of co-regulation\nstrategies; sustainability by design; restrictions on training data; and\nconsumption caps. This regulatory toolkit may then, in a second step, serve as\na blueprint for other information technologies and infrastructures facing\nsignificant sustainability challenges due to their high GHG emissions, e.g.:\nblockchain; metaverse applications; and data centers. The second dimension\nconsists in efforts to render AI regulation, and by implication the law itself,\nmore sustainable. Certain rights we have come to take for granted, such as the\nright to erasure (Article 17 GDPR), may have to be limited due to\nsustainability considerations. For example, the subjective right to erasure, in\nsome situations, has to be balanced against the collective interest in\nmitigating climate change. The paper formulates guidelines to strike this\nbalance equitably, discusses specific use cases, and identifies doctrinal legal\nmethods for incorporating such a \"sustainability limitation\" into existing\n(e.g., Art. 17(3) GDPR) and future law (e.g., AI Act).

Such transitions are referred to as complex coacervation,\nand recent studies have sought to understand the underlying physics and\nchemistry. Most theoretical and simulation efforts to date have focused on\noppositely charged linear polyelectrolytes, which adopt nearly ideal-coil\nconformations in the condensed phase. However, when one of the coacervate\ncomponents is a globular protein, a better model of complexation should replace\none of the species with a spherical charged particle or colloid. In this work,\nwe perform coarse-grained simulations of colloid-polyelectrolyte coacervation\nusing a spherical model for the colloid. Simulation results indicate that the\nelectroneutral cell of the resulting (hybrid) coacervates consists of a\npolyelectrolyte layer adsorbed on the colloid. Power laws for the structure and\nthe density of the condensed phase, which are extracted from simulations, are\nfound to be consistent with the adsorption-based scaling theory of\ncoacervation.

For higher $Q$, adsorption is strong and\ncolloids become effectively sticky.

The current paper extends these\nmethods to analysis in another orthogonal basis, wavelets. While still\nproviding the computational efficiency obtained with the original method in\nFourier space, this extension allows more flexibility in adapting to local\nproperties of the images, as well as capitalizing on the long history of\ndevelopments for wavelet shrinkage methods. In addition, wavelet methods,\nincluding empirical Bayes specific methods, have recently been developed to\neffectively capture multifractal properties of images. An extension of these\nmethods is utilized to enhance the recovery of textural characteristics of the\nunderlying image.

The adaptation step involves generating an adaptation\nstrategy and applying it to the running system whenever an anomaly arises. In\nthis article, we argue that, rather than generating individual adaptation\nstrategies, the goal should be to adapt the control logic of the running system\nin such a way that the system itself would learn how to steer clear of future\nanomalies, without triggering self-adaptation too frequently. While the need\nfor adaptation is never eliminated, especially noting the uncertain and\nevolving environment of complex systems, reducing the frequency of adaptation\ninterventions is advantageous for various reasons, e.g., to increase\nperformance and to make a running system more robust. We instantiate and\nempirically examine the above idea for software-defined networking -- a key\nenabling technology for modern data centres and Internet of Things\napplications. Using genetic programming,(GP), we propose a self-adaptation\nsolution that continuously learns and updates the control constructs in the\ndata-forwarding logic of a software-defined network. Our evaluation, performed\nusing open-source synthetic and industrial data, indicates that, compared to a\nbaseline adaptation technique that attempts to generate individual adaptations,\nour GP-based approach is more effective in resolving network congestion, and\nfurther, reduces the frequency of adaptation interventions over time.

As PTQ schemes based on reconstructing each layer\nor block output turn out to be effective to enhance quantized model\nperformance, recent works have developed algorithms to devise and learn a new\nweight-rounding scheme so as to better reconstruct each layer or block output.\nIn this work, we propose a simple yet effective new weight-rounding mechanism\nfor PTQ, coined FlexRound, based on element-wise division instead of typical\nelement-wise addition such that FlexRound enables jointly learning a common\nquantization grid size as well as a different scale for each pre-trained\nweight. Thanks to the reciprocal rule of derivatives induced by element-wise\ndivision, FlexRound is inherently able to exploit pre-trained weights when\nupdating their corresponding scales, and thus, flexibly quantize pre-trained\nweights depending on their magnitudes. We empirically validate the efficacy of\nFlexRound on a wide range of models and tasks.

A theoretical keystone to solving these\nproblems is understanding how the singular value structure of a signal is\ndeformed in the presence of noise. This question has been thoroughly studied in\nthe well-known spiked matrix model, in which data matrices originate from\nlow-rank signals perturbed by additive noise, in an asymptotic limit where the\nsize of these matrices tends to infinity but the signal rank remains finite. We\nfirst show, strikingly, that the singular value structure of large finite\nmatrices (of size $O(1000)$) with even moderate-rank signals, as low as $10$,\nis not accurately predicted by the finite-rank theory, thereby limiting the\napplication of this theory real data. To address these deficiencies, we\nanalytically compute how the singular values and vectors of an arbitrary signal\nmatrix are deformed by additive noise.

Numerical\nverification is carried out for three well-known thermodynamic functionals,\nnamely, entropy production, free energy dissipation and dissipative work. These\nuniversal equalities and inequalities are valid for arbitrary stopping\nstrategies, and thus provide a comprehensive framework with new insights into\nthe fundamental principles governing nonequilibrium systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 04:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Although previous research has investigated\npretraining methods for both LiDAR and camera-based 3D object detection, a\nunified pretraining framework for multimodal BEV perception is missing. In this\nstudy, we introduce CALICO, a novel framework that applies contrastive\nobjectives to both LiDAR and camera backbones.

It trains a model on denoising tasks that encompass different noise\nlevels simultaneously, representing a form of multi-task learning (MTL).\nHowever, analyzing and improving diffusion models from an MTL perspective\nremains under-explored. In particular, MTL can sometimes lead to the well-known\nphenomenon of $\\textit{negative transfer}$, which results in the performance\ndegradation of certain tasks due to conflicts between tasks. In this paper, we\naim to analyze diffusion training from an MTL standpoint, presenting two key\nobservations: $\\textbf{(O1)}$ the task affinity between denoising tasks\ndiminishes as the gap between noise levels widens, and $\\textbf{(O2)}$ negative\ntransfer can arise even in the context of diffusion training. Building upon\nthese observations, our objective is to enhance diffusion training by\nmitigating negative transfer. To achieve this, we propose leveraging existing\nMTL methods, but the presence of a huge number of denoising tasks makes this\ncomputationally expensive to calculate the necessary per-task loss or gradient.\nTo address this challenge, we propose clustering the denoising tasks into small\ntask clusters and applying MTL methods to them.

Despite this, DBMSs\nare prone to performance issues, where a DBMS produces an inefficient query\nplan that might lead to the slow execution of a query. Finding such issues is a\nlongstanding problem and inherently difficult, because no ground truth\ninformation on an expected execution time exists. In this work, we propose\nCardinality Estimation Restriction Testing (CERT), a novel technique that\ndetects performance issues through the lens of cardinality estimation. Given a\nquery on a database, CERT derives a more restrictive query (e.g., by replacing\na LEFT JOIN with an INNER JOIN), whose estimated number of rows should not\nexceed the number of estimated rows for the original query. CERT tests\ncardinality estimators specifically, because they were shown to be the most\nimportant component for query optimization; thus, we expect that finding and\nfixing such issues might result in the highest performance gains. In addition,\nwe found that some other kinds of query optimization issues are exposed by the\nunexpected cardinality estimation, which can also be detected by CERT.

Automatically identifying these attribute\nvalues from an eCommerce product page that contains both text and images is a\nchallenging task, especially when the attribute value is not explicitly\nmentioned in the catalog. In this paper, we present a scalable solution for\nthis problem where we pose attribute extraction problem as a question-answering\ntask, which we solve using \\textbf{MXT}, consisting of three key components:\n(i) \\textbf{M}AG (Multimodal Adaptation Gate), (ii) \\textbf{X}ception network,\nand (iii) \\textbf{T}5 encoder-decoder. Our system consists of a generative\nmodel that \\emph{generates} attribute-values for a given product by using both\ntextual and visual characteristics (e.g. images) of the product. We show that\nour system is capable of handling zero-shot attribute prediction (when\nattribute value is not seen in training data) and value-absent prediction (when\nattribute value is not mentioned in the text) which are missing in traditional\nclassification-based and NER-based models respectively. We have trained our\nmodels using distant supervision, removing dependency on human labeling, thus\nmaking them practical for real-world applications.

The situation can be further complicated when some\npieces of evidence are contradicted each other or paradoxical.

Likewise, when it comes\nto using Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for strategic decision-making,\nplacing trust in the AI itself becomes a meta-decision, given that many AI\nsystems are viewed as opaque \"black boxes\" that process large amounts of data.\nTrusting an opaque system involves deciding on the level of Trustworthy AI\n(TAI). We propose a new approach to address this issue by introducing a novel\ntaxonomy or framework of TAI, which encompasses three crucial domains:\narticulate, authentic, and basic for different levels of trust. To underpin\nthese domains, we create ten dimensions to measure trust:\nexplainability/transparency, fairness/diversity, generalizability, privacy,\ndata governance, safety/robustness, accountability, reproducibility,\nreliability, and sustainability. We aim to use this taxonomy to conduct a\ncomprehensive survey and explore different TAI approaches from a strategic\ndecision-making perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 06:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

A key challenge is that preferences are typically\nprovided at the sequence level while LM training and generation both occur at\nthe token level. There is, therefore, a granularity mismatch between the\npreference and the LM training losses, which may complicate the learning\nproblem. In this paper, we address this issue by developing an alternate\ntraining process, where we iterate between grounding the sequence-level\npreference into token-level training guidance, and improving the LM with the\nlearned guidance. For guidance learning, we design a framework that extends the\npairwise-preference learning in imitation learning to both variable-length LM\ngeneration and utilizing the preference among multiple generations. For LM\ntraining, based on the amount of supervised data, we present two minimalist\nlearning objectives that utilize the learned guidance.

In terms of vision-language (VL) tasks, they often serve\nas a language encoder and still require an additional fusion network for VL\nreasoning, resulting in excessive memory overhead. In this paper, we focus on\nexploring PLMs as a stand-alone model for VL reasoning tasks. Inspired by the\nrecently popular prompt tuning, we first prove that the processed visual\nfeatures can be also projected onto the semantic space of PLMs and act as\nprompt tokens to bridge the gap between single- and multi-modal learning.\nHowever, this solution exhibits obvious redundancy in visual information and\nmodel inference, and the placement of prompt tokens also greatly affects the\nfinal performance. Based on these observations, we further propose a novel\ntransfer learning approach for PLMs, termed Dynamic Visual Prompting (DVP).\nConcretely, DVP first deploys a cross-attention module to obtain text-related\nand compact visual prompt tokens, thereby greatly reducing the input length of\nPLMs. To obtain the optimal placement, we also equip DVP with a\nreinforcement-learning based search algorithm, which can automatically merge\nDVP with PLMs for different VL tasks via a very short search process. In\naddition, we also experiment DVP with the recently popular adapter approach to\nkeep the most parameters of PLMs intact when adapting to VL tasks, helping PLMs\nachieve a quick shift between single- and multi-modal tasks. We apply DVP to\ntwo representative PLMs, namely BERT and T5, and conduct extensive experiments\non a set of VL reasoning benchmarks including VQA2.0, GQA and SNLIVE.

Previous\ndensity feedback control approaches have only approximated pellet injection as\na continuous input due to the complexity that it introduces. In this letter, we\nmodel plasma density and pellet injection as a hybrid system and propose two\nMPC strategies for density control: mixed-integer (MI) MPC using a conventional\nmixed-integer programming (MIP) solver and MPC utilizing our novel modification\nof the penalty term homotopy (PTH) algorithm. By relaxing the integer\nrequirements, the PTH algorithm transforms the MIP problem into a series of\ncontinuous optimization problems, reducing computational complexity. Our novel\nmodification to the PTH algorithm ensures that it can handle path constraints,\nmaking it viable for constrained hybrid MPC in general. Both strategies perform\nwell with regards to reference tracking without violating path constraints and\nsatisfy the computation time limit for real-time control of the pellet\ninjection system. However, the computation time of the PTH-based MPC strategy\nconsistently outpaces the conventional MI-MPC strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 07:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Recent studies have drawn inspiration from\nthe success of diffusion models in image generation, demonstrating the\npotential for addressing this task. However, the majority of these studies have\nbeen limited to offline applications that target at sequence-level generation\nthat generates all steps simultaneously. To enable real-time motion synthesis\nwith diffusion models in response to time-varying control signals, we propose\nthe framework of the Controllable Motion Diffusion Model (COMODO). Our\nframework begins with an auto-regressive motion diffusion model (A-MDM), which\ngenerates motion sequences step by step. In this way, simply using the standard\nDDPM algorithm without any additional complexity, our framework is able to\ngenerate high-fidelity motion sequences over extended periods with different\ntypes of control signals. Then, we propose our reinforcement learning-based\ncontroller and controlling strategies on top of the A-MDM model, so that our\nframework can steer the motion synthesis process across multiple tasks,\nincluding target reaching, joystick-based control, goal-oriented control, and\ntrajectory following. The proposed framework enables the real-time generation\nof diverse motions that react adaptively to user commands on-the-fly, thereby\nenhancing the overall user experience. Besides, it is compatible with the\ninpainting-based editing methods and can predict much more diverse motions\nwithout additional fine-tuning of the basic motion generation models. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our\nframework in performing various tasks and compare its performance against\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 07:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

The viscosity of the fluid is modelled as an exponential\nfunction of temperature and concentration, with an activation energy parameter\ndetermining its sensitivity to temperature variation. Three scenarios are\nconsidered: buoyancy force due to thermal diffusion only, buoyancy force due to\ntemperature and solute acting in the same direction, and buoyancy force due to\ntemperature and solute acting in opposite directions. A generalized eigenvalue\nproblem is derived and solved numerically for linear stability analysis via the\nChebyshev spectral collocation method.

A\nprogrammable time amplifier is used between the second and third steps to reach\nthe final resolution of 24.4 ps in the standard mode of operation. The system\nmakes use of common continuously stabilized master blocks that control\ntrimmable slave blocks, in each channel, against the effects of global PVT\nvariations. Thanks to this structure, the power consumption of a channel is\nconsiderably reduced when it does not process a hit, and limited to 2.2 mW when\nit processes a hit. In the 130 nm CMOS technology used for the prototype, the\narea of a TDC channel is only 0.051 mm2. This compactness combined with low\npower consumption is a key advantage for integration in multi-channel front-end\nchips. The performance of this new structure has been evaluated on prototype\nchips. Measurements show excellent timing performance over a wide range of\noperating temperatures (-40{\\deg}C to 60{\\deg}C) in agreement with our\nexpectations. For example, the measured timing integral nonlinearity is better\nthan 1 LSB (25 ps) and the overall timing precision is better than 21 ps RMS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 08:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Although acquired\nextensive knowledge of visual concepts, it is non-trivial to exploit knowledge\nfrom these VL models to the task of semantic segmentation, as they are usually\ntrained at an image level. ZeroSeg overcomes this by distilling the visual\nconcepts learned by VL models into a set of segment tokens, each summarizing a\nlocalized region of the target image.

However,\nlabel-efficient solutions from weak supervision like scribbles are rarely\nexplored yet primarily meaningful and demanding in medical practice due to the\nexpensiveness and scarcity of densely-annotated polyp data. Besides, various\ndeployment issues, including data shifts and corruption, put forward further\nrequests for model generalization and robustness. To address these concerns, we\ndesign a framework of Spatial-Spectral Dual-branch Mutual Teaching and\nEntropy-guided Pseudo Label Ensemble Learning (S$^2$ME). Concretely, for the\nfirst time in weakly-supervised medical image segmentation, we promote the\ndual-branch co-teaching framework by leveraging the intrinsic complementarity\nof features extracted from the spatial and spectral domains and encouraging\ncross-space consistency through collaborative optimization. Furthermore, to\nproduce reliable mixed pseudo labels, which enhance the effectiveness of\nensemble learning, we introduce a novel adaptive pixel-wise fusion technique\nbased on the entropy guidance from the spatial and spectral branches. Our\nstrategy efficiently mitigates the deleterious effects of uncertainty and noise\npresent in pseudo labels and surpasses previous alternatives in terms of\nefficacy. Ultimately, we formulate a holistic optimization objective to learn\nfrom the hybrid supervision of scribbles and pseudo labels.

In particular, the modeling of time\nlags associated with the time between rainfall occurrence and subsequent\nchanges in streamflow, is of high practical importance. Since water can take a\nvariety of flowpaths to generate streamflow, a series of distinct runoff pulses\nfrom different flowpath may combine to create the observed streamflow time\nseries. Current state-of-the-art models are not able to sufficiently confront\nthe problem complexity with interpretable parametrization, which would allow\ninsights into the dynamics of the distinct flow paths for hydrological\ninference. The proposed Gaussian Sliding Windows Regression Model targets this\nproblem by combining the concept of multiple windows sliding along the time\naxis with multiple linear regression. The window kernels, which indicate the\nweights applied to different time lags, are implemented via Gaussian-shaped\nkernels. As a result, each window can represent one flowpath and, thus, offers\nthe potential for straightforward process inference.

Using a\nMoran model, we investigate the``rule of thumb'' given in [EPW09] for the click\nrate of the ``classical ratchet'' by putting it into the context of new results\non the long-time evolution of the size of the best class of the ratchet with\n(binary) tournament selection, which (other than that of the classical ratchet)\nfollows an autonomous dynamics up to the time of its extinction.\n  In [GSW23] it was discovered that the tournament ratchet has a hierarchy of\ndual processes which can be constructed on top of an Ancestral Selection graph\nwith a Poisson decoration. For a regime in which the mutation/selection-ratio\nremains bounded away from 1, this was used in [GSW23] to reveal the asymptotics\nof the click rates as well as that of the type frequency profile between\nclicks.

In\nthese applications, complete diffusion histories play an essential role in\nterms of identifying dynamical patterns, reflecting on precaution actions, and\nforecasting intervention effects. Despite their importance, complete diffusion\nhistories are rarely available and are highly challenging to reconstruct due to\nill-posedness, explosive search space, and scarcity of training data. To date,\nfew methods exist for diffusion history reconstruction. They are exclusively\nbased on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) formulation and require to\nknow true diffusion parameters. In this paper, we study an even harder problem,\nnamely reconstructing Diffusion history from A single SnapsHot} (DASH), where\nwe seek to reconstruct the history from only the final snapshot without knowing\ntrue diffusion parameters. We start with theoretical analyses that reveal a\nfundamental limitation of the MLE formulation. We prove: (a) estimation error\nof diffusion parameters is unavoidable due to NP-hardness of diffusion\nparameter estimation, and (b) the MLE formulation is sensitive to estimation\nerror of diffusion parameters.

In this work, we develop an algorithm that decomposes the\nQAOA input problem graph into a smaller problem and solves MaxCut using QAOA on\nthe reduced graph.

A single long-distance trip can amount to a distance\nequivalent to a year's worth of commute trips, resulting in a similar, if not\nworse, environmental footprint. Understanding travellers' behaviour is thus\njust as relevant for such trips. As international travel is slowly picking up\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been marred by an abundance of national and\nregional pandemic-related safety measures.

Existing schemes have been unable to account for all\nthree of these key factors at the same time.\n  In this work, we take a systematic approach to developing a framework that is\nable to account for all three factors.

To prove the stability, we apply the\nHamilton--Poisson representation of the Maxwell--Lorentz system constructed in\nour previous paper.The construction relies on the Hamilton least action\nprinciple and the Lie--Poincar\\'e calculus. The constructed structure is\ndegenerate and admits the Casimir invariants.\n  This structure allows us to construct the Lyapunov function corresponding to\na soliton, reducing the system via canonical transformation to a comoving\nframe. The function is a linear combination of the Hamiltonian and the Casimir\ninvariant. The function is conserved, and the soliton is its critical point.\nThe key point of the proof is a lower bound for the Lyapunov function. This\nbound implies that the soliton is a strict local minimizer of the function. The\nproof of the bound for $\\omega=0$ is rather simple and use only the spherical\nsymmetry. For $\\omega\\ne 0$, the lower bound holds if and only if,\nadditionally, the charge density is not identically zero.

In other words, it attempts to\n\"pull\" the latent representations of the same scan together and \"push\" the\nlatent representations of other scans away. The generated MRI latent space is\nsubsequently utilized for MR image reconstruction and the performance was\nassessed in comparison to several baseline deep learning reconstruction\nmethods.

However, as development progresses,\nmorphogen activity is reduced, leaving the emergent pattern without stabilizing\npositional cues. The pattern then can be deteriorated by the intrinsically\nnoisy biochemical processes acting at the cellular level. But remarkably, the\nestablished gene expression patterns remain spatially and temporally stable in\nmany biological systems. Here we combine spatial-stochastic simulations with an\nenhanced sampling method and a recently developed stability theory to address\nhow spatiotemporal integrity of a gene expression pattern is maintained in\ndeveloping tissue lacking morphogen gradients. Using a minimal embryo model\nconsisting of spatially coupled biochemical reactor volumes, we study a stripe\npattern in which weak cross-repression between nearest neighbor domians\nalternates with strong repression between next-nearest neighbor domains,\ninspired by the gap gene system in the Drosophila embryo. We find that\nfine-tuning of the weak repressive interactions to an optimal level can\nsignificantly increase temporal stability of the expression patterns, allowing\nfor stable patterns over developmentally relevant times in the absence of\nmorphogen gradients. The numerically determined optimal parameters closely\nagree with the predictions of the stability theory. By analizing the dynamics\nof factors characterizing pattern integrity, we trace back the stability\nenhancement to the emergence of restoring forces, maintaining the pattern in a\nmeta-stable basin. Altogether our results demonstrate that metastable\nattractors can emerge as a property of stochastic gene expression patterns even\nwithout system-wide positional cues, provided that the gene regulatory\ninteractions shaping the pattern are optimally tuned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 10:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Currently, the level of\nautomation in commercial vehicles is far from completely unmanned, and drivers\nstill play an important role in operating and controlling the vehicle.\nTherefore, driver distraction behavior detection is crucial for road safety. At\npresent, driver distraction detection primarily relies on traditional\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and supervised learning methods. However,\nthere are still challenges such as the high cost of labeled datasets, limited\nability to capture high-level semantic information, and weak generalization\nperformance. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a new\nself-supervised learning method based on masked image modeling for driver\ndistraction behavior detection. Firstly, a self-supervised learning framework\nfor masked image modeling (MIM) is introduced to solve the serious human and\nmaterial consumption issues caused by dataset labeling. Secondly, the Swin\nTransformer is employed as an encoder. Performance is enhanced by reconfiguring\nthe Swin Transformer block and adjusting the distribution of the number of\nwindow multi-head self-attention (W-MSA) and shifted window multi-head\nself-attention (SW-MSA) detection heads across all stages, which leads to model\nmore lightening. Finally, various data augmentation strategies are used along\nwith the best random masking strategy to strengthen the model's recognition and\ngeneralization ability. Test results on a large-scale driver distraction\nbehavior dataset show that the self-supervised learning method proposed in this\npaper achieves an accuracy of 99.60%, approximating the excellent performance\nof advanced supervised learning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 10:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Nature's versatility in such environments inspires researchers to\ndevelop biomimetic robots that incorporate compliant and contracting artificial\nmuscles. Among the recently proposed artificial muscle technologies,\nelectrohydraulic actuators are promising since they offer comparable\nperformance to mammalian muscles in terms of speed and power density. However,\nthey require high driving voltages and have safety concerns due to exposed\nelectrodes. These high voltages lead to either bulky or inefficient driving\nelectronics that make untethered, high-degree-of-freedom bio-inspired robots\ndifficult to realize. Here, we present low voltage electrohydraulic actuators\n(LEAs) that match mammalian skeletal muscles in average power density (50.5\nW/kg) and peak strain rate (971 percent/s) at a driving voltage of just 1100 V.\nThis driving voltage is approx. 5 - 7 times lower compared to other\nelectrohydraulic actuators using paraelectric dielectrics. Furthermore, LEAs\nare safe to touch, waterproof, and self-clearing, which makes them easy to\nimplement in wearables and robotics. We characterize, model, and physically\nvalidate key performance metrics of the actuator and compare its performance to\nstate-of-the-art electrohydraulic designs. Finally, we demonstrate the utility\nof our actuators on two muscle-based electrohydraulic robots: an untethered\nsoft robotic swimmer and a robotic gripper.

By associating\neach reference point with two given point clouds through computing its\ndirectional distances to them, the difference in directional distances of an\nidentical reference point characterizes the geometric difference between a\ntypical local region of the two point clouds. Finally, CLGD is obtained by\naveraging the directional distance differences of all reference points.

Extensive experiments show that CLGD achieves\nsignificantly higher accuracy under all tasks in a memory and computationally\nefficient manner, compared with existing metrics.

Our previous work showed distinct patterns of visuomotor\nfeedback gains during abrupt or gradual adaptation to a force field, suggesting\ntwo complementary processes: reactive feedback gains increasing with internal\nmodel uncertainty and the gradual learning of predictive feedback gains tuned\nto the environment. Here we further investigate what drives these changes\nvisuomotor feedback gains in learning, by separating the effects of internal\nmodel uncertainty from visual error signal through removal of visual error\ninformation. Removing visual error information suppresses the visuomotor\nfeedback gains in all conditions, but the pattern of modulation throughout\nadaptation is unaffected.

When the related structures have no obvious a priori\nconnection, however, such results can be, by their own nature, elusive. Here,\nwe show how data-mining across distinct web sources (including the Online\nEncyclopedia of Integer Sequences, OEIS), was crucial in the discovery of two\noriginal representation theorems relating event structures (mathematical\nstructures commonly used to represent concurrent discrete systems) to families\nof sets (endowed with elementary disjointness and subset relations) and to full\ngraphs, respectively.

One of those is\nclutter removal, which should be applied to remove the influence of unwanted\ncomponents, scattered by the environment, in the acquired sensing signal. While\nlegacy radar systems already implement different clutter removal algorithms,\nISAC requires techniques that are tailored to the envisioned use cases and the\nspecific challenges that communications deployments bring along, like phase\nnoise due to clock errors between transmitter and receiver.

In this paper, we study a series of SIS-type diffusion\nprocesses with both indirect and direct pathways on a directed hypergraph. In a\nconcrete case, the model we propose is based on a specific choice (polynomial)\nof interaction function (how several agents influence each other when they are\nin a hyperedge). Then, by the same choice of interaction function, we further\nextend the system and propose a bi-virus competing model on a directed\nhypergraph by coupling two single-virus models together. Finally, the most\ngeneral model in this paper considers an abstract interaction function under\nsingle-virus and bi-virus settings. For the single-virus model, we provide the\nresults regarding healthy state and endemic equilibrium. For the bi-virus\nsetting, we further give an analysis of the existence and stability of the\nhealthy state, dominant endemic equilibria, and coexisting equilibria.

The majority of\nobjective functions for neural models can be divided into metric learning and\nstatistical learning. Metric learning approaches require a pair mining strategy\nthat often lacks efficiency, while statistical learning approaches are not\ngenerating highly compact features due to their indirect feature optimization.\nTo this end, we propose a novel repeller-attractor loss that falls in the\nmetric learning paradigm, yet directly optimizes for the L2 metric without the\nneed of generating pairs. Our loss is formed of three components. One leading\nobjective ensures that the learned features are attracted to each designated\nlearnable class anchor. The second loss component regulates the anchors and\nforces them to be separable by a margin, while the third objective ensures that\nthe anchors do not collapse to zero. Furthermore, we develop a more efficient\ntwo-stage retrieval system by harnessing the learned class anchors during the\nfirst stage of the retrieval process, eliminating the need of comparing the\nquery with every image in the database.

Such data enables us to ask both what\ndemographics our predictions align with and whose reasoning patterns our\nmodels' rationales align with. We find systematic inter-group annotator\ndisagreement and show how 16 Transformer-based models align better with\nrationales provided by certain demographic groups: We find that models are\nbiased towards aligning best with older and/or white annotators. We zoom in on\nthe effects of model size and model distillation, finding -- contrary to our\nexpectations -- negative correlations between model size and rationale\nagreement as well as no evidence that either model size or model distillation\nimproves fairness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 13:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

To bridge this gap, this\npaper presents the first attempt to represent geodesics on 3D mesh models using\nneural implicit functions. Specifically, we introduce neural geodesic fields\n(NeuroGFs), which are learned to represent the all-pairs geodesics of a given\nmesh. By using NeuroGFs, we can efficiently and accurately answer queries of\narbitrary point-to-point geodesic distances and paths, overcoming the\nlimitations of traditional algorithms. Evaluations on common 3D models show\nthat NeuroGFs exhibit exceptional performance in solving the single-source\nall-destination (SSAD) and point-to-point geodesics, and achieve high accuracy\nconsistently. Moreover, NeuroGFs offer the unique advantage of encoding both 3D\ngeometry and geodesics in a unified representation.

From a computational\nperspective, structural balance turns out to be a special case of correlation\nclustering with the number of clusters at most two. The two main algorithmic\nproblems of interest are: $(i)$ detecting whether a given graph is balanced, or\n$(ii)$ finding a partition that approximates the \\emph{frustration index},\ni.e., the minimum number of edge flips that turn the graph balanced.\n  We study these problems in the streaming model where edges are given one by\none and focus on \\emph{memory efficiency}.

Using spectral line profiles, we aim to explore\nchanges in the kinematics and dimensions of the BLR in NGC 3516.

We model the\nbroad-line profiles assuming that there is an emission from the accretion disc\nsuperposed with an emission from a surrounding region that is outside the disc.\nWe find that in the Type 1 activity phase, the BLR is very complex. There is a\nclear disc-like BLR that contributes to the broad line wings and an additional\nintermediate line region (ILR) that contributes to the line core. In the high\nactivity phase, the ILR emission is close to the center of the line (in some\ncases slightly shifted to the red), whereas in the low activity phase (i.e.,\nType 2 phase), the ILR component has a significant shift to the blue,\nindicating an outflow.

Given that most of the network capacity is\nutilized to estimate radiance, NeRFs could store valuable density information\nin their parameters or their deep features. To this end, we take one step back\nand analyze large, trained ReLU-MLPs used in coarse-to-fine sampling.

Our model predicts that in the gradient flow, effective LRs will\neventually equalize, aligning with empirical findings on warm-up training.\nUsing large LRs is analogous to applying an explicit solver to a stiff\nnon-linear ODE, causing overshooting and vanishing gradients in lower layers\nafter the first step. Achieving overall balance demands careful tuning of LRs,\ndepth, and (optionally) momentum. Our model predicts the formation of spreads\nin effective LRs, consistent with empirical measurements.

However, the complex\nnature of SAR images presents a challenge that often leads to an overestimation\nof the flood extent. To address this issue, we propose a novel differential\nattention metric-based network (DAM-Net) in this study. The DAM-Net comprises\ntwo key components: a weight-sharing Siamese backbone to obtain multi-scale\nchange features of multi-temporal images and tokens containing high-level\nsemantic information of water-body changes, and a temporal differential fusion\n(TDF) module that integrates semantic tokens and change features to generate\nflood maps with reduced speckle noise. Specifically, the backbone is split into\nmultiple stages. In each stage, we design three modules, namely, temporal-wise\nfeature extraction (TWFE), cross-temporal change attention (CTCA), and\ntemporal-aware change enhancement (TACE), to effectively extract the change\nfeatures. In TACE of the last stage, we introduce a class token to record\nhigh-level semantic information of water-body changes via the attention\nmechanism. Another challenge faced by data-driven deep learning algorithms is\nthe limited availability of flood detection datasets. To overcome this, we have\ncreated the S1GFloods open-source dataset, a global-scale high-resolution\nSentinel-1 SAR image pairs dataset covering 46 global flood events between 2015\nand 2022.

However, limitations within\nthe current body of literature include: i) the lack of investigation around the\ngeneralization of mood inference models trained with passive sensor data from a\nrange of everyday life situations, to specific contexts such as eating, ii) no\nprior studies that use sensor data to study the intersection of mood and\neating, and iii) the inadequate examination of model personalization techniques\nwithin limited label settings, as we commonly experience in mood inference. In\nthis study, we sought to examine everyday eating behavior and mood using two\ndatasets of college students in Mexico (N_mex = 84, 1843 mood-while-eating\nreports) and eight countries (N_mul = 678, 329K mood reports incl. 24K\nmood-while-eating reports), containing both passive smartphone sensing and\nself-report data.

These shape changes are\ngoverned by mechanical forces including molecular motor-generated forces as\nwell as hydrostatic fluid pressure, both of which are actively regulated in\nliving matter through mechano-chemical feedback. Inspired by autonomous,\nbiophysical shape change, such as occurring in the model organism hydra, we\nintroduce a minimal, active, elastic model featuring a network of springs in a\nglobe-like spherical shell geometry. In this model there is coupling between\nactivity and the shape of the shell: if the local curvature of a filament\nrepresented by a spring falls below a critical value, its elastic constant is\nactively changed. This results in deformation of the springs that changes the\nshape of the shell. By combining excitation of springs and pressure regulation,\nwe show that the shell undergoes a transition from spheroidal to either\nelongated ellipsoidal or a different spheroidal shape, depending on pressure.\nThere exists a critical pressure at which there is an abrupt change from\nellipsoids to spheroids, showing that pressure is potentially a sensitive\nswitch for material shape. More complex shapes, involving loss of cylindrical\nsymmetry, can arise when springs are excited both above (spring constants\nincrease) and below (spring constants decrease) the curvature threshold. We\nthus offer biologically inspired design principles for autonomous shape\ntransitions in active elastic shells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 14:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

For statically-typed programming language like\nJava, developers obtain CFGs by using bytecode-based methods for compilable\ncode and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based methods for partially uncompilable\ncode. However, explicit syntax errors during AST construction and implicit\nsemantic errors caused by bad coding practices can lead to behavioral loss and\ndeviation of CFGs.To address the issue, we propose a novel approach that\nleverages the error-tolerant and understanding ability of pre-trained Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to generate CFGs. Our approach involves a Chain of\nThought (CoT) with four steps: structure hierarchy extraction, nested code\nblock extraction, CFG generation of nested code blocks, and fusion of all\nnested code blocks' CFGs. To address the limitations of the original CoT's\nsingle-prompt approach (i.e., completing all steps in a single generative\npass), which can result in an ``epic'' prompt with hard-to-control behavior and\nerror accumulation, we break down the CoT into an AI chain with explicit\nsub-steps. Each sub-step corresponds to a separate AI-unit, with an effective\nprompt assigned to each unit for interacting with LLMs to accomplish a specific\npurpose.Our experiments confirmed that our method outperforms existing CFG\ntools in terms of node and edge coverage, especially for incomplete or\nerroneous code.

These channels model non-orthogonal communications scenarios, such as\nthe non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scenario and underlay cognitive\ncommunications, in which the interference from other communications signals is\nmuch stronger than the thermal noise. Interference-limited communications is\nexpected to become a very common scenario in future wireless communications\nsystems, such as 5G, WiFi6, and beyond. As communications signals are\ninherently cyclostationary in continuous time (CT), then after sampling at the\nreceiver, the discrete-time (DT) received signal model contains the sampled\ndesired information signal with additive sampled CT cyclostationary noise. The\nsampled noise can be modeled as either a DT cyclostationary process or a DT\nalmost-cyclostationary process, where in the latter case the resulting channel\nis not information-stable. In a previous work we characterized the capacity of\nthis model for the case in which the DT noise is memoryless. In the current\nwork we come closer to practical scenarios by modelling the resulting DT noise\nas a finite-memory random process. The presence of memory requires the\ndevelopment of a new set of tools for analyzing the capacity of channels with\nadditive non-stationary noise which has memory. Our results show, for the first\ntime, the relationship between memory, sampling frequency synchronization and\ncapacity, for interference-limited communications. The insights from our work\nprovide a link between the analog and the digital time domains, which has been\nmissing in most previous works on capacity analysis. Thus, our results can help\nimproving spectral efficiency and suggest optimal transceiver designs for\nfuture communications paradigms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 15:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

To capture the complex physical processes involved in these\nproblems, a high grid resolution is usually needed. However, one does not need\nor maybe cannot afford a fine grid of uniformly high resolution across the\nwhole domain. The need to resolve local fine features can be addressed by the\nadaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method, which increases the grid resolution in\nregions of interest as needed during the simulation while leaving general\nestimates in other regions.\n  In this work, we propose a block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (BSAMR)\nframework to simulate two-phase flows using the level set (LS) function with\nboth the subcycling and non-subcycling methods on a collocated grid. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first framework that unifies the subcycling\nand non-subcycling methods to simulate two-phase flows. The use of the\ncollocated grid is also the first among the two-phase BSAMR framework, which\nsignificantly simplifies the implementation of multi-level differential\noperators and interpolation schemes. We design the synchronization operations,\nincluding the averaging, refluxing, and synchronization projection, which\nensures that the flow field is divergence-free on the multi-level grid. It is\nshown that the present multi-level scheme can accurately resolve the interfaces\nof the two-phase flows with gravitational and surface tension effects while\nhaving good momentum and energy conservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 15:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Our treatment is\nbased on the principles of general relativity up to virialization. We have\nchosen a spherical patch that starts to collapse gravitationally as it happens\nin top-hat collapse. It is seen that although the dark matter sector collapses\nthe dark energy sector does keep a profile that is almost similar to the dark\nenergy profile for the background expanding Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\n(FLRW) universe for suitable model parameters. It is observed that in order to\nformulate the problem in the general relativistic setting one has to abandon\nthe idea of a closed FLRW isolated collapsing patch. General relativity\nrequires an external generalized Vaidya spacetime to be matched with the\ninternal spherical patch whose dynamics is guided by the FLRW metric. It is\nshown that almost all collapses are accompanied by some flux of matter and\nradiation in the generalized Vaidya spacetime. Some of the spherical regions of\nthe universe are seen not to collapse but expand eternally, producing void-like\nstructures. Whether a spherical region will collapse or expand depends upon the\ninitial values of the system and other model parameters.

We show how these unequal-time cross-correlation\neffects give rise to scale-dependent corrections in the observable 3D power\nspectrum. We also introduce a new dimensionless observable, the\nfrequency-angular power spectrum, which is a function of dimensionless and\ndirectly observable quantities corresponding to Fourier counterparts of angles\nand redshifts. While inheriting many useful characteristics of the canonical\nobserved power spectrum, this newly introduced statistic does not depend on\nphysical distances and is hence free of so-called Alcock-Paczynski effects.\nSuch observable thus presents a clear advantage and simplification over the\ntraditional power spectrum. Moreover, relying on linear theory calculations, we\nestimate that unequal-time corrections, while generally small, can amount to a\nfew percent on large scales and high redshifts.

We investigate a CS-curricular reform and teacher\nProfessional Development (PD) program from an equity standpoint by applying\nhierarchical regression and structural equation modelling on student learning\nand perception data from three studies with respectively 1384, 2433 & 1644\ngrade 3-6 students (ages 7-11) and their 83, 142 & 95 teachers. Regarding\nlearning, exposure to CS instruction appears to contribute to closing the\nperformance gap between low-achieving and high-achieving students, as well as\npre-existing gender gaps. Despite a lack of direct influence of what was taught\non student learning, there is no impact of teachers' demographics or motivation\non student learning, with teachers' perception of the CS-PD positively\ninfluencing learning. Regarding perception, students perceive CS and its\nteaching tools (robotics, tablets) positively, and even more so when they\nperceive a role model close to them as doing CS. Nonetheless gender differences\nexist all around with boys perceiving CS more positively than girls despite\naccess to CS education. However, access to CS-education affects boys and girls\ndifferently: larger gender gaps are closing (namely those related to robotics),\nwhile smaller gaps are increasing (namely those related to CS and tablets). To\nconclude, our findings highlight how a CS curricular reform impacts learning,\nperception, and equity and supports the importance of i) early introductions to\nCS for all, ii) preparing teachers to teach CS all the while removing the\ninfluence of teacher demographics and motivation on student outcomes, and iii)\nhaving developmentally appropriate activities that signal to all groups of\nstudents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 15:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

The selection of\nsubimages (comprising size, location and orientation) is crucial. It affects\nthe available context information of each pixel, defines the number of tiles\nduring training, and influences the degree of information degradation while\ndown- and up-sampling the tile contents to the size required by the\nsegmentation model. We propose a new segmentation pipeline for earth\nobservation imagery relying on a tiling scheme that creates geo-tiles based on\nthe geo-information of the raster data. This approach exhibits several\nbeneficial properties compared to pixel-based or common web mapping approaches.\nThe proposed tiling scheme shows flexible customization properties regarding\ntile granularity, tile stride and image boundary alignment.

Consequently, controlling these defects is of great interest for\nfuture technological applications, and while past literature has focused on\nadding external doping elements to the mixture, a complete study on undoped\nBi2Se3 was still lacking. In this work, we use the self-flux method to obtain\nhigh-quality Bi2Se3 single-crystals in the entire concentration range available\non the phase-diagram for the technique. By combining basic structural\ncharacterization with measurements of the resistivity, Hall effect and\nShubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations, the effects of these impurities\non the bulk transport are investigated in samples with electron densities\nranging from 10^17 cm^-3 to 10^19 cm^-3, from Se-rich to Bi-rich mixtures,\nrespectively, evidencing the transition into a degenerate semiconductor regime.\nWe find that electron-donor impurities, likely Se vacancies, unavoidably shift\nthe Fermi level up to 200 meV inside the conduction band.

Inspired by the sparse\nmechanism shift hypothesis, we claim that changing environments in online\nlearning can be attributed to partial changes in learned parameters that are\nspecific to environments and the rest remain invariant to changing\nenvironments. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm under\nthe assumption that data collected at each time can be disentangled with two\nrepresentations, an environment-invariant semantic factor and an\nenvironment-specific variation factor. The semantic factor is further used for\nfair prediction under a group fairness constraint. To evaluate the sequence of\nmodel parameters generated by the learner, a novel regret is proposed in which\nit takes a mixed form of dynamic and static regret metrics followed by a\nfairness-aware long-term constraint. The detailed analysis provides theoretical\nguarantees for loss regret and violation of cumulative fairness constraints.\nEmpirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate our proposed method\nsequentially outperforms baseline methods in model accuracy and fairness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 19:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

Certain lung diseases such as cystic\nfibrosis can cause the formation of biofilms in the lungs and can be fatal.\nWith antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the use of phage therapy has been\nintroduced as an alternative or an additive to the use of antibiotics in order\nto combat biofilm growth. Phage therapy utilizes phages, or viruses that attack\nbacteria, in order to penetrate and eradicate biofilms. In order to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of phage therapy against biofilm bacteria, we adapt an\nordinary differential equation model to describe the dynamics of phage-biofilm\ncombat in the lungs. We then create our own phage-biofilm model with ordinary\ndifferential equations and stochastic modeling. Then, simulations of parameter\nalterations in both models are investigated to assess how they will affect the\nefficiency of phage therapy against bacteria. By increasing the phage mortality\nrate, the biofilm growth can be balanced and allow the biofilm to be more\nvulnerable to antibiotics.

Previous\nefforts in user modeling mainly focus on learning a task-specific user\nrepresentation that is designed for a single task. However, since learning\ntask-specific user representations for every task is infeasible, recent studies\nintroduce the concept of universal user representation, which is a more\ngeneralized representation of a user that is relevant to a variety of tasks.\nDespite their effectiveness, existing approaches for learning universal user\nrepresentations are impractical in real-world applications due to the data\nrequirement, catastrophic forgetting and the limited learning capability for\ncontinually added tasks.

In this position paper, we argue that model\nevaluation practices must take on a critical task to cope with the challenges\nand responsibilities brought by this homogenization: providing valid\nassessments for whether and how much human needs in downstream use cases can be\nsatisfied by the given model (\\textit{socio-technical gap}). By drawing on\nlessons from the social sciences, human-computer interaction (HCI), and the\ninterdisciplinary field of explainable AI (XAI), we urge the community to\ndevelop evaluation methods based on real-world socio-requirements and embrace\ndiverse evaluation methods with an acknowledgment of trade-offs between realism\nto socio-requirements and pragmatic costs. By mapping HCI and current NLG\nevaluation methods, we identify opportunities for new evaluation methods for\nLLMs to narrow the socio-technical gap and pose open questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 00:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

However, they are known to be unfair toward certain groups, for\ninstance, people speaking with an accent. In this work, we use the French\nCommon Voice dataset to quantify the biases of a pre-trained wav2vec~2.0 model\ntoward several demographic groups. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model on a\nvariety of fixed-size, carefully crafted training sets, we demonstrate the\nimportance of speaker diversity. We also run an in-depth analysis of the Common\nVoice corpus and identify important shortcomings that should be taken into\naccount by users of this dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 11:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

In the present first part, we investigate\nthe relationship between a pseudo MV-algebra with square root and its\ncorresponding unital $\\ell$-group in the scene of two-divisibility.\n  In the second part, we find some conditions under which a particular class of\npseudo MV-algebras can be embedded into pseudo MV-algebras with square roots.\nWe introduce and investigate the concepts of a strict square root of a pseudo\nMV-algebra and a square root closure, and we compare both notions. We show that\neach MV-algebra has a square root closure. Finally, using the square root of\nindividual elements of a pseudo MV-algebra, we find the greatest subalgebra of\na special pseudo MV-algebra with weak square root.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 07:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-08"}

In this context, besides energy efficiency and performance,\nreliability plays a crucial role since a system failure can jeopardize human\nlife. As with any other device, the reliability of hardware architectures\nrunning DNNs has to be evaluated, usually through costly fault injection\ncampaigns. This paper explores the approximation and fault resiliency of DNN\naccelerators. We propose to use approximate (AxC) arithmetic circuits to\nagilely emulate errors in hardware without performing fault injection on the\nDNN. To allow fast evaluation of AxC DNN, we developed an efficient GPU-based\nsimulation framework. Further, we propose a fine-grain analysis of fault\nresiliency by examining fault propagation and masking in networks\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 19:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}
