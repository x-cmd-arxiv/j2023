An ideal representation of a\nquantum state combines a succinct characterization informed by the system's\nstructure and symmetries, along with the ability to predict the physical\nobservables of interest. A number of machine learning approaches have been\nrecently used to construct such classical representations [1-6] which enable\npredictions of observables [7] and account for physical symmetries [8].\nHowever, the structure of a quantum state gets typically lost unless a\nspecialized ansatz is employed based on prior knowledge of the system [9-12].\nMoreover, most such approaches give no information about what states are easier\nto learn in comparison to others. Here, we propose a new generative\nenergy-based representation of quantum many-body states derived from Gibbs\ndistributions used for modeling the thermal states of classical spin systems.\nBased on the prior information on a family of quantum states, the energy\nfunction can be specified by a small number of parameters using an explicit\nlow-degree polynomial or a generic parametric family such as neural nets, and\ncan naturally include the known symmetries of the system. Our results show that\nsuch a representation can be efficiently learned from data using exact\nalgorithms in a form that enables the prediction of expectation values of\nphysical observables. Importantly, the structure of the learned energy function\nprovides a natural explanation for the hardness of learning for a given class\nof quantum states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 16:01:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

However, traditional SSL is built upon an\nassumption that labeled and unlabeled data should be from the same distribution\ne.g., classes and domains. However, in practical scenarios, unlabeled data\nwould be from unseen classes or unseen domains, and it is still challenging to\nexploit them by existing SSL methods. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a\nunified framework to leverage these unseen unlabeled data for open-scenario\nsemi-supervised medical image classification. We first design a novel scoring\nmechanism, called dual-path outliers estimation, to identify samples from\nunseen classes. Meanwhile, to extract unseen-domain samples, we then apply an\neffective variational autoencoder (VAE) pre-training. After that, we conduct\ndomain adaptation to fully exploit the value of the detected unseen-domain\nsamples to boost semi-supervised training. We evaluated our proposed framework\non dermatology and ophthalmology tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate our\nmodel can achieve superior classification performance in various medical SSL\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 16:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

Recently, machine learning methods have been\ndeveloped for in-vivo endoscopic stone recognition.

In this proposal, we learn Prototypical Parts\n(PPs) per kidney stone subtype, which are used by the DL model to generate an\noutput classification. Using PPs in the classification task enables case-based\nreasoning explanations for such output, thus making the model interpretable. In\naddition, we modify global visual characteristics to describe their relevance\nto the PPs and the sensitivity of our model's performance. With this, we\nprovide explanations with additional information at the sample, class and model\nlevels in contrast to previous works. Although our implementation's average\naccuracy is lower than state-of-the-art (SOTA) non-interpretable DL models by\n1.5 %, our models perform 2.8% better on perturbed images with a lower standard\ndeviation, without adversarial training. Thus, Learning PPs has the potential\nto create more robust DL models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 17:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

In differentiable rendering, BRDFs are\nreplaced by their differential BRDF counterparts which are real-valued and can\nhave negative values. This leads to a new source of variance arising from their\nchange in sign. Real-valued functions cannot be perfectly importance sampled by\na positive-valued PDF and the direct application of BRDF sampling leads to high\nvariance. Previous attempts at antithetic sampling only addressed the\nderivative with the roughness parameter of isotropic microfacet BRDFs. Our work\ngeneralizes BRDF derivative sampling to anisotropic microfacet models, mixture\nBRDFs, Oren-Nayar, Hanrahan-Krueger, among other analytic BRDFs.\n  Our method first decomposes the real-valued differential BRDF into a sum of\nsingle-signed functions, eliminating variance from a change in sign. Next, we\nimportance sample each of the resulting single-signed functions separately. The\nfirst decomposition, positivization, partitions the real-valued function based\non its sign, and is effective at variance reduction when applicable. However,\nit requires analytic knowledge of the roots of the differential BRDF, and for\nit to be analytically integrable too. Our key insight is that the single-signed\nfunctions can have overlapping support, which significantly broadens the ways\nwe can decompose a real-valued function. Our product and mixture decompositions\nexploit this property, and they allow us to support several BRDF derivatives\nthat positivization could not handle.

For this purpose, the design space\nfor an arbitrary alloy needs to be scoped and analyzed to identify the areas of\ndefects for different laser power-scan speed combinations and can be visualized\nusing a printability map. Constructing printability maps is typically a costly\nprocess due to the involvement of experiments, which restricts their\napplication in high-throughput product design. To reduce the cost and effort of\nconstructing printability maps, a fully computational framework is introduced\nin this work. The framework combines CALPHAD models and a reduced-order model\nto predict material properties. THen, an analytical thermal model, known as the\nEagar-Tsai model, utilizes some of these materials' properties to calculate the\nmelt pool geometry during the AM processes. In the end, printability maps are\nconstructed using material properties, melt pool dimensions, and commonly used\ncriteria for lack of fusion, balling, and keyholing defects. To validate the\nframework and its general application to laser powder-bed fusion alloys, five\ncommon additive manufacturing alloys are analyzed. Furthermore, NiTi-based\nalloys at three different compositions are evaluated to show the further\nextension of the framework to alloy systems at different compositions. The\ndefect regions in these printability maps are validated with corresponding\nexperimental observations to compare and benchmark the defect criteria and find\nthe optimal criterion set with the maximum accuracy for each unique material\ncomposition. Furthermore, printability maps for NiTi that are obtained from our\nframework are used in conjunction with process maps resulting from a\nmulti-model framework to guide the fabrication of defect-free additive\nmanufactured parts with tailorable properties and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 22:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

As computational cardiac modelling\nbecomes more prevalent, it is feasible to consider the generation of\ncomputationally derived SI curves as a supplement or precursor to curves that\nare experimentally derived. It is beneficial, therefore, to examine the\nprofiles of the SI curves produced by different cardiac tissue models to\ndetermine whether some models capture the refractory period more accurately\nthan others. In this study, we compare the unipolar SI curves of two tissue\nmodels: the current state-of-the-art bidomain model and the recently developed\nextracellular-membrane-intracellular (EMI) model. The EMI model's resolution of\nindividual cell structure makes it a more detailed model than the bidomain\nmodel, which forgoes the structure of individual cardiac cells in favour of\ntreating them homogeneously as a continuum. We find that the resulting SI\ncurves elucidate differences between the models, including that the behaviour\nof the EMI model is noticeably closer to the refractory behaviour of\nexperimental data compared to that of the bidomain model.

The timestamp of the POI to be predicted is of great significance,\nsince a user will go to different places at different times. However, most\nexisting methods either do not use this kind of temporal information, or just\nimplicitly fuse it with other contextual information. In this paper, we revisit\nthe problem of location recommendation and point out that explicitly modeling\ntemporal information is a great help when the model needs to predict not only\nthe next location but also further locations. In addition, state-of-the-art\nmethods do not make effective use of geographic information and suffer from the\nhard boundary problem when encoding geographic information by gridding.

Via extensive\ncomparisons with existing methods and ablation studies on five real-world\ndatasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed\nmethod under various settings.

Although it can\nbe alleviated by repeatedly replaying buffered data, the every-step replay is\ntime-consuming. In this paper, we study which modules in neural networks are\nmore prone to forgetting by investigating their training dynamics during CL.\nOur proposed metrics show that only a few modules are more task-specific and\nsensitively alter between tasks, while others can be shared across tasks as\ncommon knowledge. Hence, we attribute forgetting mainly to the former and find\nthat finetuning them only on a small buffer at the end of any CL method can\nbring non-trivial improvement. Due to the small number of finetuned parameters,\nsuch ``Forgetting Prioritized Finetuning (FPF)'' is efficient in computation.\nWe further propose a more efficient and simpler method that entirely removes\nthe every-step replay and replaces them by only $k$-times of FPF periodically\ntriggered during CL. Surprisingly, this ``$k$-FPF'' performs comparably to FPF\nand outperforms the SOTA CL methods but significantly reduces their\ncomputational overhead and cost. In experiments on several benchmarks of class-\nand domain-incremental CL, FPF consistently improves existing CL methods by a\nlarge margin, and $k$-FPF further excels in efficiency without degrading the\naccuracy.

A human\nbeing would gain more experiences through problem-solving, which helps her/him\nin solving a new unseen problem. Yet an optimization algorithm never gains any\nexperiences by solving more problems. In recent years, efforts have been made\ntowards endowing optimization algorithms with some abilities of experience\nlearning, which is regarded as experience-based optimization. In this paper, we\nargue that hard optimization problems could be tackled efficiently by making\nbetter use of experiences gained in related problems. We demonstrate our ideas\nin the context of expensive optimization, where we aim to find a near-optimal\nsolution to an expensive optimization problem with as few fitness evaluations\nas possible. To achieve this, we propose an experience-based surrogate-assisted\nevolutionary algorithm (SAEA) framework to enhance the optimization efficiency\nof expensive problems, where experiences are gained across related expensive\ntasks via a novel meta-learning method.

Existing defensive methods neither\nguarantee performance facing new data/tasks or adversarial attacks nor provide\ninsights to understand GNN robustness from an architectural perspective. Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS) has the potential to solve this problem by automating\nGNN architecture designs. Nevertheless, current graph NAS approaches lack\nrobust design and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Robust Neural Architecture search framework for\nGNNs (G-RNA).

Furthermore, we define a robustness metric to\nguide the search procedure, which helps to filter robust architectures. In this\nway, G-RNA helps understand GNN robustness from an architectural perspective\nand effectively searches for optimal adversarial robust GNNs.

It is challenging to optimize pipelines based on this\nparadigm in an end-to-end manner. As an alternative, generative retrieval\nrepresents documents as identifiers (docid) and retrieves documents by\ngenerating docids, enabling end-to-end modeling of document retrieval tasks.\nHowever, it is an open question how one should define the document identifiers.\nCurrent approaches to the task of defining document identifiers rely on fixed\nrule-based docids, such as the title of a document or the result of clustering\nBERT embeddings, which often fail to capture the complete semantic information\nof a document. We propose GenRet, a document tokenization learning method to\naddress the challenge of defining document identifiers for generative\nretrieval. GenRet learns to tokenize documents into short discrete\nrepresentations (i.e., docids) via a discrete auto-encoding approach. Three\ncomponents are included in GenRet: (i) a tokenization model that produces\ndocids for documents; (ii) a reconstruction model that learns to reconstruct a\ndocument based on a docid; and (iii) a sequence-to-sequence retrieval model\nthat generates relevant document identifiers directly for a designated query.\nBy using an auto-encoding framework, GenRet learns semantic docids in a fully\nend-to-end manner. We also develop a progressive training scheme to capture the\nautoregressive nature of docids and to stabilize training. We conduct\nexperiments on the NQ320K, MS MARCO, and BEIR datasets to assess the\neffectiveness of GenRet. GenRet establishes the new state-of-the-art on the\nNQ320K dataset. Especially, compared to generative retrieval baselines, GenRet\ncan achieve significant improvements on the unseen documents. GenRet also\noutperforms comparable baselines on MS MARCO and BEIR, demonstrating the\nmethod's generalizability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2023 06:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

However, the discourse of online\nfake news is typically subtle and it requires expert knowledge to use textual\ninformation to debunk fake news. Recently, studies focusing on multimodal fake\nnews detection have outperformed text-only methods. Recent approaches utilizing\nthe pre-trained model to extract unimodal features, or fine-tuning the\npre-trained model directly, have become a new paradigm for detecting fake news.\nAgain, this paradigm either requires a large number of training instances, or\nupdates the entire set of pre-trained model parameters, making real-world fake\nnews detection impractical. Furthermore, traditional multimodal methods fuse\nthe cross-modal features directly without considering that the uncorrelated\nsemantic representation might inject noise into the multimodal features. This\npaper proposes a Similarity-Aware Multimodal Prompt Learning (SAMPLE)\nframework. First, we incorporate prompt learning into multimodal fake news\ndetection. Prompt learning, which only tunes prompts with a frozen language\nmodel, can reduce memory usage significantly and achieve comparable\nperformances, compared with fine-tuning. We analyse three prompt templates with\na soft verbalizer to detect fake news. In addition, we introduce the\nsimilarity-aware fusing method to adaptively fuse the intensity of multimodal\nrepresentation and mitigate the noise injection via uncorrelated cross-modal\nfeatures. For evaluation, SAMPLE surpasses the F1 and the accuracies of\nprevious works on two benchmark multimodal datasets, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of the proposed method in detecting fake news. In addition,\nSAMPLE also is superior to other approaches regardless of few-shot and\ndata-rich settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2023 08:10:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 06:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

In this paper, we introduce HyperINR, a novel hypernetwork\narchitecture capable of directly predicting the weights for a compact INR. By\nharnessing an ensemble of multiresolution hash encoding units in unison, the\nresulting INR attains state-of-the-art inference performance (up to 100x higher\ninference bandwidth) and can support interactive photo-realistic volume\nvisualization. Additionally, by incorporating knowledge distillation,\nexceptional data and visualization generation quality is achieved, making our\nmethod valuable for real-time parameter exploration. We validate the\neffectiveness of the HyperINR architecture through a comprehensive ablation\nstudy.

To optimize fast-charging\nstrategies under various constraints, particularly safety limits, we propose a\nnovel deep Bayesian optimization (BO) approach that utilizes Bayesian recurrent\nneural network (BRNN) as the surrogate model, given its capability in handling\nsequential data. In addition, a combined acquisition function of expected\nimprovement (EI) and upper confidence bound (UCB) is developed to better\nbalance the exploitation and exploration.

The goal of tackling this challenging\nproblem is to find the path for each agent in a finite runtime while maximizing\nthe throughput. However, existing methods encounter exponential growth of\nruntime and undesirable phenomena of deadlocks and rerouting as the map size or\nagent density grows. To address these challenges in lifelong MAPF, we explore\nthe idea of highways mainly studied for one-shot MAPF (i.e., finding paths at\nonce beforehand), which reduces the complexity of the problem by encouraging\nagents to move in the same direction. We utilize two methods to incorporate the\nhighway idea into the lifelong MAPF framework and discuss the properties that\nminimize the existing problems of deadlocks and rerouting. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that the runtime is considerably reduced and the decay of\nthroughput is gradually insignificant as the map size enlarges under the\nsettings of the highway.

In this work, we focus on the more general\nNon-overlapping Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (NCSR) scenario. NCSR is\nchallenging because there are no overlapped entities (e.g., users and items)\nbetween domains, and there is only users' implicit feedback and no content\ninformation. Previous CR methods cannot solve NCSR well, since (1) they either\nneed extra content to align domains or need explicit domain alignment\nconstraints to reduce the domain discrepancy from domain-invariant features,\n(2) they pay more attention to users' explicit feedback (i.e., users' rating\ndata) and cannot well capture their sequential interaction patterns, (3) they\nusually do a single-target cross-domain recommendation task and seldom\ninvestigate the dual-target ones. Considering the above challenges, we propose\nPrompt Learning-based Cross-domain Recommender (PLCR), an automated\nprompting-based recommendation framework for the NCSR task. Specifically, to\naddress the challenge (1), PLCR resorts to learning domain-invariant and\ndomain-specific representations via its prompt learning component, where the\ndomain alignment constraint is discarded.

To explore this, we investigate the band structures of a lattice\nmodel describing the magnetic topological insulator film that supports the\naxion insulator, Chern insulator, and semi-magnetic topological insulator\nphases. We reveal that the gapped and gapless surface bands in the three phases\nare characterized by an integer-quantized Hall conductance and a half-quantized\nHall conductance, respectively. This result is distinct from the previous\nconsensus that the gapped surface band is responsible for the half-quantized\nHall conductance and the gapless band should exhibit zero Hall response. We\npropose an effective model to describe the three phases and show that the\nlow-energy dispersion of the surface bands inherits from the surface Dirac\nfermions. The gapped surface band manifests a nearly half-quantized Hall\nconductance at low energy near the center of Brillouin zone, but is compensated\nby another nearly half-quantized Hall conductance at high energy near the\nboundary of Brillouin zone because a single band can only have an\ninteger-quantized Hall conductance. The gapless state hosts a zero Hall\nconductance at low energy but is compensated by another half-quantized Hall\nconductance at high energy, and thus the half-quantized Hall conductance can\nonly originate from the gapless band. Moreover, we calculate the layer-resolved\nHall conductance of the system. The conclusion suggests that the individual\ngapped surface band alone does not support the half-quantized surface Hall\neffect in a lattice model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2023 12:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

Hadwiger's famous coloring conjecture from\n1943 states that $f_\\chi(K_t)=t-1$ for every $t \\ge 2$. In contrast, for list\ncoloring it is known that $2t-o(t) \\le f_\\ell(K_t) \\le O(t (\\log \\log t)^6)$\nand thus, $f_\\ell(K_t)$ is bounded away from the conjectured value $t-1$ for\n$f_\\chi(K_t)$ by at least a constant factor. The so-called $H$-Hadwiger's\nconjecture, proposed by Seymour, asks to prove that $f_\\chi(H)=\\textsf{v}(H)-1$\nfor a given graph $H$ (which would be implied by Hadwiger's conjecture). In\nthis paper, we prove several new lower bounds on $f_\\ell(H)$, thus exploring\nthe limits of a list coloring extension of $H$-Hadwiger's conjecture. Our main\nresults are:\n  For every $\\varepsilon>0$ and all sufficiently large graphs $H$ we have\n$f_\\ell(H)\\ge (1-\\varepsilon)(\\textsf{v}(H)+\\kappa(H))$, where $\\kappa(H)$\ndenotes the vertex-connectivity of $H$.\n  For every $\\varepsilon>0$ there exists $C=C(\\varepsilon)>0$ such that\nasymptotically almost every $n$-vertex graph $H$ with $\\left\\lceil C n\\log\nn\\right\\rceil$ edges satisfies $f_\\ell(H)\\ge (2-\\varepsilon)n$.\n  The first result generalizes recent results on complete and complete\nbipartite graphs and shows that the list chromatic number of $H$-minor-free\ngraphs is separated from the natural lower bound $(\\textsf{v}(H)-1)$ by a\nconstant factor for all large graphs $H$ of linear connectivity. The second\nresult tells us that even when $H$ is a very sparse graph (with an average\ndegree just logarithmic in its order), $f_\\ell(H)$ can still be separated from\n$(\\textsf{v}(H)-1)$ by a constant factor arbitrarily close to $2$.

An important\nvariant is when individual observations are counted with some probability less\nthan one. This can occur in different contexts: from missing data to estimating\nthe statistics across subsamples. In such situations, the spatial mean is a\nratio of random variables, whose statistics involve approximate estimators\nderived through series expansion. The present paper considers truncated\nestimators of variance of the spatial mean and their general structure in the\npresence of missing data. To all orders, the variance estimator depends only on\nthe first and second moments of the underlying field, and convergence requires\nthese moments to be finite. Furthermore, convergence occurs if either the\nprobability of counting individual observations is larger than 1/2 or the\nnumber of point observations is large. In case the point observations are\nweighted uniformly, the estimators are easily found using combinatorics and\ninvolve Stirling numbers of the second kind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2023 14:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

Both ML architectures, namely Deep Neural Network (DNN) and\nExtreme Learning Machine (ELM), are developed {to provide improved data\ndetection performance} and compared with the conventional matched filter (MF)\ndetector equipped with the minimum mean square error (MMSE) and least square\n(LS) channel estimators. The bit-error-rate (BER) performance vs. computational\ncomplexity trade-off is analyzed, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed\nDNN-OFDM and ELM-OFDM detectors methodologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 19:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Two methods of solving this equation, given by\nEuler, yield parametric solutions given by polynomials of degrees 7 and 13.\nSeveral other parametric solutions are now known, and with the exception of one\nsolution of degree 11, all the published solutions are of degrees $6n+1$ for\nsome integer $n$. The method described in this paper yields new parametric\nsolutions of degrees 21, 39 and 75, that is, degrees that are expressible as\n$6n+3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2023 03:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}
