Realizing these promises requires the innovations of AV driving\nbehaviors, city plans and infrastructure, and traffic and transportation\npolicies to join forces. However, the complex interdependencies among AV, city,\nand policy design issues can hinder their innovation. We argue the path towards\nbetter AV cities is not a process of matching city designs and policies with\nAVs' technological innovations, but a process of iterative prototyping of all\nthree simultaneously: Innovations can happen step-wise as the knot of AV, city,\nand policy design loosens and tightens, unwinds and reties. In this paper, we\nask: How can innovators innovate AVs, city environments, and policies\nsimultaneously and productively toward better AV cities? The paper has two\nparts. First, we map out the interconnections among the many AV, city, and\npolicy design decisions, based on a literature review spanning HCI/HRI,\ntransportation science, urban studies, law and policy, operations research,\neconomy, and philosophy. This map can help innovators identify design\nconstraints and opportunities across the traditional AV/city/policy design\ndisciplinary bounds. Second, we review the respective methods for AV, city, and\npolicy design, and identify key barriers in combining them: (1) Organizational\nbarriers to AV-city-policy design collaboration, (2) computational barriers to\nmulti-granularity AV-city-policy simulation, and (3) different assumptions and\ngoals in joint AV-city-policy optimization. We discuss two broad approaches\nthat can potentially address these challenges, namely, \"low-fidelity\nintegrative City-AV-Policy Simulation (iCAPS)\" and \"participatory design\noptimization\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 16:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

Let $\\rho_c(G)$, the co-density of $G$, be defined as the\nminimum of $|E^+(U)|/((|U|+1)/2)$ ranging over all $U\\subseteq V(G)$ with $|U|\n$ odd and at least 3.

This encompasses uniform demands such as the\nMinimum $k$-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem as well as nonuniform\ndemands such as the Survivable Network Design problem (SND). In a recent paper\nby [Dinitz, Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] , the authors observed that a\nweakness of these formulations is that it does not enable one to consider\nfault-tolerance in graphs that have just one small cut. To remedy this, they\nintroduced new variants of these problems under the notion \"relative\"\nfault-tolerance. Informally, this requires not that two nodes are connected if\nthere are a bounded number of faults (as in the classical setting), but that\ntwo nodes are connected if there are a bounded number of faults and the two\nnodes are connected in the underlying graph post-faults. The problem is already\nhighly non-trivial even for the case of a single demand.\n  Due to difficulties introduced by this new notion of fault-tolerance, the\nresults in [Dinitz, Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] are quite limited. For the\nRelative Survivable Network Design problem (RSND), when the demands are not\nuniform they give a nontrivial result only when there is a single demand with a\nconnectivity requirement of $3$: a non-optimal $27/4$-approximation. We\nstrengthen this result in two significant ways: We give a $2$-approximation for\nRSND where all requirements are at most $3$, and a $2^{O(k^2)}$-approximation\nfor RSND with a single demand of arbitrary value $k$. To achieve these results,\nwe first use the \"cactus representation'' of minimum cuts to give a lossless\nreduction to normal SND. Second, we extend the techniques of [Dinitz,\nKoranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] to prove a generalized and more complex version\nof their structure theorem, which we then use to design a recursive\napproximation algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 16:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

However, many studies fail to include realistic constraints in the model,\nwhich limits practical trading strategies. This study introduces realistic\nconstraints, such as transaction and holding costs, into an optimisation model.\nDue to the non-convex nature of this problem, metaheuristic algorithms, such as\nNSGA-II, R-NSGA-II, NSGA-III and U-NSGA-III, will play a vital role in solving\nthe problem.

To this end, we propose\na sim-to-real strategy to train a learning-based framework that can take as\ninput one or multiple images and outputs a full set of mechanical parameters.\nThanks to carefully designed data augmentation and transfer learning protocols,\nour solution generalizes to real images despite being trained only on synthetic\ndata, hence successfully closing the sim-to-real loop.Key in our work is to\ndemonstrate that evaluating the regression accuracy based on the similarity at\nparameter space leads to an inaccurate distances that do not match the human\nperception. To overcome this, we propose a novel metric for fabric drape\nsimilarity that operates on the image domain instead on the parameter space,\nallowing us to evaluate our estimation within the context of a similarity rank.\nWe show that out metric correlates with human judgments about the perception of\ndrape similarity, and that our model predictions produce perceptually accurate\nresults compared to the ground truth parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 17:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

To\nwork out the quantum partition function, from which the thermodynamics of the\nsystem follows, we use the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity\nthat identifies the path integral of the gravitational system with the\npartition function. In a semiclassical approximation, one needs only to compute\nthe classical action of the system. Then, one finds that the total entropy,\ni.e., the sum of black hole and matter entropies, is a function of the\ngravitational radius of the system alone. So, the black hole inside the shell\nhas no direct influence on the entropy. One also finds the free energy, the\nthermodynamic energy, and the temperature stratification. The reservoir\ntemperature is composed of a free function of the gravitational radius of the\nsystem divided by the redshift. Upon specification of the reduced temperature\nfree function, the solutions for the gravitational radii compatible with the\ndata are found. The black hole inside has two possible horizon radii. It is\nshown that there is a first law of thermodynamics for the system, another for\nthe hot shell, and yet another for the black hole. A thermodynamic stability\nanalysis is performed. By specifying for the free function the Hawking\ntemperature for the gravitational radius of the system, which is not a black\nhole, one finds a remarkable exact thermodynamic solution. With it one\nestablishes that pure black holes, hot shells with a black hole, pure hot\nshells, and hot flat spaces are phases that cohabit in the ensemble, with some\nacting as thermodynamic mimickers. This exact solution is a model to situations\ninvolving black holes and hot gravitons.

Inspired by the experimentally observed prolate composite\ndroplets and elliptic camphor disks, we employ simulations to investigate the\nphoretic dynamics of an elliptic disk that uniformly emits solutes in the\ncreeping flow regime. By varying the disk's eccentricity $e$ and the P'eclet\nnumber $\\Pe$, we distinguish five disk behaviors: stationary, steady, orbiting,\nperiodic, and chaotic. We perform a global linear stability analysis (LSA) to\npredict the onset of instability and the most unstable eigenmode when a\nstationary disk spontaneously transitions to steady self-propulsion. In\naddition to the LSA, we use an alternative approach to determine the\nperturbation growth rate, offering valuable insights into the competing roles\nof advection and diffusion. The steady motion features a transition from a\npuller-type to a neutral-type swimmer as $\\Pe$ increases, which occurs as a\nbimodal concentration profile at the disk surface shifts to a polarized solute\ndistribution, driven by convective solute transport. An elliptic disk achieves\nan orbiting motion through a chiral symmetry-breaking instability, wherein it\nrepeatedly follows a circular path while simultaneously rotating. The swinging\nperiodic motion, emerging from a steady motion via a supercritical Hopf\nbifurcation, is characterized by a wave-like trajectory.

In this framework, strictly causal linear disturbance feedback\ncontrollers are designed to minimize the worst-case expected regret.

Building on a well-established\nduality theory for optimal transport problems, we show how to equivalently\nreformulate this minimax regret optimal control problem as a tractable\nsemidefinite program.

However, splitting in this manner may fail to capture the\ngeometric properties of the data. Thus, oblique decision trees generate the\noblique hyperplane for splitting the data at each non-leaf node. Oblique\ndecision trees capture the geometric properties of the data and hence, show\nbetter generalization. The performance of the oblique decision trees depends on\nthe way oblique hyperplanes are generate and the data used for the generation\nof those hyperplanes. Recently, multiple classifiers have been used in a\nheterogeneous random forest (RaF) classifier, however, it fails to generate the\ntrees of proper depth. Moreover, double RaF studies highlighted that larger\ntrees can be generated via bootstrapping the data at each non-leaf node and\nsplitting the original data instead of the bootstrapped data recently. The\nstudy of heterogeneous RaF lacks the generation of larger trees while as the\ndouble RaF based model fails to take over the geometric characteristics of the\ndata. To address these shortcomings, we propose heterogeneous oblique double\nRaF. The proposed model employs several linear classifiers at each non-leaf\nnode on the bootstrapped data and splits the original data based on the optimal\nlinear classifier. The optimal hyperplane corresponds to the models based on\nthe optimized impurity criterion.

Based on Segment-Anything Model\n(SAM), we make the first attempt to the mask-free image inpainting and propose\na new paradigm of ``clicking and filling'', which is named as Inpaint Anything\n(IA). The core idea behind IA is to combine the strengths of different models\nin order to build a very powerful and user-friendly pipeline for solving\ninpainting-related problems. IA supports three main features: (i) Remove\nAnything: users could click on an object and IA will remove it and smooth the\n``hole'' with the context; (ii) Fill Anything: after certain objects removal,\nusers could provide text-based prompts to IA, and then it will fill the hole\nwith the corresponding generative content via driving AIGC models like Stable\nDiffusion; (iii) Replace Anything: with IA, users have another option to retain\nthe click-selected object and replace the remaining background with the newly\ngenerated scenes. We are also very willing to help everyone share and promote\nnew projects based on our Inpaint Anything (IA).

We proceeded to analyze these references, focusing on\nfactors such as the number of citations, publication date, and the journal in\nwhich the work was published. Our findings indicate that GPT tends to cite\nhighly-cited publications in environmental science, with a median citation\ncount of 1184.5.

In this work, we explore the promises and challenges of developing\nmultimodal foundation models for GeoAI. We first investigate the potential of\nmany existing FMs by testing their performances on seven tasks across multiple\ngeospatial subdomains including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban\nGeography, and Remote Sensing. Our results indicate that on several geospatial\ntasks that only involve text modality such as toponym recognition, location\ndescription recognition, and US state-level/county-level dementia time series\nforecasting, these task-agnostic LLMs can outperform task-specific\nfully-supervised models in a zero-shot or few-shot learning setting.

We first study a setting when\nthe data's inputs belong to one of $K$ discrete distributions and formalize\nthis problem via a loss that captures the labeling cost and the prediction\nerror. When the labeling cost is $B$, our algorithm, which chooses to label a\npoint if the uncertainty is larger than a time and cost dependent threshold,\nachieves a worst-case upper bound of $O(B^{\\frac{1}{3}} K^{\\frac{1}{3}}\nT^{\\frac{2}{3}})$ on the loss after $T$ rounds. We also provide a more nuanced\nupper bound which demonstrates that the algorithm can adapt to the arrival\npattern, and achieves better performance when the arrival pattern is more\nfavorable. We complement both upper bounds with matching lower bounds. We next\nstudy this problem when the inputs belong to a continuous domain and the output\nof the experiment is a smooth function with bounded RKHS norm. After $T$ rounds\nin $d$ dimensions, we show that the loss is bounded by $O(B^{\\frac{1}{d+3}}\nT^{\\frac{d+2}{d+3}})$ in an RKHS with a squared exponential kernel and by\n$O(B^{\\frac{1}{2d+3}} T^{\\frac{2d+2}{2d+3}})$ in an RKHS with a Mat\\'ern\nkernel.

This approach -- Predictive Incrementality by\nExperimentation (PIE) -- frames the task of estimating the causal effect of an\nad campaign as a prediction problem, with the unit of observation being an RCT\nitself. In contrast, traditional causal inference approaches with observational\ndata seek to adjust covariate imbalance at the user level. A key insight is to\nuse post-campaign features, such as last-click conversion counts, that do not\nrequire an RCT, as features in our predictive model. We find that our PIE model\nrecovers RCT-derived incremental conversions per dollar (ICPD) much better than\nthe program evaluation approaches analyzed in Gordon et al. (forthcoming). The\nprediction errors from the best PIE model are 48%, 42%, and 62% of the\nRCT-based average ICPD for upper-, mid-, and lower-funnel conversion outcomes,\nrespectively. In contrast, across the same data, the average prediction error\nof stratified propensity score matching exceeds 491%, and that of\ndouble/debiased machine learning exceeds 2,904%. Using a decision-making\nframework inspired by industry, we show that PIE leads to different decisions\ncompared to RCTs for only 6% of upper-funnel, 7% of mid-funnel, and 13% of\nlower-funnel outcomes. We conclude that PIE could enable advertising platforms\nto scale causal ad measurement by extrapolating from a limited number of RCTs\nto a large set of non-experimental ad campaigns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 21:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

However, hardware deployment of DGNNs still\nremains a challenge. First, DGNNs do not fully utilize hardware resources\nbecause temporal data dependencies cause low hardware parallelism.\nAdditionally, there is currently a lack of generic DGNN hardware accelerator\nframeworks, and existing GNN accelerator frameworks have limited ability to\nhandle dynamic graphs with changing topologies and node features. To address\nthe aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we propose DGNN-Booster, which is\na novel Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) accelerator framework for\nreal-time DGNN inference using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). It includes two\ndifferent FPGA accelerator designs with different dataflows that can support\nthe most widely used DGNNs.

The principal faces adverse selection, as\nagents receive private information over time that remains unobserved by the\nprincipal, and designs a mechanism of a task policy profile, which outlines the\nevolution of available action menus for agents; a coupling policy profile that\ndirectly impacts agents' utilities; and an off-switch function profile that\nassigns compensation or penalties if an agent withdraws.

A major challenge for making accurate and robust\naction predictions is the problem of confounding, which if left untreated can\nlead to prediction errors. The partially observable Markov decision process\n(POMDP) is a widely-used framework to model these stochastic and\npartially-observable decision-making problems. However, due to a lack of\nexplicit causal semantics, POMDP planning methods are prone to confounding bias\nand thus in the presence of unobserved confounders may produce underperforming\npolicies. This paper presents a novel causally-informed extension of \"anytime\nregularized determinized sparse partially observable tree\" (AR-DESPOT), a\nmodern anytime online POMDP planner, using causal modelling and inference to\neliminate errors caused by unmeasured confounder variables. We further propose\na method to learn offline the partial parameterisation of the causal model for\nplanning, from ground truth model data. We evaluate our methods on a toy\nproblem with an unobserved confounder and show that the learned causal model is\nhighly accurate, while our planning method is more robust to confounding and\nproduces overall higher performing policies than AR-DESPOT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 22:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

Recently, we have introduced an original approach\nto periodic boundary conditions, named Clifford Boundary Conditions. It\nconsiders a finite fragment extracted from a periodic system and the\nmodification of its topology into that of a Clifford Torus. The quantity\nrepresenting the position is modified in order to fulfill the system\nperiodicity.

In this work, we simulate lightcurves with baseline trends and assess\nthe impact on planet maps. Baseline trends can be erroneously modeled by\nincorrect astrophysical planet map features, but there are clues to avoid this\npitfall in both the residuals of the lightcurve during eclipse and sharp\nfeatures at the terminator of the planet.

Although UAV remote sensing systems have the ability to detect\nvarious objects, small-scale objects can be challenging to detect reliably due\nto factors such as object size, image degradation, and real-time limitations.\nTo tackle these issues, a real-time object detection algorithm (YOLO-Drone) is\nproposed and applied to two new UAV platforms as well as a specific light\nsource (silicon-based golden LED).

We propose a fixed\nnon-stockout-probability (FP3) policy, implying that each period the order size\nensures that P3, the probability of no-stockout at the end of the period of\narrival of this order, equals some target value. The FP3-policy can be computed\nefficiently and accurately from an exact recursive expression and two-moment\nfits to the emerging random variables. We use the lost-sales optimality\nequation to compute the optimal FP3-policy. Comparison against the optimal\npolicy for discrete demand suggests that the fixed P3-policy is\nclose-to-optimal.

Most investigations of excitable media consider\nsituations where the amplifying and suppressing forces necessary for spiking\ncoexist at every point in space. In this case, spiking requires a fine-tuned\nratio between local amplification and suppression strengths. But, in Nature and\nengineered systems, these forces can be segregated in space, forming structures\nlike interfaces and boundaries. Here, we show how boundaries can generate and\nprotect spiking if the reacting components can spread out: even arbitrarily\nweak diffusion can cause spiking at the edge between two non-excitable media.\nThis edge spiking is a robust phenomenon that can occur even if the ratio\nbetween amplification and suppression does not allow spiking when the two sides\nare homogeneously mixed. We analytically derive a spiking phase diagram that\ndepends on two parameters: (i) the ratio between the system size and the\ncharacteristic diffusive length-scale, and (ii) the ratio between the\namplification and suppression strengths. Our analysis explains recent\nexperimental observations of action potentials at the interface between two\nnon-excitable bioelectric tissues.

PPG images from the publicly\navailable blood pressure classification dataset were used to train the model.\nMulticlass classification for various PPG stages were done. The results show\nthe proposed method achieves high accuracy in classifying hypertension stages,\ndemonstrating the potential of PPG signals and deep learning models in\nhypertension diagnosis and management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 06:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

'Oumuamua passed through the inner solar system on a\nhyperbolic (i.e., unbound) trajectory. Its discovery occurred after perihelion\npassage, and near the time of its closest approach to Earth. After being\nobservable for approximately four months, the object became too faint and was\nlost at a heliocentric distance of around 3 au. Intriguingly, analysis of the\ntrajectory of 'Oumuamua revealed that a dynamical model including only\ngravitational accelerations does not provide a satisfactory fit of the data,\nand a non-gravitational term must be included. The detected non-gravitational\nacceleration is compatible with either solar radiation pressure or recoil due\nto outgassing. It has, however, proved challenging to reconcile either\ninterpretation with the existing quantitative models of such effects without\npostulating unusual physical properties for 'Oumuamua (such as extremely low\ndensity and/or unusual geometry, non-standard chemistry). My analysis\nindependently confirms the detection of the non-gravitational acceleration.\nAfter comparing several possible parametrizations for this effects, I find a\nstrong preference for a radially directed non-gravitational acceleration,\npointing away from the Sun, and a moderate preference for a power-law scaling\nwith the heliocentric distance, with an exponent between 1 and 2.

Since the low-level\nlocal information is crucial to the transferability of the representation, it\nis beneficial to preserve the locality in attention layers. In this paper, we\nencourage the model to preserve more local information as the training\nprocedure goes on and devise a Locality-Preserved Attention (LPA) layer to\nemphasize the importance of local features.

Despite the fact that many existing\nstudies optimize the performance of GDRWs on multi-core CPUs, massive random\nmemory accesses and costly synchronizations cause severe resource\nunderutilization, and the processing of GDRWs is usually the key performance\nbottleneck in many graph applications. This paper studies an alternative\narchitecture, FPGA, to address these issues in GDRWs, as FPGA has the ability\nof hardware customization so that we are able to explore fine-grained pipeline\nexecution and specialized memory access optimizations. Specifically, we propose\nLightRW, a novel FPGA-based accelerator for GDRWs. LightRW embraces a series of\noptimizations to enable fine-grained pipeline execution on the chip and to\nexploit the massive parallelism of FPGA while significantly reducing memory\naccesses. As current commonly used sampling methods in GDRWs do not efficiently\nsupport fine-grained pipeline execution, we develop a parallelized reservoir\nsampling method to sample multiple vertices per cycle for efficient pipeline\nexecution. To address the random memory access issues, we propose a\ndegree-aware configurable caching method that buffers hot vertices on-chip to\nalleviate random memory accesses and a dynamic burst access engine that\nefficiently retrieves neighbors. Experimental results show that our\noptimization techniques are able to improve the performance of GDRWs on FPGA\nsignificantly.

Consistently with results of previous direct\nnumerical simulations, the influence of the mean flow stratification on\nstochastic forcing amplifications is found to be non-negligible only for\nstreamwise-elongated large-scale structures. Unstable stratification is found\nto enhance the peak variance of the response, except for the velocity response\nto thermal forcing, and to increase the spanwise wavelength of the most\namplified structures. Stable stratification induces opposite effects. The\nspanwise wavelengths maximizing the different types of variance amplifications,\nall converge to approximately 6h when approaching the linear instability\nthreshold where large-scale coherent rolls become linearly unstable. In the\npresence of even moderately unstable stratification, the profiles of turbulent\nbuoyancy and momentum fluxes and of rms vertical velocity of all types of most\namplified stochastic responses are nearly indistinguishable from those of the\ncritical mode becoming unstable at the critical Richardson number.

It is a procedure of dividing the\ntotal sample among pairwise disjoint subsets of a finite population, called\nstrata, such that for chosen survey sampling designs in strata, it produces the\nsmallest variance for estimating a population total (or mean) of a given study\nvariable. In this paper we are concerned with the optimal allocation of a\nsample, under lower and upper bounds imposed jointly on the sample\nstrata-sizes. We will consider a family of sampling designs that give rise to\nvariances of estimators of a natural generic form. In particular, this family\nincludes simple random sampling without replacement (abbreviated as SI) in\nstrata, which is perhaps, the most important example of stratified sampling\ndesign. First, we identify the allocation problem as a convex optimization\nproblem. This methodology allows to establish a generic form of the optimal\nsolution, so called optimality conditions. Second, based on these optimality\nconditions, we propose new and efficient recursive algorithm, named RNABOX,\nwhich solves the allocation problem considered. This new algorithm can be\nviewed as a generalization of the classical recursive Neyman allocation\nalgorithm, a popular tool for optimal sample allocation in stratified sampling\nwith SI design in all strata, when only upper bounds are imposed on sample\nstrata-sizes. We implement the RNABOX in R as a part of our package stratallo,\nwhich is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Finally, in\nthe context of the established optimality conditions, we briefly discuss two\nexisting methodologies dedicated to the allocation problem being studied: the\nnoptcond algorithm introduced in Gabler, Ganninger and M\\\"unnich (2012); and\nfixed iteration procedures from M\\\"unnich, Sachs and Wagner (2012).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 10:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

So far the explanation of this difference has been mostly searched\nfor in the limitations of the non-muonic experiments as the extrapolation to\n$Q^2 \\rightarrow 0$ GeV$^2$ for electron scattering. Since the time scale of\nthe vacuum polarization $e^+e^--$pairs, causing the bulk contribution of the\nLamb shift in muonic hydrogen, is very much shorter than that of the photon\nexchanges, causing the Coulomb interaction, it is argued that the muon on its\norbit around the proton has to be considered as quasi particle dressed by\n$e^+e^--$pairs and may not be treated as a bare particle in an external Uehling\npotential.

In contrast to the divergent density of\nstates (DOS) in one and two dimensions, the VHS is generally non-divergent in\nthree dimension (3D). Here we report the observation of divergent 3D VHS in a\ntopological magnet EuCd2As2 by magneto-infrared spectroscopy. The divergent 3D\nVHS is generated by substantially tuning the energy dispersion and momentum\ndistribution of the Weyl bands. Applying the external magnetic field allows\neffective control of exchange interaction between itinerant electrons and local\nmagnetic moments. As a result, the 3D Weyl bands are found to shift\ncontinuously with the canting of magnetic moment, which leads to the gradual\nincrease of Fermi velocity. Above the critical field Bc ~ 0.6 T, the formation\nof a divergent 3D VHS is evidenced by the abrupt spectral emergence of the\ninter-band transitions. This type of VHS allows in situ tunability by external\nmagnetic fields with adjustable energy position, DOS and even its presence. The\nexperimental spectrum and the emergence of 3D VHS can be quantitatively\ndescribed by a two-band minimal model of Weyl semimetal with the exchange\ninteraction. The deduced model predicts three additional optical transitions\nand their energy crossings, which are quantitatively verified by the\nmagneto-near-infrared spectrum. Our results pave the way to exploring divergent\nVHS in the 3D systems with strong tunability and provide a platform to uncover\nthe coordination between electronic correlation and the topological phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 10:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

We exploit the relation of the rank of a matrix and\nthe fact that a low-rank approximation can describe the raw visibility data as\na sum of basic components where each basic component corresponds to a specific\nFourier component of the sky distribution. As such, the entire visibility data\nis represented as a collection of data matrices from baselines, instead of a\nsingle tensor. The proposed methods are formulated as follows: provided a large\ndataset of the entire visibility data; the first algorithm, named $simple~SVD$\nprojects the data into a regular sampling space of rank$-r$ data matrices. In\nthis space, the data for all the baselines has the same rank, which makes the\ncompression factor equal across all baselines. The second algorithm, named\n$BDSVD$ projects the data into an irregular sampling space of rank$-r_{pq}$\ndata matrices. The subscript $pq$ indicates that the rank of the data matrix\nvaries across baselines $pq$, which makes the compression factor\nbaseline-dependent. MeerKAT and the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry\nNetwork are used as reference telescopes to evaluate and compare the\nperformance of the proposed methods against traditional methods, such as\ntraditional averaging and baseline-dependent averaging (BDA). For the same\nspatial resolution threshold, both $simple~SVD$ and $BDSVD$ show effective\ncompression by two-orders of magnitude higher than traditional averaging and\nBDA. At the same space-saving rate, there is no decrease in spatial resolution\nand there is a reduction in the noise variance in the data which improves the\nS/N to over $1.5$ dB at the edges of the field-of-view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 10:50:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

In this paper, we propose a cell-free massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) aided computing system by deploying multi-tier computing\nnodes to improve the computation performance. At first, we investigate the\ncomputational latency and the total energy consumption for task computation,\nregarded as total cost. Then, we formulate a total cost minimization problem to\ndesign the bandwidth allocation and task allocation, while considering\nrealistic heterogenous delay requirements of the computational tasks. Due to\nthe binary task allocation variable, the formulated optimization problem is\nnonconvex. Therefore, we solve the bandwidth allocation and task allocation\nproblem by decoupling the original optimization problem into bandwidth\nallocation and task allocation subproblems. As the bandwidth allocation problem\nis a convex optimization problem, we first determine the bandwidth allocation\nfor given task allocation strategy, followed by conceiving the traditional\nconvex optimization strategy to obtain the bandwidth allocation solution. Based\non the asymptotic property of received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(SINR) under the cell-free massive MIMO setting and bandwidth allocation\nsolution, we formulate a dual problem to solve the task allocation subproblem\nby relaxing the binary constraint with Lagrange partial relaxation for\nheterogenous task delay requirements.

We think DETR has strong potential for\nCDWSOD due to an insight: the encoder and the decoder in DETR are both based on\nthe attention mechanism and are thus capable of aggregating semantics across\nthe entire image. The aggregation results, i.e., image-level predictions, can\nnaturally exploit the weak supervision for domain alignment. Such motivated, we\npropose DETR with additional Global Aggregation (DETR-GA), a CDWSOD detector\nthat simultaneously makes \"instance-level + image-level\" predictions and\nutilizes \"strong + weak\" supervisions. The key point of DETR-GA is very simple:\nfor the encoder / decoder, we respectively add multiple class queries / a\nforeground query to aggregate the semantics into image-level predictions. Our\nquery-based aggregation has two advantages. First, in the encoder, the\nweakly-supervised class queries are capable of roughly locating the\ncorresponding positions and excluding the distraction from non-relevant\nregions. Second, through our design, the object queries and the foreground\nquery in the decoder share consensus on the class semantics, therefore making\nthe strong and weak supervision mutually benefit each other for domain\nalignment.

However, evaluating populations\non large training sets can be computationally expensive. Down-sampling training\nsets has long been used to decrease the computational cost of evaluation in a\nwide range of application domains. Indeed, recent studies have shown that both\nrandom and informed down-sampling can substantially improve problem-solving\nsuccess for GP systems that use the lexicase parent selection algorithm. We use\nthe PushGP framework to experimentally test whether these down-sampling\ntechniques can also improve problem-solving success in the context of two other\ncommonly used selection methods, fitness-proportionate and tournament\nselection, across eight GP problems (four program synthesis and four symbolic\nregression). We verified that down-sampling can benefit the problem-solving\nsuccess of both fitness-proportionate and tournament selection. However, the\nnumber of problems wherein down-sampling improved problem-solving success\nvaried by selection scheme, suggesting that the impact of down-sampling depends\nboth on the problem and choice of selection scheme.

DDS utilizes the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)\nmechanism for the purpose of image editing. We show that using only SDS often\nproduces non-detailed and blurry outputs due to noisy gradients. To address\nthis issue, DDS uses a prompt that matches the input image to identify and\nremove undesired erroneous directions of SDS.

We\naddress this question by looking at universal principles that govern the\nmorphology and behavior of living systems. Living systems display a small-world\nnetwork structure in which many smaller clusters are nested within fewer larger\nones, producing a fractal-like structure with a power-law cluster size\ndistribution. Their dynamics show similar qualities: the timeseries of inner\nmessage passing and overt behavior contain high frequencies or 'states' that\nare nested within lower frequencies or 'traits'. Here, we argue that the nested\nmodular (power-law) dynamics of living systems results from their nested\nmodular (power-law) network structure: organisms 'vertically encode' the deep\nspatiotemporal structure of their environments, so that high frequencies\n(states) are produced by many small clusters at the base of a nested-modular\nhierarchy and lower frequencies (traits) are produced by fewer larger clusters\nat its top. These include physical as well as behavioral traits. Nested-modular\nstructure causes higher frequencies to be embedded in lower frequencies,\nproducing power-law dynamics. Such dynamics satisfy the need for efficient\nenergy dissipation through networks of coupled oscillators, which also governs\nthe dynamics of non-living systems (e.g. earthquake dynamics, stock market\nfluctuations). Thus, we provide a single explanation for power-law frequency\nspectra in both living and non-living systems. If hierarchical structure indeed\nproduces hierarchical dynamics, the development (e.g. during maturation) and\ncollapse (e.g. during disease) of hierarchical structure should leave specific\ntraces in power-law frequency spectra that may serve as early warning signs to\nsystem failure.

These intelligent agents are required to\nunderstand and correctly interpret the sequential turns provided as the context\nof the given question. However, these sequential questions are sometimes left\nimplicit and thus require the resolution of some natural language phenomena\nsuch as anaphora and ellipsis. The task of question rewriting has the potential\nto address the challenges of resolving dependencies amongst the contextual\nturns by transforming them into intent-explicit questions. Nonetheless, the\nsolution of rewriting the implicit questions comes with some potential\nchallenges such as resulting in verbose questions and taking conversational\naspect out of the scenario by generating self-contained questions.

Most of these existing methods either formulate\nthe controlling information as an input (i.e.,: conditional representation) for\nthe noise approximator, or introduce a pre-trained classifier in the test-phase\nto guide the Langevin dynamic towards the conditional goal. However, the former\nline of methods only work when the controlling information can be formulated as\nconditional representations, while the latter requires the pre-trained guidance\nclassifier to be differentiable. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\nnamed RGDM (Reward-Guided Diffusion Model) that guides the training-phase of\ndiffusion models via reinforcement learning (RL).

Nonetheless, as cancer is highly heterogeneous,\nit is challenging to train general-purpose discriminative cancer detection\nmodels, with data availability and disease complexity often cited as a limiting\nfactor. Unsupervised anomaly detection models have been suggested as a putative\nsolution. These models learn a healthy representation of tissue and detect\ncancer by predicting deviations from the healthy norm, which requires models\ncapable of accurately learning long-range interactions between organs and their\nimaging patterns with high levels of expressivity. Such characteristics are\nsuitably satisfied by transformers, which have been shown to generate\nstate-of-the-art results in unsupervised anomaly detection by training on\nnormal data. This work expands upon such approaches by introducing multi-modal\nconditioning of the transformer via cross-attention i.e. supplying anatomical\nreference from paired CT. Using 294 whole-body PET/CT samples, we show that our\nanomaly detection method is robust and capable of achieving accurate cancer\nlocalization results even in cases where normal training data is unavailable.\nIn addition, we show the efficacy of this approach on out-of-sample data\nshowcasing the generalizability of this approach with limited training data.\nLastly, we propose to combine model uncertainty with a new kernel density\nestimation approach, and show that it provides clinically and statistically\nsignificant improvements when compared to the classic residual-based anomaly\nmaps.

Fountains are formed when\nthe momentum of the jet fluid is in the opposite direction to its buoyancy\nforce. This work consists of two parts. First, we injected an ethanol/oil\nmixture (ouzo mixture) downward into quiescent water, forming a quasi-2D\nfountain with oil droplet nucleation (ouzo fountain). In the steady state,\nnucleation is restricted to the fountain rim, and there is hardly any\nnucleation in the fountain body, suggesting limited mixing with the bath in the\nquasi-two-dimensional fountain. By injecting a dyed ethanol solution as a\nreference case, we confirmed that the local water fraction within the fountain\nis indeed insufficient to induce nucleation.\n  Second, we have studied the effect of density difference between the jet\nfluid and the ambient water systematically. We injected saline solutions upward\ninto quiescent water with various concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) at\nvarious flow rates. The fountains show stronger mixing and thus lower\nconcentration in the initial negatively buoyant jet (NBJ) stage. In the steady\nfountain stage, the confinement induces the shielding effect by the outer flow,\nwhich reduces the degree of mixing and leads to higher concentrations. Also, we\nshow that the density difference is the critical parameter that determines the\nfountain concentration. The decreasing concentration with the density\ndifference indicates that the larger (negative) buoyancy effect enhances the\nstretching of the fluid parcels \\citep{Villermaux2019}, leading to a higher\ndegree of mixing in the fountain. From the probability density functions of the\nconcentration, we demonstrate that the degree of mixing in the steady fountain\nstage is largely determined in the developing stages for a quasi-2D fountain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 14:16:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

This leads to an\nincreasingly decentralized energy system, which is challenging to operate in a\nrobust and cost-effective way. The evaluation of technologies and subsystems\ncan only be done from the perspective of the system in which it is embedded and\nit is highly dependent on their networking and application scenarios.\nTherefore, the design and operation of energy systems require adequate\ncomputation and evaluation tools, which offer a holistic view of all\ninterconnected components.

However, unsupervised learning is\nlikely to be unstable when pixel tracking is lost due to occlusion and motion\nblur, or the pixel matching is impaired due to variation in image content and\nspatial structure over time. In natural environments, dynamic occlusion or\nobject variation is a relatively slow temporal process spanning several frames.\nWe, therefore, explore the optical flow estimation from multiple-frame\nsequences of dynamic scenes, whereas most of the existing unsupervised\napproaches are based on temporal static models. We handle the unsupervised\noptical flow estimation with a temporal dynamic model by introducing a\nspatial-temporal dual recurrent block based on the predictive coding structure,\nwhich feeds the previous high-level motion prior to the current optical flow\nestimator. Assuming temporal smoothness of optical flow, we use motion priors\nof the adjacent frames to provide more reliable supervision of the occluded\nregions. To grasp the essence of challenging scenes, we simulate various\nscenarios across long sequences, including dynamic occlusion, content\nvariation, and spatial variation, and adopt self-supervised distillation to\nmake the model understand the object's motion patterns in a prolonged dynamic\nenvironment. Experiments on KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, Sintel Clean, and Sintel\nFinal datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on unsupervised\noptical flow estimation.

Furthermore,\nthere is often a difference between one's internal identity (how salient\ndifferent aspects of one's identity are to oneself) and external identity (how\nsalient different aspects are to the external world). We attempt to capture the\ninternal and external saliences of different dimensions of identity for\ninfluential users (\"influencers\") on Twitter using the follow graph.

One practical\napplication of these findings is to identify \"bridging\" influencers that can\nconnect their sizeable audiences to people from traditionally underheard\ncommunities.

In\nEunomia, we design an expressive DSL, Aes, that lets users precisely pinpoint\nlocal searching strategies to different parts of the target program. To further\noptimize local searching strategies, we design an interval-based algorithm that\nautomatically isolates the context of variables for different local searching\nstrategies, avoiding conflicts between local searching strategies for the same\nvariable.

This\nstudy provides a novel and practical framework for reliable strategies of\nemergency rescue under complex disaster scenarios. The study employs a\nscenario-based approach to represent complex disasters, such as earthquakes,\nmudslides, floods, and their interactions. In optimizing the placement of\nemergency resources, the study considers government-owned suppliers, framework\nagreement suppliers, and existing suppliers collectively supporting emergency\nrescue materials. To determine the selection of joint suppliers and their\ncorresponding optimal material quantities under complex disaster scenarios, the\nresearch proposes a multi-objective model that integrates cost, fairness,\nemergency efficiency, and uncertainty into a facility location problem.\nFinally, the study develops an NSGA-II-XGB algorithm to solve a disaster-prone\nprovince example and verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed\nmulti-objective model and solution methods. The results show that the\nmethodology proposed in this paper can greatly reduce emergency costs, rescue\ntime, and the difference between demand and suppliers while maximizing the\ncoverage of rescue resources. More importantly, it can optimize the scale of\nresources by determining the location and number of materials provided by joint\nsuppliers for various kinds of disasters simultaneously.

The combination of their capabilities\nis often realized by learning to defer algorithms that enable the AI to learn\nto decide whether to make a prediction for a particular instance or defer it to\nthe human expert. However, to accurately learn which instances should be\ndeferred to the human expert, a large number of expert predictions that\naccurately reflect the expert's capabilities are required -- in addition to the\nground truth labels needed to train the AI. This requirement shared by many\nlearning to defer algorithms hinders their adoption in scenarios where the\nresponsible expert regularly changes or where acquiring a sufficient number of\nexpert predictions is costly. In this paper, we propose a three-step approach\nto reduce the number of expert predictions required to train learning to defer\nalgorithms. It encompasses (1) the training of an embedding model with ground\ntruth labels to generate feature representations that serve as a basis for (2)\nthe training of an expertise predictor model to approximate the expert's\ncapabilities. (3) The expertise predictor generates artificial expert\npredictions for instances not yet labeled by the expert, which are required by\nthe learning to defer algorithms. We evaluate our approach on two public\ndatasets. One with \"synthetically\" generated human experts and another from the\nmedical domain containing real-world radiologists' predictions. Our experiments\nshow that the approach allows the training of various learning to defer\nalgorithms with a minimal number of human expert predictions.

It can be used to model network\neffects using both exogenous covariates and endogenous network configurations,\nbut also the co-evolution of behaviour and social interactions. The estimation\nmethod mostly used is the Method of Moments (MoM). The model assumption that\nall individuals have the same evaluation function, however, is one of its\nlimitations. The aim of this paper is to generalize the MoM estimation method\nfor the SAOM to include random effects, so that the heterogeneity of\nindividuals can be modelled more accurately.\n  The linear evaluation function that models the probability of forming or\nremoving a tie from the network, is decomposed in a fixed part, which is the\ncurrent evaluation function of the SAOM, and a random part, with parameters\nthat are individual-specific and random. The Robbins-Monro algorithm that is\ncommonly used for MoM estimation in the SAOM, is extended to allow the\nestimation of the variance of the random parameters. We illustrate how for the\nmodel with random out-degree we can estimate the parameter of the random\ncomponents, and how to test its significance. An application is made to\nKapferer's Tailor shop dataset. It is shown that including a random out-degree\nconstitutes a serious alternative to including various transitivity effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 13:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

While the exact mechanism that led to homochirality is still\nnot fully understood, any realistic scenario on the origins of life needs to\naddress the emergence of homochirality. In order to impose and maintain\nchirality in a prebiotic network, an environmental factor functioning as a\nchiral agent is demanded. Magnetized surfaces are prebiotically plausible\nchiral agents, shown to be effective in enantioseparation of\nribose-aminooxazoline (RAO), a ribonucleic acid (RNA) precursor, due to the\nchiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. As such, mechanisms for breaking\nthe magnetic symmetry of magnetic minerals are of the utmost importance. Here\nwe report the avalanche magnetization of magnetite $(Fe_{3}O_{4})$ by the\ncrystallization of enantiopure RAO. The observed breaking of the magnetic\nsymmetry is induced by the chiral molecules due to the CISS effect and spreads\nout across the magnetic surface like an avalanche, providing a way to uniformly\nmagnetize a magnetic surface without fully covering it. Considered together\nwith our previous results on enantioseparation by crystallization on a magnetic\nsurface, chirality-induced avalanche magnetization paves the way for a\ncooperative feedback between chiral molecules and magnetic surfaces. With this\nfeedback, a weak natural bias in the net magnetization can be amplified and\nspin-selective processes can be accommodated on magnetic minerals on a\npersistent basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 22:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

To mitigate this concern, real-time monitoring and enforcement of\nhelmet laws have been advocated as a plausible solution. However, previous\nattempts at real-time helmet violation detection have been limited by their\ninability to operate in real-time. To remedy this issue, the current paper\nproposes a real-time helmet violation detection system utilizing a single-stage\nobject detection model called YOLOv5.

Recently, many\nstudies have been published to show the effectiveness, efficiency, integration,\nand sentiments of chatGPT and other LLMs. In contrast, this study focuses on\nthe important aspects that are mostly overlooked, i.e. sustainability, privacy,\ndigital divide, and ethics and suggests that not only chatGPT but every\nsubsequent entry in the category of conversational bots should undergo\nSustainability, PrivAcy, Digital divide, and Ethics (SPADE) evaluation. This\npaper discusses in detail about the issues and concerns raised over chatGPT in\nline with aforementioned characteristics. We support our hypothesis by some\npreliminary data collection and visualizations along with hypothesized facts.\nWe also suggest mitigations and recommendations for each of the concerns.\nFurthermore, we also suggest some policies and recommendations for AI policy\nact, if designed by the governments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 16:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

The\nanalysis is developed by separating the error terms with and without\nconvergence to zero, which are the key parts of the iterative approximate\nvalue. The proposed method leads to a state-of-the-art wordlength reduction for\nintermediate results during the Goldschmidt iterative computation. It enables\nat least half of the calculation precision reduction for the iterative factor\nto implement the rectangular multiplier in the divider through flexible\nnumerical method, which can also be applied in the analysis of Goldschmidt\niteration with iterative factors assigned under other ways for faster\nconvergence. Based on the proposed method, two proof-of-concept divider models\nwith different configurations are developed, which are verified by more than\n100 billion random test vectors to show the correctness and tightness of the\nproposed error analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 08:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}
