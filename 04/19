Ion charge state and composition analyses suggest that the\norigin of the seed particle population for the mechanisms of particle\nacceleration at CME-driven shocks is not the bulk solar wind thermal material,\nbut rather a suprathermal population present in the solar wind. This\nsuprathermal population could result from remnant material accelerated in prior\nsolar flares and/or preceding CME-driven shocks. In this work, we examine the\ndistribution of this suprathermal particle population in the inner heliosphere\nby combining a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the solar wind and a\nMonte-Carlo simulation of particle acceleration and transport. Assuming that\nthe seed particles are uniformly distributed near the Sun by solar flares of\nvarious magnitudes, we study the longitudinal distribution of the seed\npopulation at multiple heliocentric distances. We consider a non-uniform\nbackground solar wind, consisting of fast and slow streams that lead to\ncompression and rarefaction regions within the solar wind. Our simulations show\nthat the seed population at a particular location (e.g., 1 au) is strongly\nmodulated by the underlying solar wind configuration. Corotating interaction\nregions (CIRs) and merged interactions regions (MIRs) can strongly alter the\nenergy spectra of the seed particle populations. In addition, cross-field\ndiffusion plays an important role in mitigating strong variations of the seed\npopulation in both space and energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 16:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

This starts to occur as the\nionisation source detaches from the target, leading to a build-up of molecules\nbelow the ionisation source who get excited, resulting in Molecular Activated\nRecombination (MAR) and Dissociation (MAD). The particle sinks in the divertor\nchamber exceed the ion sources in the middle of the detached operational regime\nbefore electron-ion recombination (EIR) starts to occur, demonstrating the\nstrong capabilities for particle exhaust in the Super-X Configuration. MAD is\nthe dominant volumetric neutral atom creation mechanism and results in\nsignificant power losses. This, combined with electron-impact excitation\npreceding ionisation, are the dominant power loss mechanisms in the divertor\nchamber. As the plasma becomes more deeply detached, EIR starts to occur and\nelectron temperatures below 0.2 eV are achieved. Even at such low electron\ntemperature conditions, MAR is observed to be an important ion sink mechanism,\nwhich suggests the presence of highly vibrationally excited molecules in the\ncold detached regime.

Existing point\ncloud completion methods tend to generate global shape skeletons and hence lack\nfine local details. Furthermore, they mostly learn a deterministic\npartial-to-complete mapping, but overlook structural relations in man-made\nobjects. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a variational\nframework, Variational Relational point Completion Network (VRCNet) with two\nappealing properties: 1) Probabilistic Modeling. In particular, we propose a\ndual-path architecture to enable principled probabilistic modeling across\npartial and complete clouds. One path consumes complete point clouds for\nreconstruction by learning a point VAE. The other path generates complete\nshapes for partial point clouds, whose embedded distribution is guided by\ndistribution obtained from the reconstruction path during training. 2)\nRelational Enhancement. Specifically, we carefully design point self-attention\nkernel and point selective kernel module to exploit relational point features,\nwhich refines local shape details conditioned on the coarse completion. In\naddition, we contribute multi-view partial point cloud datasets (MVP and MVP-40\ndataset) containing over 200,000 high-quality scans, which render partial 3D\nshapes from 26 uniformly distributed camera poses for each 3D CAD model.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that VRCNet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods on all standard point cloud completion benchmarks. Notably, VRCNet\nshows great generalizability and robustness on real-world point cloud scans.\nMoreover, we can achieve robust 3D classification for partial point clouds with\nthe help of VRCNet, which can highly increase classification accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 17:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

We show the cross-spectrum measurement between two CMB maps\ncreated by nulling the contributions from CIB (CIB-free map) and tSZ (tSZ-free\nmap) to be robust for kSZ as the approach significantly suppresses the total\ncontribution of CIB and tSZ signals. Similarly, for CMB lensing, we use the\napproach introduced by Madhavacheril & Hill (2018) but with a slight\nmodification by using the tSZ-free and CIB-free maps in the two legs of the\nquadratic estimator. By cross-correlating the CMB lensing map created using\nthis technique with galaxy surveys, we show that the biases from both CIB/tSZ\nare negligible. We also compute the impact of unmodeled CIB/tSZ residuals on\nkSZ and cosmological parameters finding that the kSZ measured using the\nstandard ILC to be significantly biased. The kSZ estimate from the cross-ILC\nremains less affected by CIB/tSZ making it crucial for CMB surveys such as the\nSouth Pole Telescope (SPT), Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4.

This test, which is computationally\nless expensive than a complete merging binary but has all the potential\npitfalls of the full scenario, can be used to compare future implementations of\nM1 schemes with the one presented here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 17:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Since the carriers are not under the platform's\ncontrol, the platform has to anticipate their reactions, while deciding how to\nallocate the delivery operations. Indeed, carriers' decisions largely affect\nthe platform's revenue. In this paper, we model this problem using bilevel\nprogramming. At the upper level, the platform decides how to assign the orders\nto the carriers; at the lower level, each carrier solves a profitable tour\nproblem to determine which offered requests to accept, based on her own profit\nmaximization. Possibly, the platform can influence carriers' decisions by\ndetermining also the compensation paid for each accepted request. The two\nconsidered settings result in two different formulations: the bilevel\nprofitable tour problem with fixed compensation margins and with margin\ndecisions, respectively. For each of them, we propose single-level\nreformulations and alternative formulations where the lower-level routing\nvariables are projected out. A branch-and-cut algorithm is proposed to solve\nthe bilevel models, with a tailored warm-start heuristic used to speed up the\nsolution process. Extensive computational tests are performed to compare the\nproposed formulations and analyze solution characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 17:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

These have been visually inspected to be\nundergoing RPS sometime in the past 5 billion years (since $z=0.5$), have\nsatellite stellar masses $M_{\\star}^{\\rm sat}\\sim10^{8-10.5}{\\rm M}_\\odot$, and\nlive in hosts with $M_{\\rm 200c}\\sim10^{12-14.3}{\\rm M}_\\odot$ at $z=0$. We\nquantify the cold gas $(\\leq10^{4.5}$K) removal using the tracer particles,\nconfirming that for these jellyfish, RPS is the dominant driver of cold gas\nloss after infall. Half of these jellyfish are completely devoid of cold gas by\n$z=0$, and these galaxies have earlier infall times and smaller\nsatellite-to-host mass ratios than those that still have some gas today. RPS\ncan act on jellyfish galaxies over long timescales of $\\approx1.5-8$Gyr.\nJellyfish in more massive hosts are impacted by RPS for a shorter time span\nand, at a fixed host halo mass, jellyfish with lower stellar masses at $z=0$\nhave shorter RPS time spans. While RPS may act for long periods of time, the\npeak RPS period -- where at least 50% of the total RPS occurs -- begins within\n$\\approx1$Gyr of infall and lasts $\\lesssim2$Gyr. During this period, the\njellyfish are at host-centric distances between $\\sim0.2-2R_{\\rm 200c}$,\nillustrating that much of RPS occurs at large distances from the host galaxy.\nJellyfish continue forming stars until they have lost $\\approx98$% of their\ncold gas. For groups and clusters in TNG50 $(M_{\\rm 200c}\\sim10^{13-14.3}{\\rm\nM}_\\odot)$, jellyfish galaxies deposit more cold gas ($\\sim10^{11-12}{\\rm\nM}_\\odot$) into halos than exist in them at $z=0$, demonstrating that\njellyfish, and in general satellite galaxies, are a significant source of cold\ngas accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

These\nbinaries will be the main sources of gravitational waves (GWs) detectable by\nthe ESA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, opening the\npossibility to detect circumbinary planets around short-period DWDs everywhere\nin the Milky Way.

We test two setups: i) 'stationary' rings\nof planets that, when unperturbed, remain equally-spaced along their orbit; and\nii) horseshoe constellation systems, in which planets are continually\nundergoing horseshoe librations with their immediate neighbors. We show that a\nsingle rogue planet crossing the planets' orbit more massive than a few lunar\nmasses (0.01-0.04 Earth masses) systematically disrupts a co-orbital ring of 6,\n9, 18, or 42 Earth-mass planets located at 1 au. Stationary rings are more\nresistant to perturbations than horseshoe constellations, yet when perturbed\nthey can transform into stable horseshoe constellation systems. Given\nsufficient time, any co-orbital ring system will be perturbed into either\nbecoming a horseshoe constellation or complete destabilization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 18:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

For example, the superiority of\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) compared to dense networks mainly comes\nfrom an elegant exploitation of the translation equivariance. Patterns can\nappear at arbitrary positions and convolutions take this into account to\nachieve translation invariant operations through weight sharing. Nevertheless,\nimages often involve other symmetries that can also be exploited. It is the\ncase of rotations and reflections that have drawn particular attention and led\nto the development of multiple equivariant CNN architectures. Among all these\nmethods, Bessel-convolutional neural networks (B-CNNs) exploit a particular\ndecomposition based on Bessel functions to modify the key operation between\nimages and filters and make it by design equivariant to all the continuous set\nof planar rotations. In this work, the mathematical developments of B-CNNs are\npresented along with several improvements, including the incorporation of\nreflection and multi-scale equivariances. Extensive study is carried out to\nassess the performances of B-CNNs compared to other methods. Finally, we\nemphasize the theoretical advantages of B-CNNs by giving more insights and\nin-depth mathematical details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 18:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

Data from the Cassini\nmission, including a precise determination of the gravity field from the Grand\nFinale orbits, and the still ongoing identification of ring wave features in\nSaturn's C-ring tied to seismic modes in the planet, have led to dramatic\nadvances in our understanding of Saturn's structure. Models that match the\ngravity field suggest that differential rotation, as seen in the visible\natmosphere, extends down to at least a depth of 10,000 km (1/6$^{\\rm th}$ the\nplanet's radius). At greater depths, a variety of different investigations all\nnow point to a deep Saturn rotation rate of 10 hours and 33 minutes. There is\nvery compelling evidence for a central heavy element concentration (``core''),\nthat in most recent models is 12-20 Earth masses. Ring seismology strongly\nsuggests that the core is not entirely compact, but is dilute (mixed in with\nthe overlying H/He), and has a substantial radial extent, perhaps out to around\none-half of the planet's radius. A wide range of thermal evolution scenarios\ncan match the planet's current luminosity, with progress on better quantifying\nthe helium rain scenario hampered by Saturn's poorly known atmospheric helium\nabundance. We discuss the relevance of magnetic field data on understanding the\nplanet's current interior structure. We point towards additional future work\nthat combines seismology and gravity within a framework that includes\ndifferential rotation, and the utility of a Saturn entry probe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 18:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

In contrast, for\nother matrix losses, optimal trade-offs between the subset size and\napproximation quality have not been settled, even in the offline setting. We\ngive a number of results towards closing these gaps.\n  In the offline setting, we achieve nearly optimal bicriteria algorithms in\ntwo settings.

Furthermore, the challenge is compounded by the difficulty of\nobtaining labelled data due to high cost or lack of readily available domain\nexpertise. In our work, we show that learning realistic augmentations\nautomatically from data is possible in a label-efficient manner using\ngenerative models.

By conditioning generative\nmodels on appropriate labels, we can steer the distribution of synthetic\nexamples according to specific requirements.

The new lens model is based on 72 multiply lensed\ngalaxies that produce 214 multiple images, making it the largest sample of\nspectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies on this cluster. The larger\ncoverage in BUFFALO allows us to measure the shear up to the outskirts of the\ncluster, and extend the range of lensing constraints up to ~ 1 Mpc from the\ncentral region, providing a mass estimate up to this radius. As an application,\nwe make predictions for the number of high-redshift multiply-lensed galaxies\ndetected in future observations with JWST. Then we focus on a previously known\nlensed galaxy at z=1.0054, nicknamed Spock, which contains four previously\nreported transients. We interpret these transients as microcaustic crossings of\nSG stars and compute the probability of such events. Based on simplifications\nregarding the stellar evolution, we find that microlensing (by stars in the\nintracluster medium) of SG stars at z=1.0054 can fully explain these events.\nThe inferred abundance of SG stars is consistent with either (1) a number\ndensity of stars with bolometric luminosities beyond the Humphreys-Davidson\n(HD) limit (L ~ $6\\times10^5 L_{\\odot}$) that is below 400 stars per sq. kpc,\nor (2) the absence of stars beyond the HD limit but with a SG number density of\n~ 9000 per sq. kpc for stars with luminosities between $10^5$ and\n$6\\times10^5$.

However, the\nACR test is impractical for online monitoring of speech communication networks.\nPerceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) is one of the widely used\nmetrics instrumentally predicting the results of an ACR test. However, the PESQ\nalgorithm requires an original reference signal, which is usually unavailable\nin network monitoring, thus limiting its applicability. NISQA is a new\nnon-intrusive neural-network-based speech quality measure, focusing on\nsuper-wideband speech signals. In this work, however, we aim at predicting the\nwell-known PESQ metric using a non-intrusive PESQ-DNN model. We illustrate the\npotential of this model by predicting the PESQ scores of wideband-coded speech\nobtained from AMR-WB or EVS codecs operating at different bitrates in noisy,\ntandeming, and error-prone transmission conditions. We compare our methods with\nthe state-of-the-art network topologies of QualityNet, WaweNet, and DNSMOS --\nall applied to PESQ prediction -- by measuring the mean absolute error (MAE)\nand the linear correlation coefficient (LCC). The proposed PESQ-DNN offers the\nbest total MAE and LCC of 0.11 and 0.92, respectively, in conditions without\nframe loss, and still is best when including frame loss. Note that our model\ncould be similarly used to non-intrusively predict POLQA or other (intrusive)\nmetrics.

While the microwave response for\nconventional metals and insulators can be accurately quantified using simple\nlumped-element circuits, the applicability of these classical models to more\nexotic quantum systems remains limited. In this work, we present a general\ntheoretical framework of the MIM response of arbitrary quantum materials within\nlinear response theory. As a special case, we model the microwave response of\ntopological edge states in a Chern insulator and predict an enhanced MIM\nresponse at the crystal boundaries due to collective edge magnetoplasmon (EMP)\nexcitations. The resonance frequency of these plasmonic modes should depend\nquantitatively on the topological invariant of the Chern insulator state and on\nthe sample's circumference, which highlights their non-local, topological\nnature. To benchmark our analytical predictions, we experimentally probe the\nMIM response of quantum anomalous Hall edge states in a Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3\ntopological insulator and perform numerical simulations using a classical\nformulation of the EMP modes based on this realistic tip-sample geometry, both\nof which yield results consistent with our theoretical picture.

The main advantage of conservation of kinetic energy is that it\nendows the hyper-reduced order model (hROM) with a nonlinear stability\nproperty. The new method poses the discrete empirical interpolation method\n(DEIM) as a minimization problem and subsequently imposes constraints to\nconserve kinetic energy. Two methods are proposed to improve the robustness of\nthe new method against error accumulation: oversampling and Mahalanobis\nregularization. Mahalanobis regularization has the benefit of not requiring\nadditional measurement points. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed to\nperform structure-preserving temporal localization with the principle interval\ndecomposition: new interface conditions are derived such that energy and\nmomentum are conserved for a full time-integration instead of only during\nseparate intervals. The performance of the new structure-preserving\nhyper-reduction methods and the structure-preserving temporal localization\nmethod is analysed using two convection-dominated test cases; a shear-layer\nroll-up and two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. It is found that\nboth Mahalanobis regularization and oversampling allow hyper-reduction of these\ntest cases.

Aims. A new\nstellar occultation by Quaoar was observed on August 9th, 2022 aiming to\nimprove Quaoar's shape models and the physical parameters of Q1R while\nsearching for additional material around the body. Methods. The occultation\nprovided nine effective chords across Quaoar, pinning down its size, shape, and\nastrometric position.

The light curves were also used to\ncharacterize the Q1R ring (radial profiles and orbital elements). Results.\nQuaoar's elliptical fit to the occultation chords yields the limb with an\napparent semi-major axis of $579.5\\pm4.0$ km, apparent oblateness of\n$0.12\\pm0.01$, and area-equivalent radius of $543\\pm2$ km.

Three critical assumptions of this theory are that (1) the\ntransition of the ANS was associated with the evolution of social mammals from\nasocial reptiles; (2) the transition enabled mammals, unlike their reptilian\nancestors, to derive a biological benefit from social interactions; and (3) the\ntransition forces a less parsimonious explanation (convergence) for the\nevolution of social behavior in birds and mammals, since birds evolved from a\nreptilian lineage. Two recently published reviews, however, provided compelling\nevidence that the social asocial dichotomy is overly simplistic, neglects the\ndiversity of vertebrate social systems, impedes our understanding of the\nevolution of social behavior, and perpetuates the erroneous belief that one\ngroup, non-avian reptiles, is incapable of complex social behavior. In the\nworst case, if PT depends upon a transition from asocial reptiles to social\nmammals, then the ability of PT to explain the evolution of the mammalian ANS\nis highly questionable. A great number of social behaviors occur in both\nreptiles and mammals. In the best case, PT has misused the terms social and\nasocial. Even here, however, the theory would still need to identify a\nparticular suite of behaviors found in mammals and not reptiles that could be\nassociated with, or explain, the transition of the ANS, and then replace the\nasocial and social labels with more specific descriptors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 18:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

Instead, we show that there\nexists a large class of simple non-linear functions that can be used to\nconstruct cross-correlators with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To\ndemonstrate this, we first present a general mathematical framework using\nPrice's Theorem that allows us to analyze cross-correlators constructed using a\nmixture of piece-wise linear functions. Using this framework and\nhigh-dimensional embedding, we show that some of the most promising\ncross-correlators are based on Huber's loss functions, margin-propagation (MP)\nfunctions, and the log-sum-exp functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 19:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

Sidescan sonar (SSS) detects a wide range and provides photo-realistic\nimages in high resolution. However, SSS projects the 3D seafloor to 2D images,\nwhich are distorted by the AUV's altitude, target's range and sensor's\nresolution. As a result, the same physical area can show significant visual\ndifferences in SSS images from different survey lines, causing difficulties in\ntasks such as pixel correspondence and template matching. In this paper, a\ncanonical transformation method consisting of intensity correction and slant\nrange correction is proposed to decrease the above distortion. The intensity\ncorrection includes beam pattern correction and incident angle correction using\nthree different Lambertian laws (cos, cos2, cot), whereas the slant range\ncorrection removes the nadir zone and projects the position of SSS elements\ninto equally horizontally spaced, view-point independent bins. The proposed\nmethod is evaluated on real data collected by a HUGIN AUV, with\nmanually-annotated pixel correspondence as ground truth reference. Experimental\nresults on patch pairs compare similarity measures and keypoint descriptor\nmatching. The results show that the canonical transformation can improve the\npatch similarity, as well as SIFT descriptor matching accuracy in different\nimages where the same physical area was ensonified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 19:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

The\napproximately Poisson firing of neurons has led to the hypothesis that these\nneural networks operate in the asynchronous state. In the asynchronous state\nneurons fire independently from one another, so that the probability that a\nneuron experience synchronous synaptic inputs is exceedingly low. While the\nmodels of asynchronous neurons lead to observed spiking variability, it is not\nclear whether the asynchronous state can also account for the level of\nsubthreshold membrane potential variability. We propose a new analytical\nframework to rigorously quantify the subthreshold variability of a single\nconductance-based neuron in response to synaptic inputs with prescribed degrees\nof synchrony. Technically we leverage the theory of exchangeability to model\ninput synchrony via jump-process-based synaptic drives; we then perform a\nmoment analysis of the stationary response of a neuronal model with all-or-none\nconductances that neglects post-spiking reset. As a result, we produce exact,\ninterpretable closed forms for the first two stationary moments of the membrane\nvoltage, with explicit dependence on the input synaptic numbers, strengths, and\nsynchrony. For biophysically relevant parameters, we find that the asynchronous\nregime only yields realistic subthreshold variability (voltage variance $\\simeq\n4-9\\mathrm{mV^2}$) when driven by a restricted number of large synapses,\ncompatible with strong thalamic drive.

All procedures commonly require 3D\nvessel geometries from 3D CTA (Computed Tomography Angiography) images. During\nthese procedures, the clinician generally places a guiding catheter in the\nostium of the relevant vessel and then manipulates a wire through the catheter\nand across the blockage. The clinician only uses X-ray fluoroscopy\nintermittently to visualize and guide the catheter, guidewire, and other\ndevices. However, clinicians still passively control guidewires/catheters by\nrelying on limited indirect observation (i.e., 2D partial view of devices, and\nintermittent updates due to radiation limit) from X-ray fluoroscopy. Modeling\nand controlling the guidewire manipulation in coronary vessels remains\nchallenging because of the complicated interaction between guidewire motions\nwith different physical properties (i.e., loads, coating) and vessel geometries\nwith lumen conditions resulting in a highly non-linear system. This paper\nintroduces a scalable learning pipeline to train AI-based agent models toward\nautomated endovascular predictive device controls. First, we create a scalable\nenvironment by pre-processing 3D CTA images, providing patient-specific 3D\nvessel geometry and the centerline of the coronary. Next, we apply a large\nquantity of randomly generated motion sequences from the proximal end to\ngenerate wire states associated with each environment using a physics-based\ndevice simulator. Then, we reformulate the control problem to a\nsequence-to-sequence learning problem, in which we use a Transformer-based\nmodel, trained to handle non-linear sequential forward/inverse transition\nfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 20:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

In\nlight of this, we propose a multi-modality multi-scale model called M3S, which\nis a novel deep learning method with two core modules to address these issues.\nFirst, we convert RS data to various resolution images by the Gramian angular\nfield (GAF) to enlarge nuance, and a two-branch structure is leveraged to get\nembeddings for distinction in the multi-scale feature extraction module.\nSecond, a probability matrix and a weight matrix are used to enhance the\nclassification capacity by combining the RS and medical history data in the\nmulti-modality data fusion module. We perform extensive evaluations of M3S and\nfound its outstanding performance on our in-house dataset, with accuracy,\nprecision, recall, specificity, and F1 score of 0.9330, 0.9379, 0.9291, 0.9752,\nand 0.9334, respectively. These results demonstrate that the M3S has high\nperformance and robustness compared with popular methods in diagnosing CVD\nsubtypes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 22:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

Although there are several modes of failures, in this paper we\ninvestigate breaching and shear failures of granular columns using the\ntwo-fluid approach. The numerical model is first applied to simulate small\nscale granular column collapses with different initial volume fractions to\nstudy the role of the initial conditions on the main flow dynamics. For loosely\npacked granular columns, the porous medium initially contracts and the\nresulting positive pore pressure leads to a rapid collapse. Whereas in\ninitially dense-packing columns, the porous medium initially dilates and\nnegative pore pressure is generated stabilizing the granular column, which\nresults in a slow collapse. The proposed numerical approach shows good\nagreement with the experimental data in terms of morphology and excess of pore\npressure. Numerical results are extended to a large-scale application known as\nthe breaching process. This phenomenon may occur naturally at coasts or on\ndykes and levees in rivers but it can also be triggered by humans during\ndredging operations.

The CardiacAI data repository prospectively extracts de-identified\nelectronic medical record (EMR) data from two local health districts (LHD) in\nNew South Wales (NSW), Australia. These data are linked with Australian\npopulation health data to ascertain longitudinal hospitalisation and death\noutcomes. The data are stored within a secure, cloud-based storage and\nanalytics platform. The CardiacAI data repository is a not-for-profit data\nresource that promotes collaboration and responsible sharing of data. The\nCardiacAI data repository is a resource for Australian healthcare providers,\nclinicians and researchers seeking to improve cardiovascular care. The project\nis expanding to include data from stroke hospitalisations and two additional\nNSW LHDs, and is actively exploring linkage with ECG signal data, medical\nimaging data and community-based healthcare. The CardiacAI project has the\npotential to unlock a wealth of novel insights and translational tools that\nimprove secondary prevention and treatment of CVD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 23:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

Highly multi-mode excitation of fibers has been proposed as a novel\nroute towards efficient suppression of SBS in both active and passive fibers.\nTo study the effects of multimode excitation generally, we develop a theory of\nSBS for arbitrary input excitations, fiber cross section geometries and\nrefractive index profiles. We derive appropriate nonlinear coupled mode\nequations for the signal and Stokes modal amplitudes starting from vector\noptical and tensor acoustic equations. Using applicable approximations, we find\nan analytical formula for the SBS (Stokes) gain susceptibility, which takes\ninto account the vector nature of both optical and acoustic modes exactly. We\nshow that upon multimode excitation, the SBS power in each Stokes mode grows\nexponentially with a growth rate that depends parametrically on the\ndistribution of power in the signal modes. Specializing to isotropic fibers we\nare able to define and calculate an effective SBS gain spectrum for any choice\nof multimode excitation. The peak value of this gain spectrum determines the\nSBS threshold, the maximum SBS-limited power that can be sent through the\nfiber. We show theoretically that peak SBS gain is greatly reduced by highly\nmultimode excitation due to gain broadening and relatively weaker intermodal\nSBS gain. We demonstrate that equal excitation of the 160 modes of a\ncommercially available, highly multimode circular step index fiber raises the\nSBS threshold by a factor of 6.5, and find comparable suppression of SBS in\nsimilar fibers with a D-shaped cross-section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 23:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

However, excessive stylization or even uniform stylization may\nreduce performance. Performance reduction is especially pronounced for pixels\nfrom minority classes, which are already more challenging to classify compared\nto pixels from majority classes.

We consider\nthree common models of generalization to novel views: (i) full 3D\ngeneralization, (ii) pure 2D matching, and (iii) matching based on a linear\ncombination of views. We find that deep models generalize well to novel views,\nbut they do so in a way that differs from all these existing models.\nExtrapolation to views beyond the range covered by views in the training set is\nlimited, and extrapolation to novel rotation axes is even more limited,\nimplying that the networks do not infer full 3D structure, nor use linear\ninterpolation. Yet, generalization is far superior to pure 2D matching. These\nfindings help with designing datasets with 2D views required to achieve 3D\ngeneralization.

Consequently, it is imperative to explore ways in\nwhich to improve and supplement numerical models utilizing the ever-increasing\namounts of historical observational data. To this end, we introduce a method\nfor SST prediction that transfers physical knowledge from historical\nobservations to numerical models. Specifically, we use a combination of an\nencoder and a generative adversarial network (GAN) to capture physical\nknowledge from the observed data. The numerical model data is then fed into the\npre-trained model to generate physics-enhanced data, which can then be used for\nSST prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\nconsiderably enhances SST prediction performance when compared to several\nstate-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 02:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

We argue that pack-and-pair districting, where weaker districts are\n``packed'' with a single type of voter, while stronger districts contain two\nvoter types, is typically optimal for the gerrymanderer. The optimal form of\npack-and-pair districting depends on the relative amounts of aggregate and\nidiosyncratic uncertainty. When idiosyncratic uncertainty dominates, it is\noptimal to pack opposing voters and pair more favorable voters; this plan\nresembles traditional ``packing-and-cracking.''

We show that H-TSP can achieve comparable results (gap 3.42% vs. 7.32%)\nas SOTA search-based approaches, and more importantly, we reduce the time\nconsumption up to two orders of magnitude (3.32s vs. 395.85s). To the best of\nour knowledge, H-TSP is the first end-to-end deep reinforcement learning\napproach that can scale to TSP instances of up to 10000 nodes. Although there\nare still gaps to SOTA results with respect to solution quality, we believe\nthat H-TSP will be useful for practical applications, particularly those that\nare time-sensitive e.g., on-call routing and ride hailing service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 03:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

The above\nmodulation scheme innately enables a new multiplicative multiple access channel\n(M-MAC), where the primary and secondary signals are superposed in a\nmultiplicative and additive manner. To pursue the fundamental performance\nlimits of the M-MAC, we focus on the characterization of the capacity region of\nsuch systems. Due to the passive nature of RISs, the transmitted signal of the\nRIS should satisfy the peak power constraint. Under this constraint at the RIS\nas well as the average power constraint at the primary transmitter (PTx), we\nanalyze the capacity-achieving distributions of the transmitted signals and\ncharacterize the capacity region of the M-MAC. Then, theoretical analysis is\nperformed to reveal insights into the RIS-assisted SR. It is observed that: 1)\nthe capacity region of the M-MAC is strictly convex and larger than that of the\nconventional TDMA scheme; 2) the secondary transmission can achieve the maximum\nrate when the PTx transmits the constant envelope signals; 3) and the sum rate\ncan achieve the maximum when the PTx transmits Gaussian signals and the RIS\ntransmits the constant envelope signals. Finally, extensive numerical results\nare provided to evaluate the performance of the RIS-assisted SR and verify the\naccuracy of our theoretical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 03:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

The currently uncontested state-of-the-art defense to obtain robust\ndeep neural networks is Adversarial Training (AT), but it consumes\nsignificantly more resources compared to standard training and trades off\naccuracy for robustness. An inspiring recent work [Dapello et al.] aims to\nbring neurobiological tools to the question: How can we develop Neural Nets\nthat robustly generalize like human vision? [Dapello et al.] design a network\nstructure with a neural hidden first layer that mimics the primate primary\nvisual cortex (V1), followed by a back-end structure adapted from current CNN\nvision models. It seems to achieve non-trivial adversarial robustness on\nstandard vision benchmarks when tested on small perturbations. Here we revisit\nthis biologically inspired work, and ask whether a principled parameter-free\nrepresentation with inspiration from physics is able to achieve the same goal.\nWe discover that the wavelet scattering transform can replace the complex\nV1-cortex and simple uniform Gaussian noise can take the role of neural\nstochasticity, to achieve adversarial robustness. In extensive experiments on\nthe CIFAR-10 benchmark with adaptive adversarial attacks we show that: 1)\nRobustness of VOneBlock architectures is relatively weak (though non-zero) when\nthe strength of the adversarial attack radius is set to commonly used\nbenchmarks. 2) Replacing the front-end VOneBlock by an off-the-shelf\nparameter-free Scatternet followed by simple uniform Gaussian noise can achieve\nmuch more substantial adversarial robustness without adversarial training.

This makes the task of manipulation\ndetection hard in and of itself, with state-of-the-art detectors only being\nable to detect a limited number of manipulation types. More importantly, in\ncases where the anomaly assumption does not hold, the detection of false\npositives in otherwise non-manipulated images becomes a serious problem.\n  To understand the current state of manipulation detection, we present an\nin-depth analysis of deep learning-based and learning-free methods, assessing\ntheir performance on different benchmark datasets containing tampered and\nnon-tampered samples.

Our study shifts attention from data-dependent 3D Morphable\nModels (3DMM) to an understudied human-designed skinning model. We propose\nAdaptive Skinning Model (ASM), which redefines the skinning model with more\ncompact and fully tunable parameters. With extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that ASM achieves significantly improved capacity than 3DMM, with\nthe additional advantage of model size and easy implementation for new\ntopology. We achieve state-of-the-art performance with ASM for multi-view\nreconstruction on the Florence MICC Coop benchmark.

However, when dealing with high-dimensional\noptimization problems, the performance of these surrogate-assisted\nmulti-objective evolutionary algorithms deteriorate drastically. In this work,\na novel Classifier-assisted rank-based learning and Local Model based\nmulti-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (CLMEA) is proposed for high-dimensional\nexpensive multi-objective optimization problems. The proposed algorithm\nconsists of three parts: classifier-assisted rank-based learning,\nhypervolume-based non-dominated search, and local search in the relatively\nsparse objective space. Specifically, a probabilistic neural network is built\nas classifier to divide the offspring into a number of ranks. The offspring in\ndifferent ranks uses rank-based learning strategy to generate more promising\nand informative candidates for real function evaluations. Then, radial basis\nfunction networks are built as surrogates to approximate the objective\nfunctions. After searching non-dominated solutions assisted by the surrogate\nmodel, the candidates with higher hypervolume improvement are selected for real\nevaluations. Subsequently, in order to maintain the diversity of solutions, the\nmost uncertain sample point from the non-dominated solutions measured by the\ncrowding distance is selected as the guided parent to further infill in the\nuncertain region of the front. The experimental results of benchmark problems\nand a real-world application on geothermal reservoir heat extraction\noptimization demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows superior performance\ncompared with the state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted multi-objective\nevolutionary algorithms.

Given the prevalence of Reed-Solomon codes, a fundamental\nquestion in coding theory is determining if Reed--Solomon codes can optimally\nachieve list-decoding capacity.\n  A recent breakthrough by Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam, established that\nReed--Solomon codes are combinatorially list-decodable all the way to capacity.\nHowever, their results hold for randomly-punctured Reed--Solomon codes over an\nexponentially large field size $2^{O(n)}$, where $n$ is the block length of the\ncode. A natural question is whether Reed--Solomon codes can still achieve\ncapacity over smaller fields. Recently, Guo and Zhang showed that Reed--Solomon\ncodes are list-decodable to capacity with field size $O(n^2)$. We show that\nReed--Solomon codes are list-decodable to capacity with linear field size\n$O(n)$, which is optimal up to the constant factor. We also give evidence that\nthe ratio between the alphabet size $q$ and code length $n$ cannot be bounded\nby an absolute constant.\n  Our proof is based on the proof of Guo and Zhang, and additionally exploits\nsymmetries of reduced intersection matrices.

Although many works have made great efforts and achieved\nsignificant progress on this task, most of them suffer from expensive\nannotation cost and poor transferability to unknown data due to the domain gap.\nRecently, few works attempt to tackle the domain gap in objects, but still fail\nto adapt to the gap of varying beam-densities between two domains, which is\ncritical to mitigate the characteristic differences of the LiDAR collectors. To\nthis end, we make the attempt to propose a density-insensitive domain adaption\nframework to address the density-induced domain gap. In particular, we first\nintroduce Random Beam Re-Sampling (RBRS) to enhance the robustness of 3D\ndetectors trained on the source domain to the varying beam-density. Then, we\ntake this pre-trained detector as the backbone model, and feed the unlabeled\ntarget domain data into our newly designed task-specific teacher-student\nframework for predicting its high-quality pseudo labels. To further adapt the\nproperty of density-insensitivity into the target domain, we feed the teacher\nand student branches with the same sample of different densities, and propose\nan Object Graph Alignment (OGA) module to construct two object-graphs between\nthe two branches for enforcing the consistency in both the attribute and\nrelation of cross-density objects.

Prior work often assumes Lambertian\nsurfaces, simplified lighting models or involves estimating 3D shape, albedo,\nor a shadow map. This estimation, however, is error-prone and requires many\ntraining examples with lighting ground truth to generalize well. Our work\nbypasses the need for accurate estimation of intrinsic components and can be\ntrained solely on 2D images without any light stage data, multi-view images, or\nlighting ground truth. Our key idea is to leverage a conditional diffusion\nimplicit model (DDIM) for decoding a disentangled light encoding along with\nother encodings related to 3D shape and facial identity inferred from\noff-the-shelf estimators. We also propose a novel conditioning technique that\neases the modeling of the complex interaction between light and geometry by\nusing a rendered shading reference to spatially modulate the DDIM.

The\nnatural scale separation between the forcing and the emergent turbulent flow\ncalls for a diffusive parameterization, where the eddy-induced fluxes are\nrelated to the large-scale gradients by a diffusion tensor. The standard\nparameterization scheme in climate modeling consists in adopting the\nGent-McWilliams/Redi (GM/R) form for the diffusion tensor, initially put\nforward based on physical intuition and educated guesses before being put on\nfirm analytical footing using thickness-weighted average (TWA). In the present\ncontribution we provide a direct derivation of this diffusion tensor from the\nquasi-geostrophic (QG) dynamics of a horizontally homogeneous three-dimensional\npatch of ocean hosting a large-scale vertically-sheared zonal flow on the beta\nplane. While less general than the TWA approach, the present QG framework leads\nto rigorous constraints on the diffusion tensor. First, there is no diapycnal\ndiffusivity arising in the QG GM/R tensor for low viscosity and small-scale\ndiffusivities. The diffusion tensor then involves only two vertically dependent\ncoefficients, namely the GM transport coefficient $K_{GM}(z)$ and the Redi\ndiffusivity $K_R(z)$. Secondly, as already identified by previous authors the\nvertical structures of the two coefficients are related by the so-called\nTaylor-Bretherton relation. Finally, while the two coefficients generically\ndiffer in the interior of the water column, we show that they are equal to one\nanother near the surface and near the bottom of the domain for low-enough\ndissipative coefficients. We illustrate these findings by numerically\nsimulating the QG dynamics of a horizontally homogeneous patch of ocean hosting\na vertically sheared zonal current resembling the Antarctic Circumpolar\nCurrent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 08:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Recently,\nself-supervised methods have attracted attention because constructing a large\nreal noise dataset for supervised training is an enormous burden. The most\nrepresentative self-supervised denoisers are based on blind-spot networks,\nwhich exclude the receptive field's center pixel. However, excluding any input\npixel is abandoning some information, especially when the input pixel at the\ncorresponding output position is excluded. In addition, a standard blind-spot\nnetwork fails to reduce real camera noise due to the pixel-wise correlation of\nnoise, though it successfully removes independently distributed synthetic\nnoise. Hence, to realize a more practical denoiser, we propose a novel\nself-supervised training framework that can remove real noise. For this, we\nderive the theoretic upper bound of a supervised loss where the network is\nguided by the downsampled blinded output. Also, we design a conditional\nblind-spot network (C-BSN), which selectively controls the blindness of the\nnetwork to use the center pixel information.

As an excellent clustering algorithm, Mean-Shift can not be applied\ndirectly to community detection, since Mean-Shift can only handle data with\ncoordinates, while the data in the community detection problem is mostly\nrepresented by a graph that can be treated as data with a distance matrix (or\nsimilarity matrix). Fortunately, a new clustering algorithm called Medoid-Shift\nis proposed. The Medoid-Shift algorithm preserves the benefits of Mean-Shift\nand can be applied to problems based on distance matrix, such as community\ndetection. One drawback of the Medoid-Shift algorithm is that there may be no\ndata points within the neighborhood region defined by a distance parameter. To\ndeal with the community detection problem better, a new algorithm called\nRevised Medoid-Shift (RMS) in this work is thus proposed. During the process of\nfinding the next medoid, the RMS algorithm is based on a neighborhood defined\nby KNN, while the original Medoid-Shift is based on a neighborhood defined by a\ndistance parameter. Since the neighborhood defined by KNN is more stable than\nthe one defined by the distance parameter in terms of the number of data points\nwithin the neighborhood, the RMS algorithm may converge more smoothly. In the\nRMS method, each of the data points is shifted towards a medoid within the\nneighborhood defined by KNN. After the iterative process of shifting, each of\nthe data point converges into a cluster center, and the data points converging\ninto the same center are grouped into the same cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 09:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

The intuition is to perturb the propagation of knowledge in each\ndirection with a controllable unified solution. To this end, we propose a new\nactivation function named R3eLU, transferring private smashed data and partial\nloss into randomized responses in forward and backward propagations,\nrespectively. We give the first attempt to secure split learning against three\nthreatening attacks and present a fine-grained privacy budget allocation\nscheme. The analysis proves that our privacy-preserving SplitNN solution\nprovides a tight privacy budget, while the experimental results show that our\nsolution performs better than existing solutions in most cases and achieves a\ngood tradeoff between defense and model usability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 09:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

The DURATIONS design has been recently proposed as a practical\nalternative to a standard two-arm non-inferiority design when the goal is to\noptimise some continuous aspect of treatment administration, e.g. duration or\nfrequency, preserving efficacy but improving on secondary outcomes such as\nsafety, costs or convenience. The main features of this design are that (i) it\nrandomises patients to a moderate number of arms across the continuum and (ii)\nit uses a model to share information across arms. While papers published to\ndate about the design have focused on analysis aspects, here we show how to\ndesign such a trial in practice. We use the REFINE-Lung trial as an example;\nthis is a trial seeking the optimal frequency of immunotherapy treatment for\nnon-small cell lung cancer patients. Because the aspect of treatment\nadministration to optimise is frequency, rather than duration, we propose to\nrename the design as Multi-Arm Multi-Stage Response Over Continuous\nIntervention (MAMS-ROCI).

However, such long-term\npredictions are extremely challenging, due to the chaotic nature of temperature\nvariations. Moreover, the usefulness of existing simulation-based and machine\nlearning-based methods for this task is limited because initial simulation or\nprediction errors increase exponentially over time. To address this challenging\ntask, we devise a novel prediction method involving an information tracking\nmechanism that aims to track and adapt to changes in temperature dynamics\nduring the prediction phase by providing probabilistic feedback on the\nprediction error of the next step based on the current prediction.

Since the early 2010s, ABSA has achieved\nextraordinarily high accuracy with various deep neural models. However,\nexisting ABSA models with strong in-house performances may fail to generalize\nto some challenging cases where the contexts are variable, i.e., low robustness\nto real-world environments. In this study, we propose to enhance the ABSA\nrobustness by systematically rethinking the bottlenecks from all possible\nangles, including model, data, and training. First, we strengthen the current\nbest-robust syntax-aware models by further incorporating the rich external\nsyntactic dependencies and the labels with aspect simultaneously with a\nuniversal-syntax graph convolutional network. In the corpus perspective, we\npropose to automatically induce high-quality synthetic training data with\nvarious types, allowing models to learn sufficient inductive bias for better\nrobustness. Last, we based on the rich pseudo data perform adversarial training\nto enhance the resistance to the context perturbation and meanwhile employ\ncontrastive learning to reinforce the representations of instances with\ncontrastive sentiments. Extensive robustness evaluations are conducted. The\nresults demonstrate that our enhanced syntax-aware model achieves better\nrobustness performances than all the state-of-the-art baselines. By\nadditionally incorporating our synthetic corpus, the robust testing results are\npushed with around 10% accuracy, which are then further improved by installing\nthe advanced training strategies. In-depth analyses are presented for revealing\nthe factors influencing the ABSA robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 11:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

While a common approach to elevate gain is to enlarge an\nantenna aperture, highly resonant subwavelength structures can potentially\ngrant high gain performances. The Chu-Harrington limit is a standard criterion\nto assess electrically small structures and those surpassing it are called\nsuperdirective. Supergain is obtained in a case when internal losses are\nmitigated, and an antenna is matched to radiation, though typically in a very\nnarrow frequency band. Here we develop a concept of a spectrally overlapping\nresonant cascading, where tailored multipole hierarchy grants both high gain\nand sufficient operational bandwidth. Our architecture is based on a near-field\ncoupled wire bundle. Genetic optimization, constraining both gain and\nbandwidth, is applied on a 24-dimensional space and predicts 8.81 dBi realized\ngain within a half-wavelength in a cube volume. The experimental gain is 6.15\nwith 13% fractional bandwidth. Small wire bundle structures are rather\nattractive for designing superscattering and superdirective structures, as they\nhave a sufficient number of degrees of freedom to perform an optimization, and,\nat the same time rely on simple fabrication-tolerant layouts, based on low-loss\nmaterials. The developed approach can be applied to low-frequency (e.g.,\nkHz-MHz) applications, where miniaturization of wireless devices is highly\ndemanded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 11:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

The SOOP\nran just prior to Solar Orbiter's first close perihelion passage during two\nremote sensing windows (RSW1 and RSW2) between 2022 March 3-6 and 2022 March\n17-22, while Solar Orbiter was at a heliocentric distance of 0.55-0.51 and\n0.38-0.34 au from the Sun, respectively. Coordinated observation campaigns were\nalso conducted by Hinode and IRIS. The magnetic connectivity tool was used,\nalong with low latency in situ data, and full-disk remote sensing observations,\nto guide the target pointing of Solar Orbiter. Solar Orbiter targeted an active\nregion complex during RSW1, the boundary of a coronal hole, and the periphery\nof a decayed active region during RSW2. Post-observation analysis using the\nmagnetic connectivity tool along with in situ measurements from MAG and\nSWA/PAS, show that slow solar wind, with velocities between 210 and 600 km/s,\narrived at the spacecraft originating from two out of the three of the target\nregions.

Transform,\nplays an important role in boosting the RD performance. Analysis transform\nconverts the input image to a compact latent representation. The more compact\nthe latent representation is, the fewer bits we need to compress it. When\ndesigning better transform, some previous works adopt Swin-Transformer. The\nsuccess of the Swin-Transformer in image compression can be attributed to the\ndynamic weights and large receptive field.However,the LayerNorm adopted in\ntransformers is not suitable for image compression.We find CNN-based modules\ncan also be dynamic and have large receptive-fields. The CNN-based modules can\nalso work with GDN/IGDN. To make the CNN-based modules dynamic, we generate the\nweights of kernels conditioned on the input feature. We scale up the size of\neach kernel for larger receptive fields. To reduce complexity, we make the\nCNN-module channel-wise connected. We call this module Dynamic Depth-wise\nconvolution. We replace the self-attention module with the proposed Dynamic\nDepth-wise convolution, replace the embedding layer with a depth-wise residual\nbottleneck for non-linearity and replace the FFN layer with an inverted\nresidual bottleneck for more interactions in the spatial domain. The\ninteractions among channels of dynamic depth-wise convolution are limited. We\ndesign the other block, which replaces the dynamic depth-wise convolution with\nchannel attention. We equip the proposed modules in the analysis and synthesis\ntransform and receive a more compact latent representation and propose the\nlearned image compression model SLIC, meaning Self-Conditioned Adaptive\nTransform with Large-Scale Receptive Fields for Learned Image Compression\nLearned Image Compression.

In addition to pre-training techniques,\ninspired by the latest work in the natural language fields, more recent work\nhas shifted towards applying effective fine-tuning approaches, such as\nparameter-efficient tuning (delta tuning). However, given the substantial\ndifferences between GNNs and transformer-based models, applying such approaches\ndirectly to GNNs proved to be less effective. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive comparison of delta tuning techniques for GNNs and propose a\nnovel delta tuning method specifically designed for GNNs, called AdapterGNN.\nAdapterGNN preserves the knowledge of the large pre-trained model and leverages\nhighly expressive adapters for GNNs, which can adapt to downstream tasks\neffectively with only a few parameters, while also improving the model's\ngeneralization ability on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that\nAdapterGNN achieves higher evaluation performance (outperforming full\nfine-tuning by 1.4% and 5.5% in the chemistry and biology domains respectively,\nwith only 5% of its parameters tuned) and lower generalization gaps compared to\nfull fine-tuning.

The\nmost critical obstacle is figuring out how to effectively use the target task\ninformation to form an efficient optimization strategy. However, current\nmethods are weak due to the poor representation of the optimization strategy\nand the inefficient interaction between the optimization strategy and the\ntarget task. To overcome the above limitations, we design a learned EA (LEA) to\nrealize the move from hand-designed optimization strategies to learned\noptimization strategies, including not only hyperparameters but also update\nrules.

The study uses numerical\nsimulations to examine the effects of varying submergence depths and the impact\nof monochromatic waves on the foil's performance.

The performance was found to be\ncorrelated with the resonant frequency of the heaving motion and its proximity\nto the damped natural frequency. The effects of regular waves on the foil's\nperformance were also investigated, showing that waves with a frequency close\nto that of the natural frequency of the flapping foil aided energy harvesting.\nOverall, this study provides insights that could be useful for future design\nimprovements for fully passive flapping foil devices for energy harvesting\noperating near the free surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 12:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

Even with today's most\npowerful classical algorithms, the CVRP is challenging to solve classically.\nQuantum computing may offer a way to improve the time to solution, although the\nquestion remains open as to whether Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)\ndevices can achieve a practical advantage compared to classical heuristics. The\nmost prominent algorithms proposed to solve combinatorial optimization problems\nin the NISQ era are the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and\nthe more general Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). However, implementing\nthem in a way that reliably provides high-quality solutions is challenging,\neven for toy examples. In this work, we discuss decomposition and formulation\naspects of the CVRP and propose an application-driven way to measure solution\nquality.

Much of the remarkable recent progress on deterministic\ndistributed coloring algorithms is based on two main tools: a) defective\ncolorings in which every node of a given color can have a limited number of\nneighbors of the same color and b) list coloring, a natural generalization of\nthe standard coloring problem that naturally appears when colorings are\ncomputed in different stages and one has to extend a previously computed\npartial coloring to a full coloring.\n  In this paper, we introduce \\emph{list defective colorings}, which can be\nseen as a generalization of these two coloring variants. Essentially, in a list\ndefective coloring instance, each node $v$ is given a list of colors\n$x_{v,1},\\dots,x_{v,p}$ together with a list of defects $d_{v,1},\\dots,d_{v,p}$\nsuch that if $v$ is colored with color $x_{v, i}$, it is allowed to have at\nmost $d_{v, i}$ neighbors with color $x_{v, i}$.\n  We highlight the important role of list defective colorings by showing that\nfaster list defective coloring algorithms would directly lead to faster\ndeterministic $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithms in the LOCAL model. Further, we\nextend a recent distributed list coloring algorithm by Maus and Tonoyan [DISC\n'20]. Slightly simplified, we show that if for each node $v$ it holds that\n$\\sum_{i=1}^p \\big(d_{v,i}+1)^2 > \\mathrm{deg}_G^2(v)\\cdot polylog\\Delta$ then\nthis list defective coloring instance can be solved in a\ncommunication-efficient way in only $O(\\log\\Delta)$ communication rounds. This\nleads to the first deterministic $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm in the\nstandard CONGEST model with a time complexity of $O(\\sqrt{\\Delta}\\cdot polylog\n\\Delta+\\log^* n)$, matching the best time complexity in the LOCAL model up to a\n$polylog\\Delta$ factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 13:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

We\nargue that this learning strategy is suboptimal in the realm of RS, since the\nrequired representations for different RS downstream tasks are often varied and\ncomplex. In this study, we proposed a unified SSL framework that is better\nsuited for RS images representation learning. The proposed SSL framework,\nContrastive Mask Image Distillation (CMID), is capable of learning\nrepresentations with both global semantic separability and local spatial\nperceptibility by combining contrastive learning (CL) with masked image\nmodeling (MIM) in a self-distillation way. Furthermore, our CMID learning\nframework is architecture-agnostic, which is compatible with both convolutional\nneural networks (CNN) and vision transformers (ViT), allowing CMID to be easily\nadapted to a variety of deep learning (DL) applications for RS understanding.\nComprehensive experiments have been carried out on four downstream tasks (i.e.\nscene classification, semantic segmentation, object-detection, and change\ndetection) and the results show that models pre-trained using CMID achieve\nbetter performance than other state-of-the-art SSL methods on multiple\ndownstream tasks.

This phenomenon has been\nqualitatively understood by describing the wave field in the metamaterial using\nthe local Bloch wave approximation (LBWA), which locally represents the wave\nfield as a superposition of propagating wave solutions in the cognate infinite\nperiodic media (so-called Bloch waves). We evaluate the performance of the LBWA\nquantitatively in the context of two-dimensional linear water-wave scattering\nby graded arrays of surface-piercing vertical barriers. To do this, we\nimplement the LBWA numerically so that the Bloch waves in one region of the\ngraded array are coupled to Bloch waves in adjacent regions. This coupling is\ncomputed by solving the scattering of Bloch waves across the interface between\ntwo semi-infinite arrays of vertical barriers, where the barriers in each\nsemi-infinite array can have different submergence depths. Our results suggest\nthat the LBWA accurately predicts the free surface amplitude across a wide\nrange of frequencies, except those just above the cutoff frequencies associated\nwith each of the vertical barriers in the array.

The plasma is modelled by\nusing the drift-reduced fluid Braginskii equations, while the neutral dynamics\nis described by a kinetic model. To control the divertor conditions, a D$_2$\npuffing is used and the effect of increasing the puffing strength is\ninvestigated. The increase in fuelling leads to an increase of density in the\nscrape-off layer and a decrease of the plasma temperature. At the same time,\nthe particle and heat fluxes to the divertor target decrease and the detachment\nof the inner target is observed. The analysis of particle and transport balance\nin the divertor volume shows that the decrease of the particle flux is caused\nby a decrease of the local neutral ionization together with a decrease of the\nparallel velocity, both caused by the lower plasma temperature. The relative\nimportance of the different collision terms is assessed, showing the crucial\nrole of molecular interactions, as they are responsible for increasing the\natomic neutral density and temperature, since most of the D neutrals are\nproduced by molecular activated recombination and D$_2$ dissociation.

While relying upon Software-Defined Networking (SDN),\nIntent-Based Networking (IBN) pushes the frontiers of efficient networking by\ndecoupling the intentions of a network operator (i.e., what is desired to be\ndone) from the implementation (i.e., how is it achieved). The advantages of\nsuch a paradigm have long been argued and include, but are not limited to, the\nreduction of human errors, reduced expertise requirements among operator\npersonnel, and faster business plan adaptation. In previous work, we have shown\nhow incorporating IBN in multi-domain networks can have a significantly\npositive impact as it can enable decentralized operation, accountability, and\nconfidentiality. The pillar of our previous contribution is the compilation of\nintents using system-generated intent trees. In this work, we extend the\narchitecture to enable grooming among the user intents. Therefore, separate\nintents can now end up using the same network resources. While this makes the\nintent system reasonably more complex, it indisputably improves resource\nallocation. To represent the intent relationships of the newly enhanced\narchitecture, we use Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Furthermore, we\nappropriately adapt an advanced established technique from the literature to\nsolve the Routing, Modulation, and Spectrum Assignment (RMSA) problem for the\nintent compilation.

Biological systems often exhibit substantial parameter heterogeneity,\nfor instance through copy number fluctuations of key molecules or variability\nin modulating factors.

This\ninformation is required for the simple HWENO reconstructions, which take\nadvantages of the simple WENO and the classic HWENO. Compared with the original\nRunge-Kutta HWENO method (RK-HWENO), the new method has two advantages.\nFirstly, RK-HWENO method must solve the additional equations for\nreconstructions, which is avoided for the new method. Secondly, the SHWENO\nreconstruction is performed once with one stencil and is different from the\nclassic HWENO methods, in which both the function and its derivative values are\nreconstructed with two different stencils, respectively. Thus the new method is\nmore efficient than the RK-HWENO method. Moreover, the new method is more\ncompact than the existing ADER-WENO method.

Due to the significant amount of spectral\ninformation from recent HSI sensors, analyzing the acquired images is\nchallenging using traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods. As the number of\nfrequency bands increases, the required number of training samples increases\nexponentially to achieve a reasonable classification accuracy, also known as\nthe curse of dimensionality. Therefore, separate band selection or\ndimensionality reduction techniques are often applied before performing any\nclassification task over HSI data. In this study, we investigate recently\nproposed subspace learning methods for one-class classification (OCC). These\nmethods map high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional feature space that is\noptimized for one-class classification. In this way, there is no separate\ndimensionality reduction or feature selection procedure needed in the proposed\nclassification framework. Moreover, one-class classifiers have the ability to\nlearn a data description from the category of a single class only. Considering\nthe imbalanced labels of the LULC classification problem and rich spectral\ninformation (high number of dimensions), the proposed classification approach\nis well-suited for HSI data. Overall, this is a pioneer study focusing on\nsubspace learning-based one-class classification for HSI data.

In\nAI-driven virtual rehabilitation programs, patients complete their exercises\nindependently at home, while AI algorithms analyze the exercise data to provide\nfeedback to patients and report their progress to clinicians. To analyze\nexercise data, the first step is to segment it into consecutive repetitions.\nThere has been a significant amount of research performed on segmenting and\ncounting the repetitive activities of healthy individuals using raw video data,\nwhich raises concerns regarding privacy and is computationally intensive.\nPrevious research on patients' rehabilitation exercise segmentation relied on\ndata collected by multiple wearable sensors, which are difficult to use at home\nby rehabilitation patients. Compared to healthy individuals, segmenting and\ncounting exercise repetitions in patients is more challenging because of the\nirregular repetition duration and the variation between repetitions. This paper\npresents a novel approach for segmenting and counting the repetitions of\nrehabilitation exercises performed by patients, based on their skeletal body\njoints. Skeletal body joints can be acquired through depth cameras or computer\nvision techniques applied to RGB videos of patients. Various sequential neural\nnetworks are designed to analyze the sequences of skeletal body joints and\nperform repetition segmentation and counting. Extensive experiments on three\npublicly available rehabilitation exercise datasets, KIMORE, UI-PRMD, and\nIntelliRehabDS, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to\nprevious methods. The proposed method enables accurate exercise analysis while\npreserving privacy, facilitating the effective delivery of virtual\nrehabilitation programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 15:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

An accurate prediction of a future\ntrajectory does not just rely on the previous trajectory, but also, more\nimportantly, a simulation of the complex interactions between other vehicles\nnearby. Most state-of-the-art networks built to tackle the problem assume\nreadily available past trajectory points, hence lacking a full end-to-end\npipeline with direct video-to-output mechanism. In this article, we thus\npropose a novel end-to-end architecture that takes raw video inputs and outputs\nfuture trajectory predictions. It first extracts and tracks the 3D location of\nthe nearby vehicles via multi-head attention-based regression networks as well\nas non-linear optimization. This provides the past trajectory points which then\nfeeds into the trajectory prediction algorithm consisting of an attention-based\nLSTM encoder-decoder architecture, which allows it to model the complicated\ninterdependence between the vehicles and make an accurate prediction of the\nfuture trajectory points of the surrounding vehicles. The proposed model is\nevaluated on the large-scale BLVD dataset, and has also been implemented on\nCARLA. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nvarious state-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 15:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

However, the local statistics may not well represent the true global\nrobustness of the underlying unknown data distribution. To address this\nchallenge, this paper makes the first attempt to present a new framework,\ncalled GREAT Score , for global robustness evaluation of adversarial\nperturbation using generative models. Formally, GREAT Score carries the\nphysical meaning of a global statistic capturing a mean certified attack-proof\nperturbation level over all samples drawn from a generative model. For\nfinite-sample evaluation, we also derive a probabilistic guarantee on the\nsample complexity and the difference between the sample mean and the true mean.\nGREAT Score has several advantages: (1) Robustness evaluations using GREAT\nScore are efficient and scalable to large models, by sparing the need of\nrunning adversarial attacks. In particular, we show high correlation and\nsignificantly reduced computation cost of GREAT Score when compared to the\nattack-based model ranking on RobustBench (Croce,et. al. 2021). (2) The use of\ngenerative models facilitates the approximation of the unknown data\ndistribution. In our ablation study with different generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs), we observe consistency between global robustness evaluation\nand the quality of GANs. (3) GREAT Score can be used for remote auditing of\nprivacy-sensitive black-box models, as demonstrated by our robustness\nevaluation on several online facial recognition services.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 14:58:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 01:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Many\nimportant decisions are delegated to AI algorithms: accessing higher education,\ndetermining prison sentences, autonomously driving vehicles... Engineers and\nresearchers are educated to this field, while the general population has very\nlittle knowledge about AI. As a result, they are very sensitive to the (more or\nless accurate) ideas disseminated by the media: an AI that is unbiased,\ninfallible, and will either save the world or lead to its demise. We therefore\nbelieve, as highlighted by UNESCO, that it is essential to provide the\npopulation with a general understanding of AI algorithms, so that they can\nchoose wisely whether to use them (or not). To this end, we propose a serious\ngame in the form of a civic debate aiming at selecting an AI solution to\ncontrol a pandemic.

For example, fluorescence microscopy provides unique\nfunctional contrast by imaging only specifically labeled components, especially\nin biological samples. However, the achievable structural information on the\nsample in its full complexity is limited. Here, the intrinsic label-free carbon\ncontrast of water window soft X-ray microscopy can complement fluorescence\nimages in a correlative approach ultimately combining nanoscale structural\nresolution with functional contrast. However, soft X-ray microscopes are\ncomplex and elaborate, and typically require a large-scale synchrotron\nradiation source due to the demanding photon flux requirements. Yet, with\nmodern high-power lasers it has become possible to generate sufficient photon\nflux from laser-produced plasmas, thus enabling laboratory-based setups. Here,\nwe present a compact table-top soft X-ray microscope with an integrated\nepifluorescence modality for 'in-situ' correlative imaging. Samples remain in\nplace when switching between modalities, ensuring identical measurement\nconditions and avoiding sample alteration or destruction. We demonstrate our\nnew method by multimodal images of several exemplary samples ranging from\nnanoparticles to various multicolor labeled cell types. A structural resolution\nof down to 50 nm was reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 08:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

In pursuit of better quality, the model size and complexity\ngrow over time, which requires additional training data to avoid overfitting.\nThis model growth demands a large number of resources in data centers. Hence,\ntraining efficiency is becoming considerably more important to keep the data\ncenter power demand manageable. In Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM),\nsparse features capturing categorical inputs through embedding tables are the\nmajor contributors to model size and require high memory bandwidth. In this\npaper, we study the bandwidth requirement and locality of embedding tables in\nreal-world deployed models. We observe that the bandwidth requirement is not\nuniform across different tables and that embedding tables show high temporal\nlocality. We then design MTrainS, which leverages heterogeneous memory,\nincluding byte and block addressable Storage Class Memory for DLRM\nhierarchically. MTrainS allows for higher memory capacity per node and\nincreases training efficiency by lowering the need to scale out to multiple\nhosts in memory capacity bound use cases. By optimizing the platform memory\nhierarchy, we reduce the number of nodes for training by 4-8X, saving power and\ncost of training while meeting our target training performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 06:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}
