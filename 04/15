For this extended problem setup, which can\nprompt novel behaviour, we propose a comprehensive solution. First, we extend\nthe well-known running consensus detector (RCD) to this correlated setup; then,\nwe design an efficient implementation of the RCD by exploiting the underlying\nARMA structures; and, finally, we derive the theoretical asymptotic performance\nof the RCD in this ARMA setup. It turns out that the error probability at each\nagent exhibits one of two regimes: either (a) the error probability decays\nexponentially fast to zero or (b) it converges to a strictly positive error\nfloor. While regime (a) spans staple results in large deviation theory, regime\n(b) is new in distributed detection and is elicited by the ARMA setup. We fully\ncharacterize these two scenarios: we give necessary and sufficient conditions,\nphrased in terms of the zero and poles of the underlying ARMA models, for the\nemergence of each regime, and provide closed-form expressions for both the\ndecay rates of regime (a) and the positive error floors of regime (b).

The existing methods mainly use the convolutional neural network (CNN) as\nthe backbone network to extract features. However, these methods mainly focus\non small discriminative regions while ignoring the global perspective. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a pure transformer-based multi-task PAR\nnetwork named PARFormer, which includes four modules. In the feature extraction\nmodule, we build a transformer-based strong baseline for feature extraction,\nwhich achieves competitive results on several PAR benchmarks compared with the\nexisting CNN-based baseline methods. In the feature processing module, we\npropose an effective data augmentation strategy named batch random mask (BRM)\nblock to reinforce the attentive feature learning of random patches.\nFurthermore, we propose a multi-attribute center loss (MACL) to enhance the\ninter-attribute discriminability in the feature representations. In the\nviewpoint perception module, we explore the impact of viewpoints on pedestrian\nattributes, and propose a multi-view contrastive loss (MCVL) that enables the\nnetwork to exploit the viewpoint information. In the attribute recognition\nmodule, we alleviate the negative-positive imbalance problem to generate the\nattribute predictions.

Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the localization\nusing monocular visual cameras. While structure from motion (SfM) predicts the\nabsolute pose from a point cloud, absolute pose regression (APR) methods learn\na semantic understanding of the environment through neural networks. However,\nboth fields face challenges caused by the environment such as motion blur,\nlighting changes, repetitive patterns, and feature-less structures. This study\naims to address these challenges by incorporating additional information and\nregularizing the absolute pose using relative pose regression (RPR) methods.\nThe optical flow between consecutive images is computed using the Lucas-Kanade\nalgorithm, and the relative pose is predicted using an auxiliary small\nrecurrent convolutional network. The fusion of absolute and relative poses is a\ncomplex task due to the mismatch between the global and local coordinate\nsystems. State-of-the-art methods fusing absolute and relative poses use pose\ngraph optimization (PGO) to regularize the absolute pose predictions using\nrelative poses. In this work, we propose recurrent fusion networks to optimally\nalign absolute and relative pose predictions to improve the absolute pose\nprediction. We evaluate eight different recurrent units and construct a\nsimulation environment to pre-train the APR and RPR networks for better\ngeneralized training. Additionally, we record a large database of different\nscenarios in a challenging large-scale indoor environment that mimics a\nwarehouse with transportation robots. We conduct hyperparameter searches and\nexperiments to show the effectiveness of our recurrent fusion method compared\nto PGO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 16:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

The regularization techniques such as L1, L2, dropout, etc. are\nproposed to reduce the overfitting effect; however, they bring in additional\nhyperparameters tuning complexity. These methods also fall short when the\ninter-class similarity is high due to the underlying data distribution, leading\nto a less accurate model. In this paper, we present a novel approach to\nregularize the models by leveraging the information-rich latent embeddings and\ntheir high intra-class correlation. We create phantom embeddings from a subset\nof homogenous samples and use these phantom embeddings to decrease the\ninter-class similarity of instances in their latent embedding space. The\nresulting models generalize better as a combination of their embedding and\nregularize them without requiring an expensive hyperparameter search. We\nevaluate our method on two popular and challenging image classification\ndatasets (CIFAR and FashionMNIST) and show how our approach outperforms the\nstandard baselines while displaying better training behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 17:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

In this paper, we propose a novel learning procedure to assist in the\nsolution of a well-known computationally difficult optimization problem in\npower systems: The Direct Current Optimal Transmission Switching (DC-OTS). This\nmodel consists in finding the configuration of the power network that results\nin the cheapest dispatch of the power generating units. For this, the model\nincludes a set of binaries that determine the on/off status of the switchable\ntransmission lines. Therefore, the DC-OTS problem takes the form of a\nmixed-integer program, which is NP-hard in general. Its solution has been\napproached by way of exact and heuristic methods. The former employ techniques\nfrom mixed-integer programming to solve the problem to certified global\noptimality, while the latter seek to identify good solutions quickly. While the\nheuristic methods tend to be comparatively much faster, they may suggest\nsuboptimal or even infeasible networks topologies. The proposed approach in\nthis paper leverages known solutions to past instances of the DC-OTS problem to\nspeed up the mixed-integer optimization of a new unseen model. Although it does\nnot offer optimality guarantees, a series of numerical experiments run on a\nreal-life power system dataset show that it features a very high success rate\nin identifying the optimal grid topology (especially when compared to\nalternative competing heuristics), while rendering remarkable speed-up factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 17:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

The amplitude of the first (wake)\ncontribution is known to diverge as a system approaches marginal stability. In\nthis paper we consider the linear response of a homogeneous stellar system to a\npoint mass moving on a straight line orbit.

We give the first $H$-consistency bounds for\nthese loss functions. These are non-asymptotic guarantees that upper bound the\nzero-one loss estimation error in terms of the estimation error of a surrogate\nloss, for the specific hypothesis set $H$ used. We further show that our bounds\nare tight. These bounds depend on quantities called minimizability gaps, which\nonly depend on the loss function and the hypothesis set.

Such experiments test the degree of generality of\nthese anomalies, by exploring the same acceleration regime using independent\nastronomical systems of vastly smaller mass and size. A signal above Newtonian\nexpectations has been observed when $a<a_{0}$, alternatively interpreted as\nevidence of a modification in the relevant fundamental physics, or as being due\nto kinematic contaminants affecting the experiment; the presence of undetected\nstellar components, unbound encounters and spurious projection effects.

Interestingly, the sample transforms from blue to\npink to red as a function of pressure, but only the pink phase is\nsuperconducting. Subsequent experimental studies have failed to reproduce the\nsuperconductivity, but have confirmed the existence of pressure-driven colour\nchanges. However, these colour changes appear in different sequences and at\ndifferent pressures depending on the experiment, with observed colours\nincluding blue, pink, red, violet, and orange. Given the relationship between\ncolour and superconductivity, understanding colour changes in nitrogen-doped\nlutetium hydride may hold the key to clarifying the possible superconductivity\nin this compound. Here, we describe a full microscopic theory of colour in\nlutetium hydride. We find that hydrogen-deficient LuH$_2$ is the only phase\nwhich exhibits colour changes under pressure consistent with experimental\nreports, with a sequence blue-violet-pink-red-orange. We also find that the\nconcentration of hydrogen vacancies controls the precise sequence and pressure\nof colour changes, rationalising seemingly contradictory experiments. Nitrogen\ndoping also modifies the colour of LuH$_2$ but it plays a secondary role\ncompared to hydrogen vacancies.

Thus, data\ncompression is becoming a critical technique to mitigate the storage burden and\ncommunication cost. LZSS is the core algorithm in many widely used compressors,\nsuch as Deflate. However, existing GPU-based LZSS compressors suffer from low\nthroughput due to the sequential nature of the LZSS algorithm. Moreover, many\nGPU applications produce multi-byte data (e.g., int16/int32 index,\nfloating-point numbers), while the current LZSS compression only takes\nsingle-byte data as input. To this end, in this work, we propose GPULZ, a\nhighly efficient LZSS compression on modern GPUs for multi-byte data. The\ncontribution of our work is fourfold: First, we perform an in-depth analysis of\nexisting LZ compressors for GPUs and investigate their main issues. Then, we\npropose two main algorithm-level optimizations.

In order to\ncharacterize protoplanetary disk magnetic fields, we investigate the impact of\nthe Zeeman effect on the (polarized) radiative transfer of emission from\nparamagnetic molecules excited in protoplanetary disks. While the effects of\nthe Zeeman effect are commonly studied in the circular polarization of spectral\nlines, we perform a comprehensive modeling also of the Zeeman-induced\nbroadening of spectral lines and their linear polarization. We develop\nsimplified radiative transfer models adapted to protoplanetary disks, which we\ncompare to full three-dimensional polarized radiative transfer simulations. We\nfind that the radiative transfer of circular polarization is heavily affected\nby the expected polarity-change of the magnetic field between opposite sides of\nthe disk. In contrast, Zeeman broadening and linear polarization are relatively\nunaffected by this sign change due to their quadratic dependence on the\nmagnetic field. We can match our simplified radiative transfer models to full\npolarization modeling with high fidelity, which in turn allows us to prescribe\nstraight-forward methods to extract magnetic field information from Zeeman\nbroadening and linear polarization observations. We find that Zeeman broadening\nand linear polarization observations are highly advantageous methods to\ncharacterize protoplanetary disk magnetic fields as they are both sensitive\nprobes of the magnetic field and are marginally affected by any sign change of\nthe disk magnetic field.

These industrial facilities face various cyberattacks that may\ncause physical damage. With the increasing integration of the ICSs and\ninformation technology (IT) components, ensuring the security of ICSs is of\nparamount importance. Typically, a cyberattack in ICS aims to impose physical\ndamage on the ICSs by exploiting a sequence of vulnerabilities that leads to\ncompromising the system's sensors and/or controllers. Due to the physics of the\nICSs operation, maliciously accessing different sensors or components may cause\nvarying levels of risk. Therefore, identifying cyberattacks with the highest\nrisks is essential for effectively designing detection schemes and mitigation\nstrategies. In this paper, we develop an optimization-based holistic\ncybersecurity risk assessment framework by integrating the cyber and physical\nsystems of ICSs to understand 1) the vulnerabilities of the ICS network with\nholistic consideration of cyber and physical components and their interactions,\nand 2) the attack strategies that can lead to significant physical damage to\nthe critical assets in ICS.

Broadly, these are members of the family of\nblack-bounce spacetimes, and the family of black holes with asymptotically\nMinkowski cores.

This paper investigates the use of InstructGPT to assist\nphysicians in determining eligibility for clinical trials based on a patient's\nsummarised medical profile. Using a prompting strategy combining one-shot,\nselection-inference and chain-of-thought techniques, we investigate the\nperformance of LLMs on 10 synthetically created patient profiles. Performance\nis evaluated at four levels: ability to identify screenable eligibility\ncriteria from a trial given a medical profile; ability to classify for each\nindividual criterion whether the patient qualifies; the overall classification\nwhether a patient is eligible for a clinical trial and the percentage of\ncriteria to be screened by physician. We evaluated against 146 clinical trials\nand a total of 4,135 eligibility criteria. The LLM was able to correctly\nidentify the screenability of 72% (2,994/4,135) of the criteria. Additionally,\n72% (341/471) of the screenable criteria were evaluated correctly. The\nresulting trial level classification as eligible or ineligible resulted in a\nrecall of 0.5. By leveraging LLMs with a physician-in-the-loop, a recall of 1.0\nand precision of 0.71 on clinical trial level can be achieved while reducing\nthe amount of criteria to be checked by an estimated 90%. LLMs can be used to\nassist physicians with pre-screening of patients for clinical trials.

We present the first fully dynamic algorithm that\nmaintains the shortest paths against an adaptive adversary in subquadratic\nupdate time. This is obtained via a combinatorial reduction that allows\nreconstructing the shortest paths with only a few distance estimates. Using\nthis reduction, we obtain the following:\n  On weighted directed graphs with real edge weights in $[1,W]$, we can\nmaintain $(1+\\epsilon)$ approximate shortest paths in\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{1.816}\\epsilon^{-2} \\log W)$ update and $\\tilde{O}(n^{1.741}\n\\epsilon^{-2} \\log W)$ query time.

For transportation studies driven by GPS data, assuring the\ndata quality by removing noises caused by data oscillations is undoubtedly\nimportant. Most GPS-based studies simply remove oscillations by checking the\nhigh speed. However, this method can mistakenly identify normal points as\noscillations.

To avoid network\ncongestion, collaborative edge computing has become an emerging paradigm to\nenable different ESs to collaboratively share their data and computation\nresources. However, most papers in collaborative edge computing only allow\none-hop offloading, which may limit computing resource sharing due to either\npoor channel conditions or computing workload at ESs one-hop away. By allowing\nESs multi-hop away to also share the computing workload, a multi-hop MEC\nenables more ESs to share their computing resources.

By using\ncolloidal disks and rods with different geometric shapes and boundary\nconditions, we demonstrate that these anisotropic colloidal inclusions exhibit\nbiaxial orientational probability distributions, where they tend to orient with\nthe long rod axes and disk normals perpendicular to the helix axis, thus\nimparting strong local biaxiality on the hybrid cholesteric LC structure.\nUnlike the situation in achiral hybrid molecular-colloidal LCs, where biaxial\norder emerges only at modest to high volume fractions of the anisotropic\ncolloidal particles, the orientational probability distribution of colloidal\ninclusions immersed in chiral nematic hosts are unavoidably biaxial even at\nvanishingly low particle volume fractions. In addition, the colloidal\ninclusions induce local biaxiality in the molecular orientational order of the\nLC host medium, which enhances the weak biaxiality of the LC in a chiral\nnematic phase coming from the symmetry breaking caused by the presence of the\nhelical axis.

Motivated by the\nempirical study of context alignment between two domains, we aim to transfer\nknowledge between two domains via adaptively sampling context information for\ntwo domains.

Recently, a framework was proposed for using positive\nmatrices to parameterize a class of positive semi-separable kernels. Although\nthis class can be shown to meet all three criteria, previous algorithms for\noptimization of such kernels were limited to classification and furthermore\nrelied on computationally complex Semidefinite Programming (SDP) algorithms.

In\nthis work, we propose to explore this problem based on a design approach.\nStarting from a small initial set of samples, we adaptively discover critical\nsamples to achieve increasingly accurate learning of the system evolution. One\ncentral challenge here is that we do not know the network modeling error since\nthe ground-truth system state is unknown, which is however needed for critical\nsampling. To address this challenge, we introduce a multi-step reciprocal\nprediction network where forward and backward evolution networks are designed\nto learn the temporal evolution behavior in the forward and backward time\ndirections, respectively. Very interestingly, we find that the desired network\nmodeling error is highly correlated with the multi-step reciprocal prediction\nerror, which can be directly computed from the current system state. This\nallows us to perform a dynamic selection of critical samples from regions with\nhigh network modeling errors for dynamical systems. Additionally, a joint\nspatial-temporal evolution network is introduced which incorporates spatial\ndynamics modeling into the temporal evolution prediction for robust learning of\nthe system evolution operator with few samples. Our extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that our proposed method is able to dramatically reduce the\nnumber of samples needed for effective learning and accurate prediction of\nevolution behaviors of unknown dynamical systems by up to hundreds of times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2023 06:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Nevertheless, to\nproperly learn a powerful and robust model, these methods generally require\nlarge quantities of data, the collection of which from multiple centers may\ncause ethical and data privacy violation issues. Lately, federated learning has\nserved as a promising solution to exploit multi-center data while getting rid\nof the data transfer between institutions. However, high heterogeneity exists\nin the data from different centers, and existing federated learning methods\ntend to use average aggregation methods to combine the client's information,\nwhich limits the performance and generalization capability of the trained\nmodels. In this paper, we propose a Model-based Federated learning framework\n(ModFed). ModFed has three major contributions: 1) Different from the existing\ndata-driven federated learning methods, model-driven neural networks are\ndesigned to relieve each client's dependency on large data; 2) An adaptive\ndynamic aggregation scheme is proposed to address the data heterogeneity issue\nand improve the generalization capability and robustness the trained neural\nnetwork models; 3) A spatial Laplacian attention mechanism and a personalized\nclient-side loss regularization are introduced to capture the detailed\ninformation for accurate image reconstruction. ModFed is evaluated on three\nin-vivo datasets.

In contrast to directly using one model's predictions as pseudo\nlabels, our key idea is that high-quality pseudo labels should be generated by\ncomparing multiple confidence maps produced by different networks to select the\nmost confident one (a compete-to-win strategy). To further refine pseudo labels\nat near-boundary areas, an enhanced version of ComWin, namely, ComWin+, is\nproposed by integrating a boundary-aware enhancement module. Experiments show\nthat our method can achieve the best performance on three public medical image\ndatasets for cardiac structure segmentation, pancreas segmentation and colon\ntumor segmentation, respectively.

One of the major challenges is yet credit assignment, which aims to\ncredit agents by their contributions. Prior studies focus on either implicitly\ndecomposing the joint value function or explicitly computing the payoff\ndistribution of all agents. However, in episodic reinforcement learning\nsettings where global rewards can only be revealed at the end of the episode,\nexisting methods usually fail to work. They lack the functionality of modeling\ncomplicated relations of the delayed global reward in the temporal dimension\nand suffer from large variance and bias. We propose a novel method named\nSpatial-Temporal Attention with Shapley (STAS) for return decomposition; STAS\nlearns credit assignment in both the temporal and the spatial dimension. It\nfirst decomposes the global return back to each time step, then utilizes\nShapley Value to redistribute the individual payoff from the decomposed global\nreward. To mitigate the computational complexity of Shapley Value, we introduce\nan approximation of marginal contribution and utilize Monte Carlo sampling to\nestimate Shapley Value. We evaluate our method on the classical Alice & Bob\nexample and Multi-agent Particle Environments benchmarks across different\nscenarios, and we show our methods achieve an effective spatial-temporal credit\nassignment and outperform all state-of-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2023 10:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Here, we report a\nsimple, physically-based atomistic model with few (maximum 10 parameters for\nthe systems considered here) adjustable parameters that can accurately\nrepresent the changes in the electronic polarizability tensor for molecules and\nsolid-state systems. Due to its compactness, the model can be applied for\nsimulations of Raman spectra of large (~ 1,000,000-atom) systems with modest\ncomputational cost.

RoboREIT is extensible with various scenarios.\n[Results] We performed an exploratory user study to evaluate RoboREIT and\ndemonstrate its applicability in requirements elicitation interview training.\nThe quantitative and qualitative analyses of the users' responses reveal the\nappreciation of RoboREIT and provide further suggestions about how to improve\nit. [Contribution] Our study is the first in the literature that utilizes a\nsocial robot in requirements elicitation interview education. RoboREIT's\ninnovative design incorporates replaying faulty interview stages and allows the\nstudent to learn from mistakes by a second time practicing. All participants\npraised the feedback component, which is not present in the state-of-the-art,\nfor being helpful in identifying the mistakes. A favorable response rate of 81%\nfor the system's usefulness indicates the positive perception of the\nparticipants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2023 11:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

We study the suitability of a fibred generalisation of\nthe ideal completion of a preorder to act as a completion for doctrines to the\nsyntax of geometric logic. In contrast to other completions of doctrines\nconsidered in the literature, our completion takes a Grothendieck topology as a\nsecond argument. As a result, the geometric completion is idempotent, as well\nas being `semantically invariant' for any doctrine whose models can be\nexpressed as a category of continuous flat functors, encompassing a wide class\nof the most commonly considered doctrines.\n  We also relate the geometric completion to other completions of doctrines\nconsidered in the literature: first, by studying the behaviour of the geometric\ncompletion when the second argument is omitted, and then by studying the\ninteraction with those completions of doctrines that complete to a fragment of\ngeometric logic. Throughout, we reference how these completions of doctrines\nyield completions of categories via the syntactic category construction.

A lightweight multilayer perceptron denoising filter\n(MLPF) provides state-of-the-art low-cost denoising accuracy.

This paper proposes two digital logic\nimplementations of the MLPF denoiser and quantifies their resource cost, power,\nand latency. The hardware MLPF quantizes the weights and hidden unit\nactivations to 4 bits and has about 1k weights with about 40% sparsity. The\nArea-Under-Curve Receiver Operating Characteristic accuracy is nearly\nindistinguishable from that of the floating point network. The FPGA MLPF\nprocesses each event in 10 clock cycles. In FPGA, it uses 3.5k flip flops and\n11.5k LUTs. Our ASIC implementation in 65nm digital technology for a 346x260\npixel camera occupies an area of 4.3mm^2 and consumes 4nJ of energy per event\nat event rates up to 25MHz. The MLPF can be easily integrated into an event\ncamera using an FPGA or as an ASIC directly on the camera chip or in the same\npackage.

Fortunately, we observe that developers often\nembed such domain knowledge that encodes MRs in test cases, even without the\nawareness of metamorphic testing. These encoded MRs might be generalized and\nuseful for testing the original programs (where these MRs are found) and other\nprograms with similar functionalities.\n  In this paper, we propose MR-Extractor, to automatically discover metamorphic\nrelations from existing test cases in open-source software (OSS) projects.\nMR-Extractor firstly identifies MR-encoded test cases in OSS, and then\ngeneralizes encoded MRs and codifies them into parameterized methods (called\ncodified MR) for MT.

In this paper, we present\na provable implicit nonlinear difference scheme which preserves at least three\ndiscrete conservation invariants: energy, mass, and momentum, and prove the\nexistence of the difference solution via the Browder theorem. The error\nanalysis is based on novel and refined estimates of the bilinear operator in\nthe difference scheme.

Although the performance of cross-modal retrieval has greatly\nimproved with the development of deep models, we unfortunately find that\ntraditional hard consistency may destroy the original relationships among\nsingle-modal instances, leading the performance degradation for single-modal\nretrieval. To address this challenge, in this paper, we experimentally observe\nthat the vision-language divergence may cause the existence of strong and weak\nmodalities, and the hard cross-modal consistency cannot guarantee that strong\nmodal instances' relationships are not affected by weak modality, resulting in\nthe strong modal instances' relationships perturbed despite learned consistent\nrepresentations.To this end, we propose a novel and directly Coordinated\nVisionLanguage Retrieval method (dubbed CoVLR), which aims to study and\nalleviate the desynchrony problem between the cross-modal alignment and\nsingle-modal cluster-preserving tasks.

The time discretization is based on a splitting\nbetween explicit and implicit terms that may arise either from the multi-scale\nnature of the governing equations, which involve both slow and fast scales, or\nin the context of projection methods, where the numerical solution is projected\nonto the physically meaningful solution manifold. We propose to use a high\norder finite volume (FV) scheme for the explicit terms, ensuring conservation\nproperty and robustness across shock waves, while the virtual element method\n(VEM) is employed to deal with the discretization of the implicit terms, which\ntypically requires an elliptic problem to be solved.

To address this\nissue, we conduct an extensive study using direct numerical simulations to\ncharacterize the wing taper effect on laminar separated wakes. We analyze flows\nbehind NACA 0015 cross-sectional profile wings at post-stall angles of attack\n$\\alpha=14^\\circ$--$22^\\circ$ with taper ratios $\\lambda=0.27$--$1$, leading\nedge sweep angles $0^\\circ$--$50^\\circ$, and semi aspect ratios $sAR =1$ and\n$2$ at a mean-chord-based Reynolds number of $600$ and a freestream Mach number\nof $0.1$. Wing taper reduces the tip chord length, weakening the tip vortex,\nand attenuates the inboard downwash over the wing. This results in unsteadiness\nto develop over a large portion of the wingspan at high angles of attack.\nTapered wings with backward-swept leading edges develop unsteadiness near the\nwing tip, while wings with forward-swept trailing edges concentrate wake\noscillations at the wing root. For highly swept untapered wings, the wake is\nsteady, while tapered wings with high leading edge sweep angles exhibit wake\nshedding near the tip. Wake oscillations are larger towards the root for lower\ntaper ratios. Moreover, the effects of taper on the aerodynamic forces over\ntapered wings are studied, revealing that the combined effect of taper and\nsweep can improve the aerodynamic performance of the wing. The current findings\nshed light on the fundamental effects of wing taper on the post-stall wake\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2023 15:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Despite the recent\nprogress in computer vision, significant issues remain for image searching in\nhistopathology archives. A well-known problem is AI bias and lack of\ngeneralization. A more particular shortcoming of deep models is the ignorance\ntoward search functionality. The former affects every model, the latter only\nsearch and matching. Due to the lack of ranking-based learning, researchers\nmust train models based on the classification error and then use the resultant\nembedding for image search purposes. Moreover, deep models appear to be prone\nto internal bias even if using a large image repository of various hospitals.\nThis paper proposes two novel ideas to improve image search performance. First,\nwe use a ranking loss function to guide feature extraction toward the\nmatching-oriented nature of the search. By forcing the model to learn the\nranking of matched outputs, the representation learning is customized toward\nimage search instead of learning a class label. Second, we introduce the\nconcept of sequestering learning to enhance the generalization of feature\nextraction. By excluding the images of the input hospital from the matched\noutputs, i.e., sequestering the input domain, the institutional bias is\nreduced. The proposed ideas are implemented and validated through the largest\npublic dataset of whole slide images.

Despite the fact that many\nsuch phenomena (e.g., disasters) have clear spatial footprints and geographical\nproperties, their location information is considered only as a textual label in\nexisting graph visualization tools, limiting their capability to reveal the\ngeospatial distribution patterns of the graph nodes. In addition, most graph\nvisualization techniques rely on 2D graph visualization, which constraints the\ndimensions of information that can be presented and lacks support for graph\nstructure examination from multiple angles. To tackle the above challenges, we\ndeveloped a novel 3D map-based graph visualization algorithm to enable\ninteractive exploration of graph content and patterns in a spatially explicit\nmanner. The algorithm extends a 3D force directed graph by integrating a web\nmap, an additional geolocational force, and a force balancing variable that\nallows for the dynamic adjustment of the 3D graph structure and layout. This\nmechanism helps create a balanced graph view between the semantic forces among\nthe graph nodes and the attractive force from a geolocation to a graph node.\nOur solution offers a new perspective in visualizing and understanding spatial\nentities and events in a knowledge graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 18:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Notwithstanding this generalization, the 'babble'\ncreated by multiple simultaneously active talkers can sometimes provide\nbeneficial sound masking, but due to spatial release from masking (SRM), speech\nmay still be sufficiently intelligible up to a certain number of talkers\n(estimated to be about four). This was explored within a highly-realistic\noffice simulation, where the cognitive performance, and subjective distraction\nof participants were tested. The experimental design was a 4x2 factorial (4\ntalker numbers, 2 levels of broadband sound masking, as the factors). The\nresults indicated that within lower sound pressure level (SPL) of broadband\nsound masking, multi-talker sound environments degraded cognitive tasks\nperformance more than those with a single talker, suggesting SRM effects. For\nhigher SPL broadband sound masking, the cognitive test scores were similar\nwithin the different talker numbers. The subjective distraction increased\nmonotonically with the number of talkers, with higher distraction within lower\nSPL broadband sound masking. Overall, the results call into question the single\ntalker assumption (being the most distracting) within the international\nstandard for measuring open-plan office acoustic environments (ISO\n3382-3:2012). Soundscapes with 4 simultaneous talkers were still not adequately\nproviding beneficial 'babble' masking, and were more distracting than 1 active\ntalker. In conclusion, it is suggested that the acoustics environment of\nopen-plan offices needs better characterization by incorporating some of the\ncomplexity and psychoacoustics of multi-talker scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 16:42:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

The results describe variation in several\nacoustic and psychoacoustic metrics, and present statistical models that\npredict these metrics as a function of the number of workstations in offices.\nLA,eq of 53.6 dB is typical for occupied OPOs, with spectral slope of\napproximately -4 dB/octave.

Sound\nfluctuation, as characterised by the metric Noise Climate (NCl: LA10 - LA90)\nand the psychoacoustic Fluctuation Strength (FS), decreases significantly with\nincreasing number of workstations in OPOs. This suggests lesser auditory\ndistraction in larger offices, which needs further investigation. In terms of\nhistorical trends, OPOs have become quieter over the years, especially\nbackground noise quantified as LA90, although there are several subtleties.\nOverall, current findings can inform several OPO design perspectives including\npolicy documents, provide values for laboratory simulations of OPO acoustic\nenvironments, help interpret subjective impressions of OPO occupants, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 16:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Digital spaces are combinatorial models of continuous spaces. TDS\nis one of alternative branches of digital topology that studies constructing\nand modifying 2, 3 and n-dimensional digital image arrays in a computer and its\nmemory. Demands for mathematical theory of multidimensional spaces built of\nfinite number of points appeared in connection with the use of many dimensional\nimages in computer programs. This work presents, as examples, digital models of\nn-dimensional Euclidean spaces, n-dimensional spheres, a torus, a projective\nplane, etc. Methods of TMS can work successfully in such areas as biology,\nchemistry, industry, medicine, etc. The book is organized as follows. Digital\nmodels of continuous spaces are the intersection graphs of special locally\ncentered lamp covers of continuous spaces. Digital models are represented by\ngraphs, algebraic matrices and a set of unit cubes in n-dimensional Euclidean\nspace. The main mathematical characteristics of digital models of continuous\nspaces, such as the dimension, the Euler characteristic, the homology groups\nand others, are the same as those of their continuous counterparts.\nContractible transformations of digital spaces, that change the number of\nelements, do not change the mathematical characteristics and properties of\ndigital spaces. The main goal is to construct digital models of continuous\nspaces and to explain how to use the new methods to work with mathematical\nobjects. The emphasis is on introducing the readers to the basics and\nconceptual understanding of what TDS is.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2023 13:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Motivated by these challenges, we introduce a\ngeneric FL paradigm over next-generation (NextG) networks, called dynamic\nmulti-service FL (DMS-FL). We identify three unexplored design considerations\nin DMS-FL: (i) FL service operator accumulation, (ii) wireless resource\nfragmentation, and (iii) signal strength fluctuations.
