Our bound is based on the codes' weight\ndistributions, and we prove that it holds even for the real-world noise sources\nthat produce independent but not identically distributed bits. Additionally, we\npresent a method for identifying the optimal linear corrector for a given input\nmin-entropy rate that maximizes the throughput of the post-processed bits while\nsimultaneously achieving the needed security level. Our findings show that for\nan output min-entropy rate of $0.999$, the extraction efficiency of the linear\ncorrectors with the new bound can be up to $130.56\\%$ higher when compared to\nthe old bound, with an average improvement of $41.2\\%$ over the entire input\nmin-entropy range.

Recently, an augmented\nframework has been developed to overcome some limitations that emerged in the\napplication of the original framework. In this paper, we propose a new class of\ncontinuous-depth neural networks with delay, named Neural Delay Differential\nEquations (NDDEs). To compute the corresponding gradients, we use the adjoint\nsensitivity method to obtain the delayed dynamics of the adjoint. Differential\nequations with delays are typically seen as dynamical systems of infinite\ndimension that possess more fruitful dynamics. Compared to NODEs, NDDEs have a\nstronger capacity of nonlinear representations. We use several illustrative\nexamples to demonstrate this outstanding capacity. Firstly, we successfully\nmodel the delayed dynamics where the trajectories in the lower-dimensional\nphase space could be mutually intersected and even chaotic in a model-free or\nmodel-based manner. Traditional NODEs, without any argumentation, are not\ndirectly applicable for such modeling. Secondly, we achieve lower loss and\nhigher accuracy not only for the data produced synthetically by complex models\nbut also for the CIFAR10, a well-known image dataset.

Genotypes that map to these\nphenotypes usually form mostly connected genotype networks that percolate the\nspace of sequences, thus guaranteeing access to a large set of alternative\nphenotypes. Within a given environment, where specific phenotypic traits become\nrelevant for adaptation, the replicative ability of a phenotype and its overall\nfitness (in competition experiments with alternative phenotypes) can be\nestimated. Two primary questions arise: how do phenotype size, reproductive\ncapability and topology of the genotype network affect the fitness of a\nphenotype? And, assuming that evolution is only able to access large\nphenotypes, what is the range of unattainable fitness values? In order to\naddress these questions, we quantify the adaptive advantage of phenotypes of\nvarying size and spectral radius in a two-peak landscape. We derive analytical\nrelationships between the three variables (size, topology, and replicative\nability) which are then tested through analysis of genotype-phenotype maps and\nsimulations of population dynamics on such maps. Finally, we analytically show\nthat the fraction of attainable phenotypes decreases with the length of the\ngenotype, though its absolute number increases. The fact that most phenotypes\nare not visible to evolution very likely forbids the attainment of the highest\npeak in the landscape. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the relative\nfitness loss due to this limited accessibility is largely inconsequential for\nadaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 16:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

We study three approaches to stimulate the implemented\nmicro-benchmarks in hardware: Verilog testbenches, micro-controller\ntestbenches, and pseudo-random linear-feedback-shift-register-(LFSR)-based\ntesting. We measure the power consumption of the stimulated target devices. Our\nultimate goal is to automate power measurements for technology\ncharacterization; Currently, we manually measure the consumed power at three\nshunt resistors using an oscilloscope. Preliminary results indicate that we are\nable to induce variable power consumption in target devices; However, the\nsensitivity of the power characterization is still too low to build expressive\npower estimation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 16:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

In this paper, we present a workflow for authors of\nscientific documents to specify their contributions with a LaTeX package,\ncalled SciKGTeX, and upload them to a scientific knowledge graph.

This workflow is simpler and faster than current\napproaches, which make use of external web interfaces for data entry. Our user\nevaluation shows that SciKGTeX is easy to use, with a score of 79 out of 100 on\nthe System Usability Scale, as participants of the study needed only 7 minutes\non average to annotate the main contributions on a sample abstract of a\npublished paper.

Unfortunately, mainstream VR devices often use a small number of\ntrackers and provide low-accuracy animations. Previous studies have shown that\nthe Sense of Embodiment, and in particular the Sense of Agency, depends on the\nextent to which the avatar's movements mimic the user's movements. However, few\nworks study such effect for tasks requiring a precise interaction with the\nenvironment, i.e., tasks that require accurate manipulation, precise foot\nstepping, or correct body poses. In these cases, users are likely to notice\ninconsistencies between their self-avatars and their actual pose. In this\npaper, we study the impact of the animation fidelity of the user avatar on a\nvariety of tasks that focus on arm movement, leg movement and body posture. We\ncompare three different animation techniques: two of them using Inverse\nKinematics to reconstruct the pose from sparse input (6 trackers), and a third\none using a professional motion capture system with 17 inertial sensors. We\nevaluate these animation techniques both quantitatively (completion time,\nunintentional collisions, pose accuracy) and qualitatively (Sense of\nEmbodiment). Our results show that the animation quality affects the Sense of\nEmbodiment. Inertial-based MoCap performs significantly better in mimicking\nbody poses. Surprisingly, IK-based solutions using fewer sensors outperformed\nMoCap in tasks requiring accurate positioning, which we attribute to the higher\nlatency and the positional drift that causes errors at the end-effectors, which\nare more noticeable in contact areas such as the feet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 16:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

Therefore, a clear understanding of the capabilities and\nlimitations of LLMs is necessary.

We measure emission line redshifts of z=7.65\nand 8.64 for two galaxies, and z=9.77(+0.37,-0.29) and 10.01(+0.14,-0.19) for\ntwo others via the detection of continuum breaks consistent with Lyman-alpha\nopacity from a mostly neutral intergalactic medium. The presence (absense) of\nstrong breaks (strong emission lines) give high confidence that these two\ngalaxies are at z>9.6, but the break-derived redshifts have large uncertainties\ngiven the low spectral resolution and relatively low signal-to-noise of the\nCEERS NIRSpec prism data. The two z~10 sources are relatively luminous\n(M_UV<-20), with blue continua (-2.3<beta<-1.9) and low dust attenuation\n(A_V=0.15(+0.3,-0.1)); and at least one of them has high stellar mass for a\ngalaxy at that redshift (log(M_*/M_sol)=9.3(+0.2,-0.3)). Considered together\nwith spectroscopic observations of other CEERS NIRCam-selected high-z galaxy\ncandidates in the literature, we find a high rate of redshift confirmation and\nlow rate of confirmed interlopers (8.3%). Ten out of 34 z>8 candidates with\nCEERS NIRSpec spectroscopy do not have secure redshifts, but the absence of\nemission lines in their spectra is consistent with redshifts z>9.6. We find\nthat z>8 photometric redshifts are generally in agreement (within\nuncertainties) with the spectroscopic values. However, the photometric\nredshifts tend to be slightly overestimated (average Delta(z)=0.50+/-0.12),\nsuggesting that current templates do not fully describe the spectra of very\nhigh-z sources. Overall, our results solidifies photometric evidence for a high\nspace density of bright galaxies at z>8 compared to theoretical model\npredictions, and further disfavors an accelerated decline in the integrated UV\nluminosity density at z>8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 17:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

Unlike the conventional memory effect based on the permanent\nsoft shift in the gauge field itself, it is a permanent change in its spin\nangular momentum. The concept underlying the chiral memory (conventional\nmemory) effect is optical spin torque (optical force) induction in bulk.\nPhotons and EM radiation carry angular momentum, which is conserved without\ninteractions. Chiral interactions with matter, medium, curvature, and theories\nwith parity violation, i.e., axion-QED, transfers spin angular momentum to EM\nfields. In nature, such phenomena occur either on EM radiation (chiral memory)\nor in the vacuum of QED (vacuum chiral memory). It can be parametrized in terms\nof the photon's topological (axial) current at null infinity. To elude the\ngauge ambiguity of the topological current, we use the transverse gauge and\nshow it is the physical part of the current suggested by its cohomology\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 17:47:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

Using effective spacetime description the LQC universe also\nprovides an ultra-violet complete description of the classical inflationary\nscenario as well as its alternatives such as the ekpyrotic and matter bounce\nscenarios. In this chapter we provide a summary of singularity resolution and\nits physical implications for various isotropic and anisotropic cosmological\nspacetimes in LQC and analyze robustness of results through variant models\noriginating from different quantization prescriptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 18:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

This\napproach often implicitly treats the dimers as static, with their relevant\nstate energies and couplings determined by their optimized geometry. Here, we\nconsider the shortcomings of this approach: dimers are more accurately treated\nas dynamic model systems, with the potential for significant conformational\nheterogeneity that evolves in time and is intimately connected with\ninterchromophore coupling strengths. We highlight this concept in the singlet\nfission dynamics of a pentacene dimer that is covalently linked through\nphenyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole and acetylene bridges. Unrestricted rotations lead\nto a vast array of rotational conformers in the ground state. Consequently, we\nfind that every step in the cascade of singlet fission processes - triplet-pair\nformation from S1, triplet-pair recombination, spin evolution within the pair,\nand free triplet formation - is qualitatively and quantitatively altered by the\nconformer geometry. At room temperature, we find evidence of dynamic\ninterconversion between conformers on the multiple TT surfaces. Measurements in\nfrozen solution at 150 K emphasize the significance of static disorder. Our\ndata reveals the presence of sub-populations that result in\nexcitation-dependent electron spin polarization. These phenomena demand\nconsideration of multidimensional potential energy surfaces that define\nmultiple sub-ensembles in the excited state, a picture we refer to as\nheterogeneous singlet fission. More broadly, our results call into question the\ngeneral static approach to molecular dimer photophysics, that each step in\nconsecutive excited-state relaxation pathways can be delineated with a single,\nunique rate constant and yield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 18:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

In this study, we investigate\nthe concurrent effects of the ALP-photon and ALP-electron couplings in a\nsimplified model and examine how their simultaneous presence modifies existing\nbounds. We find that modifications to production cross-sections, decaying\nbranching ratios, and the lifetime of the ALP are the major effects.

Some\nof these systems have a polar crystal structure that gives rise to\nferroelectricity, in which the interlayer polarization exhibits bistability\ndriven by external electric fields. Here we show that bilayer $T_d$-MoTe$_2$\nsimultaneously exhibits ferroelectric switching and superconductivity.\nRemarkably, a field-driven, first-order superconductor-to-normal transition is\nobserved at its ferroelectric transition. Bilayer $T_d$-MoTe$_2$ also has a\nmaximum in its superconducting transition temperature ($T_\\textrm{c}$) as a\nfunction of carrier density and temperature, allowing independent control of\nthe superconducting state as a function of both doping and polarization. We\nfind that the maximum $T_\\textrm{c}$ is concomitant with compensated electron\nand hole carrier densities and vanishes when one of the Fermi pockets\ndisappears with doping.

The frequency, amplitude and reverberation\nof the sound as well as the repetition rate of short high-pitched sounds and\nthe signal-to-noise ratio of a mixture between pure sound and noise are\nstudied. We conducted positioning experiments with twenty-eight sighted\nblindfolded participants. Stage 1 incorporates learning phases followed by\ndepth estimation tasks. Stage 2 adds the additional challenge of azimuth\nestimation to the first stage's protocol. Stage 3 tests learning retention by\nincorporating a 10-minute break before re-testing depth estimation. The best\ndepth estimates in stage 1 were obtained with the sound frequency and the\nrepetition rate of beeps. In stage 2, the beep repetition rate yielded the best\ndepth estimation and no significant difference was observed for the azimuth\nestimation. Results of stage 3 showed that the beep repetition rate was the\neasiest sonification to memorize. Based on statistical analysis of the results,\nwe discuss the effectiveness of each sonification and compare with other\nstudies that encode depth into sounds. Finally we provide recommendations for\nthe design of depth encoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 19:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

Despite the impressive performance\nof recent models, we have identified a limitation in their robustness, where\nexisting methods may misclassify salient objects as camouflaged ones, despite\nthese two characteristics being contradictory. This limitation may stem from\nlacking multi-pattern training images, leading to less saliency robustness. To\naddress this issue, we introduce CamDiff, a novel approach inspired by\nAI-Generated Content (AIGC) that overcomes the scarcity of multi-pattern\ntraining images. Specifically, we leverage the latent diffusion model to\nsynthesize salient objects in camouflaged scenes, while using the zero-shot\nimage classification ability of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training\n(CLIP) model to prevent synthesis failures and ensure the synthesized object\naligns with the input prompt.

The input design domain is progressively\nsegmented by expanding and adaptively refining mesh-like lock-free geometrical\nstructure. The proposed triangulation-based approach effectively combines the\nfeatures of simulation and approximation methods.

With evergrowing developments in deep\nlearning and computer vision algorithms, and the ease of the data flow from\ndigital pathology, currently CoPath is witnessing a paradigm shift. Despite the\nsheer volume of engineering and scientific works being introduced for cancer\nimage analysis, there is still a considerable gap of adopting and integrating\nthese algorithms in clinical practice. This raises a significant question\nregarding the direction and trends that are undertaken in CoPath. In this\narticle we provide a comprehensive review of more than 700 papers to address\nthe challenges faced in problem design all-the-way to the application and\nimplementation viewpoints. We have catalogued each paper into a model-card by\nexamining the key works and challenges faced to layout the current landscape in\nCoPath. We hope this helps the community to locate relevant works and\nfacilitate understanding of the field's future directions. In a nutshell, we\noversee the CoPath developments in cycle of stages which are required to be\ncohesively linked together to address the challenges associated with such\nmultidisciplinary science. We overview this cycle from different perspectives\nof data-centric, model-centric, and application-centric problems.

Contingency games are\nparameterized via a scalar variable which represents a future time at which\nintent uncertainty will be resolved. Varying this parameter enables a designer\nto easily adjust how conservatively the robot behaves in the game.\nInterestingly, we also find that existing variants of game-theoretic planning\nunder uncertainty are readily obtained as special cases of contingency games.\nLastly, we offer an efficient method for solving N-player contingency games\nwith nonlinear dynamics and non-convex costs and constraints.

Thus it is important to resolve\nany ambiguity about the mission between teammates before embarking on a\ncommanded task. The safeguards guaranteed by formal methods can be used to\nsynthesize correct-by-construction reactive controllers for a robot using\nLinear Temporal Logic. If a robot fails to synthesize a controller given an\ninstruction, it is clear that there exists a logical inconsistency in the\nenvironmental assumptions and/or described interactions. These specifications\nhowever are typically crafted in a language unique to the verification\nframework, requiring the human collaborator to be fluent in the software tool\nused to construct it. Furthermore, if the controller fails to synthesize, it\nmay prove difficult to easily repair the specification. Language is a natural\nmedium to generate these specifications using modern symbol grounding\ntechniques. Using language empowers non-expert humans to describe tasks to\nrobot teammates while retaining the benefits of formal verification.\nAdditionally, dialogue could be used to inform robots about the environment\nand/or resolve any ambiguities before mission execution. This paper introduces\nan architecture for natural language interaction using a symbolic\nrepresentation that informs the construction of a specification in Linear\nTemporal Logic. The novel aspect of this approach is that it provides a\nmechanism for resolving synthesis failure by hypothesizing corrections to the\nspecification that are verified through human-robot dialogue. Experiments\ninvolving the proposed architecture are demonstrated using a simulation of an\nAstrobee robot navigating in the International Space Station.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 20:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

This is reflected in the dynamics of an infinite\ntemperature autocorrelation function which, after an initial transient that is\ncontrolled by the strength of the integrability breaking term, approaches a\nplateau that does not decay with time. The height of the plateau agrees with a\nnumerically constructed conserved quantity, and is found to decrease with\nincreasing system sizes.

In this work, we examine the Ribbon structure, namely, its ENA fluxes,\nangular extent, width, and circularity properties for two years, 2009 and 2019,\nrepresentative of the declining phases of two adjacent solar cycles. We find\nthat, (i) the Ribbon ENA fluxes have recovered in the nose direction and south\nof it down to ~ 25{\\deg} (for energies below 1.7 keV) and not at mid and high\necliptic latitudes; (ii) The Ribbon width exhibits significant variability as a\nfunction of azimuthal angle; (iii) Circularity analysis suggests that the 2019\nRibbon exhibits a statistically consistent radius with that in 2009. The\nRibbon's partial recovery is aligned with the consensus of a heliosphere with\nits closest point being southward of the nose region. The large variability of\nthe Ribbon width as a function of Azimuth in 2019 compared to 2009 is likely\nindicative of small-scale processes within the Ribbon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 21:15:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 15:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

The interplay between dynamic bonding with\nmechanical loading is modeled using a topology-based reaction scheme. The creep\nbehavior is compared against cross-linked epoxies with dynamic reactions to\nunderstand the unique aspects related to dynamic bonding. It is found that the\nfree volume that arises from tensile loads is reduced in vitrimers through\ndynamic bond rearrangement. An important feature that explains the difference\nin secondary creep behavior between conventional epoxies and vitrimers is the\norientation of the dynamic bonds during loading. In vitrimers, the dynamic\nbonds preferentially align orthogonal to the loading axis, decreasing the axial\nstiffness during secondary creep, resulting in larger creep strain compared to\nepoxies. Over longer timescales, such increased strain leads to void growth,\nresulting in tertiary creep. Thus, chemistry changes or additives that can\nprevent the initial realignment of dynamic bonds, and therefore subsequent void\ngrowth, can be an effective strategy to mitigate creep in vitrimers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 21:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

This can be\navoided by optimizing the complexity of the kernel function. For regression\nproblems with very expensive data, the functional form of the model kernels can\nbe optimized in the Gaussian process (GP) setting through compositional\nfunction search guided by the Bayesian information criterion. However, the\ncompositional kernel search is computationally demanding and relies on greedy\nstrategies, which may yield sub-optimal kernels. An alternative strategy of\nincreasing complexity of GP kernels treats a GP as a Bayesian neural network\n(NN) with a variable number of hidden layers, which yields NNGP models. Here,\nwe present a direct comparison of GP models with composite kernels and NNGP\nmodels for applications aiming at the construction of global PES for polyatomic\nmolecules.

As a\nresult, the avoided level crossing between two branches is greatly modified in\nboth location and width in the parameter axis of coupling strength, leading to\na more (less) stable sTG gas for a repulsive (attractive) dipolar force. These\nresults, consistent with experimental observations, are found to robustly apply\nto both bosonic and fermionic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 01:23:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 09:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Methods such as inverse probability weighted\ngeneralized estimating equations have been proposed to account for informative\nmissingness by weighting the observed individual outcome data in each cluster.\nThese existing methods have focused on settings where missingness occurs at the\nindividual level and each cluster has partially or fully observed individual\noutcomes. In the presence of missing clusters, e.g., all outcomes from a\ncluster are missing due to drop-out of the cluster, these approaches\neffectively ignore this cluster-level missingness and can lead to biased\ninference if the cluster-level missingness is informative. Informative\nmissingness at multiple levels can also occur in CRTs with a multi-level\nstructure where study participants are nested in subclusters such as health\ncare providers, and the subclusters are nested in clusters such as clinics.

An overarching challenge in these inverse\nproblems is that an infinite number of images, including many that are\nimplausible, are consistent with the observed measurements. Thus, image priors\nare required to reduce the space of possible solutions to more desireable\nreconstructions. However, in many applications it is difficult or potentially\nimpossible to obtain example images to construct an image prior. Hence\ninaccurate priors are often used, which inevitably result in biased solutions.\nRather than solving an inverse problem using priors that encode the spatial\nstructure of any one image, we propose to solve a set of inverse problems\njointly by incorporating prior constraints on the collective structure of the\nunderlying images. The key assumption of our work is that the underlying images\nwe aim to reconstruct share common, low-dimensional structure. We show that\nsuch a set of inverse problems can be solved simultaneously without the use of\na spatial image prior by instead inferring a shared image generator with a\nlow-dimensional latent space. The parameters of the generator and latent\nembeddings are found by maximizing a proxy for the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).\nOnce identified, the generator and latent embeddings can be combined to provide\nreconstructed images for each inverse problem.

First, by providing a true power allocation (PA)\nconstraint for conventional NOMA with practical constraints, we demonstrate\nthat it cannot support massive connections. To this end, we propose BIMA where\nthere are no strict PA constraints, unlike conventional NOMA, thus allowing a\nhigh number of devices. We provide a comprehensive analytical framework for\nBIMA for all key performance indicators (KPIs) (i.e., ergodic capacity [EC],\noutage probability [OP], and bit error rate [BER]). We evaluate Jain's fairness\nindex and proportional fairness index in terms of all KPIs. Based on the\nextensive computer simulations, we reveal that BIMA outperforms conventional\nNOMA significantly, with a performance gain of up to 20-30dB. This performance\ngain becomes greater when more devices are supported. BIMA provides a full\ndiversity order and enables the implementation of an arbitrary number of\ndevices and modulation orders, which is crucial for IoT networks in dense\nareas. BIMA guarantees a fairness system where none of the devices gets a\nsevere performance and the sum-rate is shared in a fair manner among devices by\nguarantying QoS satisfaction. Finally, we provide an intense complexity and\nlatency analysis and demonstrate that BIMA provides lower latency compared to\nconventional NOMA since it allows parallel computing at the receivers and no\niterative operations are required.

The quantitative\nresults indicate that the proposed CSP-GAN-LSTM model outperforms the existing\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of position prediction accuracy.\nBesides, simulation results in typical highway scenarios further validate the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of the proposed predictive collision risk\nassessment method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 05:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

Although spiking\nbased models are energy efficient by taking advantage of discrete spike\nsignals, their performance is limited by current network structures and their\ntraining methods. As discrete signals, typical SNNs cannot apply the gradient\ndescent rules directly into parameters adjustment as artificial neural networks\n(ANNs). Aiming at this limitation, here we propose a novel method of\nconstructing deep SNN models with knowledge distillation (KD) that uses ANN as\nteacher model and SNN as student model. Through ANN-SNN joint training\nalgorithm, the student SNN model can learn rich feature information from the\nteacher ANN model through the KD method, yet it avoids training SNN from\nscratch when communicating with non-differentiable spikes.

The\nanswer to this question is governed by the validity of a specific Bernstein\ntype inequality.\n  The main result of this paper is a geometric characterization of this type of\nBernstein inequality, i.e. a characterization in terms of the behaviour of\nfunctions from the space $S$ on atoms $\\mathscr A$ and rings $\\mathscr R = \\{ A\n\\setminus B: A, B \\in \\mathscr A, B \\subset A \\}\\setminus \\mathscr A$.

During viewport switches, clients and servers will instantly\nexchange coordination info and contents for the given viewports. However, those\nviewport switches pose a serious challenge for video encoding because the\ntemporal dependency between contents within changing viewports is\nunpredictable. In existing practices, it is commonly noted that GOP (Group of\nPictures) size in a bitstream intrinsically prohibits the reduction of the\nviewport switch latency, such as Motion-to-photon (MTP) latency, or\nmotion-to-high-quality (MTHQ) latency. In this paper, we presented a Scalable\nVideo Coding (SVC) based bitstream schema, which can structurally remove the\nimpacts of GOP in viewport-dependent streaming and provide instant viewport\nswitches within one-frame time (the best possible). In addition, combined with\ntiling, this new coding schema allows an efficient packing of the non-adjacent\nregions within a viewport of 360-degree video. Our experiments also show that\nthe overall encoding with this SVC-based approach is faster than with\nmulti-stream approaches.

Drawing inspiration from object-based classification\ntechniques, we first learn to generate superpixels that are not only\nboundary-preserving but also semantically-sensitive. The superpixels respond\nexclusively to building boundaries rather than other natural objects, while\nsimultaneously producing semantic segmentation of the buildings.

The circuit model usually implements a\ndesired unitary operation by a sequence of single-qubit and two-qubit unitary\ngates from a universal set. Although this certainly facilitates the\nexperimentalists as they only need to prepare several different kinds of\nuniversal gates, the number of gates required to implement an arbitrary desired\nunitary operation is usually large. Hence the efficiency in terms of the\ncircuit depth or running time is not guaranteed. Here we propose an alternative\napproach; we use a simple discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) on a cycle graph to\nmodel an arbitrary unitary operation without the need to decompose it into a\nsequence of gates of smaller sizes. Our model is essentially a quantum neural\nnetwork based on DTQW. Firstly, it is universal as we show that any unitary\noperation can be realized via an appropriate choice of coin operators.\nSecondly, our DTQW-based neural network can be updated efficiently via a\nlearning algorithm, i.e., a modified stochastic gradient descent algorithm\nadapted to our network. By training this network, one can promisingly find\napproximations to arbitrary desired unitary operations. With an additional\nmeasurement on the output, the DTQW-based neural network can also implement\ngeneral measurements described by positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs). We\nshow its capacity in implementing arbitrary 2-outcome POVM measurements via\nnumeric simulation.

One of\nthe most promising approaches to achieve domain generalization (DG) is\ngenerating unseen data, e.g., mixup, to cover the unknown target data. However,\nexisting works overlook the challenges induced by the simultaneous appearance\nof changes in both the semantic and distribution space. Accordingly, such a\nchallenge makes source distributions hard to fit for DNNs. To mitigate the\nhard-fitting issue, we propose to perform a semantic-aware mixup (SAM) for\ndomain generalization, where whether to perform mixup depends on the semantic\nand domain information. The feasibility of SAM shares the same spirits with the\nFourier-based mixup. Namely, the Fourier phase spectrum is expected to contain\nsemantics information (relating to labels), while the Fourier amplitude retains\nother information (relating to style information). Built upon the insight, SAM\napplies different mixup strategies to the Fourier phase spectrum and amplitude\ninformation. For instance, SAM merely performs mixup on the amplitude spectrum\nwhen both the semantic and domain information changes. Consequently, the\noverwhelmingly large change can be avoided. We validate the effectiveness of\nSAM using image classification tasks on several DG benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 07:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

We expect that our\nthree-photon time-bin GHZ state can be used for long-distance multi-user\nquantum communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 08:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

In this paper, we present InterGen, an effective\ndiffusion-based approach that incorporates human-to-human interactions into the\nmotion diffusion process, which enables layman users to customize high-quality\ntwo-person interaction motions, with only text guidance. We first contribute a\nmultimodal dataset, named InterHuman. It consists of about 107M frames for\ndiverse two-person interactions, with accurate skeletal motions and 16,756\nnatural language descriptions. For the algorithm side, we carefully tailor the\nmotion diffusion model to our two-person interaction setting. To handle the\nsymmetry of human identities during interactions, we propose two cooperative\ntransformer-based denoisers that explicitly share weights, with a mutual\nattention mechanism to further connect the two denoising processes. Then, we\npropose a novel representation for motion input in our interaction diffusion\nmodel, which explicitly formulates the global relations between the two\nperformers in the world frame. We further introduce two novel regularization\nterms to encode spatial relations, equipped with a corresponding damping scheme\nduring the training of our interaction diffusion model. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness and generalizability of InterGen. Notably, it can\ngenerate more diverse and compelling two-person motions than previous methods\nand enables various downstream applications for human interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 08:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

This involvement of untrustworthy, external entities opens the door to\nmajor security threats, such as reverse engineering (RE). RE can reveal the\nphysical structure and functionality of intellectual property (IP) and ICs,\nleading to IP theft, counterfeiting, and other misuses. The concept of the\nthreshold voltage-defined (TVD) logic family is a potential mechanism to\nobfuscate and protect the design and prevent RE. However, it addresses\npost-fabrication RE issues, and it has been shown that dopant profiling\ntechniques can be used to determine the threshold voltage of the transistor and\nbreak the obfuscation.

The ISFET-TVD logic gate can be reconfigured\nafter fabrication, maintaining an exact schematic architecture with an\nidentical layout for all types of logic gates, and thus overcoming the\nshortcomings of the classic TVD. The threshold voltage of the ISFETs can be\nadjusted after fabrication by changing the ion concentration of the material in\ncontact with the ion-sensitive gate of the transistor, depending on the Boolean\nfunctionality. The ISFET is CMOS compatible, and therefore implemented on 45 nm\nCMOS technology for demonstration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 08:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

In contrast, 3D keypoint\nestimation methods utilize the volumetric representation to achieve pixel-level\naccuracy but may predict unrealistic body structures. To address these issues,\nthis paper presents a novel hybrid inverse kinematics solution, HybrIK, that\nintegrates the merits of 3D keypoint estimation and body mesh recovery in a\nunified framework. HybrIK directly transforms accurate 3D joints to body-part\nrotations via twist-and-swing decomposition.

We have\nobserved that almost all coded computing systems studied so far consider a\nsetup of one master and some workers. However, recently emerging technologies\nsuch as blockchain, internet of things, and federated learning introduce new\nrequirements for coded computing systems. In these systems, data is generated\nin a distributed manner, so central encoding/decoding by a master is not\nfeasible and scalable. This paper presents a fully distributed coded computing\nsystem that consists of $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ data owners and $N\\in\\mathbb{N}$\nworkers, where data owners employ workers to do some computations on their\ndata, as specified by a target function $f$ of degree $d\\in\\mathbb{N}$. As\nthere is no central encoder, workers perform encoding themselves, prior to\ncomputation phase. The challenge in this system is the presence of adversarial\ndata owners that do not know the data of honest data owners but cause\ndiscrepancies by sending different data to different workers, which is\ndetrimental to local encodings in workers. There are at most\n$\\beta\\in\\mathbb{N}$ adversarial data owners, and each sends at most\n$v\\in\\mathbb{N}$ different versions of data. Since the adversaries and their\npossibly colluded behavior are not known to workers and honest data owners,\nworkers compute tags of their received data, in addition to their main\ncomputational task, and send them to data owners to help them in decoding. We\nintroduce a tag function that allows data owners to partition workers into sets\nthat previously had received the same data from all data owners. Then, we\ncharacterize the fundamental limit of the system, $t^*$, which is the minimum\nnumber of workers whose work can be used to correctly calculate the desired\nfunction of data of honest data owners. We show that $t^*=v^{\\beta}d(K-1)+1$,\nand present converse and achievable proofs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 08:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

Still, how its response to emotion\ninteracts with top-down attention is not fully understood. It is also unclear\nif amygdala activity and scalp EEG respond to emotion and attention in a\nsimilar way. Therefore, we studied the interaction of emotion and attention\nduring face processing in oscillatory gamma-band activity (GBA) in the amygdala\nand on the scalp. Amygdala signals were recorded via intracranial EEG (iEEG) in\n10 patients with epilepsy. Scalp recordings were collected from 19 healthy\nparticipants. Three randomized blocks of angry, neutral, and happy faces were\npresented, and either negative, neutral, or positive expressions were denoted\nas targets. Both groups detected happy faces fastest and most accurately.\nDuring attention to negative faces, low GBA (< 90 Hz) increased specifically\nfor angry faces both in the amygdala and over posterior scalp regions, albeit\nearlier on the scalp (60 ms) than in the amygdala (130 ms). From 220 ms,\namygdala high GBA (117.5-145 Hz) was additionally persistently increased for\nboth angry and neutral compared to happy faces. When neutral faces served as\ntargets, amygdala high GBA (105-122.5 Hz) was higher for emotional than neutral\nfaces from 160-320 ms. Attention to positive faces did not result in a\ndifferentiation between facial expressions. Present data reveal that\nattention-independent emotion detection in amygdala high GBA may only occur\nduring a neutral focus of attention. Top-down threat vigilance coordinates\nwidespread GBA, biasing stimulus processing in favor of negative faces. These\nresults are in line with a multi-pathway model of emotion processing and help\nspecify the role of GBA in this process by revealing how attentional focus can\ntune timing and amplitude of emotional GBA responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 08:42:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 11:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

One approach for trajectory planning is through\ntransferring human-like skills to robots by Learning from Demonstrations (LfD).\nThe human demonstration is considered the target motion to mimic. However,\nhuman motion is typically optimal for human embodiment but not for robots\nbecause of the differences between human biomechanics and robot dynamics. The\nDynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) framework is a viable solution for this\nlimitation of LfD, but it requires tuning the second-order dynamics in the\nformulation. Our contribution is introducing a systematic method to extract the\ndynamic features from human demonstration to auto-tune the parameters in the\nDMP framework. In addition to its use with LfD, another utility of the proposed\nmethod is that it can readily be used in conjunction with Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) for robot training. In this way, the extracted features\nfacilitate the transfer of human skills by allowing the robot to explore the\npossible trajectories more efficiently and increasing robot compliance\nsignificantly. We introduced a methodology to extract the dynamic features from\nmultiple trajectories based on the optimization of human-likeness and\nsimilarity in the parametric space. Our method was implemented into an actual\nhuman-robot setup to extract human dynamic features and used to regenerate the\nrobot trajectories following both LfD and RL with DMP. It resulted in a stable\nperformance of the robot, maintaining a high degree of human-likeness based on\naccumulated distance error as good as the best heuristic tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 08:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

Conformal FLASH proton therapy involves\nadvanced beam-shaping technologies and specialized nozzle designs to confine\nthe dose to the target volume. Optimizing the spot delivery pattern and range\nmodulators can enhance the local dose rate, and genetic algorithms have been\nused to optimize scan patterns for stereotactic FLASH proton therapy of\nearly-stage lung cancer and lung metastases. A fast and effective method based\non graph theory is proposed to optimize the dose rate in specific regions of\ninterest.\n  Methods: We have created a graph-based algorithm to optimize the trajectory\nof proton spots to maximize the 100th percentile dose rate. Since this problem\nis NP-hard, we have employed an approximation algorithm that can solve this\nkind of Traveling Salesman Problem efficiently.\n  Results: When compared to a conventional serpentine pattern, the optimized\nscanning trajectory led to a doubling of the median dose rate, but only a minor\nincrease in DR95.

A subset of these\ndata (70%) was exploited to tweak the L-model using the PRIOR subroutine of the\nNONMEM software, with 2 strategies to weight the prior information: full\ninformative (F) and optimized (O).

Our\ndataset encompasses 853,729 images of 321,751 spoof subjects and 529,571 images\nof 148,169 live subjects, representing a substantial increase in quantity.\nMoreover, our dataset incorporates spoof data obtained from the internet,\nspanning a wide array of scenarios and various commercial sensors, including 17\npresentation attacks (PAs) that encompass both 2D and 3D forms. This novel data\ncollection strategy markedly enhances FAS data diversity. Leveraging the WFAS\ndataset and Protocol 1 (Known-Type), we host the Wild Face Anti-Spoofing\nChallenge at the CVPR2023 workshop. Additionally, we meticulously evaluate\nrepresentative methods using Protocol 1 and Protocol 2 (Unknown-Type). Through\nan in-depth examination of the challenge outcomes and benchmark baselines, we\nprovide insightful analyses and propose potential avenues for future research.\nThe dataset is released under Insightface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 10:29:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 08:16:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 01:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

However,\nit's very difficult and expensive to collect a large amount of well-labeled\ndata for system building. In this paper, we propose a novel and advanced\nself-supervised learning framework which can construct a high performance\nspeaker verification system without using any labeled data. To avoid the impact\nof false negative pairs, we adopt the self-distillation with no labels (DINO)\nframework as the initial model, which can be trained without exploiting\nnegative pairs. Then, we introduce a cluster-aware training strategy for DINO\nto improve the diversity of data. In the iteration learning stage, due to a\nmass of unreliable labels from clustering, the quality of pseudo labels is\nimportant for the system training. This motivates us to propose dynamic\nloss-gate and label correction (DLG-LC) methods to alleviate the performance\ndegradation caused by unreliable labels. More specifically, we model the loss\ndistribution with GMM and obtain the loss-gate threshold dynamically to\ndistinguish the reliable and unreliable labels. Besides, we adopt the model\npredictions to correct the unreliable label, for better utilizing the\nunreliable data rather than dropping them directly. Moreover, we extend the\nDLG-LC to multi-modality to further improve the performance. The experiments\nare performed on the commonly used Voxceleb dataset.

As the methyl group is embedded in the DNA\nmolecule, assessing DNA methylation is particularly promising in\nliquid-biopsy-based approaches, as cell-free DNA retains information related to\nits cell of origin. In this work, I leverage a recently profiled collection of\ncell-sorted whole genome bisulfite profiles of 44 healthy cell types. The high\nquality and purity of such data provide an ideal basis for discovering and\ncharacterizing discriminative DNA methylation regions that could serve as a\nreference for computational deconvolution. First, I characterize differentially\nmethylated regions between every pair of cell types, obtaining a meaningful\nmeasure of divergence. Pairwise differences were then aggregated to identify a\nset of uniquely (de)methylated regions (UMRs) for each cell type. Identified\nUMRs are predominantly hypomethylated and their numbers vary significantly\nacross cell types. They are mostly located in enhancer regions and strongly\nsupport cell-type-specific characteristics. As mapping onto UMRs has proven\nunsuitable for deconvolution, I developed a novel approach utilizing the set\ncover algorithm to select discriminative regions for this purpose. Based on\nthese regions, deconvolution was performed in two distinct approaches: a\nbeta-value-based and a read-level one. Both approaches outperform an existing\ndeconvolution software modeled on the same data 3-fold in terms of total\ndeconvolution error. Surprisingly, the beta-based approach slightly\noutperformed the read-level one.

In addition, existing blind IQA (BIQA)\ndatasets pay little attention to the difficulty of cross-content assessment,\nwhich may degrade the quality of annotations.

The dataset includes individuals of various genders and ethnicities who\nhave given explicit and informed consent for their photographs to be used in\npublic research. It is annotated by pairwise comparisons (PWC) collected from\nover 30 image quality experts for three image attributes: face detail\npreservation, face target exposure, and overall image quality. An in-depth\nstatistical analysis of these annotations allows us to evaluate their\nconsistency over PIQ23. Finally, we show through an extensive comparison with\nexisting baselines that semantic information (image context) can be used to\nimprove IQA predictions.

These planets are,\nhowever, missing in our Solar System, and the reason for that is unknown. Two\ntheoretical scenarios invoke the role of Jupiter as the possible culprit:\nJupiter may have acted as a dynamical barrier to the inward migration of\nsub-Neptunes from beyond the water iceline or, alternatively, may have reduced\nconsiderably the inward flux of material (pebbles) required to form\nsuper-Earths inside that iceline. Both scenarios predict an anti-correlation\nbetween the presence of small planets (SPs) and that of cold Jupiters (CJs) in\nexoplanetary systems. To test that prediction, we homogeneously analyzed the\nradial-velocity (RV) measurements of 38 Kepler and K2 transiting SP systems\ngathered over almost 10 years with the HARPS-N spectrograph, as well as\npublicly available RVs collected with other facilities. We detected five CJs in\nthree systems, two in Kepler-68, two in Kepler-454, and a very eccentric one in\nK2-312. We derived an occurrence rate of $9.3^{+7.7}_{-2.9}\\%$ for CJs with\n$0.3-13~M_{Jup}$ and 1-10 au, which is lower but still compatible at\n$1.3\\sigma$ with that measured from RV surveys for solar-type stars, regardless\nof SP presence. This does not allow us to draw a firm conclusion about the\npredicted anti-correlation between SPs and CJs, which would require a\nconsiderably larger sample. Nevertheless, we found no evidence of previous\nclaims of an excess of CJs in SP systems.

Data heterogeneity among clients\nsignificantly results in inconsistent model updates, which evidently slow down\nmodel convergence. To alleviate this issue, many methods employ regularization\nterms to narrow the discrepancy between client-side local models and the\nserver-side global model. However, these methods impose limitations on the\nability to explore superior local models and ignore the valuable information in\nhistorical models. Besides, although the up-to-date representation method\nsimultaneously concerns the global and historical local models, it suffers from\nunbearable computation cost. To accelerate convergence with low resource\nconsumption, we innovatively propose a model regularization method named\nFedTrip, which is designed to restrict global-local divergence and decrease\ncurrent-historical correlation for alleviating the negative effects derived\nfrom data heterogeneity. FedTrip helps the current local model to be close to\nthe global model while keeping away from historical local models, which\ncontributes to guaranteeing the consistency of local updates among clients and\nefficiently exploring superior local models with negligible additional\ncomputation cost on attaching operations. Empirically, we demonstrate the\nsuperiority of FedTrip via extensive evaluations. To achieve the target\naccuracy, FedTrip outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of\nsignificantly reducing the total overhead of client-server communication and\nlocal computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 13:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

Massive stars are generally believed to form in supersonic turbulent\nenvironment. However, recent observations have challenged this traditional\nview. High spatial and spectral resolution observations of the Orion Molecular\nCloud and an infrared dark cloud G35.39 show a resolution-dependent turbulence,\nand that high-mass stars are forming exclusively in subsonic to transonic cores\nin those clouds. These studies demand a re-evaluation of the role of the\nturbulence in massive star formation. Aims. We aim to study the turbulence in a\ntypical massive star-forming region G35.20-0.74 N with a sufficient spatial\nresolution to resolve the thermal Jeans length, and a spectral resolution to\nresolve the thermal linewidth. Methods. We use the ALMA dust continuum emission\nto resolve fragmentation, JVLA 1.2 cm continuum to trace ionized gas, and JVLA\nNH3 (1,1) to (7,7) inversion transition lines to trace linewidth, temperature,\nand dynamics. We fit those lines and remove line broadening due to channel\nwidth, thermal pressure, and velocity gradient to obtain a clean map of\nintrinsic turbulence. Results. We find that (1) the turbulence in G35.20 is\noverall supersonic, with mean and median Mach numbers 3.7 and 2.8,\nrespectively. (2) Mach number decreases from 6-7 at 0.1 pc scale to <3 towards\nthe central cores at 0.01 pc scale. (3) The central ALMA cores appear to be\ndecoupled form the host filament, evident by an opposite velocity gradient and\nsignificantly reduced turbulence. Because of intense star formation activities\nin G35.20 (as compared to the relatively young and quiescent IRDC G35.39), the\nsupersonic turbulence is likely replenished by protostellar outflows.

However, many of\nthe most promising approaches to this problem rely on hypotheses that may not\nreflect practical physical scenarios, like knowing the exact dynamics of the\nqubit-environment system or being able to store an informational qubit in\nmultiple physical qubits. Here, we step away from these usual assumptions and\nanalyze the probability of successfully storing a classical bit of information\non a physical qubit during a single computational step, both for the case in\nwhich the qubit evolves freely and also when it is subject to a sequence of\nrepeated measurements. The setup consists of a qubit coupled to a heat bath at\nfinite temperature, whose dynamics is given by a generalized amplitude damping\nchannel in a pointer basis that does not necessarily coincide with the\ncomputational basis of the qubit. We first show that requiring the dynamics to\nbe Markovian implies an exponential decay of the pointer basis' populations.\nThen, we obtain the success probability as function of time and angle\n$\\theta_0$ between the initial state of the qubit and the ground state of the\npointer basis.

Scale-equivariance lifts the burden\nof having to learn each possible scale separately, allowing the neural network\nto focus on higher-level learning goals, which leads to better results and\nbetter data-efficiency. We provide an overview of the theoretical foundations\nand scientific work on scale-equivariant neural networks in the two-dimensional\ndomain. We then transfer the concepts from 2D to the three-dimensional space\nand create a scale-equivariant convolutional layer for 3D data. Using the\nproposed scale-equivariant layer, we create a scale-equivariant U-Net for\nmedical image segmentation and compare it with a non-scale-equivariant baseline\nmethod. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in\nachieving scale-equivariance for 3D medical image analysis. We publish our code\nat https://github.com/wimmerth/scale-equivariant-3d-convnet for further\nresearch and application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 13:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

By means of a parent quantum\nmany-body description, we demonstrate that such driven systems are well\ncaptured by an effective NLSE with emergent nonlinearities, which can be finely\ncontrolled by tuning the driving sequence. We first consider a general class of\ntwo-mode nonlinear systems - relevant to optical Kerr cavities, waveguides and\nBose-Einstein condensates - where we find an emergent four-wave mixing\nnonlinearity, which originates from pair-hopping processes in the parent\nquantum picture. Tuning this drive-induced nonlinearity is shown to modify the\nphase-space topology, which can be detected through relative population and\nphase measurements. We then couple individual (two-mode) dimers in view of\ndesigning extended lattice models with unconventional nonlinearities and\ncontrollable pair-hopping processes. Following this general dimerization\nconstruction, we obtain an effective lattice model with drive-induced\ninteractions, whose ground-state exhibits orbital order, chiral currents and\nemergent magnetic fluxes through the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal\nsymmetry. We analyze these intriguing properties both in the weakly-interacting\n(mean-field) regime, captured by the effective NLSE, and in the\nstrongly-correlated quantum regime.

Currently established metrics are based\non Euclidean distance, which means that errors are weighted equally in all\ndirections. Euclidean metrics are insufficient for structured environments like\nroads, since they do not properly capture the agent's intent relative to the\nunderlying lane. In order to provide a reasonable assessment of trajectory\nprediction approaches with regard to the downstream planning task, we propose a\nnew metric that is lane distance-based: Lane Miss Rate (LMR). For the\ncalculation of LMR, the ground-truth and predicted endpoints are assigned to\nlane segments, more precisely their centerlines. Measured by the distance along\nthe lane segments, predictions that are within a certain threshold distance to\nthe ground-truth count as hits, otherwise they count as misses. LMR is then\ndefined as the ratio of sequences that yield a miss. Our results on three\nstate-of-the-art trajectory prediction models show that LMR preserves the order\nof Euclidean distance-based metrics. In contrast to the Euclidean Miss Rate,\nqualitative results show that LMR yields misses for sequences where predictions\nare located on wrong lanes. Hits on the other hand result for sequences where\npredictions are located on the correct lane. This means that LMR implicitly\nweights Euclidean error relative to the lane and goes into the direction of\ncapturing intents of traffic agents.

We have developed a\ntheoretical formalism where the turbulent velocity fluctuations provide the\nmechanical work necessary to excite the modes. The modes are described by means\nof a 2D linear wave equation, relevant for the quasi-toroidal modes observed on\nthe Sun, with a source term, under the beta plane approximation. Latitudinal\ndifferential rotation is included in the form of a parabolic profile that\napproximates the solar differential rotation at low and mid latitudes.\n  We obtain synthetic power spectra for the wave's latitudinal velocity,\nlongitudinal velocity, and radial vorticity, with azimuthal orders between 1\nand 20. The synthetic power spectra contain the classical equatorial Rossby\nmodes, as well as a rich spectrum of additional modes.

However, there are some uncertain problems to be solved in\nsusceptibility modeling, such as the error of landslide samples and the complex\nnonlinear relationship between environmental factors. A self-screening graph\nconvolutional network and long short-term memory network (SGCN-LSTM) is\nproposed int this paper to overcome the above problems in landslide\nsusceptibility prediction. The SGCN-LSTM model has the advantages of wide width\nand good learning ability. The landslide samples with large errors outside the\nset threshold interval are eliminated by self-screening network, and the\nnonlinear relationship between environmental factors can be extracted from both\nspatial nodes and time series, so as to better simulate the nonlinear\nrelationship between environmental factors. The SGCN-LSTM model was applied to\nlandslide susceptibility prediction in Anyuan County, Jiangxi Province, China,\nand compared with Cascade-parallel Long Short-Term Memory and Conditional\nRandom Fields (CPLSTM-CRF), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM),\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Logistic Regression (LR) models.The\nlandslide prediction experiment in Anyuan County showed that the total accuracy\nand AUC of SGCN-LSTM model were the highest among the six models, and the total\naccuracy reached 92.38 %, which was 5.88%, 12.44%, 19.65%, 19.92% and 20.34%\nhigher than those of CPLSTM-CRF, RF, SVM, SGD and LR models, respectively.

Otherwise, the resultant probability\ndensity function for the difficult to measure quantity or field will not be\nappropriately clustered around the truth. In particular, the inverse problem\nshould be formulated by evaluating the numerical solution at the true point\nlocations for direct comparison with the point data source. If the data are\nfirst fitted to a gridded or meshed field on the computational grid or mesh,\nand the inverse problem formulated by comparing the numerical solution to the\nfitted field, the benefits of additional point data values below the grid\ndensity will be lost.

METHODS: We study the X-ray spectra using a\ncooling flow model and the evolution of the amplitude of variability and power\ndensity spectra in UV and X-rays. RESULTS: The X-ray (pn) count rate increases\nfrom initially around 0.03 cps to 0.17 cps with a harder spectrum and a higher\ndegree of variability. Meanwhile, the OM/UVW1 light curve follows a slow\ndecline with decreasing amplitude of variability. For further study we split\nthe X-ray data into two parts, and analysed them separately.

However, to date, its localization analysis has been lacking a\nquantitative approach across entire datasets. In this work, we employ\nestablished gaze event detection algorithms for fixations and saccades and\nquantitatively evaluate the impact of these events by determining their concept\ninfluence. Input features that belong to saccades are shown to be substantially\nmore important than features that belong to fixations. By dissecting saccade\nevents into sub-events, we are able to show that gaze samples that are close to\nthe saccadic peak velocity are most influential. We further investigate the\neffect of event properties like saccadic amplitude or fixational dispersion on\nthe resulting concept influence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 10:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Despite being an important aspect, there has been little\nresearch on conditioning strategies for neural fields. In this work, we explore\nthe use of neural fields as decoders for 2D semantic segmentation. For this\ntask, we compare three conditioning methods, simple concatenation of the latent\ncode, Feature Wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), and Cross-Attention, in\nconjunction with latent codes which either describe the full image or only a\nlocal region of the image. Our results show a considerable difference in\nperformance between the examined conditioning strategies. Furthermore, we show\nthat conditioning via Cross-Attention achieves the best results and is\ncompetitive with a CNN-based decoder for semantic segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 15:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

This requires\nunderstanding the interplay between the processing-(micro)structure-property\nlinkages using a multi-scale approach that connects the macro-scale (process\nparameters) to meso (homogenized properties) and micro (crystallographic\ntexture) scales. Due to the nature of the problem's multi-scale modeling setup,\npossible processing path choices could grow exponentially as the decision tree\nbecomes deeper, and the traditional simulators' speed reaches a critical\ncomputational threshold. To lessen the computational burden for predicting\nmicrostructural evolution under given loading conditions, we develop a neural\nnetwork (NN)-based method with physics-infused constraints. The NN aims to\nlearn the evolution of microstructures under each elementary process. Our\nmethod is effective and robust in finding optimal processing paths. In this\nstudy, our NN-based method is applied to maximize the homogenized stiffness of\na Copper microstructure, and it is found to be 686 times faster while achieving\n0.053% error in the resulting homogenized stiffness compared to the traditional\nfinite element simulator on a 10-process experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 20:35:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 04:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}
