The\nmechanisms causing such disruptions are currently unknown or, at least,\nundetermined. To help guide theoretical and experimental work to understand the\ndisruption mechanism, we use numerical simulations of a synthetic NEA\npopulation to identify the resonant mechanisms that are responsible for driving\nNEAs close to the Sun, determine how these different mechanisms relate to their\ndynamical lifetimes at small heliocentric distances and calculate the average\ntime they spend at different heliocentric distances. Typically, resonances\nbetween NEAs and the terrestrial and giant planets are able to dramatically\nreduce the perihelion distances of the former. We developed an algorithm that\nscans the orbital evolution of asteroids and automatically identifies\noccurrences of mean motion and secular resonances. We find that most near-Sun\nasteroids are pushed to small perihelion distances by the 3:1J and 4:1J\nmean-motion resonances with Jupiter, as well as the secular resonances v6,\nv5,v3 and v4. The time-scale of the small-perihelion evolution is fastest for\nthe 4:1J, followed by the 3:1J, while v5 is the slowest.~7% of the test\nasteroids were not trapped in a resonance during the latest stages of their\ndynamical evolution, which suggests that the secular oscillation of the\neccentricity due to the Kozai mechanism, a planetary close encounter or a\nresonance that we have not identified pushed them below the estimated average\ndisruption distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 16:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

This permits a single HW qualification to ``cover'' diverse uses of\nthe same hardware, and thus avoid re-qualification in case of configuration\nchanges. The envisaged solution foresees the use of a single filter, suitable\nnot only for linear modulations such as M-QAM, but also for continuous phase\nmodulation methods. At this stage, we focus on pulse code modulation/frequency\nmodulation (PCM/FM), for which we propose a minimum mean square error (MMSE)\nalgorithm.

As emission norms become more stringent, the need for\nfast and accurate models that enable analysis of system behavior have become an\nessential requirement for system development. The fast transient processes\ninvolved in the operation of a combustion engine make it difficult to develop\naccurate physics-based models for such systems. As an alternative to physics\nbased models, we develop an operator-based regression model (DeepONet) to learn\nthe relevant output states for a mean-value gas flow engine model using the\nengine operating conditions as input variables. We have adopted a mean-value\nmodel as a benchmark for comparison, simulated using Simulink. The developed\napproach necessitates using the initial conditions of the output states to\npredict the accurate sequence over the temporal domain. To this end, a\nsequence-to-sequence approach is embedded into the proposed framework. The\naccuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing the prediction output to ground\ntruth generated from Simulink model. The maximum $\\mathcal L_2$ relative error\nobserved was approximately $6.5\\%$. The sensitivity of the DeepONet model is\nevaluated under simulated noise conditions and the model shows relatively low\nsensitivity to noise. The uncertainty in model prediction is further assessed\nby using a mean ensemble approach. The worst-case error at the $(\\mu +\n2\\sigma)$ boundary was found to be $12\\%$. The proposed framework provides the\nability to predict output states in real-time and enables data-driven learning\nof complex input-output operator mapping. As a result, this model can be\napplied during initial development stages, where accurate models may not be\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 16:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential in improving\nlow-count PET image quality, but acquiring a large, centralized, and diverse\ndataset from multiple institutions for training a robust model is difficult due\nto privacy and security concerns of patient data. Moreover, low-count PET data\nat different institutions may have different data distribution, thus requiring\npersonalized models.

However, we find\nthat this simple baseline heavily relies on spatial cues while ignoring\ntemporal relations for frame reconstruction, thus leading to sub-optimal\ntemporal matching representations for VOT and VOS. To alleviate this problem,\nwe propose DropMAE, which adaptively performs spatial-attention dropout in the\nframe reconstruction to facilitate temporal correspondence learning in videos.\nWe show that our DropMAE is a strong and efficient temporal matching learner,\nwhich achieves better finetuning results on matching-based tasks than the\nImageNetbased MAE with 2X faster pre-training speed.

Therefore, modeling the neutrals as a 1D fluid has been also pursued\nin simulations that do not involve the radial coordinate and, hence, do not\nresolve the neutrals' radial expansion. In this article, we present an\nextensive study on the sensitivity of the PIC simulations of Hall thruster\ndischarge to the model used for the neutral dynamics. We carried out 1D axial\nPIC simulations with various fluid and kinetic models of the neutrals as well\nas self-consistent quasi-2D axial-azimuthal simulations with different\nneutrals' fluid descriptions.

Indeed, interactions form the building blocks of\nalmost all physical theories and are described by polynomial terms in the\naction. The traditional approach is to derive these terms from elementary\nprocesses and then use the resulting model to make predictions for the entire\nsystem. But what if the underlying processes are unknown? Can we reverse the\napproach and learn the microscopic action by observing the entire system? We\nuse invertible neural networks (INNs) to first learn the observed data\ndistribution. By the choice of a suitable nonlinearity for the neuronal\nactivation function, we are then able to compute the action from the weights of\nthe trained model; a diagrammatic language expresses the change of the action\nfrom layer to layer. This process uncovers how the network hierarchically\nconstructs interactions via nonlinear transformations of pairwise relations. We\ntest this approach on simulated data sets of interacting theories.

In this work, we show that the recently proposed\nDeep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) can be naturally adapted to this form of\ncomputation. Our Landmark DEQ (LDEQ) achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthe challenging WFLW facial landmark dataset, reaching $3.92$ NME with fewer\nparameters and a training memory cost of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ in the number of\nrecurrent modules. Furthermore, we show that DEQs are particularly suited for\nlandmark detection in videos. In this setting, it is typical to train on still\nimages due to the lack of labelled videos. This can lead to a ``flickering''\neffect at inference time on video, whereby a model can rapidly oscillate\nbetween different plausible solutions across consecutive frames. By rephrasing\nDEQs as a constrained optimization, we emulate recurrence at inference time,\ndespite not having access to temporal data at training time. This Recurrence\nwithout Recurrence (RwR) paradigm helps in reducing landmark flicker, which we\ndemonstrate by introducing a new metric, normalized mean flicker (NMF), and\ncontributing a new facial landmark video dataset (WFLW-V) targeting landmark\nuncertainty. On the WFLW-V hard subset made up of $500$ videos, our LDEQ with\nRwR improves the NME and NMF by $10$ and $13\\%$ respectively, compared to the\nstrongest previously published model using a hand-tuned conventional filter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 19:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

This tradition involves a series of\napproaches that relativize measurement outcomes to, for example, worlds,\nsystems, agents, or reference frames. It includes Everett's Relative-State\nformulation of QT, the Many-worlds Interpretation, Relational Quantum\nMechanics, QBism, Healey's Pragmatism, and Diek's perspectival modal\ninterpretation. These approaches have potential costs connected with their\nrelationalism that may make them unattractive. Thus, if there is a\nnon-relationalist non-hidden variable universal approach to QT, it should be\ntaken seriously.

EBQT circumvents relationalism by\nconstructing an account of determinate and indeterminate quantum properties\nthat is not relational while maintaining unitary non-hidden variable universal\nQT. In situations where a relationalist is pressed to assume that measurement\noutcomes are relativized, such as in the extended Wigner's friend scenarios,\naccording to EBQT there aren't determinate outcomes but systems with certain\nnon-relational indeterminate properties.

Systems keep having determinate properties over time\nbecause of these structured interactions represented by certain networks.

Furthermore, it employs the complex polarization\npropagator (CPP) formalism which allows calculations on complexes with a dense\npopulation of electronic states (such complexes are known to be problematic for\nconventional TD-DFT). Here, we employ this method to investigate both the\ndynamic and electronic effects of the solvent for the excited electronic states\nof trans-trans-trans-[Pt(N3)2(OH)2(NH3)2] in aqueous solution.

We quantify the effect of the underlying structure and\ndynamics by classical molecular mechanics simulations, refined with a\nsubsequent DFT or semi-empirical optimization on a cluster. Moreover, we\nquantify the effect of employing different methods to set up the solvated\nsystem, e.g., how sensitive the results are to the method used for the\nrefinement, and how large a solvent shell that is required.

A physical\nlayer security approach -- known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) --\nhas been proposed and is being pursued as a viable IoT security mechanism. SEI\nis advantageous because it is a passive technique that exploits inherent and\ndistinct features that are unintentionally added to the signal by the IoT Radio\nFrequency (RF) front-end. SEI's passive exploitation of unintentional signal\nfeatures removes any need to modify the IoT device, which makes it ideal for\nexisting and future IoT deployments.

One challenge is the extraction of SEI features from signals\ncollected under multipath fading conditions.

Methods: To focus\non the role of deformation, simplified infinite-well (cavity) and radial\npower-law potential models are employed taking account of quadrupole and\noctupole shape degrees of freedom. Nuclear ground state deformations are\ninvestigated over the nuclear chart, and the properties of the deformed shell\nstructures are analyzed by means of the semiclassical periodic orbit theory.\nResults and conclusions: The systematics in nuclear ground-state octupole\ndeformations are reproduced in simplified mean-field potential models with of\nwithout parity mixing between Delta l=3 pair of levels. The strong octupole\ndeformed shell effect at above the spherical shell closures are explained\nsimply and clearly using the semiclassical periodic-orbit theory. They are\nassociated with the local restoration of dynamical symmetry, which enhance the\ncontribution of classical periodic orbits to the gross shell effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 23:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

FINV addresses the challenge of synthesizing novel views of\nobjects from partial observations, spanning cases where the object is not\nentirely in view, is partially occluded, or is only observed from similar\nviews. To achieve this, FINV learns shape priors by training a 3D generative\nmodel. At inference, given one or more views of a novel real-world object, FINV\nfirst finds a set of latent codes for the object by inverting the generative\nmodel from multiple initial seeds. Maintaining the set of latent codes, FINV\nfilters and resamples them after receiving each new observation, akin to\nparticle filtering.

We investigate\nwhether such a disagreement between observed and predicted internal rotation\nrates is present in main sequence stars by studying angular momentum transport\nin $\\gamma$ Dor stars. Furthermore, we test whether models of rotating stars\nwith internal magnetic fields can reproduce their rotational properties.\nMethods. We compute rotating models with the Geneva stellar evolution code\ntaking into account meridional circulation and the shear instability. We also\ncompute models with internal magnetic fields using a general formalism for\ntransport by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. We then compare these models to\nobservational constraints for $\\gamma$ Dor stars that we compiled from the\nliterature, combining so the core rotation rates, projected rotational\nvelocities from spectroscopy, and constraints on their fundamental parameters.\nResults. We show that combining the different observational constraints\navailable for $\\gamma$ Dor stars enable to clearly distinguish the different\nscenarios for internal angular momentum transport. Stellar models with purely\nhydrodynamical processes are in disagreement with the data whereas models with\ninternal magnetic fields can reproduce both core and surface constraints\nsimultaneously. Conclusions. Similarly to results obtained for subgiant and red\ngiant stars, angular momentum transport in radiative regions of $\\gamma$ Dor\nstars is highly efficient, in good agreement with predictions of models with\ninternal magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 01:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

We propose a physics-guided\nmaterial classification framework that relies on thermal properties of the\nobject. Our key observation is that the rate of heating and cooling of an\nobject depends on the unique intrinsic properties of the material, namely the\nemissivity and diffusivity. We leverage this observation by gently heating the\nobjects in the scene with a low-power laser for a fixed duration and then\nturning it off, while a thermal camera captures measurements during the heating\nand cooling process. We then take this spatial and temporal \"thermal spread\nfunction\" (TSF) to solve an inverse heat equation using the finite-differences\napproach, resulting in a spatially varying estimate of diffusivity and\nemissivity. These tuples are then used to train a classifier that produces a\nfine-grained material label at each spatial pixel.

In this\npaper, we focus on the benchmark task of HGNNs, i.e., node classification, and\nempirically find that typical HGNNs are not good at predicting the label of a\ntest node whose receptive field (1) has few training nodes from the same\ncategory or (2) has multiple training nodes from different categories. A\npossible explanation is that their message passing mechanisms may involve\nnoises from different categories, and cannot fully explore task-specific\nknowledge such as the label dependency between distant nodes. Therefore,\ninstead of introducing a new HGNN model, we propose a general post-training\nframework that can be applied on any pretrained HGNNs to further inject\ntask-specific knowledge and enhance their prediction performance. Specifically,\nwe first design an auxiliary system that estimates node labels based on (1) a\nglobal inference module of multi-channel label propagation and (2) a local\ninference module of network schema-aware prediction. The mechanism of our\nauxiliary system can complement the pretrained HGNNs by providing extra\ntask-specific knowledge. During the post-training process, we will strengthen\nboth system-level and module-level consistencies to encourage the cooperation\nbetween a pretrained HGNN and our auxiliary system. In this way, both systems\ncan learn from each other for better performance. In experiments, we apply our\nframework to four typical HGNNs. Experimental results on three benchmark\ndatasets show that compared with pretrained HGNNs, our post-training framework\ncan enhance Micro-F1 by a relative improvement of 3.9% on average.

However, conventional autoencoder-based methods\nlacked considerations in two aspects. This limited their performance in outlier\ndetection. First, the mean squared error used in conventional autoencoders\nignored the judgment uncertainty of the autoencoder, which limited their\nrepresentation ability. Second, autoencoders suffered from the abnormal\nreconstruction problem: some outliers can be unexpectedly reconstructed well,\nmaking them difficult to identify from the inliers. To mitigate the\naforementioned issues, two novel methods were proposed in this paper. First, a\nnovel loss function named Probabilistic Reconstruction Error (PRE) was\nconstructed to factor in both reconstruction bias and judgment uncertainty. To\nfurther control the trade-off of these two factors, two weights were introduced\nin PRE producing Adjustable Probabilistic Reconstruction Error (APRE), which\nbenefited the outlier detection in different applications. Second, a\nconceptually new outlier scoring method based on mean-shift (MSS) was proposed\nto reduce the false inliers caused by the autoencoder. Experiments on 32\nreal-world outlier detection datasets proved the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethods. The combination of the proposed methods achieved 41% of the relative\nperformance improvement compared to the best baseline.

In this study we investigate a method\nfor estimating the halo spin and halo concentration of low surface brightness\n(LSB), gas-rich dwarf barred galaxy UGC 5288, by forward modelling disk\nproperties derived from observations - stellar and gas surface densities, disk\nscale length, HI rotation curve, bar length and bar ellipticity. We combine\nsemi-analytical techniques, N-body/SPH and cosmological simulations to model\nthe DM halo of UGC 5288 with both a cuspy Hernquist profile and a flat-core\npseudo-isothermal profile. We find that the best match with observations is a\npseudo-isothermal halo model with a core radius of $r_{c} = 0.23$ kpc, and halo\nspin of $\\lambda$= 0.08 at the virial radius. Although our findings are\nconsistent with previous core radius estimates of the halo density profile of\nUGC 5288, as well as with the halo spin profiles of similar mass analogues of\nUGC5288 in the high-resolution cosmological-magneto-hydrodynamical simulation\nTNG50, there still remain some uncertainties as we are limited in our knowledge\nof the formation history of the galaxy. Additionally, we find that the inner\nhalo spin ($ r< 10$ kpc) in barred galaxies is different from the unbarred\nones, and the halo spin shows weak correlations with bar properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 05:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Nor do these models tend\nto account for the observation that, when swimming alone or in smaller groups,\nmany species of fish use intermittent locomotion, often referred to as burst\nand coast or burst and glide. Recent empirical studies have suggested that\nburst and glide movement is indeed pivotal to the social interactions of\nindividual fish. In this paper, we propose a model of social burst and glide\nmotion by combining a well-studied model of neuronal dynamics, the\nFitzHugh-Nagumo model, with a model of fish motion. We begin by showing that\nthe model can capture the motion of a single fish swimming down a channel. By\nthen extending to a two fish model, where visual stimuli of the position of the\nother fish affect the internal burst or glide state of the fish, we find that\nour model captures a rich set of swimming dynamics found in many species of\nfish. These include: leader-follower behaviour; periodic changes in leadership;\napparently random (i.e. chaotic) leadership change; and pendulum-like\ntit-for-tat turn taking. Unlike SPP models, which assume that fish move at a\nconstant speed, the model produces realistic motion of individual fish.\nMoreover, unlike previous studies where a random component is used for\nleadership switching to occur, we show that leadership switching, both periodic\nand chaotic, can be the result of a deterministic interaction. We give several\nempirically testable predictions on how fish interact and discuss our results\nin light of recently established correlations between fish locomotion and brain\nactivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 05:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

In principle, the gauge fixing procedure, which deals with the\n(unphysical) gauge symmetry, should not interfere with the other (physical)\nsymmetries. In practice, however, there can be an interference which takes two\ndifferent forms. First, depending on the considered gauge, it might not always\nbe simple or possible to devise approximation schemes that preserve the\nphysical symmetry constraints on (gauge-independent) observables. Second, even\nat an exact level of discussion, the (gauge-dependent) effective action for the\ngauge field, and thus the related vertex functions, may not reflect the\nphysical symmetries of the problem. We illustrate these difficulties using a\nvery general class of gauge fixings that contains the usual gauge fixings as\nparticular cases.

Once the anchor transformations\nare found, per-vertex nonlinear displacements of the garment template can be\nregressed in a canonical space, which reduces the complexity of deformation\nspace learning. By explicitly constraining the transformed anchors to satisfy\nthe consistencies of position, normal and direction, the physical meaning of\nlearned anchor transformations in space is guaranteed for better\ngeneralization.

A code with locality $(r,\\delta)$ (also called an\n$(r,\\delta)$-LRC) can repair up to $\\delta-1$ symbols in a codeword\nsimultaneously by accessing at most other $r$ symbols in the codeword. An\noptimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRC is a code that achieves the Singleton-type bound on\n$r,\\delta$, the code length, the code size and the minimum distance.\nConstructing optimal LRCs receives wide attention recently. In this paper, we\ngive a new method to analyze the $(r,\\delta)$-locality of cyclic codes. Via the\ncharacterization of locality, we obtain several classes of optimal\n$(r,\\delta)$-LRCs. When the minimum distance $d$ is greater than or equal to\n$2\\delta+1$, we present a class of $q$-ary optimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs whose code\nlengths are unbounded.

In other words, our optimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs can\nhave large distance over a relatively small field, which are desired by\npractical requirement of high repair capability and low computation cost.\nBesides, for the case of the minimal value $2$ of $\\delta$, we find out all the\noptimal cyclic $(r,2)$-LRCs of prime power lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 07:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

However, no attempt has been\nmade so far to account for the varying QPE recurrence time and luminosity in\nindividual sources, nor for the diversity of the QPE phenomenology in the\ndifferent known erupters. We present a semi-analytical model based on an\nExtreme Mass Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) system where the secondary intersects, along\nits orbit, a rigidly precessing accretion disc surrounding the primary. We\nassume QPEs to be due to emission from an adiabatically expanding, initially\noptically thick gas cloud expelled from the disc plane at each impact. We\nproduce synthetic X-ray light curves that are compared with X-ray data from\nfour QPE sources: GSN 069, eRO-QPE1, eRO-QPE2 and RX J1301.9+2747. Our model\nreproduces the diversity of QPE properties between the considered objects well,\nand is also able to account naturally for the varying QPE amplitudes and\nrecurrence times in individual sources. Future implementations will enable us\nto refine the match with the data, and to estimate precisely the system\nparameters making also use of multi-epoch QPE data. We briefly discuss the\nnature of the secondary object as well as possible implications of our findings\nfor the EMRI population at large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 07:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

In contrast to\nthe normal Hall effect, the in-plane Hall effect requires the absence of\ncertain crystal symmetries, and possibly manifests a non-trivial topology of\nquantum materials. An accurate estimation of the intrinsic in-plane (thermal)\nHall conductivity is crucial to identify the underlying mechanisms as in the\ncase of the Kitaev spin-liquid candidate alpha-RuCl3. Here, we give the\nsymmetry conditions for the in-plane Hall effect and discuss the implications\nthat may impede the experimental evaluation of the in-plane (thermal) Hall\nconductivity within the single-device measurement. First, the lack of symmetry\nin crystals can create merohedral twin domains that cancel the total Hall\nsignal. Second, even in a twin-free crystal, the intrinsic response is\npotentially contaminated by the out-of-plane conduction in three-dimensional\nsystems, which is systematically unavoidable in the in-plane Hall systems.\nThird, even in a quasi-two-dimensional system, the conversion of (thermal)\nresistivity, rho (lambda), to (thermal) conductivity, sigma (kappa) requires\nprotocols beyond the widely-used simplified formula due to the lack of\nin-plane-rotational symmetry. In principle, two independent sample devices are\nnecessary to accurately estimate the s_xy (k_xy). As a case study, we discuss\nthe half-integer quantization of the in-plane thermal Hall effect in the\nspin-disordered state of alpha-RuCl3. For an accurate measurement of the\nthermal Hall effect, it is necessary to avoid crystals with the merohedral\ntwins contributing oppositely to k_xy, while the out-of-plane transport may\nhave a negligible effect. To deal with the field-induced rotational-symmetry\nbreaking, we propose two symmetry-based protocols, improved single-device and\ntwo-device methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 08:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

In this paper, we\ndevelop a model-agnostic verification framework, called DeepAgn, and show that\nit can be applied to FNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or a mixture of\nboth. Under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity, DeepAgn analyses the\nreachability of DNNs based on a novel optimisation scheme with a global\nconvergence guarantee. It does not require access to the network's internal\nstructures, such as layers and parameters. Through reachability analysis,\nDeepAgn can tackle several well-known robustness problems, including computing\nthe maximum safe radius for a given input, and generating the ground-truth\nadversarial examples. We also empirically demonstrate DeepAgn's superior\ncapability and efficiency in handling a broader class of deep neural networks,\nincluding both FNNs, and RNNs with very deep layers and millions of neurons,\nthan other state-of-the-art verification approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 09:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

For this purpose we look at implicit discourse relation\nannotation, a task that has repeatedly been shown to be difficult due to the\nrelations' ambiguity. We compare the annotations of 1,200 discourse relations\nobtained using two distinct annotation tasks and quantify the biases of both\nmethods across four different domains. Both methods are natural language\nannotation tasks designed for crowdsourcing. We show that the task design can\npush annotators towards certain relations and that some discourse relations\nsenses can be better elicited with one or the other annotation approach.

When constructing analytic\nwaveforms in the frequency domain, one has to contend with the fact that the\nphase of the Fourier integral in non-monotonic, resulting in a breakdown of the\nstandard stationary phase approximation. In this work, we study this breakdown\nwithin the context of catastrophe theory. We find that the stationary phase\napproximation holds in the context of eccentric Keplerian orbits when the\nFourier frequency satisfies $f_{\\rm min} < f < f_{\\rm max}$, where $f_{\\rm\nmin/max}$ are integer multiples of the apocenter/pericenter frequencies,\nrespectively. For values outside of this interval, the phase undergoes a fold\ncatastrophe, giving rise to an Airy function approximation of the Fourier\nintegral. Using these two different approximations, we generate a matched\nasymptotic expansion that approximates generic Fourier integrals of Keplerian\nmotion for bound orbits across all frequency values. This asymptotic expansion\nis purely analytic and closed-form. We discuss several applications of this\ninvestigation and the resulting approximation, specifically: 1) the development\nand improvement of effective fly-by waveforms, 2) the transition from burst\nemission in the high eccentricity limit to wave-like emission in the\nquasi-circular limit, which results in an analogy between eccentric\ngravitational wave bursts and Bose-Einstein condensates, and 3) the calculation\nof f-mode amplitudes from stars in eccentric orbits in terms of complex Hansen\ncoefficients. The techniques and approximations developed herein are generic,\nand will be useful for future studies of gravitational waves from eccentric\nbinaries within the context of post-Newtonian theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 09:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Constructing spatial-temporal corridors for multi-vehicle can\ndecouple the high-dimensional conflicts and further reduce the difficulty of\nobtaining feasible trajectories. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel\nhierarchical method based on interactive spatio-temporal corridors (ISTCs). In\nthe first layer, based on the initial guidance trajectories, Mixed Integer\nQuadratic Programming is designed to construct ISTCs capable of resolving\nconflicts in generic multi-vehicle scenarios.

By introducing ISTCs, the multi-vehicle\ncoordinated motion planning problem is able to be decoupled into single-vehicle\ntrajectory optimization problems, which greatly decentralizes the computational\npressure and has great potential for real-world applications.

F stars, either with or without\nhot Jupiters, are usually X-ray emitters. The very low level of X-ray emission\nof the F5 star WASP-18 despite its relatively young age and spectral type is\nthus quite peculiar. [Abridged] We observed KELT-24 with \\xmm\\ for a total of\n43 ks in order to test if the X-ray activity of this star is depressed by the\ninteraction with its massive hot Jupiter, as is the case of WASP-18. KELT-24 is\ndetected in combined EPIC images with a high significance level. Its average\ncoronal spectrum is well described by a cool component at 0.36 keV and a hotter\ncomponent at 0.98 keV. We detected a flare with a duration of about 2 ks,\nduring which the coronal temperature reached 3.5 keV. The unabsorbed quiescent\nflux in 0.3-8.0 keV is $\\sim1.33\\times10^{-13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$,\ncorresponding to a luminosity of $1.5\\times10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the\ndistance of the star. The luminosity is well within the range of the typical\nX-ray luminosity of F stars in Hyades, which are coeval. We conclude that the\nactivity of KELT-24 appears normal, as expected, and is not affected by any\nstar--planet interaction. From the analysis of TESS light curves, we infer a\ndistribution of optical flares for KELT-24 and WASP-18. Small optical\nflickering similar to flares is recognized in WASP-18 but at lower levels of\nenergy and amplitude than in KELT-24. We discuss the causes of the low activity\nof WASP-18. Either WASP-18b could hamper the formation of a corona bright in\nX-rays in its host star through some form of tidal interaction, or the star has\nentered a minimum of activity similar to the solar Maunder minimum. This latter\nhypothesis would make WASP-18 among the few candidates showing such a quench of\nstellar activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 10:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Findings: Most\ncited goals by researchers do not coincide with those that arouse greater\nsocial attention. A small proportion of articles accumulates a large part of\nthe citations and most of the social attention. Both citation and social\nattention grow with funding. Thus, funded research has a greater probability of\nbeing cited in academic articles and mentioned in social media.

However it is often desirable to tune the model\nat inference time based on external factors such as preferences of the user or\ndynamic characteristics of the data. This is especially important to balance\nthe perception-distortion trade-off of ill-posed image-to-image translation\ntasks. In this work, we propose to optimize a parametric tunable convolutional\nlayer, which includes a number of different kernels, using a parametric\nmulti-loss, which includes an equal number of objectives. Our key insight is to\nuse a shared set of parameters to dynamically interpolate both the objectives\nand the kernels. During training, these parameters are sampled at random to\nexplicitly optimize all possible combinations of objectives and consequently\ndisentangle their effect into the corresponding kernels. During inference,\nthese parameters become interactive inputs of the model hence enabling reliable\nand consistent control over the model behavior. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our tunable convolutions effectively work as a drop-in\nreplacement for traditional convolutions in existing neural networks at\nvirtually no extra computational cost, outperforming state-of-the-art control\nstrategies in a wide range of applications; including image denoising,\ndeblurring, super-resolution, and style transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 11:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Upon job arrival,\na scheduler may run some \\emph{testing algorithm} against the job to extract\nsome information about its structure, e.g., its size, and properly classify it.\nThe acquisition of such knowledge comes with a cost because the testing\nalgorithm delays the dispatching decisions, though this is under control. In\nthis paper, we analyze the impact of such extra cost in a load balancing\nsetting by investigating the following questions: does it really pay off to\ntest jobs? If so, under which conditions? Under mild assumptions connecting the\ninformation extracted by the testing algorithm in relationship with its running\ntime, we show that whether scheduling with testing brings a performance\ndegradation or improvement strongly depends on the traffic conditions, system\nsize and the coefficient of variation of job sizes. Thus, the general answer to\nthe above questions is non-trivial and some care should be considered when\ndeploying a testing policy. Our results are achieved by proposing a load\nbalancing model for scheduling with testing that we analyze in two limiting\nregimes. When the number of servers grows to infinity in proportion to the\nnetwork demand, we show that job-size testing actually degrades performance\nunless short jobs can be predicted reliably almost instantaneously \\emph{and}\nthe network load is sufficiently high. When the coefficient of variation of job\nsizes grows to infinity, we construct testing policies inducing an arbitrarily\nlarge performance gain with respect to running jobs untested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 11:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

While multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\nserves as a core component in many deep CTR prediction models, it has been\nwidely recognized that applying a vanilla MLP network alone is inefficient in\nlearning multiplicative feature interactions. As such, many two-stream\ninteraction models (e.g., DeepFM and DCN) have been proposed by integrating an\nMLP network with another dedicated network for enhanced CTR prediction. As the\nMLP stream learns feature interactions implicitly, existing research focuses\nmainly on enhancing explicit feature interactions in the complementary stream.\nIn contrast, our empirical study shows that a well-tuned two-stream MLP model\nthat simply combines two MLPs can even achieve surprisingly good performance,\nwhich has never been reported before by existing work. Based on this\nobservation, we further propose feature gating and interaction aggregation\nlayers that can be easily plugged to make an enhanced two-stream MLP model,\nFinalMLP. In this way, it not only enables differentiated feature inputs but\nalso effectively fuses stream-level interactions across two streams.

This limit depends on the mechanical\nproperties of the surrounding solid and the density contrast between the fluid\nand the solid. Self-sustained fracture growth is characterized by two\ndimensionless numbers. The first parameter is a buoyancy factor that compares\nthe total released volume to the limiting volume to determine whether buoyant\ngrowth occurs. The second parameter is the dimensionless viscosity of a radial\nfracture at the time when buoyant effects become of order 1. This dimensionless\nviscosity notably depends on the rate at which the fluid volume is released,\nindicating that both the total volume and release history impact self-sustained\nbuoyant growth. Six well-defined propagation histories can be identified based\non these two dimensionless numbers. Their growth evolves between distinct\nlimiting regimes of radial and buoyant propagation, resulting in different\nfracture shapes. We can identify two growth rates depending on the dominant\nenergy dissipation mechanism (viscous flow vs fracture creation) in the\nfracture head. For finite values of material toughness, the toughness-dominated\nlimit represents a late-time solution for all fractures in growth rate and head\nshape (possibly reached only at a very late time). The viscosity-dominated\nlimit can appear at intermediate times. Our three-dimensional simulations\nconfirm the predicted scalings and highlight the importance of considering the\nentire propagation and release history for accurate analysis of buoyant\nhydraulic fractures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 11:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Here we report on the results of yet another XRP,\nEXO 2030+375, observed with IXPE and contemporarily monitored with Insight-HXMT\nand SRG/ART-XC.

In the current information era, we spend a big amount of our days\nbrowsing online. This activity consumes electricity which in turn produces\nCO2eq. While website browsing contributes to the production of greenhouse gas\nemissions, the impact of the Internet on the environment is further exacerbated\nby the web-tracking practice. Indeed, most webpages are heavily loaded by\ntracking content used mostly for advertising, data analytics and usability\nimprovements.

In\nthis work, we focus on the overhead caused by web tracking and analyse both its\nnetwork and carbon footprint. By leveraging the browsing telemetry of 100k\nusers and the results of a crawling experiment of 2.7M websites, we find that\nweb tracking increases data transmissions upwards of 21%, which in turn implies\nthe additional emission of around 11 Mt of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\nevery year.

The data representations learned with the models are often\ncontinuous and dense. However in many applications, sparse representations are\nexpected, such as learning sparse high dimensional embedding of data in an\nunsupervised setting, and learning multi-labels from thousands of candidate\ntags in a supervised setting. In some scenarios, there could be further\nrestriction on degree of sparsity: the number of non-zero features of a\nrepresentation cannot be larger than a pre-defined threshold $L_0$. In this\npaper we propose a sparse deep latent generative model SDLGM to explicitly\nmodel degree of sparsity and thus enable to learn the sparse structure of the\ndata with the quantified sparsity constraint.

In particular, we introduce to each observation $i$ an\nauxiliary random variable $L_i$, which models the sparsity of its\nrepresentation.

One such example is the Ruppeiner\ngeometry which is the metric space comprising the second derivatives of entropy\nwith respect to other extensive variables of the system.

The focus of this work\nis to explore the ISAC in the emerging massive Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite\nsystems, leveraging on their low latency, density, ubiquitous coverage and ease\nof integration. In particular, two aspects of the ISAC: opportunistic and\noptimized will be highlighted in this work through the use of LEO satellites\nfor positioning as well as the use of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)\ntechnique optimized to address sensing and communication requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 12:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

The initial reaction paths of our\ninvestigated systems are sampled using the Nudged-Elastic Band (NEB) method\ndriven by a cheap electronic structure method. Forces recalculated at the more\naccurate electronic structure theory for a set of points on the path are fitted\nwith a machine-learning technique (in our case symmetric gradient domain\nmachine learning or sGDML) to produce a semi-local reactive Potential Energy\nSurface (PES), embracing reactants, products and transition state (TS) regions.\nThis approach has been successfully applied to a unimolecular (Bergman\ncyclization of enediyne) and a bimolecular (S$_\\text{N}$2 substitution)\nreaction. In particular, we demonstrate that with only 50 to 150 energy-force\nevaluations with the accurate reference methods (here CASSCF and CCSD) it is\npossible to construct a semi-local PES giving qualitative agreement for\nstationary-point geometries, intrinsic reaction-coordinates and barriers.\nFurthermore, we find a qualitative agreement in vibrational frequencies and\nreaction rate coefficients. The key aspect of the method's performance is its\nmulti-scale nature, which not only saves computational effort but also allows\nextracting meaningful information along the reaction path, characterized by\nzero gradients in all but one direction. Agnostic to the nature of the TS and\ncomputationally economic, the protocol can be readily automated and routinely\nused for mechanistic reaction studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 12:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

However, they generally suffer from two limitations: i) the matching\nprocedure between local frames tends to be inaccurate due to the lack of\nguidance to force long-range temporal perception; ii) explicit motion learning\nis usually ignored, leading to partial information loss. To address these\nissues, we develop a Motion-augmented Long-short Contrastive Learning (MoLo)\nmethod that contains two crucial components, including a long-short contrastive\nobjective and a motion autodecoder. Specifically, the long-short contrastive\nobjective is to endow local frame features with long-form temporal awareness by\nmaximizing their agreement with the global token of videos belonging to the\nsame class. The motion autodecoder is a lightweight architecture to reconstruct\npixel motions from the differential features, which explicitly embeds the\nnetwork with motion dynamics. By this means, MoLo can simultaneously learn\nlong-range temporal context and motion cues for comprehensive few-shot\nmatching. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we evaluate MoLo on five standard\nbenchmarks, and the results show that MoLo favorably outperforms recent\nadvanced methods.

In this work, we\npropose Relative Pose Attention SRT (RePAST): Instead of fixing a reference\nframe at the input, we inject pairwise relative camera pose information\ndirectly into the attention mechanism of the Transformers. This leads to a\nmodel that is by definition invariant to the choice of any global reference\nframe, while still retaining the full capabilities of the original method.\nEmpirical results show that adding this invariance to the model does not lead\nto a loss in quality.

However, in the\nmultiple-degenerate-mechanical-mode optomechanical systems, the dark-mode\neffect strongly suppresses the quantum effects in mechanical modes. Here we\nstudy the generation of mechanical squeezing in a two-mechanical-mode\noptomechanical system by breaking the dark-mode effect with the\nsynthetic-gauge-field method. We find that when the mechanical modes work at a\nfinite temperature, the mechanical squeezing is weak or even disappeared due to\nthe dark-mode effect, while the strong mechanical squeezing can be generated\nonce the dark-mode effect is broken.

The HoP approach is straightforward: given the current timestamp\nt, we generate a pseudo Bird's-Eye View (BEV) feature of timestamp t-k from its\nadjacent frames and utilize this feature to predict the object set at timestamp\nt-k. Our approach is motivated by the observation that enforcing the detector\nto capture both the spatial location and temporal motion of objects occurring\nat historical timestamps can lead to more accurate BEV feature learning. First,\nwe elaborately design short-term and long-term temporal decoders, which can\ngenerate the pseudo BEV feature for timestamp t-k without the involvement of\nits corresponding camera images. Second, an additional object decoder is\nflexibly attached to predict the object targets using the generated pseudo BEV\nfeature. Note that we only perform HoP during training, thus the proposed\nmethod does not introduce extra overheads during inference. As a plug-and-play\napproach, HoP can be easily incorporated into state-of-the-art BEV detection\nframeworks, including BEVFormer and BEVDet series. Furthermore, the auxiliary\nHoP approach is complementary to prevalent temporal modeling methods, leading\nto significant performance gains. Extensive experiments are conducted to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed HoP on the nuScenes dataset. We\nchoose the representative methods, including BEVFormer and BEVDet4D-Depth to\nevaluate our method. Surprisingly, HoP achieves 68.5% NDS and 62.4% mAP with\nViT-L on nuScenes test, outperforming all the 3D object detectors on the\nleaderboard.

What\nmechanisms give rise to synchronous replication initiation remains however\npoorly understood. Via mathematical modelling, we identify four distinct\nsynchronization regimes depending on two quantities: the duration of the\nso-called licensing period during which the initiation potential in the cell\nremains high after the first origin has fired and the duration of the blocking\nperiod during which already initiated origins remain blocked. For synchronous\nreplication initiation, the licensing period must be long enough such that all\norigins can be initiated, but shorter than the blocking period to prevent\nreinitiation of origins that have already fired. We find an analytical\nexpression for the degree of synchrony as a function of the duration of the\nlicensing period, which we confirm by simulations. Our model reveals that the\ndelay between the firing of the first and the last origin scales with the\ncoefficient of variation (CV) of the initiation volume. Matching these to the\nvalues measured experimentally shows that the firing rate must rise with the\ncell volume with an effective Hill coefficient that is at least 20; the\nprobability that all origins fire before the blocking period is over is then at\nleast 92%. Our analysis thus reveals that the low CV of the initiation volume\nis a consequence of synchronous replication initiation. Finally, we show that\nthe previously presented molecular model for the regulation of replication\ninitiation in E. coli can give rise to synchronous replication initiation for\nbiologically realistic parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 13:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Predictions from QSAR models can help, for\nexample, to optimize molecular structure; prioritize compounds for further\nexperimental testing; and estimate their toxicity. In addition to the accurate\nestimation of the activity, it is highly desirable to obtain some estimate of\nthe uncertainty associated with the prediction, e.g., calculate a prediction\ninterval (PI) containing the true molecular activity with a pre-specified\nprobability, say 70%, 90% or 95%.

A total of 2,636 reference\nfingerprints from optical and capacitive sensors, 1,318 fingerphotos from\nsmartphones, and 9,224 latent fingerprints from each of the 132 subjects were\nprovided in this work. The dataset is constructed considering various age\ngroups, equal representations of genders and backgrounds. In addition, we\nprovide an extensive set of analysis of various subset evaluations to highlight\nopen challenges for future directions in latent fingerprint recognition\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 13:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Of particular\ninterest is the ability to encode quantum information not only as spin qubits\nbut also in the so-called valley degree of freedom, a two-fold orbital\ndegeneracy that arises from the symmetry of the hexagonal Bravais lattice.\nKnown spin-mixing and orbital-mixing mechanisms are unlikely to be at work for\nvalleys. Moreover, the topological nature of valley states in BLG promises\nunique routes for coherent qubit manipulation. Gate-defined BLG quantum-dot\ndevices have been recently established as a versatile building block for\naccessing high-quality spin and valley quantum states. However, measurements of\nthe relaxation time of valley states -- which ultimately limits these qubits'\ncoherence properties and therefore their suitability as practical qubits --\nremained so far elusive. Here we report the first measurement of the\ncharacteristic relaxation times of spin and valley states, obtained in a\nhigh-quality BLG device containing gate-defined double quantum dots. We show\nthat valley states can be distinguished with a fidelity of well above\n$99\\,\\text{%}$ and report remarkably long relaxation time between valley\ntriplets and singlets, exceeding $500\\,\\text{ms}$ at $B=250\\,\\text{mT}$, more\nthan one order of magnitude longer than the relaxation times we measure for\nspin states. Our approach to isolating valley states paves the way to measuring\ncoherent valley-qubit oscillations and, in combination with the recently\ndemonstrated electrical tunability of the valley $g$-factor, could provide a\npractical platform for the electrical control of long-lived valley qubits in\nBLG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 13:48:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

This is due to the lower error rates and richer\nanalytical software of NGS than that of TGS. NGS technologies generate vast\namounts of genomic data including short reads, quality values and read\nidentifiers. As a result, efficient compression of such data has become a\npressing need, leading to extensive research efforts focused on designing FASTQ\ncompressors. Previous researches show that lossless compression of quality\nvalues seems to reach its limits. But there remain lots of room for the\ncompression of the reads part. Results: By investigating the characters of the\nsequencing process, we present a new algorithm for compressing reads in FASTQ\nfiles, which can be integrated into various genomic compression tools. We first\nreviewed the pipeline of reference-based algorithms and identified three key\ncomponents that heavily impact storage: the matching positions of reads on the\nreference sequence(refpos), the mismatched positions of bases on reads(mispos)\nand the matching failed reads(unmapseq). To reduce their sizes, we conducted a\ndetailed analysis of the distribution of matching positions and sequencing\nerrors and then developed the three modules of AMGC. According to the\nexperiment results, AMGC outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving an 81.23% gain in compression ratio on average compared with the\nsecond-best-performing compressor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 14:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

However, their performance in\nmulti-view 3D object detection remains inferior to the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nof convolutional neural network based detectors. In this work, we investigate\nthis issue from the perspective of bird's-eye-view (BEV) feature generation.\nSpecifically, we examine the BEV feature generation method employed by the\ntransformer-based SOTA, BEVFormer, and identify its two limitations: (i) it\nonly generates attention weights from BEV, which precludes the use of lidar\npoints for supervision, and (ii) it aggregates camera view features to the BEV\nthrough deformable sampling, which only selects a small subset of features and\nfails to exploit all information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nnovel BEV feature generation method, dual-view attention, which generates\nattention weights from both the BEV and camera view. This method encodes all\ncamera features into the BEV feature. By combining dual-view attention with the\nBEVFormer architecture, we build a new detector named VoxelFormer. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on the nuScenes benchmark to verify the superiority\nof dual-view attention and VoxelForer. We observe that even only adopting 3\nencoders and 1 historical frame during training, VoxelFormer still outperforms\nBEVFormer significantly. When trained in the same setting, VoxelFormer can\nsurpass BEVFormer by 4.9% NDS point.

Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose to disentangle the inference score of LLMs for dialogue tasks\ninto a small number of symbolic concepts. We verify that we can use those\nsparse concepts to well estimate all inference scores of the LLM on all\narbitrarily masking states of the input sentence. We also evaluate the\ntransferability of concepts encoded by an LLM and verify that symbolic concepts\nusually exhibit high transferability across similar input sentences. More\ncrucially, those symbolic concepts can be used to explain the exact reasons\naccountable for the LLM's prediction errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 15:39:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

By modelling such anisotropic particles as small spheroids that\nslowly settle (or rise) in a wavy environment, we consider how the particle\nshape and buoyancy couple to the background wave-driven flow to influence the\nparticle orientation, drift, and dispersion. A multiscale expansion allows the\nwave-induced oscillations to be separated from the wave-averaged particle\nmotion. Using the wave-averaged equations of particle motion, we demonstrate\nthat spheroidal particles have a wave-induced preferential orientation with\ndifferent stable solutions for prolate and oblate particles. The resulting\npreferential orientation positions particles with their longest axis pointing\nin the direction of wave propagation and upwards against gravity. The angle at\nwhich the longest axis points upwards is a function of particle aspect ratio.\nIn this orientation, particles drift in the direction opposite to wave\npropagation, weakening and potentially even reversing their Stokes drift. The\nwave-induced stable orientation also results in a reduced settling velocity\nrelative to a random (isotropic) orientation. The dispersion of a particle\ncloud is controlled by the distribution of orientations. For a cloud of\nparticles released together with random (isotropic) orientation, the initial\ncloud growth rate is ballistic in all directions. Wave action acts to suppress\nthe vertical dispersion, but enhances horizontal dispersion into a\nsuper-ballistic state when the Stokes drift shear acts on a particle cloud that\nhas expanded in the vertical direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 15:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

The excitation\nof new degrees of freedom in such systems provides attractiveness or geometric\nself-focusing of energy-mass-momentum flows (EMMF) for the entire regular\nsystem. As a result of cumulation, EMMF structures acquire hyper-properties.\nThe cumulation of EMMF in rendered structures is a common property of media\nactivated to form 4D structures. The basis of such a dissipative structure is\nan attractor, the end result of which is a cumulative jet from an attractor\nwith hyper-properties. Therefore, these structures are cumulative-dissipative.\nWe discuss a method for describing these structures and prove that cumulative\nprocesses in plasmoids exist and can be described theoretically, although not\nwith the help of full-fledged mathematical 4D models. It has been theoretically\nand experimentally proven that the cumulation of the electric field due to the\nambipolar drift of the plasma is an inherent property of the current carrying\ngas-discharge plasma.

Based on the mathematical approach, a classification of shock waves\nand types of cumulation in 4D space-time will be carried out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 19:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Thus, we have\npresented a new theory: how Henry's Law regulates the concentration of CO$_2$\nin the atmosphere. This theory uses a physically perfect unit impulse response\nto convolve signals. By comparing the theory and the present observations we\nare able to derive the response time about 7.4 years, which is roughly the\nresidence time of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere. In addition, according to Henry's\nLaw we can derive the temperature dependence of the equilibrium concentration\nof CO$_2$. It turns out that now the major increase of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere\nis due to the temperature change, the reason for which is approximately a\nchange of cloudiness ($90\\%$) and the rest ($10\\%$) the greenhouse effect. The\ncorresponding increase of CO$_2$ is $83$~ppm/$^\\circ$C. According to our\ntheory, the causality is very clear: the increase of the temperature results in\nmore CO$_2$ in the atmosphere. This further CO$_2$ concentration increases also\nthe temperature but less than $10\\%$ via the greenhouse effect. The human\ncontribution to the CO$_2$ concentration and the temperature is very small.\nAbout $90\\%$ of a big human release of CO$_2$ dissolves in water. That is why\nthe human release now warms the climate less than $0.03 ^\\circ$C. We can also\nperform an inverse operation or calculate the temperature profile from the\nobserved CO$_2$ curve.

Additionally, the choice of the architecture enables native\ninterpretability support for the classification task both in image and metadata\ndomain with no additional modifications necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 11:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

Most of the literature studying balanced\nmultiframelets is from the point of view of the function setting, but very few\napproaches are from the aspect of multiframelet filter banks. In this paper, we\nstudy structural characterizations of balanced dual multiframelets from the\npoint of view of the Oblique Extension Principle (OEP). The OEP naturally\nconnects framelets with filter banks, which makes it a very handy tool for\nanalyzing the properties of framelets. With the OEP, we shall characterize\ncompactly supported balanced dual multiframemets through the concept of\nbalanced moment correction filters, which is the key notion that will be\nintroduced in our investigation. The results of this paper demonstrate what\nessential structures a balanced dual multiframelet has in the most general\nsetting, and bring us a more complete picture to understand balanced\nmultiframelets and their underlying discrete multiframelet transforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 06:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

We had previously\nstudied an ionic metal-polymer composites (IPMC), which consists in an ionic\npolymer film such as Nafion saturated with water and coated on both sides with\na thin layer of metal acting as electrodes. This system bends when it is\nsubject to an electric field orthogonal to the film and can thus be used as an\nactuator. Conversely, the deflection of the film generates a potential\ndifference between the electrodes ; the same system can therefore be used as a\nsensor.We have developed a ''continuous medium'' model for this system. The\nthermodynamics of linear irreversible processes had enabled us to establish its\nconstitutive equations.We are currently interested in a system of close\nproperties based on PEDOT, a semiconductor EAP. The central part of the device\nconsists in two interpenetrating polymers playing the role of an ions\nreservoir. The PEDOT is polymerized on each side and forms an interpenetrating\nnetwork with the two other polymers. A pseudo trilayer is obtained, the two\nouter layers containing the PEDOT acting as electrodes. It is then saturated\nwith an ionic liquid. When the blade thus obtained is placed in an electric\nfield orthogonal to its faces, the PEDOT undergoes a reduction reaction (or\ndedoping) on the side of the negative electrode, which attracts cations from\nthe central part and therefore swells ; the blade ultimately bends towards the\npositive electrode.We have first adapted our model to this two-components\nsystem : the cations on the one hand, and the three polymers and the anions on\nthe other hand. We have written its balance equations and thermodynamic\nrelations first at the microscopic scale for each phase, then at the\nmacroscopic scale for the whole material using an averaging technique. The\nthermodynamics of linear irreversible processes then provides its constitutive\nrelations : a Kelvin - Voigt type stress-strain relation and generalized\nFourier's and Darcy's laws. The equations obtained were applied to the case of\na cantilevered blade subject to a continuous potential difference at constant\ntemperature. The numerical resolution of the equations system enabled us to\ndraw the profiles of the different quantities, which are very steep functions\nnear the electrodes. We also evaluated the tip displacement and the force that\nmust be exerted on the free end of the beam to prevent its displacement\n(blocking force). The results obtained are in good agreement with the\nexperimental data published in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 07:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}
