To address this issue,\nprior work has proposed adding stack data structures to neural networks,\ndrawing inspiration from theoretical connections between syntax and stacks.\nHowever, these methods employ deterministic stacks that are designed to track\none parse at a time, whereas syntactic ambiguity, which requires a\nnondeterministic stack to parse, is extremely common in language. In this\ndissertation, we remedy this discrepancy by proposing a method of incorporating\nnondeterministic stacks into neural networks. We develop a differentiable data\nstructure that efficiently simulates a nondeterministic pushdown automaton,\nrepresenting an exponential number of computations with a dynamic programming\nalgorithm. We incorporate this module into two predominant architectures:\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. We show that this raises\ntheir formal recognition power to arbitrary context-free languages, and also\naids training, even on deterministic context-free languages. Empirically,\nneural networks with nondeterministic stacks learn context-free languages much\nmore effectively than prior stack-augmented models, including a language with\ntheoretically maximal parsing difficulty. We also show that an RNN augmented\nwith a nondeterministic stack is capable of surprisingly powerful behavior,\nsuch as learning cross-serial dependencies, a well-known non-context-free\npattern. We demonstrate improvements on natural language modeling and provide\nanalysis on a syntactic generalization benchmark. This work represents an\nimportant step toward building systems that learn to use syntax in more\nhuman-like fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 16:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 01:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

It is therefore unfortunate that machine\ntranslation -- both research and production -- largely remains stuck in a\ndecades-old sentence-level translation paradigm. It is also an increasingly\nglaring problem in light of competitive pressure from large language models,\nwhich are natively document-based. Much work in document-context machine\ntranslation exists, but for various reasons has been unable to catch hold. This\npaper suggests a path out of this rut by addressing three impediments at once:\nwhat architectures should we use? where do we get document-level information\nfor training them? and how do we know whether they are any good? In contrast to\nwork on specialized architectures, we show that the standard Transformer\narchitecture is sufficient, provided it has enough capacity. Next, we address\nthe training data issue by taking document samples from back-translated data\nonly, where the data is not only more readily available, but is also of higher\nquality compared to parallel document data, which may contain machine\ntranslation output. Finally, we propose generative variants of existing\ncontrastive metrics that are better able to discriminate among document\nsystems.

While different approaches have emerged to account for\nsuch states in the analysis, the performance of such approaches and the\nconsequences of ignoring the states in the analysis have rarely been\nquantified. We evaluated the recent idea of combining hidden Markov chains and\niSSA in a single modelling framework.

In an extensive simulation study, we compared the MS-iSSA to both\nthe standard iSSA and a classification-based iSSA (i.e., a two-step approach\nbased on a separate prior state classification). We further illustrate the\nthree approaches in a case study on fine-scale interactions of simultaneously\ntracked bank voles (Myodes glareolus). The results indicate that standard iSSAs\ncan lead to erroneous conclusions due to both biased estimates and unreliable\np-values when ignoring underlying behavioural states. We found the same for\niSSAs based on prior state-classifications, as they ignore misclassifications\nand classification uncertainties. The MS-iSSA, on the other hand, performed\nwell in parameter estimation and decoding of behavioural states.

This limitation has been recently circumvented by\nformulating IRL as the problem of estimating the feasible reward set, i.e., the\nregion of the rewards compatible with the expert's behavior. In this paper, we\nmake a step towards closing the theory gap of IRL in the case of finite-horizon\nproblems with a generative model.

Imaging the CNT arrays on\ninsulators like SiO2/Si using low-voltage scanning electron microscopy (LVSEM)\nto acquire array information like the alignment, density, and distribution of\nresidual polymers is necessary. Such a task remains challenging due to the\nnanoscale CNT body (1-2 nm in diameter), nanoscale tube-to-tube separation\n(1-10 nm), the broadening of the apparent diameter, and the complex image\ncontrast caused by the insulating substrate and polymer residues. In this\nstudy, the imaging mechanism for this system is investigated. Two methods are\ndeveloped to separate the three dominant contrasts, i.e. topographic contrast,\ncharge contrast, and material contrast, by selecting the take-off angle and\nenergy of the emitted electrons as enabled by changing the working distance or\nthe deceleration voltage. The contrast formation and separation mechanism is\nfurther confirmed by the dynamic contrast evolution due to the\nelectron-beam-induced deposition of amorphous carbon. The contrast separation\nmethod is further applied to an individual CNT, reducing its apparent diameter\nfrom 36 nm to 6 nm. This result hints at the potential for LVSEM to count the\ndensity exceeding 150 CNTs/um of CNT arrays. Finally, a comparative study of\nLVSEM and transmission electron microscopy confirms the failure of LVSEM to\nresolve CNTs in a bundle. The results suggest that the density of CNT arrays\nmay be underestimated in reported SEM data. The proposed method can serve as a\nuseful tool for further study and application of arrayed CNTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 17:13:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

It has been\nargued that explicitly capturing the underlying structure of data should allow\nconnectionist systems to generalize in a more predictable and systematic\nmanner. Indeed, evidence in humans suggests that interpreting the world in\nterms of symbol-like compositional entities may be crucial for intelligent\nbehavior and high-level reasoning. Another common limitation of deep learning\nsystems is that they require large amounts of training data, which can be\nexpensive to obtain. In representation learning, large datasets are leveraged\nto learn generic data representations that may be useful for efficient learning\nof arbitrary downstream tasks.\n  This thesis is about structured representation learning. We study methods\nthat learn, with little or no supervision, representations of unstructured data\nthat capture its hidden structure. In the first part of the thesis, we focus on\nrepresentations that disentangle the explanatory factors of variation of the\ndata. We scale up disentangled representation learning to a novel robotic\ndataset, and perform a systematic large-scale study on the role of pretrained\nrepresentations for out-of-distribution generalization in downstream robotic\ntasks. The second part of this thesis focuses on object-centric\nrepresentations, which capture the compositional structure of the input in\nterms of symbol-like entities, such as objects in visual scenes. Object-centric\nlearning methods learn to form meaningful entities from unstructured input,\nenabling symbolic information processing on a connectionist substrate.

To this end, we present PoseVocab, a novel\npose encoding method that encourages the network to discover the optimal pose\nembeddings for learning the dynamic human appearance. Given multi-view RGB\nvideos of a character, PoseVocab constructs key poses and latent embeddings\nbased on the training poses. To achieve pose generalization and temporal\nconsistency, we sample key rotations in $so(3)$ of each joint rather than the\nglobal pose vectors, and assign a pose embedding to each sampled key rotation.\nThese joint-structured pose embeddings not only encode the dynamic appearances\nunder different key poses, but also factorize the global pose embedding into\njoint-structured ones to better learn the appearance variation related to the\nmotion of each joint. To improve the representation ability of the pose\nembedding while maintaining memory efficiency, we introduce feature lines, a\ncompact yet effective 3D representation, to model more fine-grained details of\nhuman appearances. Furthermore, given a query pose and a spatial position, a\nhierarchical query strategy is introduced to interpolate pose embeddings and\nacquire the conditional pose feature for dynamic human synthesis.

The provision of publicly available datasets has recently\nencouraged the development of new methods, mainly based on deep learning. In\nthis review, we identify datasets used for method development and evaluation,\nas well as quantify their frequency of use in the literature. We further\npresent an overview of the current state of research regarding the segmentation\nand tracking of minimally invasive surgical instruments in endoscopic images.\nThe paper focuses on methods that work purely visually without attached markers\nof any kind on the instruments, taking into account both single-frame\nsegmentation approaches as well as those involving temporal information.

Effective modelling for such data must\nexploit its time series nature, the semantic relationship between different\ntypes of observations, and information in the sparsity structure of the data.\nSelf-supervised Transformers have shown outstanding performance in a variety of\nstructured tasks in NLP and computer vision. But multivariate time series data\ncontains structured relationships over two dimensions: time and recorded event\ntype, and straightforward applications of Transformers to time series data do\nnot leverage this distinct structure. The quadratic scaling of self-attention\nlayers can also significantly limit the input sequence length without\nappropriate input engineering. We introduce the DuETT architecture, an\nextension of Transformers designed to attend over both time and event type\ndimensions, yielding robust representations from EHR data. DuETT uses an\naggregated input where sparse time series are transformed into a regular\nsequence with fixed length; this lowers the computational complexity relative\nto previous EHR Transformer models and, more importantly, enables the use of\nlarger and deeper neural networks.

This mechanism was uncovered by\nresolving the quantum dynamical reactive pathways and identifying their rate\nlimiting transitions. Upon inspecting the wavefunctions associated with the\nrate limiting transition, we observed the formation of a polariton and\nidentified the concomitant rate suppression as due to hybridization between the\nreactive mode and the cavity mode, which inhibits bath-mediated tunneling\nduring the reaction. The transition probabilities that define the quantum\nmaster equation can be directly translated into a visualisation of the\ncorresponding polariton energy landscape.

Skyrmions\nare topological objects while skyrmion crystals break internal and\ntranslational symmetries, thus our setup allows us to study the interplay of\ntopology and symmetry breaking. Starting from a basis of holomorphic theta\nfunctions, we construct an analytical ansatz for such a junction with finite\nspatially modulating topological charge density in the central region and\nvanishing in the leads. We then construct a suitably defined energy functional\nfor the junction and derive the resulting equations of motion, which resemble a\nBogoliubov-de Gennes-like equation. Using analytical techniques, field theory,\nheuristic models and microscopic recursive transfer-matrix numerics, we\ncalculate the spectra and magnon transmission properties of the skyrmion\ncrystal. We find that magnon transmission can be understood via a combination\nof low-energy Goldstone modes and effective emergent Landau levels at higher\nenergies. The former manifests in discrete low-energy peaks in the transmission\nspectrum which reflect the nature of the Goldstone modes arising from symmetry\nbreaking.

Numerically computing the spectral dimension of\n$1$-periodic frusta geometries using extrapolated quantum amplitudes, we find\nthat quantum effects lead to a small change of spectral dimension at small\nscales and an agreement to semi-classical results at larger scales. Adding a\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$, we find additive corrections to the\nnon-oscillating result at the diffusion scale $\\tau\\sim 1/\\sqrt{\\Lambda}$.\nExtending to $2$-periodic configurations, we observe a reduced effective\ndimension, the form of which sensitively depends on the values of the\ngravitational constant $G$ and the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$.

In nutritional epidemiology,\nstudying reproducible dietary patterns is critical to reveal important\nassociations with health. However, it is challenging: diverse cultural and\nethnic backgrounds may critically impact eating patterns, showing\nheterogeneity, leading to incorrect dietary patterns and obscuring the\ncomponents shared across different groups or populations.\n  Moreover, covariate effects generated from observed variables, such as\ndemographics and other confounders, can further bias these dietary patterns.\nIdentifying the shared and group-specific dietary components and covariate\neffects is essential to drive accurate conclusions.\n  To address these issues, we introduce a new modeling factor regression, the\nMulti-Study Factor Regression (MSFR) model. The MSFR model analyzes different\npopulations simultaneously, achieving three goals: capturing shared\ncomponent(s) across populations, identifying group-specific structures, and\ncorrecting for covariate effects.\n  We use this novel method to derive common and ethnic-specific dietary\npatterns in a multi-center epidemiological study in Hispanic/Latinos community.\nOur model improves the accuracy of common and group dietary signals and yields\nbetter prediction than other techniques, revealing significant associations\nwith health.\n  In summary, we provide a tool to integrate different groups, giving accurate\ndietary signals crucial to inform public health policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 18:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

We study this effect in a more general context,\nwhen both geometric and dynamic factors are taken into account. We consider\ngeneric axially symmetric rotating black holes. The near-horizon behavior of\nmetric coefficients is determined by three numbers $p,~q,$ $k$ that appear in\nthe Taylor expansions for different types of a horizon$.$ This includes\nnonextremal, extremal and ultraextremal horizons.

In this short paper, we introduce a novel unifying graph\ndata model called Statement Graphs, which combines the traits of both RDF and\nLPG and achieves interoperability at different levels: it (a) provides the\nability to manage RDF and LPG data as a single, interconnected graph, (b)\nsupports querying over the integrated graph using any RDF or LPG query\nlanguage, while (c) clearing the way for graph stack independent data exchange\nmechanisms and formats.

However, some essential questions exist pertaining\nto SNNs that are little studied: Do SNNs trained with surrogate gradient learn\ndifferent representations from traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)?\nDoes the time dimension in SNNs provide unique representation power? In this\npaper, we aim to answer these questions by conducting a representation\nsimilarity analysis between SNNs and ANNs using Centered Kernel Alignment\n(CKA). We start by analyzing the spatial dimension of the networks, including\nboth the width and the depth.

Moreover, the phase transition point is uniquely associated\nwith the behavior of individual levels, namely at the Unruh temperature the two\nlowest Matsubara modes become singular on the Rindler horizon. This provides a\nnew manifestation of the duality between the thermodynamic description and the\ngeometric approach (the behavior of the quantum levels of particles living on a\nnontrivial geometric manifold). Although the considered example refers to the\nphysics of black holes, we note the formal similarity of the Unruh temperature\nwith the parameter characterizing quantum transitions in the theory of\ncondensed matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 20:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

The growing adoption of HDR in\nmassively scaled video networks has driven the need for video quality\nassessment (VQA) algorithms that better account for distortions on HDR content.\nIn particular, standard VQA models may fail to capture conspicuous distortions\nat the extreme ends of the dynamic range, because the features that drive them\nmay be dominated by distortions {that pervade the mid-ranges of the signal}.

This process,\nalso known as selective forgetting or unlearning, is often conducted by\npartitioning a dataset into shards, training fully independent models on each,\nthen ensembling the resulting models. Increasing the number of shards reduces\nthe expected cost to forget but at the same time it increases inference cost\nand reduces the final accuracy of the model since synergistic information\nbetween samples is lost during the independent model training. Rather than\ntreating each shard as independent, SAFE introduces the notion of a shard\ngraph, which allows incorporating limited information from other shards during\ntraining, trading off a modest increase in expected forgetting cost with a\nsignificant increase in accuracy, all while still attaining complete removal of\nresidual influence after forgetting. SAFE uses a lightweight system of adapters\nwhich can be trained while reusing most of the computations. This allows SAFE\nto be trained on shards an order-of-magnitude smaller than current\nstate-of-the-art methods (thus reducing the forgetting costs) while also\nmaintaining high accuracy, as we demonstrate empirically on fine-grained\ncomputer vision datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 22:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Adjusting zonal\ntemperature set-points is one of the most promising measures to unlock the\nenergy flexibility potential of central air conditioning systems in complex\ncommercial buildings. However, most existing studies focused on quantifying the\nenergy flexibility on the building level since only building-level energy\nconsumption is normally metered in commercial buildings. This study aims to\ninvestigate the impacts of temperature set-point adjustment strategies on\nzone-level thermal and energy performance by developing a non-intrusive\ndata-driven load disaggregation method (i.e., a virtual zonal power meter).\nThree university buildings in Northern California were selected to test the\nproposed load disaggregation method.

For\nthe three tested buildings, the top 30% most energy-intensive zones accounted\nfor around 60% of the total energy use; and the top 30% most energy-flexible\nzones provided around 80% of the total energy flexibility.

Over the past few decades, the\nphase-field method has grown in popularity as a valid approach to modeling\nhydraulic fracturing because of the ease of handling complex fracture\npropagation geometries. However, existing phase-field methods cannot\nappropriately capture nucleation of hydraulic fractures because their\nformulations are solely energy-based and do not explicitly take into account\nthe strength of the material. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel\nphase-field formulation for hydraulic fracturing with the main goal of modeling\nfracture nucleation in porous media, e.g., rocks. Built on the variational\nformulation of previous phase-field methods, the proposed model incorporates\nthe material strength envelope for hydraulic fracture nucleation through two\nimportant steps: (i) an external driving force term, included in the damage\nevolution equation, that accounts for the material strength; (ii) a properly\ndesigned damage function that defines the fluid pressure contribution on the\ncrack driving force. The comparison of numerical results for two-dimensional\n(2D) test cases with existing analytical solutions demonstrates that the\nproposed phase-field model can accurately model both nucleation and propagation\nof hydraulic fractures. Additionally, we present the simulation of hydraulic\nfracturing in a three-dimensional (3D) domain with various stress conditions to\ndemonstrate the applicability of the method to realistic scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 23:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Methods have focused specifically on capturing accurate energy\n(e.g., through parametric lighting models), which emphasizes shading and strong\ncast shadows; or producing plausible texture (e.g., with GANs), which\nprioritizes plausible reflections. Approaches which provide editable lighting\ncapabilities have been proposed, but these tend to be with simplified lighting\nmodels, offering limited realism. In this work, we propose to bridge the gap\nbetween these recent trends in the literature, and propose a method which\ncombines a parametric light model with 360{\\deg} panoramas, ready to use as\nHDRI in rendering engines. We leverage recent advances in GAN-based LDR\npanorama extrapolation from a regular image, which we extend to HDR using\nparametric spherical gaussians. To achieve this, we introduce a novel lighting\nco-modulation method that injects lighting-related features throughout the\ngenerator, tightly coupling the original or edited scene illumination within\nthe panorama generation process. In our representation, users can easily edit\nlight direction, intensity, number, etc. to impact shading while providing\nrich, complex reflections while seamlessly blending with the edits.\nFurthermore, our method encompasses indoor and outdoor environments,\ndemonstrating state-of-the-art results even when compared to domain-specific\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 00:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

They are gaining increased\nattention in computational science and engineering, due to their potential both\nto accelerate traditional numerical methods and to enable data-driven\ndiscovery. A popular variant of neural operators is the Fourier neural operator\n(FNO). Previous analysis proving universal operator approximation theorems for\nFNOs resorts to use of an unbounded number of Fourier modes and limits the\nbasic form of the method to problems with periodic geometry. Prior work relies\non intuition from traditional numerical methods, and interprets the FNO as a\nnonstandard and highly nonlinear spectral method. The present work challenges\nthis point of view in two ways: (i) the work introduces a new broad class of\noperator approximators, termed nonlocal neural operators (NNOs), which allow\nfor operator approximation between functions defined on arbitrary geometries,\nand includes the FNO as a special case; and (ii) analysis of the NNOs shows\nthat, provided this architecture includes computation of a spatial average\n(corresponding to retaining only a single Fourier mode in the special case of\nthe FNO) it benefits from universal approximation. It is demonstrated that this\ntheoretical result unifies the analysis of a wide range of neural operator\narchitectures.

Canyons on the\ncontinental slope may provide a pathway for warm water to cross the slope\ncurrent and intrude onto the continental shelf underneath ice shelves, which\ncan increase rates of ice shelf melting, leading to reduced buttressing of ice\nshelves, accelerating glacial flow and hence increased sea level rise.\nObservations and modelling studies of the Antarctic Slope Current and\ncross-shelf warm water intrusions are limited, particularly in the East\nAntarctica region. To explore this topic, an idealised configuration of the\nAntarctic Slope Current is developed, using an eddy-resolving isopycnal model\nthat emulates the dynamics and topography of the East Antarctic sector. Warm\nwater intrusions via canyons are found to occur in discrete episodes, with\nlarge onshore flow induced by eddies. The episodic nature of cross-shelf warm\nwater transport is demonstrated, with canyon width playing a key role in\nmodulating cross-shelf exchanges; warm water transport through narrower canyons\nis more irregular than transport through wider canyons. The episodic\ncross-shelf transport is driven by a cycle of rising and falling rates of eddy\ngeneration in the Antarctic Slope Current, a variability intrinsic to the slope\ncurrent that can be explained without any temporal variability in external\nforcings. Improved understanding of the intrinsic variability of warm water\nintrusions can help guide future observational and modelling studies in the\nanalysis of eddy impacts on Antarctic shelf circulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 01:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Adversarial training is one of the most efficient\nmethods to improve the model's robustness. The key factor for the success of\nadversarial training is the capability to generate qualified and divergent\nadversarial examples which satisfy some objectives/goals (e.g., finding\nadversarial examples that maximize the model losses for simultaneously\nattacking multiple models). Therefore, multi-objective optimization (MOO) is a\nnatural tool for adversarial example generation to achieve multiple\nobjectives/goals simultaneously. However, we observe that a naive application\nof MOO tends to maximize all objectives/goals equally, without caring if an\nobjective/goal has been achieved yet. This leads to useless effort to further\nimprove the goal-achieved tasks, while putting less focus on the\ngoal-unachieved tasks. In this paper, we propose \\emph{Task Oriented MOO} to\naddress this issue, in the context where we can explicitly define the goal\nachievement for a task.

In the preemptive\nM/G/1 queue, we know the optimal policy is the Gittins policy, which uses any\navailable information about jobs' remaining service times to dynamically\nprioritize jobs. For models more complex than the M/G/1, optimal scheduling is\ngenerally intractable. This leads us to ask: beyond the M/G/1, does Gittins\nstill perform well?\n  Recent results indicate that Gittins performs well in the M/G/k, meaning that\nits additive suboptimality gap is bounded by an expression which is negligible\nin heavy traffic. But allowing multiple servers is just one way to extend the\nM/G/1, and most other extensions remain open. Does Gittins still perform well\nwith non-Poisson arrival processes? Or if servers require setup times when\ntransitioning from idle to busy?\n  In this paper, we give the first analysis of the Gittins policy that can\nhandle any combination of (a) multiple servers, (b) non-Poisson arrivals, and\n(c) setup times. Our results thus cover the G/G/1 and G/G/k, with and without\nsetup times, bounding Gittins's suboptimality gap in each case. Each of (a),\n(b), and (c) adds a term to our bound, but all the terms are negligible in\nheavy traffic, thus implying Gittins's heavy-traffic optimality in all the\nsystems we consider. Another consequence of our results is that Gittins is\noptimal in the M/G/1 with setup times at all loads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 01:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Coronal magnetic field reconstructions reveal\na magnetic flux rope (MFR) with configuration highly consistent with a filament\nexisting for a long period before the flare, and the eruption of the whole\nfilament indicates that the MFR erupted during the flare. However, quantitative\nanalysis shows that the pre-flare MFR resides in a height too low to trigger a\ntorus instability (TI). The filament experienced a slow rise before the flare\nonset, for which we estimate evolution of the filament height using a\ntriangulation method by combining the SDO and STEREO observations, and find it\nis also much lower than the critical height for triggering TI. On the other\nhand, the pre-flare evolution of the current density shows progressive thinning\nof a vertical current layer on top of the flare PIL, which suggests that a\nvertical current sheet forms before the eruption.

Inferring these navigational patterns from\nincompletely observed environments is required for intelligent mobile robots\noperating in unmapped locations. However, algorithmically defining these\nnavigational patterns is nontrivial. This paper presents the first\nself-supervised learning (SSL) method for learning to infer navigational\npatterns in real-world environments from partial observations only. We explain\nhow geometric data augmentation, predictive world modeling, and an\ninformation-theoretic regularizer enables our model to predict an unbiased\nlocal directional soft lane probability (DSLP) field in the limit of infinite\ndata. We demonstrate how to infer global navigational patterns by fitting a\nmaximum likelihood graph to the DSLP field. Experiments show that our SSL model\noutperforms two SOTA supervised lane graph prediction models on the nuScenes\ndataset. We propose our SSL method as a scalable and interpretable continual\nlearning paradigm for navigation by perception.

In order to achieve high mobility, UAV has\nstrict requirements on communication latency, and it cannot be illegally\ncontrolled as weapons of attack with malicious intentions. Therefore, an\nefficient and secure communication method specifically designed for UAV network\nis required. This paper proposes a communication mechanism named ESCM for the\nabove requirements. For high efficiency of communication, ESCM designs a\nrouting protocol based on artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) for UAV network\nto accelerate communication between UAVs. Meanwhile, we plan to use blockchain\nto guarantee the communication security of UAV networks. However, blockchain\nhas unstable links in high mobility network scenarios, resulting in low\nconsensus efficiency and high communication overhead. Therefore, ESCM also\nintroduces the concept of the digital twin, mapping the UAVs from the physical\nworld into Cyberspace, transforming the UAV network into a static network. And\nthis virtual UAV network is called CyberUAV. Then, in CyberUAV, we design a\nblockchain system and propose a consensus algorithm based on network coding,\nnamed proof of network coding (PoNC). PoNC not only ensures the security of\nESCM, but also further improves the performance of ESCM through network coding.\nSimulation results show that ESCM has obvious advantages in communication\nefficiency and security. Moreover, encoding messages through PoNC consensus can\nincrease the network throughput, and make mobile blockchain static through\ndigital twin can improve the consensus success rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 02:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

H2O maser emission is\nmarginally detected above the three times the rms level within a velocity range\nof approximately 2250-2450 km/s, slightly red-shifted with respect to the\nsystemic velocity. H2O maser emission is located approximately 1 milliarcsecond\n(mas) east of the brightest continuum component at 22 GHz, where the continuum\nspectrum is optically thick, that is at the free-free absorbed receding jet by\nionized gas. A positional coincidence between H2O maser emission and an ionized\ngas disk implies that the H2O maser emission arises from the near side of the\ndisk, amplifying continuum emission from the background receding jet. If the\ndisk axis is oriented 64 degree relative to the line of sight, the H2O maser\nemission is expected to be at a mean radius of 0.3 pc in the disk.

However, it is also known that the\nsame tomographic task, albeit with a less symmetric formula, can be\naccomplished by any informationally complete (non necessarily symmetric)\nstructure. Here we show that, if the tomographic task is replaced by a\ndata-driven inferential approach, the reconstruction, while possible with\ndesigns, cannot by accomplished anymore by an arbitrary informationally\ncomplete structure. Hence, we propose the data-driven inference as the arena in\nwhich the role of designs naturally emerges. Our inferential approach is based\non a minimality principle according to which, among all the possible inferences\nconsistent with the data, the weakest should be preferred, in the sense of\nmajorization theory and statistical comparison.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 03:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

This motivates the need to temporally localize the instruction steps\nin such videos, i.e. the task called key-step localization. Traditional methods\nfor key-step localization require video-level human annotations and thus do not\nscale to large datasets. In this work, we tackle the problem with no human\nsupervision and introduce StepFormer, a self-supervised model that discovers\nand localizes instruction steps in a video.

Traditional sequential\nrecommendation methods that rely on explicit item IDs encounter challenges in\nhandling item cold start and domain transfer problems.

However, existing SSL\napproaches used in FSL typically seek the supervision signals from the global\nembedding of every single image. Therefore, during the episodic training of\nFSL, these methods cannot capture and fully utilize the local visual\ninformation in image samples and the data structure information of the whole\nepisode, which are beneficial to FSL. To this end, we propose to augment the\nfew-shot learning objective with a novel self-supervised Episodic Spatial\nPretext Task (ESPT). Specifically, for each few-shot episode, we generate its\ncorresponding transformed episode by applying a random geometric transformation\nto all the images in it. Based on these, our ESPT objective is defined as\nmaximizing the local spatial relationship consistency between the original\nepisode and the transformed one. With this definition, the ESPT-augmented FSL\nobjective promotes learning more transferable feature representations that\ncapture the local spatial features of different images and their\ninter-relational structural information in each input episode, thus enabling\nthe model to generalize better to new categories with only a few samples.\nExtensive experiments indicate that our ESPT method achieves new\nstate-of-the-art performance for few-shot image classification on three\nmainstay benchmark datasets.

Such a model can be used by novice\nengineers during their product ramp-up phase to build a model of the software\nsystem that captures their knowledge of the system and aid their mental model.\nThe paper also presents a learning approach in which the learners create and\nrefine these models iteratively using the available and newly uncovered\nknowledge about the software system. We hypothesize that by leveraging this\nmodeling language and approach, novice engineers can reduce the time it takes\nthem to achieve desired proficiency level of system comprehension. This paper\npresents early ideas on this language and approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 05:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

The\nresultant mass ratio and orbital period were the highest among SU UMa stars,\nand this provided a proof that the 3:1 resonance can develop in less than 6 d\neven in q=0.39(3). The superoutburst faded relatively rapidly and was followed\nby a rebrightening, suggesting that the tidal effect in a large-q system was\ninsufficient to maintain a long superoutburst and the remnant matter caused a\nrebrightening. The presence of such a system among dwarf novae is against the\nconventional idea that outbursts in dwarf novae are not long enough to develop\nsuperhumps, in contrast to novalike variables, under a weak tidal effect. The\npresent observation also supports that the 3:1 resonance is the cause of a long\noutburst, and not its consequence, even under extreme q. The rapid growth of\nthe 3:1 resonance in a high-q system challenges the generally accepted results\nof hydrodynamic simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 06:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

The disk radius\ndecreases as photoevaporation clears out the gas in the outer disk efficiently.\nThe qualitative evolutionary trends of the disk mass are remarkably similar for\nthe wide range of the central stellar mass we consider, and the time evolution\nof the disk mass can be well fitted by a simple function. The dispersal time is\napproximately ten million years for low mass stars with weak mass dependence,\nbut gets as short as two million years around a 7M$_{\\odot}$ star.

From additional experiments on\nNiTPP multilayer films, we conclude that this distortion is a consequence of\nthe interaction with the substrate, as the NiTPP macrocycle of the second layer\nturns out to be flat. We further find that distortions in the MTPP macrocycle\nare accompanied by an increasing energy gap between the highest occupied\nmolecular orbitals (HOMO and HOMO-1).

To achieve the fairness notion of\nequal treatment of equals, conventionally the randomness necessary to resolve\nconflicts between players is assumed to be generated by some trusted authority.\nHowever, in a distributed setting, the mutually untrusted players are\nresponsible for generating the randomness themselves.\n  In addition to standard desirable properties such as fairness and\nPareto-efficiency, we investigate the game-theoretic notion of maximin\nsecurity, which guarantees that an honest player following a protocol will not\nbe harmed even if corrupted players deviate from the protocol. Our main\ncontribution is an impossibility result that shows no maximin secure protocol\ncan achieve both fairness and ordinal efficiency. Specifically, this implies\nthat the well-known probabilistic serial (PS) mechanism by Bogomolnaia and\nMoulin cannot be realized by any maximin secure protocol.\n  On the other hand, we give a maximin secure protocol that achieves fairness\nand stability (aka ex-post Pareto-efficiency).

Therefore, the mechanism contributing to\nthe rise of affective polarization still remain unclear, as well as its unique\nemergent dynamics. To address this issue, this study introduces the coupled\nfeedback between opinions and response susceptibility to a attraction-repulsion\nmodel which takes account into three parameters: interaction strength, response\nsusceptibility and tolerance to others. The model features phase diagrams of\nglobal consensus, affective polarization, and ``harmony with diversity\" states.\nThe simulations on time-varying and static social networks show that\nintermediate parameter ranges yield a global convergence, as one integrated\ncluster collapsing and converging towards a uncertain moderate position after\nlong-time persistence.

Remarkably, strengthening feedback\nmay facilitate polarization by driving the system priorly self-organize into\none integrated cluster which then gradually approaching polarization,\nespecially for low tolerance and strong interactions, and the step-like dynamic\nbehaviors of opinion entropy suggest the occurrence of dynamic equilibrium.

Some of the long standing problems of this subject are\nhighlighted, including the incompatibility of an instantaneous ``collapse of\nthe wavefunction'' with relativity of simultaneity, and the difficulty of\nmaintaining causality in the rules for measurement highlighted by ``impossible\nmeasurement'' scenarios. Thereafter, the issue is considered from the\nperspective of mathematical physics. To this end, quantum field theory is\ndescribed in a model-independent, operator algebraic setting, on generic\nLorentzian spacetime manifolds. The process of measurement is modelled by a\nlocalized dynamical coupling between a quantum field called the ``system'', and\nanother quantum field, called the ``probe''. The result of the dynamical\ncoupling is a scattering map, whereby measurements carried out on the probe can\nbe interpreted as measurements of induced observables on the system. The\nlocalization of the dynamical coupling allows it to derive causal relations for\nthe induced observables. It will be discussed how this approach leads to the\nconcept of selective or non-selective system state updates conditioned on the\nresult of probe measurements, which in turn allows it to obtain conditional\nprobabilities for consecutive probe measurements consistent with relativistic\ncausality and general covariance, without the need for a physical collapse of\nthe wavefunction. In particular, the problem of impossible measurements is\nresolved.

To this end, we, in\nthis paper, propose a novel deep lifelong cross-modal hashing to achieve\nlifelong hashing retrieval instead of re-training hash function repeatedly when\nnew data arrive. Specifically, we design lifelong learning strategy to update\nhash functions by directly training the incremental data instead of retraining\nnew hash functions using all the accumulated data, which significantly reduce\ntraining time. Then, we propose lifelong hashing loss to enable original hash\ncodes participate in lifelong learning but remain invariant, and further\npreserve the similarity and dis-similarity among original and incremental hash\ncodes to maintain performance. Additionally, considering distribution\nheterogeneity when new data arriving continuously, we introduce multi-label\nsemantic similarity to supervise hash learning, and it has been proven that the\nsimilarity improves performance with detailed analysis. Experimental results on\nbenchmark datasets show that the proposed methods achieves comparative\nperformance comparing with recent state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods,\nand it yields substantial average increments over 20\\% in retrieval accuracy\nand almost reduces over 80\\% training time when new data arrives continuously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 07:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

We find that while the QP-GP rotation parameter matches the simulated\nrotation period of the star, the length scale cannot be directly connected to\nthe spot lifetimes on the stellar surface. Regarding the setup of the priors\nfor the QP-GP, we find that it can be advantageous to constrain the QP-GP\nhyperparameters in different ways depending on the application and the goal of\nthe analysis.

To improve the performance of voxel-based\nradiance field in sparse input scenarios, we propose two methods: (a) We\nintroduce an incremental voxel training strategy, which prevents overfitting by\nsuppressing the optimization of peripheral voxels in the early stage of\nreconstruction. (b) We use several regularization techniques to smooth the\nvoxels, which avoids degenerate solutions. Experiments demonstrate that VGOS\nachieves state-of-the-art performance for sparse inputs with super-fast\nconvergence.

Aims: We aim at constraining the instability mechanism in FU Orionis\nstar itself, by directly probing the size and the evolution in time of the\noutburst region with near-infrared interferometry, and to confront it to\nphysical models of this region. Methods: FU Orionis has been a regular target\nof near-infrared interferometry. In this paper, we analyze more than 20 years\nof interferometric observations to perform a temporal monitoring of the region\nof the outburst, and compare it to the spatial structure deduced from 1D MHD\nsimulations. Results: We measure from the interferometric observations that the\nsize variation of the outburst region is compatible with a constant or slightly\ndecreasing size over time in the H and K band. The temporal variation and the\nmean sizes are consistently reproduced by our 1D MHD simulations. We find that\nthe most compatible scenario is a model of an outburst occurring in a\nmagnetically layered disk, where a Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI) is\ntriggered by a Gravitational Instability (GI) at the outer edge of a dead-zone.\nThe scenario of a pure Thermal Instability (TI) fails to reproduce our\ninterferometric sizes since it can only be sustained in a very compact zone of\nthe disk <0.1 AU. The scenario of MRI-GI could be compatible with an external\nperturbation enhancing the GI, such as tidal interactions with a stellar\ncompanion, or a planet at the outer edge of the dead-zone. Conclusions: The\nlayered disk model driven by MRI turbulence is favored to interpret the spatial\nstructure and temporal evolution of FU Orionis outburst region. Understanding\nthis phase gives a crucial link between the early phase of disk evolution and\nthe process of planet formation in the first inner AUs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 09:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

While a similarity metric\ncan provide client groups with specialized models according to their data\ndistribution, this process can be time-consuming because the server needs to\ncapture all data distribution first from all clients to perform the correct\nclustering. Due to resource and time constraints at the network edge, only a\nfraction of devices {is} selected every round, necessitating the need for an\nefficient scheduling technique to address these issues. Thus, this paper\nintroduces a two-phased client selection and scheduling approach to improve the\nconvergence speed while capturing all data distributions. This approach ensures\ncorrect clustering and fairness between clients by leveraging bandwidth reuse\nfor participants spent a longer time training their models and exploiting the\nheterogeneity in the devices to schedule the participants according to their\ndelay. The server then performs the clustering depending on predetermined\nthresholds and stopping criteria. When a specified cluster approximates a\nstopping point, the server employs a greedy selection for that cluster by\npicking the devices with lower delay and better resources. The convergence\nanalysis is provided, showing the relationship between the proposed scheduling\napproach and the convergence rate of the specialized models to obtain\nconvergence bounds under non-i.i.d. data distribution.

Ideally, an RL agent that generally masters a task\nshould reach its goal starting from any controllable state of the environment\ninstead of memorizing a small set of trajectories. For example, a self-driving\nsystem should be able to take over the control from humans in the middle of\ndriving and must continue to drive the car safely. To practically evaluate this\ntype of generalization, we start the test agent from the middle of other\nindependently well-trained \\emph{stranger} agents' trajectories. With extensive\nexperimental evaluation, we show the prevalence of \\emph{generalization\nfailure} on controllable states from stranger agents. For example, in the\nHumanoid environment, we observed that a well-trained Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) agent, with only 3.9\\% failure rate during regular testing,\nfailed on 81.6\\% of the states generated by well-trained stranger PPO agents.\nTo improve \"relay generalization,\" we propose a novel method called\nSelf-Trajectory Augmentation (STA), which will reset the environment to the\nagent's old states according to the Q function during training. After applying\nSTA to the Soft Actor Critic's (SAC) training procedure, we reduced the failure\nrate of SAC under relay-evaluation by more than three times in most settings\nwithout impacting agent performance and increasing the needed number of\nenvironment interactions.

The multiple harmonic balance (MHB) method\nis one of the most commonly used approaches for such problems. However, it is\nlimited by low-order estimations due to complex symbolic operations in\npractical uses. Many variants have been developed to improve the MHB method,\namong which the time domain MHB-like methods are regarded as crucial\nimprovements because of their high efficiency and simple derivation. But there\nis still one main drawback remaining to be addressed. The time domain MHB-like\nmethods negatively suffer from non-physical solutions, which have been shown to\nbe caused by aliasing (mixtures of the high-order into the low-order\nharmonics). Inspired by the collocation-based harmonic balancing framework\nrecently established by our group, we herein propose a reconstruction multiple\nharmonic balance (RMHB) method to reconstruct the conventional MHB method using\ndiscrete time domain collocations. Our study shows that the relation between\nthe MHB and time domain MHB-like methods is determined by an aliasing matrix,\nwhich is non-zero when aliasing occurs. On this basis, a conditional\nequivalence is established to form the RMHB method. Three numerical examples\ndemonstrate that this new method is more robust and efficient than the\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 11:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

In this\npaper, we are particularly concerned with thwarting CRAs and SCAs against\nembedded devices, while taking into account their resource limitations.\nFine-grained code diversification can hinder CRAs by introducing uncertainty to\nthe binary code; while software mechanisms can thwart timing or power SCAs.

Thus, we create a\nnew meta computing architecture composed of multiple meta computers, each of\nwhich integrates the resources in a small-scale network. To make meta computing\nwidely applied in society, the service quality and user experience of meta\ncomputing cannot be ignored. Consider a meta computing system providing\nservices for users by scheduling meta computers, how to choose from multiple\nmeta computers to achieve maximum Quality-of-Experience (QoE) with limited\nbudgets especially when the true expected QoE of each meta computer is not\nknown as a priori?

To determine a scheduling strategy that can\nmaximize the total QoE utility under a limited budget, we propose an upper\nconfidence bound (UCB) based algorithm and model the utility of service by\nusing a concave function of total QoE to characterize the marginal utility in\nthe real world.

Phononic radiation have been proposed as the source of the engine's\nenergy, though other hypotheses, such as quantum vacuum fluctuations, should\nalso be examined. This paper is the first of a series which will address these\nhypotheses. Herein, we investigate the more basic hypothesis that quantum\nvacuum fluctuations power a quantum engine that converts entanglement energy\ninto useful electrical work. The system under review is composed of two\natom-level quantum dots that are tunnel-coupled and exhibit a magnetic exchange\ninteraction. This working substance is connected in series with two\nferromagnetic electrodes. The engine cycle comprises two strokes. The\nthermalizing stroke puts the system into equilibrium with the electrode baths,\nleading to a release of electrical energy into the leads and to an increase in\nthe system entropy due to entanglement. Then the measurement stroke breaks the\nentanglement between the two quantum dots, thereby reducing its entropy while\nenergizing it on average. Using a perturbative master equation approach, we\nanalytically demonstrate the efficiency of the engine, and we study the cycle\nnumerically to gain insight into the relevant parameters to maximize power.\nAlthough the possibility of harvesting energy from the quantum vacuum\nfluctuations and the interactions with the baths is proven on paper and\nconfirmed by numerical experiments, the efficiency remains low and is unstable.\nOur results indicate that quantum vacuum fluctuations alone are unlikely to be\nthe energy source in the the quantum spintronic engine experiments that have\nbeen reported thus far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 11:57:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Properties of the dual pair are formulated in terms of this\nmultiplier $V$. It acts, in a natural way, on $A\\otimes A$ as the canonical map\n$T$, given by $T(a\\otimes a')=\\Delta(a)(1\\otimes a')$. In this second paper on\nthe subject, we assume that the pairing is coming from a multiplier Hopf\n$^*$-algebra with positive integrals. In this case, the positive right integral\non $A$ can be used to construct a Hilbert space $\\mathcal H$. The duality $V$\nnow acts as a unitary operator on the Hilbert space tensor product $\\mathcal\nH\\otimes\\mathcal H$. This eventually makes it possible to complete the\nalgebraic quantum group to a locally compact quantum group. The procedure to\npass from the algebraic quantum group to the operator algebraic completion has\nbeen treated in the literature but the construction is rather involved because\nof the necessary use of left Hilbert algebras. In this paper, we give a\ncomprehensive, yet concise and somewhat simpler approach.

While\nthere has been extensive research on designing dedicated hardware accelerators\nfor GNNs, few have extensively explored the impact of the sparse storage format\non the efficiency of the GNN accelerators. This paper proposes SCV-GNN with the\nnovel sparse compressed vectors (SCV) format optimized for the aggregation\noperation. We use Z-Morton ordering to derive a data-locality-based computation\nordering and partitioning scheme. The paper also presents how the proposed\nSCV-GNN is scalable on a vector processing system. Experimental results over\nvarious datasets show that the proposed method achieves a geometric mean\nspeedup of $7.96\\times$ and $7.04\\times$ over CSC and CSR aggregation\noperations, respectively. The proposed method also reduces the memory traffic\nby a factor of $3.29\\times$ and $4.37\\times$ over compressed sparse column\n(CSC) and compressed sparse row (CSR), respectively. Thus, the proposed novel\naggregation format reduces the latency and memory access for GNN inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 13:07:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

There is a pervasive sense in the generative modeling community that\nthe various flow and diffusion-based generative models have some common\nfoundational structure and interrelationships. We establish connections between\nMFGs and major classes of flow and diffusion-based generative models including\ncontinuous-time normalizing flows, score-based models, and Wasserstein gradient\nflows. We derive these three classes of generative models through different\nchoices of particle dynamics and cost functions. Furthermore, we study the\nmathematical structure and properties of each generative model by studying\ntheir associated MFG's optimality condition, which is a set of coupled\nforward-backward nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The theory of\nMFGs, therefore, enables the study of generative models through the theory of\nnonlinear PDEs. Through this perspective, we investigate the well-posedness and\nstructure of normalizing flows, unravel the mathematical structure of\nscore-based generative modeling, and derive a mean-field game formulation of\nthe Wasserstein gradient flow. From an algorithmic perspective, the optimality\nconditions of MFGs also allow us to introduce HJB regularizers for enhanced\ntraining of a broad class of generative models. In particular, we propose and\ndemonstrate an Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman regularized SGM with improved\nperformance over standard SGMs. We present this framework as an MFG laboratory\nwhich serves as a platform for revealing new avenues of experimentation and\ninvention of generative models.

In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters\nidentified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4\n\\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching\nfor prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass\nratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many\nrespects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only\nonce, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc\nand a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of\nmagnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses\nmost of its dark matter and gas in the process. The displacement between the\ncollisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant\ntypically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception\nof the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas\ncells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these\ngas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation\nbox, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case\nthat is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented\ncases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such\nas A520 and Coma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 14:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

A key component of the SW distance is the slicing\ndistribution. There are two existing approaches for choosing this distribution.\nThe first approach is using a fixed prior distribution. The second approach is\noptimizing for the best distribution which belongs to a parametric family of\ndistributions and can maximize the expected distance. However, both approaches\nhave their limitations. A fixed prior distribution is non-informative in terms\nof highlighting projecting directions that can discriminate two general\nprobability measures. Doing optimization for the best distribution is often\nexpensive and unstable. Moreover, designing the parametric family of the\ncandidate distribution could be easily misspecified. To address the issues, we\npropose to design the slicing distribution as an energy-based distribution that\nis parameter-free and has the density proportional to an energy function of the\nprojected one-dimensional Wasserstein distance. We then derive a novel sliced\nWasserstein metric, energy-based sliced Waserstein (EBSW) distance, and\ninvestigate its topological, statistical, and computational properties via\nimportance sampling, sampling importance resampling, and Markov Chain methods.\nFinally, we conduct experiments on point-cloud gradient flow, color transfer,\nand point-cloud reconstruction to show the favorable performance of the EBSW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 14:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Currently, the\nmost common approach to survival analysis is based on Cox's partial likelihood,\nwhich can be interpreted as a ranking model optimized on a lower bound of the\nconcordance index. This relation between ranking models and Cox's partial\nlikelihood considers only pairwise comparisons. Recent work has developed\ndifferentiable sorting methods which relax this pairwise independence\nassumption, enabling the ranking of sets of samples. However, current\ndifferentiable sorting methods cannot account for censoring, a key factor in\nmany real-world datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method\ncalled Diffsurv. We extend differentiable sorting methods to handle censored\ntasks by predicting matrices of possible permutations that take into account\nthe label uncertainty introduced by censored samples. We contrast this approach\nwith methods derived from partial likelihood and ranking losses. Our\nexperiments show that Diffsurv outperforms established baselines in various\nsimulated and real-world risk prediction scenarios.

Flow-based VFI algorithms estimate intermediate\nmotion fields to warp the existent frames. Real-world motions' complexity and\nthe reference frame's absence make motion estimation challenging. Many\nstate-of-the-art approaches explicitly model the correlations between two\nneighboring frames for more accurate motion estimation. In common approaches,\nthe receptive field of correlation modeling at higher resolution depends on the\nmotion fields estimated beforehand. Such receptive field dependency makes\ncommon motion estimation approaches poor at coping with small and fast-moving\nobjects.

In the framework of\nthe invasion of a FFP, we aim to provide some new scenarios to explain the\nnumber asymmetry of the L4 and L5 Jupiter Trojans, and some other observed\nfeatures. We investigate two different cases: (i) The indirect case, where\nJupiter experiences a scattering encounter with the FFP and jumps outwards at a\nspeed that is much higher than that considered in(Li et al. 2023), resulting in\na change in the numbers of the L4 (N4) and L5 (N5) Trojans swarms. (ii) The\ndirect case, in which the FFP traverses the L5 region and affects the stability\nof the local Trojans. In the indirect case, the outward migration of Jupiter\ncan be fast enough to make the L4 islands disappear temporarily, inducing a\nresonant amplitude increase of the local Trojans. After the migration is over,\nthe L4 Trojans come back to the re-appeared and enlarged islands. As for the L5\nislands, they always exist but expand even more considerably. Since the L4\nswarm suffers less excitation in the resonant amplitude than the L5 swarm, more\nL4 Trojans are stable and could survive to the end. In the direct case, the FFP\ncould deplete a considerable fraction of the L5 Trojans, while the L4 Trojans\nat large distances are not affected and all of them could survive. Both the\nindirect and direct cases could result in a number ratio of R45=N4/N5~1.6 that\ncan potentially explain the current observations. The latter has the advantage\nof producing the observed resonant amplitude distribution. For achieving these\nresults, we propose that the FFP should have a mass of at least of a few tens\nof Earth masses and its orbital inclination is allowed to be as high as 40\ndegrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 14:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

One of the reasons why this mixture is inevitable has to do with the\nfact that we live in an era that incorporates technology in every single aspect\nof our daily lives. In the industry, this has translated into fabrication\nversatility, as follows: design changes on a final product are just one click\naway, fabrication chains have evolved towards continuous roll-to roll\nprocesses, and, most importantly, the overall costs and fabrication speeds are\nmatching and overcoming most of the traditional fabrication methods.\nLaser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) stands out as a versatile set of\nfabrication techniques, being the closest approach to an all-in-one additive\nmanufacturing method compatible with virtually any material. In this technique,\nlaser radiation is used to propel the material of interest and deposit it at\nuser-defined locations with high spatial resolution. By selecting the proper\nlaser parameters and considering the interaction of the laser light with the\nmaterial, it is possible to transfer this technique from robust inorganic\nmaterials to fragile biological samples. In this work, we first present a brief\nintroduction on the current developments of the LIFT technique by surveying\nrecent scientific review publications. Then, we provide a general research\noverview by making an account of the publication and citation numbers of\nscientific papers on the LIFT technique considering the last three decades.

Our first result is that the order\nof the Wronskian of these power series is equivalent up to a polynomial factor,\nto the maximum order which occurs in the linear combination of these power\nseries. This implies that the Wronskian approach used in (Kayal and Saha,\nTOCT'2012) to upper bound the order of sum of square roots is optimal up to a\npolynomial blowup. We also demonstrate similar upper bounds, similar to those\nof (Kayal and Saha, TOCT'2012), for the order of power series in a variety of\nother scenarios.

A recent study to incorporate such a crucial\nmechanism shows that sufficient intensity of macro-level social influence can\ncause a change from a continuous to discontinuous transition, further\nindicating the existence of a tricritical point. Although network localization\nstrength determines the tricritical point, it remains unclear what network\nquantities govern the performance of localization in regulating innovation\ndiffusion. To address this issue, we herein consider the model incorporating\nboth the micro- and macro-levels social influence. We present a dynamic\nmessage-passing method to analytically treat both the outbreak threshold and\nrecovered population, and validate the predictions through agent-based\nsimulations. Extensive analysis on the classical synthetic networks shows that\nsparsely available connections, and relatively heterogeneous degree\ndistribution, either assortative or extremely disassortative configurations are\nfavorable for continuous transition. In such cases, the employed network can\nyield a strong localization effect so that the innovation is trapped in the\nconfigurations composed of the hubs with high non-backtracking centrality. We\nfurther explore the dependence of both tricritical point and localization\nstrength on three structural quantities: network density, heterogeneity, and\nassortativity, which gives a clear physical picture of the joint effects of the\nthree structure quantities on the localization strength. Finally, we conclude\nthat the core-periphery structure, being sensitive to the change of the three\nstructure quantities, essentially determines localization strength, and further\nregulates the phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 15:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

To address this shortcoming, endoscopic\noptical coherence tomography (OCT) provides both morphological and functional\nin-vivo measurements of the middle ear. However, due to the shadow of prior\nstructures, interpretation of OCT images is challenging and time-consuming. To\nfacilitate fast diagnosis and measurement, improvement in the readability of\nOCT data is achieved by merging morphological knowledge from ex-vivo middle ear\nmodels with OCT volumetric data, so that OCT applications can be further\npromoted in daily clinical settings.

The morphology of the laser-structured areas as well as the\nredeposited debris was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and\n{\\mu}-Raman spectroscopy. To identify repetition rate ranges where heat\naccumulation is present during the irradiations, we developed a simple heat\naccumulation model that solves the heat equation in 1 dimension implementing a\nForward differencing in Time and Central differencing in Space (FTCS) scheme.\nContact angle measurements with water demonstrated the influence of heat\naccumulation and debris on the functional wetting behavior.

A\nlongstanding challenge for automatic resource analysis is the inference of\nbounds that are functions of complex custom data structures. This article\nbuilds on type-based automatic amortized resource analysis (AARA) to address\nthis challenge. AARA is based on the potential method of amortized analysis and\nreduces bound inference to standard type inference with additional linear\nconstraint solving, even when deriving non-linear bounds. A key component of\nAARA is resource functions that generate the space of possible bounds for\nvalues of a given type while enjoying necessary closure properties.\n  Existing work on AARA defined such functions for many data structures such as\nlists of lists but the question of whether such functions exist for arbitrary\ndata structures remained open. This work answers this questions positively by\nuniformly constructing resource polynomials for algebraic data structures\ndefined by regular recursive types. These functions are a generalization of all\npreviously proposed polynomial resource functions and can be seen as a general\nnotion of polynomials for values of a given recursive type. A resource type\nsystem for FPC, a core language with recursive types, demonstrates how resource\npolynomials can be integrated with AARA while preserving all benefits of past\ntechniques. The article also proposes the use of new techniques useful for\nstating the rules of this type system and proving it sound. First, multivariate\npotential annotations are stated in terms of free semimodules, substantially\nabstracting details of the presentation of annotations and the proofs of their\nproperties. Second, a logical relation giving semantic meaning to resource\ntypes enables a proof of soundness by a single induction on typing derivations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 15:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

However, it is still highly challenging to fully\nfine-tune these models for downstream tasks due to their high computational and\nstorage costs. Recently, Parameter-Efficient Tuning (PETuning) techniques,\ne.g., Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), have\nsignificantly reduced the computation and storage cost by inserting lightweight\nprompt modules into the pre-trained models and tuning these prompt modules with\na small number of trainable parameters, while keeping the transformer backbone\nfrozen. Although only a few parameters need to be adjusted, most PETuning\nmethods still require a significant amount of downstream task training data to\nachieve good results. The performance is inadequate on low-data regimes,\nespecially when there are only one or two examples per class. To this end, we\nfirst empirically identify the poor performance is mainly due to the\ninappropriate way of initializing prompt modules, which has also been verified\nin the pre-trained language models.

The barycenter point is introduced as the best position where to\nplace the negative sources. The barycenter is obtained from the spatial mean of\nthe molecules impinging on the surface of each FA receiver. This paper derives\nan expression that captures the position of the barycenter in a diffusive MC\nchannel with multiple FA receivers. In this work, an analytical model inspired\nby Newton's law of gravitation is found to describe the barycenter, and the\nresult is compared with particle-based simulation (PBS) data. Since the\nbarycenter depends on the distance between the transmitter and receiver and the\nobservation time, the condition that the barycenter can be assumed to be at the\ncenter of the receiver is discussed. This assumption simplifies further\nmodeling of any diffusive MC system containing multiple FA receivers.

Accurately\ndetecting and predicting LC processes can help traffic participants better\nunderstand their surrounding environment, recognize potential LC safety\nhazards, and improve traffic safety. This present paper focuses on LC\nprocesses, developing an LC intention recognition (LC-IR) model and an LC\nstatus prediction (LC-SP) model. A novel ensemble temporal convolutional\nnetwork with Long Short-Term Memory units (TCN-LSTM) is first proposed to\ncapture long-range dependencies in sequential data. Then, three multi-task\nmodels (MTL-LSTM, MTL-TCN, MTL-TCN -LSTM) are developed to capture the\nintrinsic relationship among output indicators. Furthermore, a unified modeling\nframework for LC intention recognition and driving status prediction (LC-IR-SP)\nis developed. To validate the performance of the proposed models, a total\nnumber of 1023 vehicle trajectories is extracted from the CitySim dataset. The\nPearson coefficient is employed to determine the related indicators. The\nresults indicate that using150 frames as input length, the TCN-LSTM model with\n96.67% accuracy outperforms TCN and LSTM models in LC intention classification\nand provides more balanced results for each class. Three proposed multi-tasking\nlearning models provide markedly increased performance compared to\ncorresponding single-task models, with an average reduction of 24.24% and\n22.86% in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE),\nrespectively.

It can significantly reduce the requirement of large amounts of\ntask-specific data by sufficiently sharing medical knowledge among different\ntasks. However, due to the challenges of designing strongly generalizable\nmodels with limited and complex medical data, most existing approaches tend to\ndevelop task-specific models. To take a step towards MAGI, we propose a new\nparadigm called Medical-knOwledge-enhanced mulTimOdal pretRaining (MOTOR). In\nMOTOR, we combine two kinds of basic medical knowledge, i.e., general and\nspecific knowledge, in a complementary manner to boost the general pretraining\nprocess.

In this work, we have taken four one-dimensional quantum\nmechanical models: two Inverted Harmonic Oscillators(IHOs), a triple Well and\nIHO with a plateau. Then we spontaneously break the already existing symmetry\nin their Hamiltonian with varying perturbation strength to bring anomaly into\nthe system.

Once a target location has been reached, drones do not have to\nremain active during the mission. It is possible for the vehicle to perch and\nstop its motors in such situations to conserve energy, as well as maintain a\nstatic position in unfavorable flying conditions. In the perching target\nestimation phase, the steady and accuracy of a visual camera with markers is a\nsignificant challenge. It is rapidly detectable from afar when using a large\nmarker, but when the drone approaches, it quickly disappears as out of camera\nview. In this paper, a vision-based target poses estimation method using\nmultiple markers is proposed to deal with the above-mentioned problems. First,\na perching target with a small marker inside a larger one is designed to\nimprove detection capability at wide and close ranges. Second, the relative\nposes of the flying vehicle are calculated from detected markers using a\nmonocular camera. Next, a Kalman filter is applied to provide a more stable and\nreliable pose estimation, especially when the measurement data is missing due\nto unexpected reasons. Finally, we introduced an algorithm for merging the\nposes data from multi markers. The poses are then sent to the position\ncontroller to align the drone and the marker's center and steer it to perch on\nthe target. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and\nfeasibility of the adopted approach. The drone can perch successfully onto the\ncenter of the markers with the attached 25mm-diameter rounded magnet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 16:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

It is an issue of major concern. The steep rise in the\nnumber of automobiles on the roads followed by old infrastructure, accidents,\npedestrian traffic, and traffic rule violations all add to challenging traffic\nconditions. Given these poor conditions of traffic, there is a critical need\nfor automatically detecting and signaling systems. There are already various\ntechnologies that are used for traffic management and signaling systems like\nvideo analysis, infrared sensors, and wireless sensors. The main issue with\nthese methods is they are very costly and high maintenance is required. In this\npaper, we have proposed a three-phase system that can guide emergency vehicles\nand manage traffic based on the degree of congestion. In the first phase, the\nsystem processes the captured images and calculates the Index value which is\nused to discover the degree of congestion. The Index value of a particular road\ndepends on its width and the length up to which the camera captures images of\nthat road. We have to take input for the parameters (length and width) while\nsetting up the system. In the second phase, the system checks whether there are\nany emergency vehicles present or not in any lane. In the third phase, the\nwhole processing and decision-making part is performed at the edge server. The\nproposed model is robust and it takes into consideration adverse weather\nconditions such as hazy, foggy, and windy. It works very efficiently in low\nlight conditions also. The edge server is a strategically placed server that\nprovides us with low latency and better connectivity. Using Edge technology in\nthis traffic management system reduces the strain on cloud servers and the\nsystem becomes more reliable in real-time because the latency and bandwidth get\nreduced due to processing at the intermediate edge server.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 15:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 11:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}
