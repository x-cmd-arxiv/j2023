The key to\naddressing the CTR task is learning feature interactions that are useful for\nprediction, which is typically achieved by fitting historical click data with\nthe Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) paradigm. Representative methods include\nFactorization Machines and Deep Interest Network, which have achieved wide\nsuccess in industrial applications. However, such a manner inevitably learns\nunstable feature interactions, i.e., the ones that exhibit strong correlations\nin historical data but generalize poorly for future serving. In this work, we\nreformulate the CTR task -- instead of pursuing ERM on historical data, we\nsplit the historical data chronologically into several periods (a.k.a,\nenvironments), aiming to learn feature interactions that are stable across\nperiods. Such feature interactions are supposed to generalize better to predict\nfuture behavior data. Nevertheless, a technical challenge is that existing\ninvariant learning solutions like Invariant Risk Minimization are not\napplicable, since the click data entangles both environment-invariant and\nenvironment-specific correlations. To address this dilemma, we propose\nDisentangled Invariant Learning (DIL) which disentangles feature embeddings to\ncapture the two types of correlations separately. To improve the modeling\nefficiency, we further design LightDIL which performs the disentanglement at\nthe higher level of the feature field. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of DIL in learning stable feature interactions for CTR.

Our simulation study shows better clustering\nperformances of (i) models calibrated by maximising our consensus score\ncompared to existing calibration scores, and (ii) weighted compared to\nunweighted approaches in the presence of features that do not contribute to\ncluster definition.

An analytical relationship\nbetween the amplitude modulation coefficient and IOIM parameters is derived,\nwhich is shown to capture the increasing trend of the amplitude modulation\ncoefficient with an increasing Reynolds number in a smooth-wall dataset. This\nrelationship is then applied to classify and interpret the non-canonical\nturbulent boundary layer results reported in previous works. We further present\nthe case study of a turbulent boundary layer after a rough-to-smooth change.\nBoth single-probe and two-probe hotwire measurements are performed to acquire\nstreamwise velocity time series in the recovering flow on the downstream smooth\nwall. An increased coherence between the large-scale motions and the\nsmall-scale envelope in the near-wall region is attributed to the stronger\nfootprints of the over-energetic large-scale motions in the outer layer,\nwhereas the near-wall cycle and its amplitude sensitivity to the superposed\nstructures are similar to that of a canonical smooth-wall flow.

We investigate dust attenuation of 122 heavily dust-obscured galaxies\ndetected with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and Herschel in the\nCOSMOS field.

Methods. We make use of the extensive\nphotometric coverage of the COSMOS data combined with highly-resolved dust\ncontinuum maps from ALMA. We use CIGALE to estimate various physical properties\nof these dusty objects, mainly their SFR, their stellar masses and their\nattenuation.

We use these radii to investigate the relative\ncompactness of the dust continuum and the extension of the rest-frame\nUV/optical Re(y)/Re(ALMA). Results. We find that the physical parameters\ncalculated from our models strongly depend on the assumption of dust\nattenuation curve. As expected, the most impacted parameter is the stellar\nmass, which leads to a change in the \"starburstiness\" of the objects. We find\nthat taking into account the relative compactness of star-to-dust emission\nprior to SED fitting is crucial, especially when studying dust attenuation of\ndusty star-forming galaxies. Shallower attenuation curves did not show a clear\npreference of compactness with attenuation, while the Calzetti attenuation\ncurve preferred comparable spatial extent of unattenuated stellar light and\ndust emission.

To enable fine-grained controllability, however, text-based\nmodels require long prompts, whose details may be ignored by the model. On the\nother hand, layout-based conditional models have also witnessed significant\nadvances. These models rely on bounding boxes or segmentation maps for precise\nspatial conditioning in combination with coarse semantic labels. The semantic\nlabels, however, cannot be used to express detailed appearance characteristics.\nIn this paper, we approach fine-grained scene controllability through image\ncollages which allow a rich visual description of the desired scene as well as\nthe appearance and location of the objects therein, without the need of class\nnor attribute labels. We introduce \"mixing and matching scenes\" (M&Ms), an\napproach that consists of an adversarially trained generative image model which\nis conditioned on appearance features and spatial positions of the different\nelements in a collage, and integrates these into a coherent image. We train our\nmodel on the OpenImages (OI) dataset and evaluate it on collages derived from\nOI and MS-COCO datasets. Our experiments on the OI dataset show that M&Ms\noutperforms baselines in terms of fine-grained scene controllability while\nbeing very competitive in terms of image quality and sample diversity. On the\nMS-COCO dataset, we highlight the generalization ability of our model by\noutperforming DALL-E in terms of the zero-shot FID metric, despite using two\nmagnitudes fewer parameters and data. Collage based generative models have the\npotential to advance content creation in an efficient and effective way as they\nare intuitive to use and yield high quality generations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 17:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

We find two broad classes of\nnon-Hermitian edge states: (1) Infernal points, where a skin effect occurs only\nat a single edge momentum, while all other edge momenta are devoid of edge\nstates. Under semi-infinite boundary conditions, the point gap thereby closes\ncompletely, but only at a single edge momentum. (2) Non-Hermitian exceptional\npoint dispersions, where edge states persist at all edge momenta and furnish an\nanomalous number of symmetry-protected exceptional points.

However, for complex geometries, the accuracy of SEM\noften degrades due to a combination of geometric inaccuracies near curved\nboundaries and the loss of superconvergence with simplicial or\nnon-tensor-product elements. We propose to overcome the first issue by using\n$h$- and $p$-geometric refinement, to refine the mesh near high-curvature\nregions and increase the degree of geometric basis functions, respectively. We\nshow that when using mixed-meshes with tensor-product elements in the interior\nof the domain, curvature-based geometric refinement near boundaries can improve\nthe accuracy of the interior elements by reducing pollution errors and\npreserving the superconvergence.

Offline goal-conditioned\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms promise to learn from sub-optimal data,\nbut face optimization challenges especially with high-dimensional data. To\nbridge the gap between IL and RL, we introduce Distance Weighted Supervised\nLearning or DWSL, a supervised method for learning goal-conditioned policies\nfrom offline data. DWSL models the entire distribution of time-steps between\nstates in offline data with only supervised learning, and uses this\ndistribution to approximate shortest path distances.

Building on C-WLT, we introduce a zero-shot approach for WSD,\ntested on 18 languages from the XL-WSD dataset. Our method outperforms fully\nsupervised baselines on recall for many evaluation languages without additional\ntraining or finetuning. This study presents a first step towards understanding\nhow to best leverage the cross-lingual knowledge inside PLMs for robust\nzero-shot reasoning in any language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 19:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes\nand cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations.

While modern two-sample tests, such as the edge count test and its\nvariants, can handle multivariate and non-Euclidean data, contemporary\ngargantuan datasets often exhibit heterogeneity due to the presence of latent\nsubpopulations. Direct application of these tests, without regulating for such\nheterogeneity, may lead to incorrect statistical decisions. We develop a new\nnonparametric testing procedure that accurately detects differences between the\ntwo samples in the presence of unknown heterogeneity in the data generation\nprocess. Our framework handles this latent heterogeneity through a composite\nnull that entertains the possibility that the two samples arise from a mixture\ndistribution with identical component distributions but with possibly different\nmixing weights. In this regime, we study the asymptotic behavior of weighted\nedge count test statistic and show that it can be effectively re-calibrated to\ndetect arbitrary deviations from the composite null. For practical\nimplementation we propose a Bootstrapped Weighted Edge Count test which\ninvolves a bootstrap-based calibration procedure that can be easily implemented\nacross a wide range of heterogeneous regimes. A comprehensive simulation study\nand an application to detecting aberrant user behaviors in online games\ndemonstrates the excellent non-asymptotic performance of the proposed test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 22:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

Models such as DALL-E and Stable Diffusion\nhave become increasingly popular and successful at creating images from texts,\noften combining abstract ideas. However, like other deep learning models, they\nalso reflect social biases they inherit from their training data, which is\noften crawled from the internet. Manually auditing models for biases can be\nvery time and resource consuming and is further complicated by the unbounded\nand unconstrained nature of inputs these models can take. Research into bias\nmeasurement and quantification has generally focused on small single-stage\nmodels working on a single modality. Thus the emergence of multistage\nmultimodal models requires a different approach. In this paper, we propose\nMultimodal Composite Association Score (MCAS) as a new method of measuring\ngender bias in multimodal generative models. Evaluating both DALL-E 2 and\nStable Diffusion using this approach uncovered the presence of gendered\nassociations of concepts embedded within the models.

The working electrolyte was based on lactate-C media along with\nan inocula consisting of Oleidesulfovibrio alaskensis strain G20 and\nCitrobacter sp. strain MIC21. Passivating effect of the co-cultured biofilm\nmatrix was observed in the form of an ennoblement effect. Tests based on\nsequencing, microscopy, and spectroscopy revealed the formation of a compact\nbiofilm matrix dominated by strain MIC21 cells, exopolymers, and insoluble\nprecipitates. This matrix displayed elastic modulus (a measure of rigidity) as\nhigh as 0.8 Gpa and increased corrosion resistance by ~10-fold. Interestingly,\nstrain MIC21 has the capacity to inhibit the undesirable growth of aggressive\nstrain G20. Additional corrosion tests also substantiated the passivation\neffects of strain MIC21. We provide mechanistic insight into the underlying\nreasons responsible for corrosion prevention behavior of the biofilm matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 23:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

Assuming a star formation efficiency of\n$\\epsilon_* \\sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to\n$2\\sigma$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$.

Indeed, it is known that QSAT remains\nPSPACE-complete even when restricted to instances with constant treewidth of\nthe primal graph, but the problem admits a double-exponential fixed-parameter\nalgorithm parameterized by the vertex cover number (primal graph). However,\nprior works have left a gap in our understanding of the complexity of QSAT when\nviewed from the perspective of other natural representations of instances, most\nnotably via incidence graphs. In this paper, we develop structure-aware\nreductions which allow us to obtain essentially tight lower bounds for highly\nrestricted instances of QSAT, including instances whose incidence graphs have\nbounded treedepth or feedback vertex number. We complement these lower bounds\nwith novel algorithms for QSAT which establish a nearly-complete picture of the\nproblem's complexity under standard graph-theoretic parameterizations. We also\nshow implications for other natural graph representations, and obtain novel\nupper as well as lower bounds for QSAT under more fine-grained\nparameterizations of the primal graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 00:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

This approach is\ndemonstrated on strain-rate-sensitive soft materials. This model is based on\nthe viscous dissipation-based visco-hyperelasticity framework where the total\nstress is decomposed into volumetric, isochoric hyperelastic, and isochoric\nviscous overstress contributions. It is shown that each of these stress\ncomponents can be written as linear combinations of the components of an\nirreducible integrity basis. Three Gaussian process regression-based surrogate\nmodels are trained (one per stress component) between principal invariants of\nstrain and strain rate tensors and the corresponding coefficients of the\nintegrity basis components. It is demonstrated that this type of model\nconstruction enforces key physics-based constraints on the predicted responses:\nthe second law of thermodynamics, the principles of local action and\ndeterminism, objectivity, the balance of angular momentum, an assumed reference\nstate, isotropy, and limited memory. The three surrogate models that constitute\nour constitutive model are evaluated by training them on small-size numerically\ngenerated data sets corresponding to a single deformation mode and then\nanalyzing their predictions over a much wider testing regime comprising\nmultiple deformation modes. Our physics-informed data-driven constitutive model\npredictions are compared with the corresponding predictions of classical\ncontinuum thermodynamics-based and purely data-driven models.

While it is possible to achieve accurate\npredictions using direct solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations,\napplications of such solvers is not feasible in design optimization due to the\nhigh cost of resolving wave phenomena in an Eulerian setting. In this work, we\npropose a technique for highly accelerated predictions of aeroacoustic response\nusing a data-driven model reduction approach based on the eigensystem\nrealization algorithm (ERA), as a non-intrusive balanced truncation method.\nSpecifically, we create and compare ERA ROMs based on the training data\ngenerated by solving the linearized and nonlinear Euler equations with Gaussian\npulse inputs, and use them for prediction of the aeroacoustic response of an\nairfoil subject to different types of gust loading. The results show that both\nROMs are in good agreement with the full-order model (FOM) solution in a purely\npredictive setting, while achieving orders of magnitude reduction in the online\ncomputation time. Using ERA for prediction of the acoustic response requires\nactivating each input channel separately in the FOM for training ROMs, and\noperating on a large Hankel matrix, that can become computationally infeasible.\nWe address this bottleneck in two steps: first, we propose a multi-fidelity\ngappy POD method to identify the most impactful input channels based on a\ncoarser grid. Therefore, we reduce the computation cost on the FOM and ROM\nlevels as we build the Markov sequence by querying the high-resolution FOM only\nfor the input channels identified by gappy POD. Second, we use tangential\ninterpolation at the ROM level to reduce the size of the Hankel matrix. The\nproposed methods enable application of ERA for highly accurate online acoustic\nresponse prediction and reduce the offline computation cost of ROMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 00:56:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 17:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

In this\nwork, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we\nsystematically investigate the electronic structures of superconducting K3C60\nthin films. We observe a dispersive energy band crossing the Fermi level with\nan occupied bandwidth of about 130 meV. The measured band structure shows\nprominent quasiparticle kinks and a replica band involving high-energy\nJahn-Teller active Hg(8) phonon mode, reflecting strong electron-phonon\ncoupling in the system. The electron-phonon coupling constant is estimated to\nbe about 1.2, which dominates the quasiparticle mass renormalization. Moreover,\nwe observe an isotropic nodeless superconducting gap beyond the mean-field\nestimation. Both the large electron-phonon coupling constant and large reduced\nsuperconducting gap suggest a strong-coupling superconductivity in K3C60, while\nthe electronic correlation effect is indicated by the observation of a\nwaterfall-like band dispersion and the small bandwidth compared with the\neffective Coulomb interaction. Our results not only directly visualize the\ncrucial band structure of superconducting fulleride but also provide important\ninsights into the mechanism of the unusual superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 01:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

In this paper, we show how causal\ntemporal primitives like delay, triggering, and sorting inherent in the AER\nprotocol itself can be exploited for scalable neuromorphic computing using our\nproposed technique called Time-to-Event Margin Propagation (TEMP). The proposed\nTEMP-based AER architecture is fully asynchronous and relies on interconnect\ndelays for memory and computing as opposed to conventional and local\nmultiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. We show that the time-based encoding\nin the TEMP neural network produces a spatio-temporal representation that can\nencode a large number of discriminatory patterns. As a proof-of-concept, we\nshow that a trained TEMP-based convolutional neural network (CNN) can\ndemonstrate an accuracy greater than 99% on the MNIST dataset.

Nevertheless, DNN models have proven to be\nvulnerable to adversarial digital and physical attacks. To mitigate this issue,\nseveral detection frameworks have been proposed to detect whether a single\ninput image has been manipulated by adversarial digital noise or not. In our\nprior work, we proposed a real-time detector, called VisionGuard (VG), for\nadversarial physical attacks against single input images to DNN models.\nBuilding upon that work, we propose VisionGuard* (VG), which couples VG with\nmajority-vote methods, to detect adversarial physical attacks in time-series\nimage data, e.g., videos. This is motivated by autonomous systems applications\nwhere images are collected over time using onboard sensors for decision-making\npurposes. We emphasize that majority-vote mechanisms are quite common in\nautonomous system applications (among many other applications), as e.g., in\nautonomous driving stacks for object detection. In this paper, we investigate,\nboth theoretically and experimentally, how this widely used mechanism can be\nleveraged to enhance the performance of adversarial detectors. We have\nevaluated VG* on videos of both clean and physically attacked traffic signs\ngenerated by a state-of-the-art robust physical attack. We provide extensive\ncomparative experiments against detectors that have been designed originally\nfor out-of-distribution data and digitally attacked images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 02:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

The model\nexhibits a crossover transition of pion condensations from the\nBose-Einstein-Condensation regime at low density to the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime at high density. The EOS stiffens quickly and\napproaches the quark matter regime at density significantly less than the\ndensity for pions to spatially overlap. The sound velocity develops a peak in\nthe crossover region, and then gradually relaxes to the conformal value $1/3$\nfrom above, in contrast to the perturbative QCD results which predicts the\napproach from below. In the context of QCD computations, this opposite trend is\nin part due to the lack of gluon exchanges in our model, and also due to the\nnon-perturbative power corrections arising from the condensates. We argue that\nwith large power corrections the trace anomaly can be negative.

REAVL has two core components: a knowledge retriever that\nretrieves knowledge given multi-modal data, and a knowledge-augmented model\nthat fuses multi-modal data and knowledge. By novelly unifying four\nknowledge-aware self-supervised tasks, REAVL promotes the mutual integration of\nmulti-modal data and knowledge by fusing explicit knowledge with\nvision-language pairs for masked multi-modal data modeling and KG relational\nreasoning. Empirical experiments show that REAVL achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance uniformly on knowledge-based vision-language understanding and\nmultimodal entity linking tasks, and competitive results on general\nvision-language tasks while only using 0.2% pre-training data of the best\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 02:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

We first build an\napproximate model by assigning weights to historical samples. However, due to\ndecision-dependent effects, the resulting approximate model is complicated and\nunable to solve directly. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of\napproximate gradients and design an Approximate Gradient Descent (AGD)\nalgorithm. We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithm in both convex\nand non-convex settings, which correspond to the newsvendor pricing model and\nits variants respectively. Finally, we perform numerical experiment on both\nsimulated and real-world dataset to demonstrate the efficiency and\neffectiveness of the AGD algorithm. We find that the AGD algorithm can converge\nto the local maximum provided that the approximation is effective. We also\nillustrate the significance of two characteristics: distribution-free and\ndecision-dependent of our model. Consideration of the decision-dependent effect\nis necessary for approximation, and the distribution-free model is preferred\nwhen there is little information on the demand distribution and how demand\nreacts to the pricing decision.

This paper introduces a time-based nonlinear control method that\nachieves accurate global-position tracking (GPT) for multi-domain bipedal\nwalking. Deriving a tracking controller for bipedal robots is challenging due\nto the highly complex robot dynamics that are time-varying and hybrid,\nespecially for multi-domain walking that involves multiple phases/domains of\nfull actuation, over actuation, and underactuation. To tackle this challenge,\nwe introduce a continuous-phase GPT control law for multi-domain walking, which\nprovably ensures the exponential convergence of the entire error state within\nthe full and over actuation domains and that of the directly regulated error\nstate within the underactuation domain. We then construct sufficient\nmultiple-Lyapunov stability conditions for the hybrid multi-domain tracking\nerror system under the proposed GPT control law. We illustrate the proposed\ncontroller design through both three-domain walking with all motors activated\nand two-domain gait with inactive ankle motors. Simulations of a ROBOTIS OP3\nbipedal humanoid robot demonstrate the satisfactory accuracy and convergence\nrate of the proposed control approach under two different cases of multi-domain\nwalking as well as various walking speeds and desired paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 03:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

The second stage\ncontrols the power generation and voltage magnitudes of voltage-controlled\nbuses in response to VRE uncertainty, and the third stage reacts to N-k\ncontingencies additionally by line switching and load shedding. The VRE and N-k\ncontingencies, considering different availability of their probability\ndistributions, are tackled by stochastic and distributionally robust\noptimization, respectively. By adopting stage-wise realization of uncertainties\nin VRE and contingencies, the associated corrective controls with different\nmechanisms can be handled separately and properly, which makes the proposed OTS\nmodel more realistic than existing two-stage ones.

This\npaper presents a novel approach to address the two types of overfitting issues\nby uncovering common forgery features. Specifically, we first propose a\ndisentanglement framework that decomposes image information into three distinct\ncomponents: forgery-irrelevant, method-specific forgery, and common forgery\nfeatures. To ensure the decoupling of method-specific and common forgery\nfeatures, a multi-task learning strategy is employed, including a multi-class\nclassification that predicts the category of the forgery method and a binary\nclassification that distinguishes the real from the fake. Additionally, a\nconditional decoder is designed to utilize forgery features as a condition\nalong with forgery-irrelevant features to generate reconstructed images.\nFurthermore, a contrastive regularization technique is proposed to encourage\nthe disentanglement of the common and specific forgery features.

Currently, many multi-modal fusion methods have\nbeen proposed to improve segmentation accuracy, such as fusing RGB and depth\nimages. However, we find that when fusing two modals of data with untrustworthy\nfeatures, the performance of multi-modal networks could be degraded, even lower\nthan those using a single modality. In this paper, the untrustworthy features\nrefer to those extracted from regions (e.g., far objects that are beyond the\ndepth measurement range) with invalid depth data (i.e., 0 pixel value) in depth\nimages. The untrustworthy features can confuse the segmentation results, and\nhence lead to inferior results. To provide a solution to this issue, we propose\nthe Adaptive-Mask Fusion Network (AMFNet) by introducing adaptive-weight masks\nin the fusion module to fuse features from RGB and depth images with\ninconsistency. In addition, we release a large-scale RGB-depth dataset with\nmanually-labeled ground truth based on the NPO dataset for drivable roads and\nnegative obstacles segmentation.

This simple,\nbasic property is captured by the so called triboelectric series, where PTFE\nranks extremely high, and that qualitatively orders materials in terms of their\nability to electrostatically charge upon contact and rubbing. However, while\nclassifying materials, the series does not provide an explanation of their\ntriboelectric strength, besides a loose correlation with the workfunction.\nIndeed, despite being an extremely familiar process, known from centuries,\ntribocharging is still elusive and not fully understood.

We study how charge transfers when pristine or defective PTFE is put\nin contact with different clean and oxidised metals.

However, medical image datasets are often low in sample\nsize and only partially labeled, i.e., only a subset of organs are annotated.\nTherefore, it is crucial to investigate how to learn a unified model on the\navailable partially labeled datasets to leverage their synergistic potential.\nIn this paper, we empirically and systematically study the partial-label\nsegmentation with in-depth analyses on the existing approaches and identify\nthree distinct types of supervision signals, including two signals derived from\nground truth and one from pseudo label. We propose a novel training framework\ntermed COSST, which effectively and efficiently integrates comprehensive\nsupervision signals with self-training.

In such real-world\napplications, algorithms working in floating-point arithmetic are used for\ncomputing matrix functions and additionally, input data might be unreliable,\ne.g., due to measurement errors. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the\nsensitivity of matrix functions to perturbations, which is measured by\ncondition numbers. However, the condition number itself might not be computed\nexactly as well due to round-off and errors in the input. The sensitivity of\nthe condition number is measured by the so-called level-2 condition number. For\nthe usual (level-1) condition number, it is well-known that structured\ncondition numbers (i.e., where only perturbations are taken into account that\npreserve the structure of the input matrix) might be much smaller than\nunstructured ones, which, e.g., suggests that structure-preserving algorithms\nfor matrix functions might yield much more accurate results than\ngeneral-purpose algorithms. In this work, we examine structured level-2\ncondition numbers in the particular case of restricting the perturbation matrix\nto an automorphism group, a Lie or Jordan algebra or the space of\nquasi-triangular matrices. In numerical experiments, we then compare the\nunstructured level-2 condition number with the structured one for some specific\nmatrix functions such as the matrix logarithm, matrix square root, and matrix\nexponential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 10:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

To bridge this\ngap, this paper presents the first mathematically rigorous definitions of key\nXAI notions and processes, using the well-funded formalism of Category theory.\nWe show that our categorical framework allows to: (i) model existing learning\nschemes and architectures, (ii) formally define the term ``explanation'', (iii)\nestablish a theoretical basis for XAI taxonomies, and (iv) analyze commonly\noverlooked aspects of explaining methods.

The spectral sub-type\nis one of the parameters that is used for the characterization and it is\ntraditionally derived from the observed spectra. However, obtaining the spectra\nof M dwarfs is expensive in terms of observation time and resources due to\ntheir intrinsic faintness. We study the performance of four machine-learning\n(ML) models: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Probabilistic Random\nForest (PRF), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), in identifying the spectral\nsub-types of M dwarfs at a grand scale by deploying broadband photometry in the\noptical and near-infrared. We trained the ML models by using the\nspectroscopically identified M dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data\nRelease (SDSS) 7, together with their photometric colors that were derived from\nthe SDSS, Two-Micron All-Sky Survey, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer.\nWe found that the RF, PRF, and MLP give a comparable prediction accuracy, 74%,\nwhile the KNN provides slightly lower accuracy, 71%.

The five most useful features for the prediction are r-z, r-i,\nr-J, r-H, and g-z, and hence lacking data in all SDSS bands substantially\nreduces the prediction accuracy. However, we can achieve an accuracy of over\n70% when the r and i magnitudes are available. Since the stars in this study\nare nearby (d~1300 pc for 95% of the stars), the dust extinction can reduce the\nprediction accuracy by only 3%.

The High Resolution Telescope (HRT) of the\nPolarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) on board the Solar Orbiter\nacquired a high-cadence data set of an active region.

The leading sunspot shows a linear dependence of the phase lag on\nthe angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight of the observer in\nits penumbra. The magnetic pore exhibits global resonances at several\nfrequencies, which are also excited by different wave modes.

A common method to\ngenerate such subspace is the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. This projection\nstrategy is intrusive since it assumes that the approximation model used to\nsolve the high fidelity flow problem is known and accessible. In the present\narticle, we propose a non-intrusive paradigm based on Machine Learning to build\nClosed Parametric Reduced Order Models (ML-PROM) relevant to fluid dynamics.\nWith no prior knowledge requirement of the approximation model, this method is\npurely data-driven as it operates directly on data regardless their origin,\nDNS, RANS simulations or experiment. The key idea to build the ML-CPROM is to\nuse the generally known form of Galerkin ROMs and assimilate the time\nvariations of the temporal POD modes to a nonlinear quadratic form taking a\nclosure right hand side member. This last term is introduced to account for\nuncaptured dynamics due to data noise, POD truncation errors and time\nintegration schemes. For parameter variation, the ML-CPROM is updated by\ninterpolation on the quotient manifold of the set of fixed rank matrices by the\northogonal group. The predicted closure term is afterwards calculated by a\nLong-Short-Term-Memory neural network. We assess the potential of the proposed\napproach on the parametric examples of the lid-driven cavity flow and the flow\npast a cylinder by varying the Reynolds number through the viscosity, and the\nAhmed-Body flow by varying the geometry through the rear slant angle.

However, the space-inefficiency of methods that use point-wise\nrepresentations limits their development and usage in practical applications.\nIn particular, scan-submap matching and global map representation methods are\nrestricted by the inefficiency of nearest neighbor searching (NNS) for\nlarge-volume point clouds. To improve space-time efficiency, we propose a novel\nmethod of describing scenes using quadric surfaces, which are far more compact\nrepresentations of 3D objects than conventional point clouds. In contrast to\npoint cloud-based methods, our quadric representation-based method decomposes a\n3D scene into a collection of sparse quadric patches, which improves storage\nefficiency and avoids the slow point-wise NNS process. Our method first\nsegments a given point cloud into patches and fits each of them to a quadric\nimplicit function. Each function is then coupled with other geometric\ndescriptors of the patch, such as its center position and covariance matrix.\nCollectively, these patch representations fully describe a 3D scene, which can\nbe used in place of the original point cloud and employed in LiDAR odometry,\nmapping and localization algorithms. We further design a novel incremental\ngrowing method for quadric representations, which eliminates the need to\nrepeatedly re-fit quadric surfaces from the original point cloud. Extensive\nodometry, mapping and localization experiments on large-volume point clouds in\nthe KITTI and UrbanLoco datasets demonstrate that our method maintains low\nlatency and memory utility while achieving competitive, and even superior,\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 13:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

The clumpy structure hampers wind mass-loss estimates, limiting our\nunderstanding of massive star evolution. The wind structure also impacts\naccretion in high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) systems. We analyse the\nwavelength-dependent variability of X-ray absorption in the wind to study its\nstructure. Such an approach is possible in HMXBs, where the compact object\nserves as an X-ray backlight. We probe different parts of the wind by analysing\ndata taken at superior and inferior conjunction. We apply excess variance\nspectroscopy to study the wavelength-dependent soft X-ray variability of the\nHMXB Cygnus X-1 in the low/hard spectral state. Excess variance spectroscopy\nquantifies the variability of an object above the statistical noise as a\nfunction of wavelength, which allows us to study the variability of individual\nspectral lines. As one of the first studies, we apply this technique to\nhigh-resolution gratings spectra provided by Chandra, accounting for various\nsystematic effects. The frequency dependence is investigated by changing the\ntime binning. The strong orbital phase dependence we observe in the excess\nvariance is consistent with column density variations predicted by a simple\nmodel for a clumpy wind. We identify spikes of increased variability with\nspectral features found by previous spectroscopic analyses of the same data\nset, most notably from silicon in over-dense clumps in the wind. In the silicon\nline region, the variability power is redistributed towards lower frequencies,\nhinting at increased line variability in large clumps.

This paper developed Self-discipline on\nmultiple channels(SMC), which combines consistency regularization with\nself-distillation using the concept of multiple channels.

It has been\nestablished that the relative amplitude of variability anti-correlates with the\naccretion rate.The dependence of the variance on black hole mass has remained\nelusive, and contradicting results, including positive, negative, or no\ncorrelation, have been reported. In this work, we show that the key to these\ncontradictions lies in the timescales of variability studied (e.g., the length\nof the light curves available). By isolating the variance on different\ntimescales as well as mass and accretion rate bins we show that there is indeed\na negative correlation between black hole mass and variance and that this\nanti-correlation is stronger for shorter timescale fluctuations. The behavior\ncan be explained in terms of a universal variability power spectrum for all\nquasars, resembling a broken power law where the variance is constant at low\ntemporal frequencies and then drops continuously for frequencies higher than a\ncharacteristic frequency $f_b$, where $f_b$ correlates with the black hole\nmass.

Essentially, we propose to augment a query with its\npotential answers by prompting LLMs with a composition of the query and the\nquery's in-domain candidates. The candidates, regardless of correct or wrong,\nare obtained by a vanilla retrieval procedure on the target collection. Such\ncandidates, as a part of prompts, are likely to help LLM generate more precise\nanswers by pattern imitation or candidate summarization. Even if all the\ncandidates are wrong, the prompts at least make LLM aware of in-collection\npatterns and genres. Moreover, due to the low performance of a self-supervised\nretriever, the LLM-based query augmentation becomes less effective as the\nretriever bottlenecks the whole pipeline. So, we propose to leverage a\nnon-parametric lexicon-based method (e.g., BM25) as the retrieval module to\ncapture query-document overlap in a literal fashion. As such, LameR makes the\nretrieval procedure transparent to the LLM, so it circumvents the performance\nbottleneck.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 14:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

The simplest way to suppress\nfluctuations and realize the long-range orders in low-dimensional systems is\njust to consider the ground state at zero temperature. A less trivial example\nis an out-of-equilibrium system driven by periodic driving forces, instead of\nthermal agitation. If the amplitude of the driving force is sufficiently small,\nthe periodic force of frequency $\\omega_0$ only excites the eigenmode of the\neigenfrequency $\\omega_0$. Therefore, the fluctuations would be largely\nsuppressed even near the critical point, if it exists. Does this mechanism\nallows the spontaneous symmetry breaking in low dimensions? We here show that\nthe answer is positive, at least for the spherical model, which corresponds to\nthe large $n$ limit of the $O(n)$ model and allows us to analytically calculate\nthe lower critical dimension $d_l$. For that purpose, we here propose the\ndriving force inspired by the chiral active matter:\n$h(\\boldsymbol{x},t)=\\sqrt{2D}\\cos\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$, where\n$\\dot{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{x},t)=\\omega_0+\\xi(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$, and\n$\\xi(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$ denotes the white noise. For the finite strength of the\nnoise, the model undergoes the second-order ferromagnetic phase transition at\nsome finite $D=D_c$. In particular, the lower critical dimension is $d_l=2$,\nmeaning that the ordered phase does not appear for $d\\leq d_l=2$. In the\nabsence of the noise, on the contrary, the model undergoes the ferromagnetic\nphase transition for any $d>0$, namely, $d_l=0$. Furthermore, the model for the\nconserved order parameter exhibits the hyperuniformity in the absence of the\nnoise, which has been previously reported for chiral active matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 14:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

AIMS: To measure the phot.\ndispersion in G+G_BP+G_RP of the 145 677 450 Gaia DR3 5-parameter sources with\nG <= 17 mag and G_BP-G_RP with -1.0 to 8.0 mag. To use that unbiased sample to\nanalyze stellar variability in the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC. METHODS: We convert\nfrom magnitude uncertainties to the observed phot. dispersions, calculate the\ninstrumental component as a function of apparent magnitude and color, and use\nit to transform the observed dispersions into the astrophysical ones. We give\nvariability indices in the three bands for the whole sample. We use the\nsubsample of Rimoldini et al. that includes light curves and variability types\nto calibrate our results and establish their limitations. RESULTS: We use\ninformation from the MW, LMC, and SMC CAMDs to discuss variability across the\nHRD. WDs and sdBs are more variable than MS or RC stars but their variability\ndecreases for the former with age. The MS region in the Gaia CAMD has an s_G\ndistribution peaks at low values (~1-2 mmag) and has a large tail dominated by\nEBs, RR Lyr stars, and YSOs. RC stars are characterized by little variability,\nwith their s_G distribution peaking at 1 mmag or less. The stars in the PMS\nregion are highly variable, with a power law distribution in s_G with slope\n2.75 and a cutoff for values lower than 7 mmag. The luminous red stars region\nof the Gaia CAMD has the highest variability, with its extreme dominated by AGB\nstars and with a power law in s_G with a slope of ~2.2 that extends from there\nto a cutoff of 7 mmag. We show that our method can be used to search for LMC\nCepheids. We analyze four stellar clusters with O stars and detect a strong\ndifference in s_G between stars that are already in the MS and those that are\nstill in the PMS.

To overcome these limitations, this\nwork introduces FLAC, a methodology that minimizes mutual information between\nthe features extracted by the model and a protected attribute, without the use\nof attribute labels. To do that, FLAC proposes a sampling strategy that\nhighlights underrepresented samples in the dataset, and casts the problem of\nlearning fair representations as a probability matching problem that leverages\nrepresentations extracted by a bias-capturing classifier.

Long-lived triplet states have low spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) and hence their population is low. Thus, a long-lived triplet\nstate can be populated but inefficiently. If the SOC is increased, the triplet\nstate population efficiency is improved - coming at the cost of decreasing the\nlifetime.

The self-attention mechanism is a\nDL technique that attempts to mimic the action of selectively focusing on some\nrelevant things while ignoring others. Models, such as the Transformer\narchitecture, were recently proposed for sequential data with successful\nresults.

The high-dimensionality of the\ndynamics causes computational bottlenecks, especially when these large-scale\nsystems need to be simulated for a variety of situations such as different\nforcing terms. This motivates model reduction where the goal is to replace the\nfull-order dynamics with accurate reduced-order surrogates. Interpolation-based\nmodel reduction has been proven to be an effective tool for the construction of\ncheap-to-evaluate surrogate models that preserve the internal structure in the\ncase of weak nonlinearities. In this paper, we consider the construction of\nmultivariate interpolants in frequency domain for structured quadratic-bilinear\nsystems.

To reduce the\nheavy runtime cost, in this paper we propose a lightweight learning approach\nwhich uses a small number of actual runtime performance data to predict the\nruntime performance of a compiled program with various optimization flag\ncombination. Furthermore, to reduce the search space, we design a novel\nparticle swarm algorithm which tunes compiler optimization flags with the\nprediction model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach\nCompTuner, we conduct an extensive experimental study on two popular C\ncompilers GCC and LLVM with two widely used benchmarks cBench and PolyBench.\nThe experimental results show that CompTuner significantly outperforms the five\ncompared techniques, including the state-of-art technique BOCA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 04:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

Uncertainty quantification algorithms often\nperform poorly in an input domain and the reason for poor performance remains\nunknown. Therefore, we present a neural network training method that considers\nsimilar samples with sensitivity awareness in this paper. In the proposed NN\ntraining method for UQ, first, we train a shallow NN for the point prediction.\nThen, we compute the absolute differences between prediction and targets and\ntrain another NN for predicting those absolute differences or absolute errors.\nDomains with high average absolute errors represent a high uncertainty. In the\nnext step, we select each sample in the training set one by one and compute\nboth prediction and error sensitivities. Then we select similar samples with\nsensitivity consideration and save indexes of similar samples. The ranges of an\ninput parameter become narrower when the output is highly sensitive to that\nparameter. After that, we construct initial uncertainty bounds (UB) by\nconsidering the distribution of sensitivity aware similar samples. Prediction\nintervals (PIs) from initial uncertainty bounds are larger and cover more\nsamples than required. Therefore, we train bound correction NN. As following\nall the steps for finding UB for each sample requires a lot of computation and\nmemory access, we train a UB computation NN.

As a result, a method that can be used as High availability to\nmaintain the Availability of the FDS Server without changing the message\nreceived is required. High availability will be achieved through the Active\nPassive Failover method, which will transfer data flows in the event of an\noperational failure on the FDS server. The transfer is based on CPU Load\nparameters and ISO 8583 messages, which are checked at each stage. The\nwaterfall method was used in this research. The waterfall is a straightforward\nclassic model with a linear system flow, with the output of each stage serving\nas the input for the next. The primary goals of this research are to ensure\nthat data in ISO 8583 format can be streamed without changing messages, to\nmeasure the effectiveness of the Active Passive Failover method in performing\nHigh availability using ISO 8583 message parameters and CPU Load, and to\nincrease the level of Availability and reliability of the FDS Server.

However, going\nthrough the vast and ever-increasing volume of biomedical literature is an\nintimidating and time consuming process. This necessitates development of\nautomated methods capable of accurately extracting bacterial relations reported\nin biomedical literature.

Traditional DP formulations impose a uniform\nprivacy requirement for all users, which is often inconsistent with real-world\nscenarios in which users dictate their privacy preferences individually. This\nwork considers the problem of mean estimation under heterogeneous DP\nconstraints, where each user can impose their own distinct privacy level. The\nalgorithm we propose is shown to be minimax optimal when there are two groups\nof users with distinct privacy levels. Our results elicit an interesting\nsaturation phenomenon that occurs as one group's privacy level is relaxed,\nwhile the other group's privacy level remains constant. Namely, after a certain\npoint, further relaxing the privacy requirement of the former group does not\nimprove the performance of the minimax optimal mean estimator.

In this work, we extend\nthe impact of such dataset to improving quantitative structure-activity\nrelationship (QSAR) models by introducing Molecule-Morphology Contrastive\nPretraining (MoCoP), a framework for learning multi-modal representation of\nmolecular graphs and cellular morphologies. We scale MoCoP to approximately\n100K molecules and 600K morphological profiles using data from the JUMP-CP\nConsortium and show that MoCoP consistently improves performances of graph\nneural networks (GNNs) on molecular property prediction tasks in ChEMBL20\nacross all dataset sizes. The pretrained GNNs are also evaluated on internal\nGSK pharmacokinetic data and show an average improvement of 2.6% and 6.3% in\nAUPRC for full and low data regimes, respectively. Our findings suggest that\nintegrating cellular morphologies with molecular graphs using MoCoP can\nsignificantly improve the performance of QSAR models, ultimately expanding the\ndeep learning toolbox available for QSAR applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 02:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

For these systems, which exhibit clearly defined start and end\nstates, it is possible to build a comprehensive picture of the lobe dynamics by\nconsidering backward and forward integration of sets of initial conditions to\nindex their origin and fate. We illustrate the method and its utility in the\nstudy of a two degrees of freedom caldera potential with four exits,\ndemonstrating that the OFM not only recapitulates results from classical\nmanifold theory, but even provides more detailed information about complex lobe\nstructures. The OFM allows the detection of dynamically significant transitions\ncaused by the creation of new lobes, and is also able to guide the prediction\nof the position of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs). Further, we compute the OFM\non the periodic orbit dividing surface (PODS) associated with the transition\nstate of a caldera entrance, which allows for a powerful analysis of reactive\ntrajectories. The intersection of the manifolds corresponding to this UPO with\nother manifolds in the phase space results in the appearance of lobes on the\nPODS, which are directly classified by the OFM. This allows computations of\nbranching ratios and the exploration of a fractal cascade of lobes as the\ncaldera is stretched, which results in fluctuations in the branching ratio and\nchaotic selectivity.
