The decision about\nwhich evaluation to extend is based on a preprocessing consisting in computing\nan incomplete Grobner basis after the current evaluation, which possibly\ngenerates linear polynomials that are used to eliminate further variables.

The need to fully\ndescribe a SS model limits its applicability under complex settings, e.g., when\ntracking based on visual data, and the processing of high-dimensional signals\noften induces notable latency. These challenges can be treated by mapping the\nmeasurements into latent features obeying some postulated closed-form SS model,\nand applying the KF in the latent space. However, the validity of this\napproximated SS model may constitute a limiting factor. In this work, we study\ntracking from high-dimensional measurements under complex settings using a\nhybrid model-based/data-driven approach. By gradually tackling the challenges\nin handling the observations model and the task, we develop Latent-KalmanNet,\nwhich implements tracking from high-dimensional measurements by leveraging data\nto jointly learn the KF along with the latent space mapping. Latent-KalmanNet\ncombines a learned encoder with data-driven tracking in the latent space using\nthe recently proposed-KalmanNet, while identifying the ability of each of these\ntrainable modules to assist its counterpart via providing a suitable prior (by\nKalmanNet) and by learning a latent representation that facilitates data-aided\ntracking (by the encoder).

Over the past few decades, various statistical and deep\nlearning approaches have been used to develop load forecasting models. This\npaper presents an interpretable machine learning approach that identifies load\ndynamics using data-driven methods within an operator-theoretic framework. We\nrepresent the load data using the Koopman operator, which is inherent to the\nunderlying dynamics. By computing the corresponding eigenfunctions, we\ndecompose the load dynamics into coherent spatiotemporal patterns that are the\nmost robust features of the dynamics. Each pattern evolves independently\naccording to its single frequency, making its predictability based on linear\ndynamics. We emphasize that the load dynamics are constructed based on coherent\nspatiotemporal patterns that are intrinsic to the dynamics and are capable of\nencoding rich dynamical features at multiple time scales. These features are\nrelated to complex interactions over interconnected power grids and different\nexogenous effects.

Some recent studies\nalso demonstrated strong empirical evidence that code review (natural language\ninstruction about suggestive changes in code) can improve the program repair\nfurther. Large language models, trained with Natural Language (NL) and computer\nprogram corpora, have the capacity to contain inherent knowledge of both. In\nthis study, we investigate if this inherent knowledge of code and NL can be\nutilized to improve automated program repair. We applied PLBART and CodeT5, two\nstate-of-the-art language models that are pre-trained with both Programming\nLanguage (PL) and Natural Language (NL), on two such natural language-based\nprogram repair datasets and found that the pre-trained language models\nfine-tuned with datasets containing both code review and subsequent code\nchanges notably outperform each of the previous models. We observed that the\npre-trained models improve the previously best-reported results by 9.91% on the\nReview4Repair dataset and by 24.72% on the dataset by Tufano et al. This\nsuggests that a pre-trained sequential model has a better understanding of\nnatural language and can utilize it much better. We performed an ablation study\nto assess the contribution of the pre-training mechanism and the model\narchitecture. We found that pre-training was significantly more important in\nthe performance gain than the model architecture. The practical application of\nusing pre-trained transformer models in the context of automated program repair\nis still a long way off. However, our study demonstrates the substantial value\nof employing pre-trained models, paving the path for future studies to use more\nof these.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 17:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Natural fliers are naturally optimized and are comparable in size\nto MAVs, making them a potent candidate to mimic for the design of MAVs. The\ndragonfly frequently uses a gliding mode of flight relative to the other small\nfliers and operates at a range of 100-10000. The literature suggests that the\ncorrugated profile improves the aerodynamic efficiency around Re at 104.

In this paper, we perform direct\nnumerical simulations of flow past bio-inspired corrugated wing to understand\nthe impact of the tandem wing configuration. The horizontal distance between\nthe wings is fixed, and the vertical distance varies. The results reveal that\nthe forewing/hindwing interaction increases the lift of the forewing relative\nto the isolated wing for all the case studies. The combined drag coefficient\ndrops by approximately 7%, and overall efficiency drops by approximately 13%\nrelative to an isolated wing for a case study with zero vertical spacing\nbetween forewing and hindwing at 3 degree angle of attack, fixed for both\nwings.

Some previous works have used\nlanguage model techniques, such as the attention mechanism, to capture users'\ninterests based on their past behaviors, and to understand the content of\narticles. However, these existing model architectures require adjustments if\nadditional information is taken into account. Pre-trained large language\nmodels, which can better capture word relationships and comprehend contexts,\nhave seen a significant development in recent years, and these pre-trained\nmodels have the advantages of transfer learning and reducing the training time\nfor downstream tasks.

In this paper, a\ncausation entropy boosting (CEBoosting) strategy is developed to facilitate the\ndetection of regime switching and the discovery of the dynamics associated with\nthe new regime via online model identification. The causation entropy, which\ncan be efficiently calculated, provides a logic value of each candidate\nfunction in a pre-determined library. The reversal of one or a few such\ncausation entropy indicators associated with the model calibrated for the\ncurrent regime implies the detection of regime switching. Despite the short\nlength of each batch formed by the sequential data, the accumulated value of\ncausation entropy corresponding to a sequence of data batches leads to a robust\nindicator. With the detected rectification of the model structure, the\nsubsequent parameter estimation becomes a quadratic optimization problem, which\nis solved using closed analytic formulae. Using the Lorenz 96 model, it is\nshown that the causation entropy indicator can be efficiently calculated, and\nthe method applies to moderately large dimensional systems. The CEBoosting\nalgorithm is also adaptive to the situation with partial observations.

Although methods\nsuitable for analyzing arbitrary and non-linear microstructures exist, their\ncomputational cost makes them impractical to use in large-scale structural\nanalysis. Surrogate models or Reduced Order Models (ROM), commonly enhance\nefficiencies, but they are typically calibrated with a single microstructure.\nHomogenization methods, such as the Mori-Tanaka method, offer rapid\nhomogenization for a wide range of constituent properties. However, simplifying\nassumptions, like stress and strain averaging in phases, render the\nconsideration of both deterministic and stochastic variations in microstructure\ninfeasible.\n  This paper illustrates a transformer neural network architecture that\ncaptures the knowledge of various microstructures and constituents, enabling it\nto function as a computationally efficient homogenization surrogate model.\nGiven an image or an abstraction of an arbitrary composite microstructure, the\ntransformer network predicts the homogenized stress-strain response. Two\nmethods were tested that encode features of the microstructure. The first\nmethod calculates two-point statistics of the microstructure and uses Principal\nComponent Analysis for dimensionality reduction.

Due to the ill-defined nature of\nthe disorder, it is difficult for even a psychiatrist alone to be confident\nwith their diagnosis. Changes in mental and mood state are often highly\nsubjective and difficult to pinpoint through short-term surveys and psychiatric\nconsultations. For many patients, diagnosis and treatment based on\ntrial-and-error is unavoidable. A timely and thorough diagnosis and treatment\nplan is associated with the need for an equal involvement of both the patient\nand the psychiatrist throughout the process. This conclusion is reached through\na detailed assessment of current interventions for (i) the ill-defined nature\nof the disorder, and (ii) the trial-and-error requirement for medication and\ndiagnosis. As a result, I propose the implementation of an AI communication\nfacilitator that can aid in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of bipolar\ndisorder by embodying the shared decision-making model.

The electrification of the\nresidential heat sector is an option to decarbonise the heat sector in the\nUnited Kingdom. The inherent flexibility that is available in the residential\nheat sector, in the form of the thermal inertia of buildings, is expected to\nplay an important role in supporting the critical task of short-term balancing\nof electricity supply and demand. This paper proposes a method for\ncharacterising the locally aggregated flexibility envelope from the electrified\nresidential heat sector, considering the most influential factors including\noutdoor and indoor temperature, thermal mass and heat loss of dwellings.\nApplying the method to England and Wales as a case study, demonstrated a\nsignificant potential for a temporary reduction of electricity demand for\nheating even during cold weather. Total electricity demand reductions of\napproximately 25 GW to 85 GW were shown to be achievable for the outdoor\ntemperature of 10 degreeC and -5 degreeC, respectively. Improving the energy\nperformance of the housing stock in England and Wales was shown to reduce the\nmagnitude of available flexibility to approximately 18 GW to 60 GW for the\noutdoor temperature of 10 degreeC and -5 degreeC, respectively. This is due to\nthe use of smaller size heat pumps in the more efficient housing stock.\nHowever, the impact of the buildings' retrofit on their thermal mass and\nconsequently on the duration of the flexibility provision is uncertain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 20:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

This is because leakage, i.e., the\nloss of information stored in the computational subspace to undesired subspaces\nin a larger Hilbert space, is more difficult to detect and correct than errors\nthat preserve the computational subspace. As a result, leakage presents a\nsignificant obstacle to the development of fault-tolerant quantum computation.\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate benchmarking framework\ncalled leakage randomized benchmarking (LRB) for measuring leakage rates on\nmulti-qubit quantum systems. Our approach is more insensitive to state\npreparation and measurement (SPAM) noise than existing leakage benchmarking\nprotocols, requires fewer assumptions about the gate set itself, and can be\nused to benchmark multi-qubit leakages, which was not done previously. We also\nextend the LRB protocol to an interleaved variant called interleaved LRB\n(iLRB), which can benchmark the average leakage rate of generic n-site quantum\ngates with reasonable noise assumptions. We demonstrate the iLRB protocol on\nbenchmarking generic two-qubit gates realized using flux tuning, and analyze\nthe behavior of iLRB under corresponding leakage models. Our numerical\nexperiments show good agreement with theoretical estimations, indicating the\nfeasibility of both the LRB and iLRB protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 20:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

One-class classification methods are commonly\nused for anomaly detection tasks, but they have limitations when applied to\ntemporal data. In particular, mapping all normal instances into a single\nhypersphere to capture their global characteristics can lead to poor\nperformance in detecting context-based anomalies where the abnormality is\ndefined with respect to local information. To address this limitation, we\npropose a novel approach inspired by the loss function of DeepSVDD. Instead of\nmapping all normal instances into a single hypersphere center, each normal\ninstance is pulled toward a recent context window. However, this approach is\nprone to a representation collapse issue where the neural network that encodes\na given instance and its context is optimized towards a constant encoder\nsolution. To overcome this problem, we combine our approach with a\ndeterministic contrastive loss from Neutral AD, a promising self-supervised\nlearning anomaly detection approach. We provide a theoretical analysis to\ndemonstrate that the incorporation of the deterministic contrastive loss can\neffectively prevent the occurrence of a constant encoder solution.

To understand the origin of\nthese filaments, we investigate the dynamics of a retreating thin-film of\naqueous polyethylene oxide (PEO) solutions which partially wet polydimethyl\nsiloxane (PDMS) substrates. Under certain conditions the retreating film\ngenerates regularly-spaced liquid filaments. The early-stage thin-film dynamics\nof dewetting are investigated to identify a theoretical criterion for liquid\nfilament formation. Starting with a linear stability analysis of a Newtonian or\nsimple non-Newtonian (power-law) thin-film, a critical film thickness is\nidentified which depends on the Hamaker constant for the fluid-substrate pair\nand the surface tension of the fluid. When the measured film thickness is\nsmaller than this value, the film is unstable and forms filaments as a result\nof van der Waals forces dominating its behaviour. This critical film-height is\ncompared with experimental measurements of film thickness obtained for receding\nfilms of Newtonian (glycerol-water mixtures) and non-Newtonian (PEO) solutions\ngenerated on substrates inclined at angles 0 $^{\\circ}$, 30 $^{\\circ}$, and 60\n$^{\\circ}$ to the vertical. The observations of filament and its absence show\ngood agreement with the theory.

The low-frequency relaxation mode, m1, was attributed to an\nend-over-end rotation of the dipolar groups parallel to the director. The\nhigh-frequency relaxation mode, m2, was associated with the precessional\nmotions of the dipolar groups around the director. The relaxation times for\nboth modes were analyzed over a wide temperature range down to near the glass\ntransition temperature. The different analytic functions used to characterize\nthe temperature dependence of the relaxation times of the two modes are\ndiscussed.

However, two vital issues are\nstill under-explored: (1) From the content modeling perspective, sufficient\nlong-text descriptions are usually scarce in a real recommender system, more\noften the light-weight textual features, such as a few keywords or tags, are\nmore accessible, which is improperly modeled by existing methods. (2) From the\nCDR perspective, not all inter-domain interests are helpful to infer\nintra-domain interests. Caused by domain-specific features, there are part of\nsignals benefiting for recommendation in the source domain but harmful for that\nin the target domain. Therefore, how to distill useful interests is crucial. To\ntackle the above two problems, we propose a metapath and multi-interest\naggregated graph neural network (M2GNN). Specifically, to model the tag-based\ncontents, we construct a heterogeneous information network to hold the semantic\nrelatedness between users, items, and tags in all domains. The metapath schema\nis predefined according to domain-specific knowledge, with one metapath for one\ndomain. User representations are learned by GNN with a hierarchical aggregation\nframework, where the intra-metapath aggregation firstly filters out trivial\ntags and the inter-metapath aggregation further filters out useless interests.\nOffline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate that M2GNN achieves\nsignificant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods and current\nindustrial recommender system in Dianping, respectively. Further analysis shows\nthat M2GNN offers an interpretable recommendation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 22:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

However, the design of the reward function, on which the agent\nrelies to optimize its recommendation policy, is often not straightforward.\nExploring the causality underlying users' behavior can take the place of the\nreward function in guiding the agent to capture the dynamic interests of users.\nMoreover, due to the typical limitations of simulation environments (e.g., data\ninefficiency), most of the work cannot be broadly applied in large-scale\nsituations. Although some works attempt to convert the offline dataset into a\nsimulator, data inefficiency makes the learning process even slower. Because of\nthe nature of reinforcement learning (i.e., learning by interaction), it cannot\ncollect enough data to train during a single interaction.

This paper\naddresses a new challenging setting called positive and unlabeled heterogeneous\ndomain adaptation (PU-HDA), a HUDA setting where the source domain only has\npositives. PU-HDA can also be viewed as an extension of PU learning where the\npositive and unlabeled examples are sampled from different domains. A naive\ncombination of existing HUDA and PU learning methods is ineffective in PU-HDA\ndue to the gap in label distribution between the source and target domains.

The proposed method iterates projections in each time\nstep with a proper convection form. We prove that the projection iterations\nconverge with a certain parameter regime. Optimal iteration convergence can be\nachieved with the modulation of parameter values.\n  This new method has several significant improvements over the Uzawa method\nand the projection method both theoretically and practically. First, when the\niterative projections are fully convergent in each time step, the numerical\nvelocity is weakly divergence free (pointwise divergence free in divergence\nfree finite element methods), and the stability and error estimate are\nrigorously proven. With proper parameters, this method converges much faster\nthan the Uzawa method. Second, numerical simulations show that with rather\nrelaxed stopping criteria which require only a few iterations each time step,\nthe numerical solution preserves stability and accuracy for high Reynolds\nnumbers, where the convectional projection method would fail. Furthermore, this\nmethod retains the efficiency of the traditional projection method by\ndecoupling the velocity and pressure fields, which splits the saddle point\nsystem into small elliptic problems. Three dimensional simulations with\nTaylor-Hood P2/P1 finite elements are presented to demonstrate the performance\nand efficiency of this method.\n  More importantly, this method is a generic approach and thus there are many\npotential improvements and extensions of the iterative projection method,\nincluding utilization of various convection forms, association with\nstabilization techniques for high Reynolds numbers, applications to other\nsaddle point problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 03:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Existing methods typically leverage high-resolution (HR) ODI as the\ninput, so as to recover the structural details via fully-supervised learning.\nHowever, the HR depth ground truth (GT) maps may be arduous or expensive to be\ncollected due to resource-constrained devices in practice. Therefore, in this\npaper, we explore for the first time to estimate the HR omnidirectional depth\ndirectly from a low-resolution (LR) ODI, when no HR depth GT map is available.\nOur key idea is to transfer the scene structural knowledge from the readily\navailable HR image modality and the corresponding LR depth maps to achieve the\ngoal of HR depth estimation without extra inference cost. Specifically, we\nintroduce ODI super-resolution (SR) as an auxiliary task and train both tasks\ncollaboratively in a weakly supervised manner to boost the performance of HR\ndepth estimation. The ODI SR task takes an LR ODI as the input to predict an HR\nimage, enabling us to extract the scene structural knowledge via uncertainty\nestimation. Buttressed by this, a scene structural knowledge transfer (SSKT)\nmodule is proposed with two key components. First, we employ a cylindrical\nimplicit interpolation function (CIIF) to learn cylindrical neural\ninterpolation weights for feature up-sampling and share the parameters of CIIFs\nbetween the two tasks. Then, we propose a feature distillation (FD) loss that\nprovides extra structural regularization to help the HR depth estimation task\nlearn more scene structural knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 03:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Pseudo-label-based methods, which serve as\nan effective solution, have been widely studied recently. However, existing\nmethods generate pseudo labels during training and make predictions during\ntesting under different pipelines or settings, resulting in a gap between\ntraining and testing. In this paper, we propose to generate high-quality pseudo\nlabels from the predicted action boundaries. Nevertheless, we note that\nexisting post-processing, like NMS, would lead to information loss, which is\ninsufficient to generate high-quality action boundaries. More importantly,\ntransforming action boundaries into pseudo labels is quite challenging, since\nthe predicted action instances are generally overlapped and have different\nconfidence scores. Besides, the generated pseudo-labels can be fluctuating and\ninaccurate at the early stage of training. It might repeatedly strengthen the\nfalse predictions if there is no mechanism to conduct self-correction. To\ntackle these issues, we come up with an effective pipeline for learning better\npseudo labels.

One\napproach is to first collect information from students about which courses they\nwant to take and to develop optimization models for assigning students to\navailable seats in a fair manner. What makes this problem complex is that the\ncourses themselves have time conflicts, and the students have credit caps (an\nupper bound on the number of courses they would like to enroll in). We model\nthis problem as follows. We have $n$ agents (students), and there are\n\"resources\" (these correspond to courses). Each agent is only interested in a\nsubset of the resources (courses of interest), and each resource can only be\nassigned to a bounded number of agents (available seats). In addition, each\nresource corresponds to an interval of time, and the objective is to assign\nnon-overlapping resources to agents so as to produce \"fair and high utility\"\nschedules.\n  In this model, we provide a number of results under various settings and\nobjective functions. Specifically, in this paper, we consider the following\nobjective functions: total utility, max-min (Santa Claus objective), and\nenvy-freeness. The total utility objective function maximizes the sum of the\nutilities of all courses assigned to students. The max-min objective maximizes\nthe minimum utility obtained by any student. Finally, envy-freeness ensures\nthat no student envies another student's allocation. Under these settings and\nobjective functions, we show a number of theoretical results.

However, when fixed costs are\nincluded, prices become non-monotonic with respect to demand, which can\nadversely impact market transparency. To overcome this issue, convex hull (CH)\npricing has been introduced for unit commitment with fixed costs. Several CH\npricing methods have been presented, and a feasible cost has been used as a\nquality measure for the CH price. However, obtaining a feasible cost requires a\ncomputationally intensive optimization procedure, and the associated duality\ngap may not provide an accurate quality measure. This paper presents a new\napproach for quantifying the quality of the CH price by establishing an upper\nbound on the optimal dual value. The proposed approach uses Surrogate\nLagrangian Relaxation (SLR) to efficiently obtain near-optimal CH prices, while\nthe upper bound decreases rapidly due to the convergence of SLR. Testing\nresults on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate that the novel quality measure\nis more accurate than the measure provided by a feasible cost, indicating the\nhigh quality of the upper bound and the efficiency of SLR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 05:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

However, when images are not\nobject-centric, the semantics of the image can be significantly altered due to\ncropping. Furthermore, as the model becomes insensitive to geometric\ntransformations, it may struggle to capture location information. For this\nreason, we propose a Geometric Transformation Sensitive Architecture designed\nto be sensitive to geometric transformations, specifically focusing on\nfour-fold rotation, random crop, and multi-crop. Our method encourages the\nstudent to be sensitive by predicting rotation and using targets that vary with\nthose transformations through pooling and rotating the teacher feature map.\nAdditionally, we use patch correspondence loss to encourage correspondence\nbetween patches with similar features. This approach allows us to capture\nlong-term dependencies in a more appropriate way than capturing long-term\ndependencies by encouraging local-to-global correspondence, which occurs when\nlearning to be insensitive to multi-crop.

Method: We propose a solution for stereo endoscopes that estimates\ndepth and optical flow to minimize two geometric losses for camera pose\nestimation.

A distinguishing feature is their asymptotic\nbehaviours can be accurately predicted via their associated state evolution\nequations. Orthogonal AMP (OAMP) was recently developed to avoid the need for\ncomputing the so-called Onsager term in traditional AMP algorithms, providing\ntwo clear benefits: the derivation of an OAMP algorithm is both straightforward\nand more broadly applicable. OAMP was originally demonstrated for statistical\nproblems with a single measurement vector and single transform. This paper\nextends OAMP to statistical problems with multiple measurement vectors (MMVs)\nand multiple transforms (MTs). We name the resulting algorithms as OAMP-MMV and\nOAMP-MT respectively, and their combination as augmented OAMP (A-OAMP). Whereas\nthe extension of traditional AMP algorithms to such problems would be\nchallenging, the orthogonal principle underpinning OAMP makes these extensions\nstraightforward.\n  The MMV and MT models are widely applicable to signal processing and\ncommunications. We present an example of MIMO relay system with correlated\nsource data and signal clipping, which can be modelled as a joint MMV-MT\nsystem. While existing methods meet with difficulties in this example, OAMP\noffers an efficient solution with excellent performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:40:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Implicit in these functions lies an unwarranted\nassumption that restricts the spatial variation (Svar) and temporal variability\n(Tvar) of changes in climate to be null. This could bias damage estimates and\nthe climate policy advice from IAMs. While the effects of Tvar have been\nstudied in the literature, those of Svar and their interactions with Tvar have\nnot.

During the training of the systems,\non-the-fly simulation pipeline is nowadays preferred as it allows the model to\ntrain on infinite number of data samples without pre-generating and saving them\non harddisk. An RIR simulation method thus needs to not only generate more\nrealistic artificial room impulse response (RIR) filters, but also generate\nthem in a fast way to accelerate the training process. Existing RIR simulation\ntools have proven effective in a wide range of speech processing tasks and\nneural network architectures, but their usage in on-the-fly simulation pipeline\nremains questionable due to their computational complexity or the quality of\nthe generated RIR filters.

However, limited by cost,\nnoise and manual labeling, obtaining diverse and reliable multimodal MR images\nremains a challenge. For the same lesion, different MRI manifestations have\ngreat differences in background information, coarse positioning and fine\nstructure. In order to obtain better generation and segmentation performance, a\ncoordination-spatial attention generation adversarial network (CASP-GAN) based\non the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) is proposed.\nThe performance of the generator is optimized by introducing the Coordinate\nAttention (CA) module and the Spatial Attention (SA) module. The two modules\ncan make full use of the captured location information, accurately locating the\ninterested region, and enhancing the generator model network structure. The\nability to extract the structure information and the detailed information of\nthe original medical image can help generate the desired image with higher\nquality. There exist some problems in the original CycleGAN that the training\ntime is long, the parameter amount is too large, and it is difficult to\nconverge. In response to this problem, we introduce the Coordinate Attention\n(CA) module to replace the Res Block to reduce the number of parameters, and\ncooperate with the spatial information extraction network above to strengthen\nthe information extraction ability. On the basis of CASP-GAN, an attentional\ngenerative cross-modality segmentation (AGCMS) method is further proposed. This\nmethod inputs the modalities generated by CASP-GAN and the real modalities into\nthe segmentation network for brain tumor segmentation.

To code\ntransient signals effectively, FDNS with temporal noise shaping (TNS) has\nemerged. However, these mainly operated in the modified discrete cosine\ntransform domain, which essentially accompanies time domain aliasing. In this\npaper, a unified noise-shaping (UNS) framework including FDNS and complex\nLPC-based TNS (CTNS) in the DFT domain is proposed to overcome the aliasing\nissues. Additionally, a modified polar quantizer with phase contrast control is\nproposed, which saves phase bits depending on the frequency envelope\ninformation. The core coding feasibility at low bit rates is verified through\nvarious objective metrics and subjective listening evaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 08:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

An\nimportant topic in manipulation detection is the localization of the fake\nregions. Previous work related to forgery detection mostly focuses on the\nentire faces. However, recent forgery methods have developed to edit important\nfacial components while maintaining others unchanged. This drives us to not\nonly focus on the forgery detection but also fine-grained falsified region\nsegmentation.

The interplay between helicity and the electric field is quite\nsignificant.

Alternative methods have\nbeen explored in the statistical literature, such as weighted log-rank tests\nand tests based on the Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST). While weighted\nlog-rank tests can achieve high power compared to the standard log-rank test,\nsome choices of weights may lead to type-I error inflation under particular\nconditions.

However, establishing\nknowledge bases (KBs) for domain-oriented communication can be time-consuming.\nTo address this challenge, this paper proposes a semantic caching model in edge\ncomputing system that caches domain-specialized general models and\nuser-specific individual models. This approach has the potential to reduce the\ntime and resources required to establish individual KBs while accurately\ncapturing the semantics behind users' messages, ultimately leading to more\nefficient and accessible semantic communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 09:13:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 16:35:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

In this paper, we propose Vision Transformer based\nPose-Conditioned Self-Loop Graph (ViPLO) to resolve these problems. First, we\npropose a novel feature extraction method suitable for the Vision Transformer\nbackbone, called masking with overlapped area (MOA) module.

DAS-N2N requires no manually produced labels (i.e.,\npre-determined examples of clean event signals or sections of noise) for\ntraining and aims to map random noise processes to a chosen summary statistic,\nsuch as the distribution mean, median or mode, whilst retaining the true\nunderlying signal. This is achieved by splicing (joining together) two fibres\nhosted within a single optical cable, recording two noisy copies of the same\nunderlying signal corrupted by different independent realizations of random\nobservational noise. A deep learning model can then be trained using only these\ntwo noisy copies of the data to produce a near fully-denoised copy. Once the\nmodel is trained, only noisy data from a single fibre is required. Using a\ndataset from a DAS array deployed on the surface of the Rutford Ice Stream in\nAntarctica, we demonstrate that DAS-N2N greatly suppresses incoherent noise and\nenhances the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of natural microseismic icequake\nevents. We further show that this approach is inherently more efficient and\neffective than standard stop/pass band filtering routines and a comparable\nself-supervised learning method based on masking individual DAS channels. Our\npreferred model for this task is lightweight, processing 30 seconds of data\nrecorded at a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz over 985 channels (approx. 1 km of\nfiber) in $<$1 s. Due to the high noise levels in DAS recordings, efficient\ndata-driven denoising methods, such as DAS-N2N, will prove essential to\ntime-critical DAS earthquake detection, particularly in the case of\nmicroseismic monitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 09:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

For scattering dominated transport, the\nacceleration rate scales as $t_{\\rm acc}\\propto t^{1/2}$, though recovers Bohm\nscaling $t_{\\rm acc}\\propto t$ if particles become magnetised on one side of\nthe shock. For uniform field configurations, a limiting energy is reached when\nparticles are magnetised on both sides of the shock. For the cylindrical field\nconfiguration, this limit does not apply, and particles of one sign of charge\nwill experience a curvature drift that redirects particles upstream. For the\nnon-resonant scattering model considered, these particles preferentially escape\nonly when they reach the confinement limit determined by the finite system\nsize, and the distribution approaches the escapeless limit $dN/d\\gamma \\propto\n\\gamma^{-1}$. The cylindrical field configuration resembles that expected for\njets launched by the Blandford $\\&$ Znajek mechanism, the luminous jets of AGN\nand GRBs thus provide favourable sites for the production of ultra-high energy\ncosmic rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 10:21:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 15:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

In this paper, we present the result of a DECam\nobservational campaign toward the LMC and give a catalogue of the observed\nvariable sources. We considered all the available DECam observations of the\nLMC, acquired during 32 nights over a period of two years (from February 2018\nto January 2020), and set up a specific pipeline for detecting and\ncharacterizing variable sources in the observed fields. Here, we report on the\nfirst 15 deg2 in and around the LMC as observed by DECam, testing the\ncapabilities of our pipeline. Since many of the observed fields cover a rather\ncrowded region of the sky, we adopted the ISIS subtraction package which, even\nin these conditions, can detect variables at a very low signal to noise ratio.\nAll the potentially identified variable sources were then analyzed and each\nlight curve tested for periodicity by using the Lomb-Scargle and\nSchwarzenberg-Czerny algorithms. Furthermore, we classified the identified\nsources by using the UPSILoN neural network. This analysis allowed us to find\n70 981 variable stars, 1266 of which were previously unknown. We estimated the\nperiod of the variables and compared it with the available values in the\ncatalogues. Moreover, for the 1266 newly detected objects, an attempted\nclassification based on light curve analysis is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 10:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

The main issue is that the pre-trained\nlanguage model-based encoders used by DRs are typically trained and fine-tuned\nusing clean, well-curated text data. Misspelled queries are typically not found\nin the data used for training these models, and thus misspelled queries\nobserved at inference time are out-of-distribution compared to the data used\nfor training and fine-tuning.

To address this challenge, we\npropose ToRoDer (TypOs-aware bottlenecked pre-training for RObust DEnse\nRetrieval), a novel \\textit{pre-training} strategy for DRs that increases their\nrobustness to misspelled queries while preserving their effectiveness in\ndownstream retrieval tasks.

The pre-training task is to recover the\nmasked tokens for both the encoder and decoder.

Recently, few-shot knowledge graph\ncompletion (FKGC), which aims to predict missing facts for unseen relations\nwith few-shot associated facts, has attracted increasing attention from\npractitioners and researchers. However, existing FKGC methods are based on\nmetric learning or meta-learning, which often suffer from the\nout-of-distribution and overfitting problems. Meanwhile, they are incompetent\nat estimating uncertainties in predictions, which is critically important as\nmodel predictions could be very unreliable in few-shot settings. Furthermore,\nmost of them cannot handle complex relations and ignore path information in\nKGs, which largely limits their performance. In this paper, we propose a\nnormalizing flow-based neural process for few-shot knowledge graph completion\n(NP-FKGC). Specifically, we unify normalizing flows and neural processes to\nmodel a complex distribution of KG completion functions. This offers a novel\nway to predict facts for few-shot relations while estimating the uncertainty.\nThen, we propose a stochastic ManifoldE decoder to incorporate the neural\nprocess and handle complex relations in few-shot settings. To further improve\nperformance, we introduce an attentive relation path-based graph neural network\nto capture path information in KGs. Extensive experiments on three public\ndatasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the existing\nFKGC methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

On the\nother hand, RAs can degrade estimation efficiency due to their estimation\nerrors, which are not asymptotically negligible when the number of regressors\nis of the same order as the sample size. Failure to account for the cost of RAs\ncan result in over-rejection of causal inference under the null hypothesis. To\naddress this issue, we develop a unified inference theory for the\nregression-adjusted average treatment effect (ATE) estimator under CARs. Our\ntheory has two key features: (1) it ensures the exact asymptotic size under the\nnull hypothesis, regardless of whether the number of covariates is fixed or\ndiverges at most at the rate of the sample size, and (2) it guarantees weak\nefficiency improvement over the ATE estimator with no adjustments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 11:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

We have therefore\nused about 90,000 spectra of the X-shooter spectrograph of the Very Large\nTelescope at Cerro Paranal in Chile in order to study 10 years of variations of\n298 OH lines.

For a better\nunderstanding of the resulting variability patterns and the line-specific\ndifferences, we applied decomposition techniques, studied the variability\ndepending on time scale, and calculated correlations. As a result, the mixing\nof thermalized and nonthermalized OH level populations clearly influences the\namplitude of the variations.

The lensing signature can be measured\nwith $3 \\sigma$ confidence when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the GW\ndetection reaches $100 \\, (f/300 {\\rm Hz})^{-1}$ over a one-year observation\nperiod (where $f$ is the GW frequency). The solar density profile can be\nplotted as a function of radius when the SNR improves to $\\gtrsim 10^4$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 12:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Through this approach, we intend to investigate and\ngain insights into various fundamental properties of a static neutron star,\nsuch as its compositional ingredients, speed of sound, mass-radius profile, and\ntidal deformability. The obtained results revealed that the quarkyonic matter\nequation of state (EOS) is capable of producing a heavy neutron star with the\nmass range of $\\sim$ $2.8 M_\\odot$.

However, it is still very\nchallenging for some reasons. First, compared with humans, current robots are\nextremely inflexible, and therefore have higher requirements on the accuracy of\nbase placements (BPs). Second, the BP and task constraints are coupled with\neach other. The optimal BP depends on the task constraints, and in BP will\naffect task constraints in turn. More tricky is that some task constraints are\nflexible and non-deterministic. Third, except for fulfilling tasks, some other\nperformance metrics such as optimal energy consumption and minimal execution\ntime need to be considered, which makes the BPO problem even more complicated.\nIn this paper, a Scale-like disc (SLD) representation of the workspace is used\nto decouple task constraints and BPs. To evaluate reachability and return\noptimal working pose over SLDs, a reachability map (RM) is constructed offline.\nIn order to optimize the objectives of coverage, manipulability, and time cost\nsimultaneously, this paper formulates the BPO as a multi-objective optimization\nproblem (MOOP). Among them, the time optimal objective is modeled as a\ntraveling salesman problem (TSP), which is more in line with the actual\nsituation. The evolutionary method is used to solve the MOOP. Besides, to\nensure the validity and optimality of the solution, collision detection is\nperformed on the candidate BPs, and solutions from BPO are further fine-tuned\naccording to the specific given task. Finally, the proposed method is used to\nsolve a real-world toilet coverage cleaning task.

Reducing the pre-processing (i.e.,\nindex building) time and improving the accuracy of search results are two major\nchallenges. DSTree and the iSAX index family are state-of-the-art solutions for\nthis problem. However, DSTree suffers from long index building times, while\niSAX suffers from low search accuracy. In this paper, we identify two problems\nof the iSAX index family that adversely affect the overall performance.

Furthermore, we devise Dumpy-Fuzzy as a variant of Dumpy which\nfurther improves search accuracy by proper duplication of series. Experiments\nwith a variety of large, real datasets demonstrate that the Dumpy solutions\nachieve considerably better efficiency, scalability and search accuracy than\nits competitors.

In this work, we hypothesize that each participant\nhas a specific function in each action and that role-based interaction is\ncritical for predicting players' future moves. We create RolFor, a novel\nend-to-end model for Role-based Forecasting. RolFor uses a new module we\ndeveloped called Ordering Neural Networks (OrderNN) to permute the order of the\nplayers such that each player is assigned to a latent role. The latent role is\nthen modeled with a RoleGCN. Thanks to its graph representation, it provides a\nfully learnable adjacency matrix that captures the relationships between roles\nand is subsequently used to forecast the players' future trajectories.\nExtensive experiments on a challenging NBA basketball dataset back up the\nimportance of roles and justify our goal of modeling them using optimizable\nmodels.

We present new and precise\nmeasurements of the Galactic radial metallicity gradient in small age bins\nbetween 0.5 and 12 Gyr, confirming a steeper metallicity gradient for 2-5 Gyr\nold populations and a subsequent flattening for older populations mostly\nproduced by radial migration.

Specifically, we enhance the diffusion model in several\naspects such as network architecture, noise level, denoising steps, training\nimage size, and optimizer/scheduler. We show that tuning these hyperparameters\nallows us to achieve better performance on both distortion and perceptual\nscores. We also propose a U-Net based latent diffusion model which performs\ndiffusion in a low-resolution latent space while preserving high-resolution\ninformation from the original input for the decoding process. Compared to the\nprevious latent-diffusion model which trains a VAE-GAN to compress the image,\nour proposed U-Net compression strategy is significantly more stable and can\nrecover highly accurate images without relying on adversarial optimization.\nImportantly, these modifications allow us to apply diffusion models to various\nimage restoration tasks, including real-world shadow removal, HR\nnon-homogeneous dehazing, stereo super-resolution, and bokeh effect\ntransformation. By simply replacing the datasets and slightly changing the\nnoise network, our model, named Refusion, is able to deal with large-size\nimages (e.g., 6000 x 4000 x 3 in HR dehazing) and produces good results on all\nthe above restoration problems. Our Refusion achieves the best perceptual\nperformance in the NTIRE 2023 Image Shadow Removal Challenge and wins 2nd place\noverall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 14:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Therefore, it has been suggested that carrollian CFTs could\nprovide a co-dimension one dual description to gravity in asymptotically flat\nspacetimes. In this work, we construct an embedding space formalism for\nthree-dimensional carrollian CFTs and use it to determine two- and three-point\ncorrelators.

The output\nconsisted of B0 maps at the new head positions. We further fine-tuned the\nnetwork weights to each subject by measuring a limited number of head positions\nof the given subject, and trained the U-net with these data. Our approach was\ncompared to established dynamic B0 field mapping via interleaved navigators,\nwhich suffer from limited spatial resolution and the need for undesirable\nsequence modifications. Qualitative and quantitative comparison showed similar\nperformance between an interleaved navigator-equivalent method and proposed\nmethod.

These landslides have\ndifferent ways to manifest, ranging from aseismic events of slow displacement\n(slow slips) to ordinary earthquakes. An example of continuous slow slip event\nwas identified in Cascadia, near the island of Vancouver (CA). This slow slip\nevent is associated with a tectonic movements, when the overriding North\nAmerica plate lurches southwesterly over the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.\nThis region is located down-dip the seismogenic rupture zone, which has not\nbeen activated since 1700s but has been cyclically loaded by the slow slip\nmovement. This fact requires some attention, since slow slip events have\nalready been reported in literature as possible triggering factors for\nearthquakes. Nonetheless, the physical models to describe the slow slip events\nare still incomplete, which restricts the detailed knowledge of the movements\nand the associated tremor. In the original paper, the strategy adopted by the\nauthors to address the limitation of the current models for the slow slip\nevents was to use Random Forest machine learning algorithm to construct a model\ncapable to predict GPS displacement measurement from the continuous seismic\ndata. This investigation is sustained in the fact that the statistical features\nof the seismic data are a fingerprint of the fault displacement rate.\nTherefore, predicting GPS data from seismic data can make GPS measurements a\nproxy for investigating the fault slip physics and, additionally, correlate\nthis slow slip events with associated tremors that can be studied in\nlaboratory. The purpose of this report is to expose the methodology adopted by\nthe authors and try to reproduce their results as coherent as possible with the\noriginal work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 14:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

However, so far,\nthe focus of developing drift detectors is on detection quality, e.g.~accuracy,\nbut not on computational performance, such as running time. We show that the\nprevious works consider computational performance only as a secondary objective\nand do not have a benchmark for such evaluation.

However, three typical issues\nseriously affect the training efficiency and the performance of the dispatch\nagent, namely, the difficulty of quantifying the transient instability level,\nthe high dimensionality of the state space and action space, and the frequent\ngeneration of actions that correspond to non-convergent power flows during the\nearly training stage. To address these issues, a fast-converged DRL method for\nTSC-OPF is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a transient security constraint\ntranscription method based on the simulation time duration of instability is\nproposed to quantify the instability level. Secondly, a general method for\nMarkov decision process modeling of TSC-OPF is proposed to decrease the\ndimensionality of the observation space. Finally, two general improvement\ntechniques for off-policy DRL algorithms are proposed. A warm-up training\ntechnique is introduced to improve the efficiency of agents learning how to\ngenerate actions that lead to convergent power flows. A parallel exploration\ntechnique is adopted to improve the efficiency of agents exploring the action\nspace. Based on the above studies, environments for TSC-OPF with the objectives\nof minimizing generation cost and minimizing control cost are constructed and\ndispatch agents are built and trained. The proposed method is tested in the\nIEEE 39-bus system and a practical 710-bus regional power grid.

They are strongly localized deformations often associated with the\nformation of leads and pressure ridges. Viscous-plastic sea-ice models start to\nproduce LKFs at high spatial grid resolution, typically with a grid spacing\nbelow 5 km. A recent study showed that the placement of the variables on the\ngrid plays an important role for the number of simulated LKFs. The study found\nthat a nonconforming finite element discretization with a CD-grid placement\n(CD1) resolves more LKFs per degree of freedom compared to more common A,B and\nC-grids. A new CD-grid formulation (CD2) has just been proposed based on a\nconforming subgrid discretization.

We\nfound that the CD1 setup simulates more deformation structure than the CD2\napproximation. This highlights the importance of the type of spatial\ndiscretization for the simulation of LKFs.

This paradigm, i.e., tool learning with foundation\nmodels, combines the strengths of specialized tools and foundation models to\nachieve enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and automation in problem-solving.\nDespite its immense potential, there is still a lack of a comprehensive\nunderstanding of key challenges, opportunities, and future endeavors in this\nfield. To this end, we present a systematic investigation of tool learning in\nthis paper. We first introduce the background of tool learning, including its\ncognitive origins, the paradigm shift of foundation models, and the\ncomplementary roles of tools and models. Then we recapitulate existing tool\nlearning research into tool-augmented and tool-oriented learning. We formulate\na general tool learning framework: starting from understanding the user\ninstruction, models should learn to decompose a complex task into several\nsubtasks, dynamically adjust their plan through reasoning, and effectively\nconquer each sub-task by selecting appropriate tools. We also discuss how to\ntrain models for improved tool-use capabilities and facilitate the\ngeneralization in tool learning. Considering the lack of a systematic tool\nlearning evaluation in prior works, we experiment with 17 representative tools\nand show the potential of current foundation models in skillfully utilizing\ntools. Finally, we discuss several open problems that require further\ninvestigation for tool learning. Overall, we hope this paper could inspire\nfuture research in integrating tools with foundation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 15:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Compared to the Deuterium-Tritium reaction a much higher reaction\ntemperature is required. Moreover, bremsstrahlung energy losses due to the high\nnuclear charge of boron deem it seemingly apparent than a fusion reactor based\non Deuterium-Tritium plasma in equilibrium is to say the least very\ndifficult.It is becoming more appealing to collide intense laser beams or\naccelerated proton beams with a boron target to produce p-$^{11}$B reactions.\nThe fusion yield of p-$^{11}$B reactions is closely related to proton beam\nparameters and boron target conditions such as density, temperature, and\ningredients. Quantum degeneracy will increase fusion yields by reducing the\nstopping power of injected protons. In this work, we suggest a high-efficiency\nscheme for beam-target p-$^{11}$B fusions via injecting a MeV proton beam into\na highly compressed quantum degenerated boron target. Such a boron target can\nbe achieved via quasi-isentropic compression of solid boron by using precisely\nshaped laser pulses. Our results indicate that for densities ranging from\n$10^3$ to $10^4\\rho_s$, where $\\rho_s$ is the density of solid boron,\ncontributions of bound and free electrons to the stopping of protons can be\ncompletely disregarded and dramatically reduced respectively. The result is an\nincrease in fusion yield by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, in order to\nachieve multiplication factor $F$ greater than one, with $F$ defined as the\nratio of output fusion energy to the energy of injected protons, it is found\nthere exits a minimum possible density of boron target, which is $2.15 \\times\n10^4 \\rho_s$ when the kinetic energy of injected protons is $0.8$ MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 15:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Concatenated codes, which\ncombine multiple layers of quantum codes, offer a powerful technique for\nachieving high levels of error correction with a relatively low resource\noverhead. In this paper, we examine the concatenation of graph codes using the\npowerful and versatile graphical language of ZX-calculus.

It aims at\nestimating future SoH based on historical aging data. Most existing deep\nlearning methods rely on filter-based feature extractors (e.g., CNN or Kalman\nfilters) and recurrent time sequence models. Though efficient, they generally\nignore cyclic features and the domain gap between training and testing\nbatteries. To address this problem, we present CyFormer, a transformer-based\ncyclic time sequence model for SoH prediction. Instead of the conventional\nCNN-RNN structure, we adopt an encoder-decoder architecture. In the encoder,\nrow-wise and column-wise attention blocks effectively capture intra-cycle and\ninter-cycle connections and extract cyclic features. In the decoder, the SoH\nqueries cross-attend to these features to form the final predictions. We\nfurther utilize a transfer learning strategy to narrow the domain gap between\nthe training and testing set. To be specific, we use fine-tuning to shift the\nmodel to a target working condition. Finally, we made our model more efficient\nby pruning. The experiment shows that our method attains an MAE of 0.75\\% with\nonly 10\\% data for fine-tuning on a testing battery, surpassing prior methods\nby a large margin. Effective and robust, our method provides a potential\nsolution for all cyclic time sequence prediction tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 02:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

However, despite significant advancements in\nalgorithm design, the test problems in STO are not well designed. Oftentimes,\nthey are either randomly assembled by other benchmark functions that have\nidentical optima or are generated from practical problems that exhibit limited\nvariations. The relationships between the optimal solutions of source and\ntarget tasks in these problems are manually configured and thus monotonous,\nlimiting their ability to represent the diverse relationships of real-world\nproblems. Consequently, the promising results achieved by many algorithms on\nthese problems are highly biased and difficult to be generalized to other\nproblems. In light of this, we first introduce a few rudimentary concepts for\ncharacterizing STO problems (STOPs) and present an important problem feature\noverlooked in previous studies, namely similarity distribution, which\nquantitatively delineates the relationship between the optima of source and\ntarget tasks. Then, we propose general design guidelines and a problem\ngenerator with superior extendibility.

Lastly, a\nbenchmark suite with 12 individual STOPs is developed using the proposed\ngenerator, which can serve as an arena for comparing different STO algorithms.\nThe source code of the benchmark suite is available at\nhttps://github.com/XmingHsueh/STOP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 06:48:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 12:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

It is presented as a new generalization of usual\ngeometry, both encompassing and going beyond the Riemannian framework, within a\npurely algebraic formalism. Like Riemannian geometry, NCG also has links with\nphysics. Indeed, NCG provided a powerful framework for the reformulation of the\nStandard Model of Particle Physics (SMPP), taking into account General\nRelativity, in a single \"geometric\" representation, based on Non-Commutative\nGauge Theories (NCGFT). Moreover, this accomplishment provides a convenient\nframework to study various possibilities to go beyond the SMPP, such as Grand\nUnified Theories (GUTs). This thesis intends to show an elegant method recently\ndeveloped by Thierry Masson and myself, which proposes a general scheme to\nelaborate GUTs in the framework of NCGFTs. This concerns the study of NCGFTs\nbased on approximately finite $C^*$-algebras (AF-algebras), using either\nderivations of the algebra or spectral triples to build up the underlying\ndifferential structure of the Gauge Theory. The inductive sequence defining the\nAF-algebra is used to allow the construction of a sequence of NCGFTs of\nYang-Mills Higgs types, so that the rank $n+1$ can represent a grand unified\ntheory of the rank $n$. The main advantage of this framework is that it\ncontrols, using appropriate conditions, the interaction of the degrees of\nfreedom along the inductive sequence on the AF algebra.

There are two types of data\nemployed to train reinforcement learning (RL) model for position allocation,\nnamed strategy data and random data. Strategy data is collected from the\ncurrent online model, it suffers from an imbalanced distribution of\nstate-action pairs, resulting in severe overestimation problems during\ntraining. On the other hand, random data offers a more uniform distribution of\nstate-action pairs, but is challenging to obtain in industrial scenarios as it\ncould negatively impact platform revenue and user experience due to random\nexploration. As the two types of data have different distributions, designing\nan effective strategy to leverage both types of data to enhance the efficacy of\nthe RL model training has become a highly challenging problem. In this study,\nwe propose a framework named Multi-Distribution Data Learning (MDDL) to address\nthe challenge of effectively utilizing both strategy and random data for\ntraining RL models on mixed multi-distribution data. Specifically, MDDL\nincorporates a novel imitation learning signal to mitigate overestimation\nproblems in strategy data and maximizes the RL signal for random data to\nfacilitate effective learning. In our experiments, we evaluated the proposed\nMDDL framework in a real-world position allocation system and demonstrated its\nsuperior performance compared to the previous baseline. MDDL has been fully\ndeployed on the Meituan food delivery platform and currently serves over 300\nmillion users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Meanwhile,\ntheoretical treatments of recommendation frequently address the\ndecision-theoretic nature of the problem, including the need to balance\nexploration and exploitation, via the multi-armed bandits (MABs) framework.\nHowever, MAB-based approaches rely heavily on assumptions about human\npreferences. These preference assumptions are seldom tested using human subject\nstudies, partly due to the lack of publicly available toolkits to conduct such\nstudies. In this work, we conduct a study with crowdworkers in a comics\nrecommendation MABs setting. Each arm represents a comic category, and users\nprovide feedback after each recommendation. We check the validity of core MABs\nassumptions-that human preferences (reward distributions) are fixed over\ntime-and find that they do not hold.

A conversion scheme is proposed to\nobtain competitive accuracy by mapping trained ANNs' parameters to SNNs with\nthe same structures. However, an enormous number of time steps are required for\nthese converted SNNs, thus losing the energy-efficient benefit. Utilizing both\nthe accuracy advantages of ANNs and the computing efficiency of SNNs, a novel\nSNN training framework is proposed, namely layer-wise ANN-to-SNN knowledge\ndistillation (LaSNN). In order to achieve competitive accuracy and reduced\ninference latency, LaSNN transfers the learning from a well-trained ANN to a\nsmall SNN by distilling the knowledge other than converting the parameters of\nANN.

The system then signals the vehicles behind the\ndriver using colored lights to inform them of the safe overtaking distance. The\nproposed system has been implemented using Stereo vision for distance analysis\nand You Only Look Once (YOLO) for object identification.

In this paper, we propose an effective\noil spill image segmentation network named SRCNet by leveraging SAR image\nrepresentation and the training for oil spill segmentation simultaneously.\nSpecifically, our proposed segmentation network is constructed with a pair of\ndeep neural nets with the collaboration of the seminal representation that\ndescribes SAR images, where one deep neural net is the generative net which\nstrives to produce oil spill segmentation maps, and the other is the\ndiscriminative net which trys its best to distinguish between the produced and\nthe true segmentations, and they thus built a two-player game. Particularly,\nthe seminal representation exploited in our proposed SRCNet originates from SAR\nimagery, modelling with the internal characteristics of SAR images. Thus, in\nthe training process, the collaborated seminal representation empowers the\nmapped generative net to produce accurate oil spill segmentation maps\nefficiently with small amount of training data, promoting the discriminative\nnet reaching its optimal solution at a fast speed. Therefore, our proposed\nSRCNet operates effective oil spill segmentation in an economical and efficient\nmanner. Additionally, to increase the segmentation capability of the proposed\nsegmentation network in terms of accurately delineating oil spill details in\nSAR images, a regularisation term that penalises the segmentation loss is\ndevised. This encourages our proposed SRCNet for accurately segmenting oil\nspill areas from SAR images. Empirical experimental evaluations from different\nmetrics validate the effectiveness of our proposed SRCNet for oil spill image\nsegmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 13:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

We\nup-sample the acquired low-resolution image through a vision-based\ninterpolation method; then, we train a learning-based model to improve the\nquality of the up-sampling. We qualitatively and quantitatively test our model\non different anatomical districts (e.g., cardiac, obstetric) images and with\ndifferent up-sampling resolutions (i.e., 2X, 4X). Our method improves the PSNR\nmedian value with respect to SOTA methods of $1.7\\%$ on obstetric 2X raw\nimages, $6.1\\%$ on cardiac 2X raw images, and $4.4\\%$ on abdominal raw 4X\nimages; it also improves the number of pixels with a low prediction error of\n$9.0\\%$ on obstetric 4X raw images, $5.2\\%$ on cardiac 4X raw images, and\n$6.2\\%$ on abdominal 4X raw images.\n  The proposed method is then applied to the spatial super-resolution of 2D\nvideos, by optimising the sampling of lines acquired by the probe in terms of\nthe acquisition frequency. Our method specialises trained networks to predict\nthe high-resolution target through the design of the network architecture and\nthe loss function, taking into account the anatomical district and the\nup-sampling factor and exploiting a large ultrasound data set. The use of deep\nlearning on large data sets overcomes the limitations of vision-based\nalgorithms that are general and do not encode the characteristics of the data.\nFurthermore, the data set can be enriched with images selected by medical\nexperts to further specialise the individual networks. Through learning and\nhigh-performance computing, our super-resolution is specialised to different\nanatomical districts by training multiple networks. Furthermore, the\ncomputational demand is shifted to centralised hardware resources with a\nreal-time execution of the network's prediction on local devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 15:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Results: We propose\nDeepEIK, a unified deep learning framework that incorporates both explicit and\nimplicit knowledge for AI drug discovery. We adopt feature fusion to process\nthe multi-modal inputs, and leverage the attention mechanism to denoise the\ntext information. Experiments show that DeepEIK significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on crucial tasks in AI drug discovery including\ndrug-target interaction prediction, drug property prediction and\nprotein-protein interaction prediction.
