To\ndate, substructures containing significant buildup of stellar mass and actively\nforming stars have yet to be found in typical (i.e., main-sequence) SFGs at $z\n> 2$. This is due to the strong dust attenuation common in massive galaxies at\nthe epoch and the scarcity of high-resolution, high-sensitivity\nextinction-independent imaging. To search for disk substructures, we subtracted\nthe central stellar-mass disk from the JWST/NIRCam rest-frame 1.2 $\\mu$m image\n($0.13''$ resolution) and subtracted, in the visibility plane, the central\nstarburst disk from ALMA rest-frame 240 $\\mu$m observations ($0.03''$\nresolution). The residual images revealed substructures at rest-frame 1.2\n$\\mu$m co-located with those found at rest-frame 240 $\\mu$m, $\\simeq 2$ kpc\naway from the galactic center. The largest substructure contains $\\simeq20$% of\nthe total stellar mass and $\\simeq5$% of the total SFR of the galaxy. While\nUDF2 exhibits a kinematically-ordered velocity field of molecular gas\nconsistent with a secularly evolving disk, more sensitive observations are\nrequired to characterize the nature and the origin of this substructure (spiral\narms, minor merger, or other types of disk instabilities). UDF2 resides in an\noverdense region ($N \\geqslant 4$ massive galaxies within 70 kpc projected\ndistance at $z=2.690-2.697$) and the substructures may be associated with\ninteraction-induced instabilities. Importantly, a statistical sample of such\nsubstructures identified with JWST and ALMA could play a key role in bridging\nthe gap between the bulge-forming starburst and the rest of the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 16:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

The current approach, symmetry-invariant perturbation\ntheory is a first principles method with no adjustable parameters. An adiabatic\nevolution is employed to transfer the well-known Pauli restrictions for\nidentical, independent particles with two spin values to restrictions on the\ncollective modes of an ensemble of ``spin up'' ``spin down'' particles. The\ncollective modes, analytic N-body normal modes, are obtained from a group\ntheoretic exact solution of the first-order equations. Cooper pairing is\nreinterpreted not as the pairing of two fermions with total zero momentum, but\nas the convergence of the momentum of the entire ensemble to two values, +k and\n-k, as the particles in the normal mode move back and forth with a single\nfrequency and phase. The Fermi sea and Pauli blocking, commonly described using\nindependent fermions that occupy lower states to create a ``sea'' in energy\nspace and block occupation is redescribed as a collective energy phenomena of\nthe entire ensemble. Superfluidity, which has always been viewed as a\ncollective phenomena as Cooper pairs are assumed to condense into a macroscopic\noccupation of a single lowest state, is now reimagined without two-body pairing\nin real space, but as a macroscopic occupation of a low-energy phonon normal\nmode resulting in the convergence of the momentum to two equal and opposite\nvalues.

Their FIR luminosities are 2.2\n- 6.4 $\\times$ 10$^{12} L_{\\odot}$, and star formation rates are $\\sim$ 400 -\n1200 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We also calculated the SMGs differential and\ncumulative number counts in a combined area of $\\sim$ 620 arcmin$^2$. To a\n$4\\sigma$ detection (at $\\sim$ 5.5 mJy), SMGs overdensity is\n$0.68^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$($\\pm0.19$), exceeding the blank field source counts by a\nfactor of 1.68. We find that 13/54 quasars show overdensities (at $\\sim$ 5.5\nmJy) of $\\delta_{SMG}\\sim$ 1.5 - 5.4. The combined area of these 13 quasars\nexceeds the blank field counts with the overdensity to 5.5 mJy of \\dsmg $\\sim$\n$2.46^{+0.64}_{-0.55}$($\\pm0.25$) in the regions of $\\sim$ 150 arcmin$^2$.\nHowever, the excess is insignificant on the bright end (e.g., 7.5 mJy). We also\ncompare results with previous environmental studies of Lyman alpha emitters\n(LAEs) and Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs) on a similar scale. Our survey presents\nthe first systematic study of the environment of quasars at $z\\sim6$. The newly\ndiscovered SMGs provide essential candidates for follow-up spectroscopic\nobservations to test whether they reside in the same large-scale structures as\nthe quasars and search for protoclusters at an early epoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 17:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

However, the\nperformance of masked feature reconstruction naturally relies on the\ndiscriminability of the input features and is usually vulnerable to disturbance\nin the features. In this paper, we present a masked self-supervised learning\nframework GraphMAE2 with the goal of overcoming this issue. The idea is to\nimpose regularization on feature reconstruction for graph SSL. Specifically, we\ndesign the strategies of multi-view random re-mask decoding and latent\nrepresentation prediction to regularize the feature reconstruction. The\nmulti-view random re-mask decoding is to introduce randomness into\nreconstruction in the feature space, while the latent representation prediction\nis to enforce the reconstruction in the embedding space. Extensive experiments\nshow that GraphMAE2 can consistently generate top results on various public\ndatasets, including at least 2.45% improvements over state-of-the-art baselines\non ogbn-Papers100M with 111M nodes and 1.6B edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 17:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

Fine meshes\nthat are required to accurately compute the PDE solution introduce an enormous\nnumber of parameters and require large scale computing resources such as more\nprocessors and more memory to solve such systems in a reasonable time. For\ninverse problems constrained by time dependent PDEs, the adjoint method that is\noften employed to efficiently compute gradients and higher order derivatives\nrequires solving a time-reversed, so-called adjoint PDE that depends on the\nforward PDE solution at each timestep. This necessitates the storage of a high\ndimensional forward solution vector at every timestep. Such a procedure quickly\nexhausts the available memory resources. Several approaches that trade\nadditional computation for reduced memory footprint have been proposed to\nmitigate the memory bottleneck, including checkpointing and compression\nstrategies. In this work, we propose a close-to-ideal scalable compression\napproach using autoencoders to eliminate the need for checkpointing and\nsubstantial memory storage, thereby reducing both the time-to-solution and\nmemory requirements. We compare our approach with checkpointing and an\noff-the-shelf compression approach on an earth-scale ill-posed seismic inverse\nproblem. The results verify the expected close-to-ideal speedup for both the\ngradient and Hessian-vector product using the proposed autoencoder compression\napproach. To highlight the usefulness of the proposed approach, we combine the\nautoencoder compression with the data-informed active subspace (DIAS) prior to\nshow how the DIAS method can be affordably extended to large scale problems\nwithout the need of checkpointing and large memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 17:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

In this work we explore the connection between environment and nuclear\nactivity by evaluating the variation in the incidence of ionized outflows in\nAGN across different environments.

TTA methods leverage unlabeled data at test time\nto adapt to distribution shifts. Though many effective methods have been\nproposed, their impressive performance usually comes at the cost of\nsignificantly increased computation budgets. Current evaluation protocols\noverlook the effect of this extra computation cost, affecting their real-world\napplicability. To address this issue, we propose a more realistic evaluation\nprotocol for TTA methods, where data is received in an online fashion from a\nconstant-speed data stream, thereby accounting for the method's adaptation\nspeed. We apply our proposed protocol to benchmark several TTA methods on\nmultiple datasets and scenarios. Extensive experiments shows that, when\naccounting for inference speed, simple and fast approaches can outperform more\nsophisticated but slower methods. For example, SHOT from 2020 outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art method SAR from 2023 under our online setting.

Thus the GW signal will be\namplified, deflected, and delayed in time. Through analysing the lensed GW\nwaveform, physical properties of the lens can be inferred. On the other hand,\nneglecting lensing effects in the analysis of GW data may induce systematic\nerrors in the estimating of source parameters. As a space-borne GW detector,\nTianQin will be launched in the 2030s. It is expected to detect dozens of MBHBs\nmerger as far as z = 15, and thus will have high probability to detect at least\none lensed event during the mission lifetime. In this article, we discuss the\ncapability of TianQin to detect lensed MBHBs signals. Three lens models are\nconsidered in this work: the point mass model, the SIS model, and the NFW\nmodel. The sensitive frequency band for space-borne GW detectors is around\nmilli-hertz, and the corresponding GW wavelength could be comparable to the\nlens gravitational length scale, which requires us to account for wave\ndiffraction effects. In calculating lensed waveforms, we adopt the\napproximation of geometric optics at high frequencies to accelerate\ncomputation, while precisely evaluate the diffraction integral at low\nfrequencies. Through a Fisher analysis, we analyse the accuracy to estimate the\nlens parameters. We find that the accuracy can reach to the level of 10^-3 for\nthe mass of point mass and SIS lens, and to the level of 10^-5 for the density\nof NFW lens. We also assess the impact on the accurate of estimating the source\nparameters, and find that the improvement of the accuracy is dominated by the\nincreasing of SNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 18:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

The simplest and most popular choice is the \"two-stream method\" which\nis often used to produce simple yet effective models for radiative transfer in\nscattering and absorbing media. Toon et al. (1989) (Toon89) outlined a\ntwo-stream method for computing reflected light and thermal spectra and was\nlater implemented in the open-source radiative transfer model PICASO. In Part~I\nof this series, we developed an analytical spherical harmonics method for\nsolving the radiative transfer equation for reflected solar radiation (Rooney\net al. 2023), which was implemented in PICASO to increase the accuracy of the\ncode by offering a higher-order approximation. This work is an extension of\nthis spherical harmonics derivation to study thermal emission spectroscopy. We\nhighlight the model differences in the approach for thermal emission and\nbenchmark the 4-term method (SH4) against Toon89 and a high-stream\ndiscrete-ordinates method, CDISORT. By comparing the spectra produced by each\nmodel we demonstrate that the SH4 method provides a significant increase in\naccuracy, compared to Toon89, which can be attributed to the increased order of\napproximation and to the choice of phase function.

A goal in designing such secluded partitions is to\nminimize $k$ while making $\\varepsilon$ as large as possible. This partition\nproblem has connections to a diverse range of topics, including deterministic\nrounding schemes, pseudodeterminism, replicability, as well as Sperner/KKM-type\nresults.\n  In this work, we establish near-optimal relationships between $k$ and\n$\\varepsilon$.

This has important consequences on\nheating, acceleration and transport processes connected with KAWs.\nHistorically, KAWs generation by mode conversion of SAWs in laboratory plasmas\nand their strong damping/absorption right after SAW mode conversion have been\ninvestigated for plasma heating. Here, we focus on the opposite limit: a mode\nconverted KAW weakly absorbed in a periodic magnetized plasma cylinder. We show\nthat a KAW may be excited as resonant cavity mode in the region between the\nmagnetic axis and the SAW resonant layer generated externally by an antenna\nlauncher; this process is qualitatively similar to mode converted electron\nBernstein waves. In this way, large amplitude KAWs may be generated time\nasymptotically with relatively small coupled antenna power. This case has\nlittle or no relevance for plasma heating but interesting nonlinear\nimplications for plasma equilibrium. In particular, we demonstrate that KAWs\nmay generate convective cells (CCs) by modulational instability, that a\nconsequence of plasma nonuniformity is the azimuthal symmetry breaking due to\nplasma diamagnetic effects, that the modulational instability growth rate is\nenhanced over the corresponding uniform plasma limit, that the unstable\nparameter space is extended, and that the cylindrical geometry causes a complex\ninterplay between nonlinearity and nonuniformity. As a result, we show that it\nis possible to control the CC radial structures and the corresponding parallel\nelectric field generation not only by means of the antenna frequency but also\nby fine tuning of its amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 20:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

This means that it can\n(optionally) be used to perform pre-capture calibration using classical\ncalibration targets, and can later be used to perform calibration or refinement\nduring 3D reconstruction, e.g., while optimizing a radiance field. To evaluate\nthe performance of our proposed model, we create a comprehensive dataset\nassembled from the Lensfun database with a multitude of lenses. Using this and\nother real-world datasets, we show that the quality of our proposed lens model\noutperforms standard packages as well as recent approaches while being much\neasier to use and extend. The model generalizes across many lens types and is\ntrivial to integrate into existing 3D reconstruction and rendering systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 20:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

For us, tropicalization is\nunderstood in the broader sense of a process that associates idempotent\nalgebraic objects to the usual ones from algebraic geometry.\n  This goal is achieved by first building the affine case and then globalizing\nthe construction in a functorial way for a fixed affine open covering of a\ngiven scheme. Our constructions are possible thanks to the algebraic\ninterpretation of order-theoretic structures through the theory of commutative\nalgebra for idempotent semirings.\n  We define the notions of realizable semirings and realizable semimodules, and\nwe show that they are suitable for our formalism due to the fact that their\nlattices of subobjects are, in a precise way, a combinatorial reflection of\nlattices coming from commutative algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 21:32:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 20:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

Measuring and quantifying\nbias and its sources is a challenging task and has been extensively studied in\nimage captioning. Despite the significant effort in this direction, we observed\nthat existing metrics lack consistency in the inclusion of the visual signal.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new bias assessment metric, dubbed\n$ImageCaptioner^2$, for image captioning. Instead of measuring the absolute\nbias in the model or the data, $ImageCaptioner^2$ pay more attention to the\nbias introduced by the model w.r.t the data bias, termed bias amplification.\nUnlike the existing methods, which only evaluate the image captioning\nalgorithms based on the generated captions only, $ImageCaptioner^2$\nincorporates the image while measuring the bias. In addition, we design a\nformulation for measuring the bias of generated captions as prompt-based image\ncaptioning instead of using language classifiers. Finally, we apply our\n$ImageCaptioner^2$ metric across 11 different image captioning architectures on\nthree different datasets, i.e., MS-COCO caption dataset, Artemis V1, and\nArtemis V2, and on three different protected attributes, i.e., gender, race,\nand emotions. Consequently, we verify the effectiveness of our\n$ImageCaptioner^2$ metric by proposing AnonymousBench, which is a novel human\nevaluation paradigm for bias metrics. Our metric shows significant superiority\nover the recent bias metric; LIC, in terms of human alignment, where the\ncorrelation scores are 80% and 54% for our metric and LIC, respectively.

The point-wise annotation of\nground truth normals is vulnerable to inefficiency and inaccuracies, which\ntotally makes it impossible to build perfect real datasets for supervised deep\nlearning. To overcome the challenge, we propose a multi-sample consensus\nparadigm for unsupervised normal estimation. The paradigm consists of\nmulti-candidate sampling, candidate rejection, and mode determination. The\nlatter two are driven by neighbor point consensus and candidate consensus\nrespectively. Two primary implementations of the paradigm, MSUNE and MSUNE-Net,\nare proposed. MSUNE minimizes a candidate consensus loss in mode determination.\nAs a robust optimization method, it outperforms the cutting-edge supervised\ndeep learning methods on real data at the cost of longer runtime for sampling\nenough candidate normals for each query point. MSUNE-Net, the first\nunsupervised deep normal estimator as far as we know, significantly promotes\nthe multi-sample consensus further. It transfers the three online stages of\nMSUNE to offline training. Thereby its inference time is 100 times faster.\nBesides that, more accurate inference is achieved, since the candidates of\nquery points from similar patches can form a sufficiently large candidate set\nimplicitly in MSUNE-Net. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the two\nproposed unsupervised methods are noticeably superior to some supervised deep\nnormal estimators on the most common synthetic dataset. More importantly, they\nshow better generalization ability and outperform all the SOTA conventional and\ndeep methods on three real datasets: NYUV2, KITTI, and a dataset from PCV [1].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 22:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

The EVKG encapsulates essential EV-related\nknowledge, including EV adoption, electric vehicle supply equipment, and\nelectricity transmission network, to support decision-making related to EV\ntechnology development, infrastructure planning, and policy-making by providing\ntimely and accurate information and analysis. To enrich and contextualize the\nEVKG, we integrate the developed EV-relevant ontology modules from existing\nwell-known knowledge graphs and ontologies. This integration enables\ninteroperability with other knowledge graphs in the Linked Data Open Cloud,\nenhancing the EVKG's value as a knowledge hub for EV decision-making. Using six\ncompetency questions, we demonstrate how the EVKG can be used to answer various\ntypes of EV-related questions, providing critical insights into the EV\necosystem. Our EVKG provides an efficient and effective approach for managing\nthe complex and diverse EV industry. By consolidating critical EV-related\nknowledge into a single, easily accessible resource, the EVKG supports\ndecision-makers in making informed choices about EV technology development,\ninfrastructure planning, and policy-making.

We used rotating rigid objects that can appear rigid or non-rigid\nto test whether shape features contribute to rigidity perception. When two\ncircular rings were rigidly linked at an angle and jointly rotated at moderate\nspeeds, observers reported that the rings wobbled and were not linked rigidly\nbut rigid rotation was reported at slow speeds. When gaps, paint or vertices\nwere added, the rings appeared rigidly rotating even at moderate speeds. At\nhigh speeds, all configurations appeared non-rigid. Salient features thus\ncontribute to rigidity at slow and moderate speeds, but not at high speeds.\nSimulated responses of arrays of motion-energy cells showed that motion flow\nvectors are predominantly orthogonal to the contours of the rings, not parallel\nto the rotation direction. A convolutional neural network trained to\ndistinguish flow patterns for wobbling versus rotation, gave a high probability\nof wobbling for the motion-energy flows. However, the CNN gave high\nprobabilities of rotation for motion flows generated by tracking features with\narrays of MT pattern-motion cells and corner detectors.

This paper describes the training process of a DRL\npolicy on hardware of an SEA pendulum system for tracking force control\ntrajectories from 0.05 - 0.35 Hz at 50 N amplitude using the Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) algorithm. Safety mechanisms are developed and utilized for\ntraining the policy for 12 hours (overnight) without an operator present within\nthe full 21 hours training period. The tracking performance is evaluated\nshowing improvements of $25$ N in mean absolute error when comparing the first\n18 min. of training to the full 21 hours for a 50 N amplitude, 0.1 Hz sinusoid\ndesired force trajectory. Finally, the DRL policy exhibits better tracking and\nstability margins when compared to a model-free PID controller for a 50 N chirp\nforce trajectory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 00:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

Blossom thinning is one of the crucial crop load\nmanagement practices to achieve desired crop load, fruit quality, and return\nbloom. While several techniques such as chemical, and mechanical thinning are\navailable for large-scale blossom thinning such approaches often yield\nunpredictable thinning results and may cause damage the canopy, spurs, and leaf\ntissue. Hence, growers still depend on laborious, labor intensive and expensive\nmanual hand blossom thinning for desired thinning outcomes. This research\npresents a robotic solution for blossom thinning in apple orchards using a\ncomputer vision system with artificial intelligence, a six degrees of freedom\nrobotic manipulator, and an electrically actuated miniature end-effector for\nrobotic blossom thinning. The integrated robotic system was evaluated in a\ncommercial apple orchard which showed promising results for targeted and\nselective blossom thinning. Two thinning approaches, center and boundary\nthinning, were investigated to evaluate the system ability to remove varying\nproportion of flowers from apple flower clusters. During boundary thinning the\nend effector was actuated around the cluster boundary while center thinning\ninvolved end-effector actuation only at the cluster centroid for a fixed\nduration of 2 seconds. The boundary thinning approach thinned 67.2% of flowers\nfrom the targeted clusters with a cycle time of 9.0 seconds per cluster,\nwhereas center thinning approach thinned 59.4% of flowers with a cycle time of\n7.2 seconds per cluster. When commercially adopted, the proposed system could\nhelp address problems faced by apple growers with current hand, chemical, and\nmechanical blossom thinning approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 01:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

We consider\nsmall-strain deformations of linear elastic solids in the compressible and\nnear-incompressible regimes over quadrilateral (convex and nonconvex) meshes.\nWithin an element, the displacement field is approximated as a linear\ncombination of canonical shape functions that are $\\textit{virtual}$.

In this regard, research in Cooperative Intersection Management (CIM)\nis considered highly significant since it can utilize Vehicle-to-Everything\n(V2X) communication among Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs).

Some recent studies have developed sensors for\nestimating coffee yield at the time of harvest, however a more inclusive and\napplicable technology to remotely monitor multiple parameters of the field and\nestimate coffee yield and quality even at pre-harvest stage, was missing.\nFollowing precision agriculture approach, we employed machine learning\nalgorithm YOLO, for image processing of coffee plant. In this study, the latest\nversion of the state-of-the-art algorithm YOLOv7 was trained with 324 annotated\nimages followed by its evaluation with 82 unannotated images as test data.\nNext, as an innovative approach for annotating the training data, we trained\nK-means models which led to machine-generated color classes of coffee fruit and\ncould thus characterize the informed objects in the image.

Here, we ``defrost'' the frozen star by\nallowing its radial pressure to be perturbatively less negative than maximal.\nThis modification to the equation of state is implemented by appropriately\ndeforming the background metric so as to allow the frozen star to mimic a\nquantum black hole at finite $\\hbar$ and Newton's constant. As a consequence,\nthe defrosted star acquires a non-trivial spectrum of oscillatory\nperturbations. To show this, we first use the Cowling approximation to obtain\ngeneric equations for the energy density and pressure perturbations of a\nstatic, spherically symmetric background with an anisotropic fluid. The\nparticular setting of a deformed frozen star is then considered, for which the\ndispersion relation is obtained to leading order in terms of the deviation from\nmaximal pressure.

A very interesting candidate is primordial black holes (PBHs;\nCarr2016). For the mass ranges of $< 10^{-16} M_{\\odot}$ and $> 100 M_{\\odot}$,\nPBHs have been ruled out. However, they are still poorly constrained in the\nmass ranges of $10^{-16} - 100 M_{\\odot}$ (Belotsky et al. 2019). Fast radio\nbursts (FRBs) are millisecond flashes of radio light of unknown origin mostly\nfrom outside the Milky Way.

We aim at three\ndesirable properties of equilibria. First, equilibria can be naturally realized\nby introducing a mediator into games. Second, an equilibrium can be computed\nefficiently in a distributed fashion. Third, any equilibrium in that class\napproximately maximizes social welfare, as measured by the price of anarchy,\nfor a broad class of games. These three properties allow players to compute an\nequilibrium and realize it via a mediator, thereby settling into a stable state\nwith approximately optimal social welfare. Our main result is the existence of\nan equilibrium concept that satisfies these three properties.\n  Toward this goal, we characterize various (non-equivalent) extensions of\ncorrelated equilibria, collectively known as Bayes correlated equilibria. In\nparticular, we focus on communication equilibria (also known as coordination\nmechanisms), which can be realized by a mediator who gathers each player's\nprivate information and then sends correlated recommendations to the players.\nWe show that if each player minimizes a variant of regret called untruthful\nswap regret in repeated play of Bayesian games, the empirical distribution of\nthese dynamics converges to a communication equilibrium. We present an\nefficient algorithm for minimizing untruthful swap regret with a sublinear\nupper bound, which we prove to be tight up to a multiplicative constant.

Radio frequency\n(RF) generators operating at a driving frequency of 1 MHz feed the coils via a\nmatching network with powers of up to 100 kW per driver. These high powers\nentail high voltages, which make the ion source prone to electrical breakdowns\nand arcing, wherefore its reliability is reduced. Moreover, at the ITER\nprototype RF ion source not more than 60% of the power is absorbed by the\nplasma, whereas the rest is lost for heating the RF coil and conducting\nstructures of the driver.

Analyzing\nprivacy amplification via shuffling is a critical component in both\nsingle-message and multi-message shuffle protocols. However, current methods\nused in these two areas are distinct and specific, making them less convenient\nfor protocol designers and practitioners. In this work, we introduce\nvariation-ratio reduction as a unified framework for privacy amplification\nanalyses in the shuffle model. This framework utilizes total variation bounds\nof local messages and probability ratio bounds of other users' blanket\nmessages, converting them to indistinguishable levels. Our results indicate\nthat the framework yields tighter bounds for both single-message and\nmulti-message encoders (e.g., with local DP, local metric DP, or multi-message\nrandomizers).

Conventionally, habitual and goal-directed behaviors are\nconsidered handled by two distinct systems in the brain.

We incorporate both behaviors in one framework by\nintroducing a Bayesian latent variable called \"intention\".

The minimum linewidth\nshows a linear dependence on the actual temperature of the active area,\nconfirming single-mode dynamics based on the nonlinear theory of spin-torque\nnano-oscillation with a single mode. The observed electrostatic gating tuning\noscillation frequency arises from voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy and\nthreshold current of SHNO via modification of the nonlinear damping and/or the\ninterfacial spin-orbit coupling of the magnetic multilayer. In contrast to\npreviously observed two-mode coexistence degrading the spectral purity in\nPy/Pt-based SHNOs with a negligible IPMA, a single coherent spin-wave mode with\na low driven current can be achieved by selecting the ferromagnet layer with a\nsuitable IPMA because the nonlinear mode coupling can be diminished by bringing\nin the PMA field to compensate the easy-plane shape anisotropy. Moreover, the\nsimulations demonstrate that the experimentally observed current and\ngate-voltage modulation of auto-oscillation modes are also closely associated\nwith the nonlinear damping and mode coupling, which are determined by the\nellipticity of magnetization precession.

Detecting so-called out-of-distribution (OoD)\nsamples is crucial in safety-critical applications such as robotically guided\nretinal microsurgery, where distances between the instrument and the retina are\nderived from sequences of 1D images that are acquired by an\ninstrument-integrated optical coherence tomography (iiOCT) probe.\n  Methods: This work investigates the feasibility of using an OoD detector to\nidentify when images from the iiOCT probe are inappropriate for subsequent\nmachine learning-based distance estimation.

Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress\nthese models, in which a trained deep teacher network is used to distill\nknowledge to a smaller student network such that the student learns to mimic\nthe behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the\nstudent with a pre-trained teacher unaware of the student model.

Existing studies on topology-imbalance\nfocus on the location or the local neighborhood structure of nodes, ignoring\nthe global underlying hierarchical properties of the graph, i.e., hierarchy. In\nthe real-world scenario, the hierarchical structure of graph data reveals\nimportant topological properties of graphs and is relevant to a wide range of\napplications.

To address this issue, we propose a self-consistency-driven diffusion\nmodel inspired by the iterative self-consistent parallel imaging (SPIRiT),\nnamely SPIRiT-Diffusion.

One of the motivations of this work\nconcerns geophysics and more particularly the pyroclastic density currents\nwhich are precisely mixtures of pyroclast and lithic fragments and air. They\nare extremely destructive phenomena, capable of devastating urbanised areas,\nand are known to propagate over long distances, even over almost flat\ntopography. Fluidisation of these dense granular flows by pore gas pressure is\none response that could explain this behaviour and must therefore be taken into\naccount in the models. Starting from a gas-solid mixing model and invoking the\ncompressibility of the gas, through a law of state, we rewrite the conservation\nof mass equation of the gas phase into an equation on the pore gas pressure\nwhose net effect is to reduce the friction between the particles. The momentum\nequation of the solid phase is completed by generic constitutive laws,\nspecified as in Schaeffer et al (2019, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 874,\n926-951) by a yield function and a dilatancy function. Therefore, the\ndivergence of the velocity field, which reflects the ability of the granular\nflow to expand or compress, depends on the volume fraction, pressure, strain\nrate and inertial number. In addition, we require the dilatancy function to\ndescribe the rate of volume change of the granular material near an isochoric\nequilibrium state, i.e. at constant volume. This property ensures that the\nvolume fraction, which is the solution to the conservation of mass equation, is\npositive and finite at all times. We also require that the non-isochoric\nfluidised model is linearly stable and dissipates energy (over time). In this\ntheoretical framework, we derive the dilatancy models corresponding to\nclassical rheologies such as Drucker-Prager and $\\mu$(I) (with or without\nexpansion effects).

Training a robust\nclassifier against this crop-related variability requires abundant training\ndata, which is not available in few-shot settings. To mitigate this issue, we\npropose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) based data generation model,\nwhich is capable of generating data with increased crop-related diversity. The\nmain idea is to transform the latent space such latent codes with different\nnorms represent different crop-related variations.

In particular, each latent code is rescaled such that\nits norm linearly correlates with the IoU score of the input crop w.r.t. the\nground-truth box.

However, most previous\napproaches focus mainly on a specific form of trajectories, which means these\nmethods could not be used to forecast heterogeneous trajectories, not to\nmention the dimension-wise interaction. Besides, previous methods mostly treat\ntrajectory prediction as a normal time sequence generation task, indicating\nthat these methods may require more work to directly analyze agents' behaviors\nand social interactions at different temporal scales. In this paper, we bring a\nnew ``view'' for trajectory prediction to model and forecast trajectories\nhierarchically according to different frequency portions from the spectral\ndomain to learn to forecast trajectories by considering their frequency\nresponses. Moreover, we try to expand the current trajectory prediction task by\nintroducing the dimension $M$ from ``another view'', thus extending its\napplication scenarios to heterogeneous trajectories vertically. Finally, we\nadopt the bilinear structure to fuse two factors, including the frequency\nresponse and the dimension-wise interaction, to forecast heterogeneous\ntrajectories via spectrums hierarchically in a generic way. Experiments show\nthat the proposed model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on ETH-UCY,\nStanford Drone Dataset and nuScenes with heterogeneous trajectories, including\n2D coordinates, 2D and 3D bounding boxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 10:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

The low-resolution ADCs induce two challenges on the\ndevice activity detection compared with the traditional setup with the\nassumption of infinite ADC resolution. First, the codebook design for signal\nquantization by the low-resolution ADC is particularly important since a good\ndesign of the codebook can lead to small quantization error on the received\nsignal, which in turn has significant influence on the activity detector\nperformance. To this end, prior information about the received signal power is\nneeded, which depends on the number of active devices $K$. This is sharply\ndifferent from the activity detection problem in traditional setups, in which\nthe knowledge of $K$ is not required by the BS as a prerequisite. Second, the\ncovariance-based approach achieves good activity detection performance in\ntraditional setups while it is not clear if it can still achieve good\nperformance in this paper. To solve the above challenges, we propose a\ncommunication protocol that consists of an estimator for $K$ and a detector for\nactive device identities: 1) For the estimator, the technical difficulty is\nthat the design of the ADC quantizer and the estimation of $K$ are closely\nintertwined and doing one needs the information/execution from the other. We\npropose a progressive estimator which iteratively performs the estimation of\n$K$ and the design of the ADC quantizer; 2) For the activity detector, we\npropose a custom-designed stochastic gradient descent algorithm to estimate the\nactive device identities.

To further minimize the risk of privacy leakage,\nexisting defenses usually require clients to locally modify their gradients\n(e.g., differential privacy) prior to sharing with the server. While these\napproaches are effective in certain cases, they regard the entire data as a\nsingle entity to protect, which usually comes at a large cost in model utility.\nIn this paper, we seek to reconcile utility and privacy in FL by proposing a\nuser-configurable privacy defense, RecUP-FL, that can better focus on the\nuser-specified sensitive attributes while obtaining significant improvements in\nutility over traditional defenses. Moreover, we observe that existing inference\nattacks often rely on a machine learning model to extract the private\ninformation (e.g., attributes).

To\nimprove the transferability to un-queryable black-box adversary models,\ninspired by the idea of meta-learning, RecUP-FL forms a model zoo containing a\nset of substitute models and iteratively alternates between simulations of the\nwhite-box and the black-box adversarial attack scenarios to generate\nperturbations.

The policies were\ntrained with deep reinforcement learning in simulation and successfully\ntransferred to real-world experiments, using coordinated model calibration and\ndomain randomization. We evaluated the effectiveness of tactile information via\ncomparative studies and validated the sim-to-real performance through\nreal-world experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 11:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

In particular, the\ndecision maker will take an action that determines, along with the resolution\nof uncertainty, the payoffs to both players. I delineate the exact level of\ncommitment needed to ensure full revelation: any fully revealing incentive\nscheme is equivalent to a dynamic game wherein each round the decision maker\nproposes a plan of action and the expert chooses to reveal some novel\ncontingencies. The game ends when nothing novel is revealed and the expert\nchooses which of the proposed plans gets implemented. That is, the decision\nmaker must be able to commit that once a plan of action is proposed, it cannot\nbe taken off the table.\n  I then consider the set of robust strategies -- those strategies that\nmaximize the worst case outcome across any possible awareness type of the\nexpert -- and show they are characterized by a principle of myopic optimality:\nat each round, the decision maker maximizes his payoff as if the expert had\nnothing further to reveal. It turns out, this myopic principle also solves the\nmechanism designer's problem: the set of outcomes that are achievable by any\nincentive compatible and Pareto efficient mechanism are delineated by the set\nof robust strategies in the above dynamic game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 11:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

By exploiting a large number of individuals, it is often possible\nto produce effects that go far beyond the capabilities of the smartest\nindividuals, or even to produce intelligent collective behaviour out of\nnot-so-intelligent individuals. Indeed, collective intelligence, namely the\ncapability of a group to act collectively in a seemingly intelligent way, is\nincreasingly often a design goal of engineered computational systems--motivated\nby recent techno-scientific trends like the Internet of Things, swarm robotics,\nand crowd computing, just to name a few. For several years, the collective\nintelligence observed in natural and artificial systems has served as a source\nof inspiration for engineering ideas, models, and mechanisms. Today, artificial\nand computational collective intelligence are recognised research topics,\nspanning various techniques, kinds of target systems, and application domains.\nHowever, there is still a lot of fragmentation in the research panorama of the\ntopic within computer science, and the verticality of most communities and\ncontributions makes it difficult to extract the core underlying ideas and\nframes of reference. The challenge is to identify, place in a common structure,\nand ultimately connect the different areas and methods addressing intelligent\ncollectives. To address this gap, this paper considers a set of broad scoping\nquestions providing a map of collective intelligence research, mostly by the\npoint of view of computer scientists and engineers.

NVMe virtualization\nis crucial in cloud computing as it allows for virtualized NVMe devices to be\nused by virtual machines (VMs), thereby improving the utilization of storage\nresources. However, traditional software-based solutions have flexibility\nbenefits but often come at the cost of performance degradation or high CPU\noverhead. On the other hand, hardware-assisted solutions offer high performance\nand low CPU usage, but their adoption is often limited by the need for special\nhardware support or the requirement for new hardware development.\n  In this paper, we propose LightIOV, a novel software-based NVMe\nvirtualization mechanism that achieves high performance and scalability without\nconsuming valuable CPU resources and without requiring special hardware\nsupport.

Results from our experiments\nshow that LightIOV can provide comparable performance to VFIO, with an IOPS of\n97.6%-100.2% of VFIO.

This orbital transformation causes an orthogonal\ntransformation of the configuration state functions (CSF) spanning the function\nspace of the singlet ground state of C$_2$. Instead of CSFs built from\ncanonical MOs one gets CSFs of orthogonal deformed atomic orbitals (AO). This\napproach resembles the orthogonal valence bond methods (OVB) CSFs which are\nvery different from conventional VB, based on non-orthogonal AOs. To get used\nto the different argumentation, the bonding situation in ethane (single bond),\nethene (double bond), and the nitrogen molecule (triple bond) are also studied.\nThe complex bonding situation in C$_2$ is caused by the possibility to excite\nan electron with spin flip from the doubly occupied 2s AO into the 2p subshell,\nthe resulting high-spin $^5S_u$ state of the carbon atom allows for a better\nreduction of the Pauli repulsion.

This is attributed to the network architecture that\nplays a very important role in the fusion process. However, in general, it is\nhard to specify a good fusion architecture, and consequently, the design of\nfusion networks is still a black art, rather than science. To address this\nproblem, we formulate the fusion task mathematically, and establish a\nconnection between its optimal solution and the network architecture that can\nimplement it. This approach leads to a novel method proposed in the paper of\nconstructing a lightweight fusion network. It avoids the time-consuming\nempirical network design by a trial-and-test strategy. In particular we adopt a\nlearnable representation approach to the fusion task, in which the construction\nof the fusion network architecture is guided by the optimisation algorithm\nproducing the learnable model. The low-rank representation (LRR) objective is\nthe foundation of our learnable model. The matrix multiplications, which are at\nthe heart of the solution are transformed into convolutional operations, and\nthe iterative process of optimisation is replaced by a special feed-forward\nnetwork. Based on this novel network architecture, an end-to-end lightweight\nfusion network is constructed to fuse infrared and visible light images. Its\nsuccessful training is facilitated by a detail-to-semantic information loss\nfunction proposed to preserve the image details and to enhance the salient\nfeatures of the source images.

Prior studies on the energy efficiency of NOMA overlook the\nSIC overhead and rely on simplistic power consumption models (PCM). To fill\nthis gap, we first introduce PCM-$\\kappa$ that accounts for SIC-related power\nexpenditure, where $\\kappa$ represents the average power consumption per SIC\nlayer. Then, to investigate the energy efficiency of NOMA and joint\ntransmission (JT)-CoMP NOMA, we formulate a power allocation problem for\nmaximizing the energy efficiency and consequently propose a global approach\nrunning at a centralized entity and a local algorithm running at a base\nstation. We evaluate the energy efficiency using PCM-$\\kappa$ and two PCMs\ncommonly used in the literature. Numerical analysis suggests that using\nsimplistic PCMs leads to a few orders of magnitude overestimation of energy\nefficiency, especially when the receivers have low rate requirements. Despite\nthe superiority of JT-CoMP NOMA over conventional NOMA in finding a feasible\npower allocation, the difference in their energy efficiency is only marginal.\nMoreover, when conventional NOMA is feasible, the optimal solution for JT-CoMP\nNOMA converges to conventional NOMA and NOMA schemes favour the users with the\nbest channel quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 12:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

We argue that the Resource\nConstrained $\\nu$-net is an appropriate formalism to be used the context of\nconformance checking, which traditionally aligns cases individually failing to\nexpose deviations on inter-case dependencies. We provide formal mathematical\nfoundations of the globally aligned event log based on theory of partially\nordered sets and propose an approximation technique based on the composition of\nindividually aligned cases that resolves inter-case violations locally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 13:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

The three key factors in pretraining foundation models\nare the pretraining method, the size of the pretraining dataset, and the number\nof model parameters. Recently, research in the remote sensing field has focused\nprimarily on the pretraining method and the size of the dataset, with limited\nemphasis on the number of model parameters. This paper addresses this gap by\nexamining the effect of increasing the number of model parameters on the\nperformance of foundation models in downstream tasks such as rotated object\ndetection and semantic segmentation.

The particle\ndiffuses in a harmonic potential (with strength $k$) which is centered around\nthe origin. The center also serves as an absorbing boundary for the particle\nand we denote the first passage time of the particle to the center as $t_f$. In\nthis set-up, we investigate the following functionals: (i) local time $T_{loc}\n= \\int _0^{t_f}d \\tau ~ \\delta (x-x_R)$ i.e., the time a particle spends around\n$x_R$ until the first passage, (ii) occupation or residence time $T_{res} =\n\\int _0^{t_f} d \\tau ~\\theta (x-x_R)$ i.e., the time a particle typically\nspends above $x_R$ until the first passage and (iii) the first passage time\n$t_f$ to the origin.

Such unprecedented interaction experiences may pose considerable\nsocial and psychological risks to the users unless the technology is properly\ncontrolled. This creates an urgent need for scalable and robust evaluation\nmetrics for conversational chatbots. Existing automatic evaluation metrics\nusually focus on objective quality measures and disregard subjective\nperceptions of social dimensions. Moreover, most of these approaches operate on\npre-produced dialogs from available benchmark corpora, which implies human\ninvolvement for preparing the material for evaluation and, thus, impeded\nscalability of the metrics. To address this limitation, we propose to make use\nof the emerging large language models (LLMs) from the GPT-family and describe a\nnew framework allowing to conduct dialog system evaluation with prompting. With\nthis framework, we are able to achieve full automation of the evaluation\npipeline and reach impressive correlation with the human judgement (up to\nPearson r=0.95 on system level).

Defective interfering (DI) elements are a subgroup of DVGs that\nhave been shown to interfere with the replication of the wild-type (WT) virus.\nAlong with DIs, other genetic elements known as satellite RNAs (satRNAs), that\nshow no genetic relatedness with the WT virus, can co-infect cells with WT\nhelper viruses and take advantage of viral proteins for their own benefit.\nThese satRNAs have effects that range from reduced symptom severity to enhanced\nvirulence. The interference dynamics of DIs over WT viruses has been thoroughly\nmodelled at within-cell, within-host, and population levels. However, nothing\nis known about the dynamics resulting from the nonlinear interactions between\nWT viruses and DIs in the presence of satellites, a process that is frequently\nseen in plant RNA viruses and in biomedically relevant pathosystems like\nhepatitis B virus and its $\\delta$ satellite. Here, we look into a\nphenomenological mathematical model that describes how a WT virus replicates\nand produces DIs in presence of a satRNA at the intra-host level. The WT virus\nis subject to mechanisms of complementation, competition, and various levels of\ninterference from DIs and the satRNA. Examining the dynamics analytically and\nnumerically reveals three possible stable states: (i) full extinction, (ii)\nsatellite extinction and virus-DIs coexistence and (iii) full coexistence.\nAssuming DIs replicate faster than the satRNA owed to their smaller size drives\nto scenario (ii), which implies that DIs could wipe out the satRNA. In\naddition, a small region of the parameter space exists wherein the system is\nbistable (either scenarios (ii) or (iii) are concurrently stable).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 14:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

A comparison is\nmade of CME catalogues based on L1 coronagraph imagery and off Sun-Earth line\ncoronagraph and heliospheric imager (HI) observations, for the year 2011.\nAnalysis reveals inconsistencies in the identification of a number of\npotentially Earth-directed CMEs. The catalogues reflect our ability to identify\nand characterise CMEs, so any discrepancies can impact our prediction of\nEarth-directed CMEs. We show that 15 CMEs, which were observed by STEREO, that\nhad estimated directions compatible with Earth-directed events, had no\nidentified halo/partial halo counterpart listed in the L1 coronagraph CME\ncatalogue. In-situ data confirms that for 9 of these there was a consistent L1\nInterplanetary CME (ICME). The number of such \"discrepant\" events is\nsignificant compared to the number of ICMEs recorded at L1 in 2011, stressing\nthe need to address space weather monitoring capabilities, particularly with\nthe inclusion of off Sun-Earth line observation. While the study provides\nevidence that some halo CMEs are simply not visible in near-Earth coronagraph\nimagery, there is evidence that some halo CMEs viewed from L1 are compromised\nby preceding CME remnants or the presence of multiple-CMEs. This underlines (1)\nthe value of multiple vantage point CME observation, and (2) the benefit of off\nSun-Earth line platform heliospheric imaging, and coronagraph imaging, for the\nefficient identification and tracking of Earth-directed events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 14:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Recently,\napproaches that automatically generate reward functions from logical task\nspecifications have been proposed to mitigate this issue; however, they scale\npoorly on long-horizon tasks (i.e., tasks where the agent needs to perform a\nseries of correct actions to reach the goal state, considering future\ntransitions while choosing an action). Employing a curriculum (a sequence of\nincreasingly complex tasks) further improves the learning speed of the agent by\nsequencing intermediate tasks suited to the learning capacity of the agent.\nHowever, generating curricula from the logical specification still remains an\nunsolved problem. To this end, we propose AGCL, Automaton-guided Curriculum\nLearning, a novel method for automatically generating curricula for the target\ntask in the form of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). AGCL encodes the\nspecification in the form of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and then\nuses the DFA along with the Object-Oriented MDP (OOMDP) representation to\ngenerate a curriculum as a DAG, where the vertices correspond to tasks, and\nedges correspond to the direction of knowledge transfer.

This creates an immediate computational challenge on effective\nanalyses of the full data-set. With simulation-based inference (SBI), it is\npossible to attain complex posterior distributions with the accuracy of\ntraditional methods but with a $>10^4$ increase in speed. However, it comes\nwith a major limitation. Standard SBI requires the simulated data to have\nidentical characteristics to the observed data, which is often violated in\nastronomical surveys due to inhomogeneous coverage and/or fluctuating sky and\ntelescope conditions. In this work, we present a complete SBI-based\nmethodology, ``SBI$^{++}$,'' for treating out-of-distribution measurement\nerrors and missing data. We show that out-of-distribution errors can be\napproximated by using standard SBI evaluations and that missing data can be\nmarginalized over using SBI evaluations over nearby data realizations in the\ntraining set. In addition to the validation set, we apply SBI$^{++}$ to\ngalaxies identified in extragalactic images acquired by the James Webb Space\nTelescope, and show that SBI$^{++}$ can infer photometric redshifts at least as\naccurately as traditional sampling methods and crucially, better than the\noriginal SBI algorithm using training data with a wide range of observational\nerrors. SBI$^{++}$ retains the fast inference speed of $\\sim$1 sec for objects\nin the observational training set distribution, and additionally permits\nparameter inference outside of the trained noise and data at $\\sim$1 min per\nobject. This expanded regime has broad implications for future applications to\nastronomical surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 15:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

The spin Hall effect (SHE) and Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) are\nwell-known mechanisms to electrically generate spin accumulation in materials\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), but the exact role of the strength and\ntype of SOC, especially in crystals with low symmetry, has yet to be explained.\nIn this study, we investigate REE in two different families of non-magnetic\nchiral materials, elemental semiconductors (Te and Se) and semimetallic\ndisilicides (TaSi$_2$ and NbSi$_2$), using an approach based on density\nfunctional theory (DFT). By analyzing spin textures across the full Brillouin\nzones and comparing them with REE magnitudes calculated as a function of\nchemical potential, we link specific features in the electronic structure with\nthe efficiency of the induced spin accumulation. Our findings show that\nmagnitudes of REE can be increased by: (i) the presence of purely radial\n(Weyl-type) spin texture manifesting as the parallel spin-momentum locking,\n(ii) high spin polarization of bands along one specific crystallographic\ndirection, (iii) low band velocities. By comparing materials possessing the\nsame crystal structures, but different strengths of SOC, we conclude that\nlarger SOC may indirectly contribute to the enhancement of REE. It yields\ngreater spin-splitting of bands along specific crystallographic directions,\nwhich prevents canceling the contributions from the oppositely spin-polarized\nbands over wider energy regions and helps maintain larger REE magnitudes. We\nbelieve that these results will be useful for designing spintronics devices and\nmay aid further computational studies searching for efficient REE in materials\nwith different symmetries and SOC strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 15:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

FL involves a group of clients with\ndecentralized data who collaborate to learn a common model under the\ncoordination of a centralized server, with the goal of protecting clients'\nprivacy by ensuring that local datasets never leave the clients and that the\nserver only performs model aggregation. However, in realistic scenarios, the\nserver may be able to collect a small amount of data that approximately mimics\nthe population distribution and has stronger computational ability to perform\nthe learning process. To address this, we focus on the hybrid FL framework in\nthis paper. While previous hybrid FL work has shown that the alternative\ntraining of clients and server can increase convergence speed, it has focused\non the scenario where clients fully participate and ignores the negative effect\nof partial participation. In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis of\nhybrid FL under clients' partial participation to validate that partial\nparticipation is the key constraint on convergence speed. We then propose a new\nalgorithm called FedCLG, which investigates the two-fold role of the server in\nhybrid FL.

Secondly, the server's calculated gradient\nneeds to guide the participated clients' training and the server's aggregation.\nWe validate our theoretical findings through numerical experiments, which show\nthat our proposed method FedCLG outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 19:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

However, news coverage for some news events is limited to a specific\ngeographical region because of information spreading barriers, which can be\npolitical, geographical, economic, cultural, or linguistic. In this paper, we\npropose an approach to barrier classification where we infer the semantics of\nnews articles through Wikipedia concepts. To that end, we collected news\narticles and annotated them for different kinds of barriers using the metadata\nof news publishers. Then, we utilize the Wikipedia concepts along with the body\ntext of news articles as features to infer the news-spreading barriers. We\ncompare our approach to the classical text classification methods, deep\nlearning, and transformer-based methods. The results show that the proposed\napproach using Wikipedia concepts based semantic knowledge offers better\nperformance than the usual for classifying the news-spreading barriers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 20:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

The current study conducted a word\nfrequency analysis of this book's English and Chinese versions with LIWC and\nAntConc, and made comparative research into Lin Yutang's attitudinal changes.\nThe results show that due to different writing purposes and readerships, there\nis less anger in Lin's self-translation (M=0.7755, SD=0.2775) than in the first\n11 chapters of the English original (M=1.1036, SD=0.3861), which is a\nsignificant difference (t=2.2892, p=0.0331).

The typical strategy is to\nhave a controlled descent of the spacecraft or to have extremely limited\nshielding, if any, due to the NASA requirement that all impacting parts must\nimpact with no greater than 15J of energy. Given the nature of this mission\nneither a controlled descent nor having no shielding was not an option. This is\nthe issue Wichita State University nuSOL team is facing for its 3U CubeSat\ndemonstrator.\n  The CubeSat will be equipped with scientific equipment with the purpose of\ndetecting solar neutrinos, and the less background noise from Cosmic Rays the\nbetter the study will be. Through simulations, density tests, and burn tests,\nWSU was able to develop an epoxy based shield doped with either iron or\ntungsten powder. The simulations were conducted by firing electrons, protons,\nalpha particles, and oxygen and iron nuclei into the shield material with\nenergies ranging from 1MeV until consistent failure rate using Geant4. The\nstandards for these simulations are the base epoxy at 1.15g per cc to solid\nsteel at 8g per cc . Mixing tests have determined for iron, a density of 4g per\ncc is achievable, which is 53 percent iron by volume. Tungsten epoxy with a\ndensity of 7.5g per cc is more easily achieved, and results in 40 percent\ntungsten by volume.

The high-grade\nbrain tumors are easier to recurrent even after standard treatment. Therefore,\ndeveloping a method to predict brain tumor recurrence location plays an\nimportant role in the treatment planning and it can potentially prolong\npatient's survival time. There is still little work to deal with this issue. In\nthis paper, we present a deep learning-based brain tumor recurrence location\nprediction network. Since the dataset is usually small, we propose to use\ntransfer learning to improve the prediction. We first train a multi-modal brain\ntumor segmentation network on the public dataset BraTS 2021. Then, the\npre-trained encoder is transferred to our private dataset for extracting the\nrich semantic features. Following that, a multi-scale multi-channel feature\nfusion model and a nonlinear correlation learning module are developed to learn\nthe effective features. The correlation between multi-channel features is\nmodeled by a nonlinear equation. To measure the similarity between the\ndistributions of original features of one modality and the estimated correlated\nfeatures of another modality, we propose to use Kullback-Leibler divergence.\nBased on this divergence, a correlation loss function is designed to maximize\nthe similarity between the two feature distributions. Finally, two decoders are\nconstructed to jointly segment the present brain tumor and predict its future\ntumor recurrence location. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work\nthat can segment the present tumor and at the same time predict future tumor\nrecurrence location, making the treatment planning more efficient and precise.\nThe experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method\nto predict the brain tumor recurrence location from the limited dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 02:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

While IoT node power consumption is a major\nconcern for these applications, cloud-based processing is becoming\nunsustainable due to continuous sensor or image data transmission over the\nwireless network. Thus optimized ML capabilities and data transfers should be\nintegrated in the IoT node. Moreover, IoT applications are torn between\nsporadic data-logging and energy-hungry data processing (e.g. image\nclassification). Thus, the versatility of the node is key in addressing this\nwide diversity of energy and processing needs. This paper presents SamurAI, a\nversatile IoT node bridging this gap in processing and in energy by leveraging\ntwo on-chip sub-systems: a low power, clock-less, event-driven\nAlways-Responsive (AR) part and an energy-efficient On-Demand (OD) part.
