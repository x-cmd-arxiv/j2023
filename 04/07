On general graphs, this problem is computationally hard, and this\nhardness holds at arbitrarily low temperatures. At the same time, in recent\nyears, there has been significant progress showing the existence of\nlow-temperature sampling algorithms in various specific families of graphs. Our\naim in this paper is to understand the minimal structural properties of general\ngraphs that enable polynomial-time sampling from the $q$-state ferromagnetic\nPotts model at low temperatures. We study this problem from the perspective of\nthe widely-used Swendsen--Wang dynamics and the closely related random-cluster\ndynamics.\n  Our results demonstrate that the key graph property behind fast or slow\nconvergence time for these dynamics is whether the independent edge-percolation\non the graph admits a strongly supercritical phase. By this, we mean that at\nlarge $p<1$, it has a unique giant component of linear size, and the complement\nof that giant component is comprised of only small components. Specifically, we\nprove that such a condition implies fast mixing of the Swendsen--Wang and\nrandom-cluster dynamics on two general families of bounded-degree graphs: (a)\ngraphs of at most stretched-exponential volume growth and (b) locally treelike\ngraphs. In the other direction, we show that, even among graphs in those\nfamilies, these Markov chains can converge exponentially slowly at arbitrarily\nlow temperatures if the edge-percolation condition does not hold. In the\nprocess, we develop new tools for the analysis of non-local Markov chains,\nincluding a framework to bound the speed of disagreement propagation in the\npresence of long-range correlations, and an understanding of spatial mixing\nproperties on trees with random boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 16:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

However, it has certain limitations. In this\npaper, we propose a new perspective on the effectiveness of spatial attention,\nwhich is that the spatial attention mechanism essentially solves the problem of\nconvolutional kernel parameter sharing. However, the information contained in\nthe attention map generated by spatial attention is not sufficient for\nlarge-size convolutional kernels. Therefore, we propose a novel attention\nmechanism called Receptive-Field Attention (RFA). Existing spatial attention,\nsuch as Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Coordinated Attention\n(CA) focus only on spatial features, which does not fully address the problem\nof convolutional kernel parameter sharing. In contrast, RFA not only focuses on\nthe receptive-field spatial feature but also provides effective attention\nweights for large-size convolutional kernels. The Receptive-Field Attention\nconvolutional operation (RFAConv), developed by RFA, represents a new approach\nto replace the standard convolution operation. It offers nearly negligible\nincrement of computational cost and parameters, while significantly improving\nnetwork performance. We conducted a series of experiments on ImageNet-1k, COCO,\nand VOC datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Of particular\nimportance, we believe that it is time to shift focus from spatial features to\nreceptive-field spatial features for current spatial attention mechanisms.

To mitigate the uncontrollable\nsynthesis effect of the diffusion model, we design an Attribute-Guided\nConditioning Network (AGCN) to adaptively combine the coarse animation features\nand 3D face reconstruction results, which can incorporate appearance and motion\nconditions into the diffusion process. These specific designs help FADM rectify\nunnatural artifacts and distortions, and also enrich high-fidelity facial\ndetails through iterative diffusion refinements with accurate animation\nattributes. FADM can flexibly and effectively improve existing animation\nvideos. Extensive experiments on widely used talking-head benchmarks validate\nthe effectiveness of FADM over prior arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 16:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

At the heart of SLM lies a\nsimple but effective learnable sparse mask, which learns which features to\nselect, and gives rise to a novel objective that provably maximizes the mutual\ninformation (MI) between the selected features and the labels, which can be\nderived from a quadratic relaxation of mutual information from first\nprinciples.

However, algorithms may\nshow bias with respect to various attributes beyond the more obvious ones, and\nintegrity issues related to these more subtle attributes can have serious\nconsequences. To enable the generation of actionable, data-driven hypotheses\nwhich identify specific dataset attributes likely to induce model bias, we\ncontribute a first technique for the rigorous, quantitative screening of\nmedical image datasets. Drawing from literature in the causal inference and\ninformation theory domains, our procedure decomposes the risks associated with\ndataset attributes in terms of their detectability and utility (defined as the\namount of information knowing the attribute gives about a task label). To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and sensitivity of our method, we develop a\nvariety of datasets with synthetically inserted artifacts with different\ndegrees of association to the target label that allow evaluation of inherited\nmodel biases via comparison of performance against true counterfactual\nexamples. Using these datasets and results from hundreds of trained models, we\nshow our screening method reliably identifies nearly imperceptible\nbias-inducing artifacts. Lastly, we apply our method to the natural attributes\nof a popular skin-lesion dataset and demonstrate its success. Our approach\nprovides a means to perform more systematic algorithmic audits and guide future\ndata collection efforts in pursuit of safer and more reliable models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 16:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

Broadly, the goal is to estimate differences in event rates under\ntwo treatments within a defined target population over a specified followup\nwindow. Estimation with observational claims data is challenging because while\nmembership in the target population is defined in terms of eligibility\ncriteria, treatment is rarely assigned exactly at the time of eligibility.\nAd-hoc solutions to this timing misalignment, such as assigning treatment at\neligibility based on subsequent assignment, incorrectly attribute prior event\nrates to treatment - resulting in immortal risk bias. Even if eligibility and\ntreatment are aligned, a terminal event process (e.g. death) often stops the\nrecurrent event process of interest. Both processes are also censored so that\nevents are not observed over the entire followup window. Our approach addresses\nmisalignment by casting it as a treatment switching problem: some patients are\non treatment at eligibility while others are off treatment but may switch to\ntreatment at a specified time - if they survive long enough. We define and\nidentify an average causal effect of switching under specified causal\nassumptions. Estimation is done using a g-computation framework with a joint\nsemiparametric Bayesian model for the death and recurrent event processes.\nComputing the estimand for various switching times allows us to assess the\nimpact of treatment timing.

The nodes gossip\nthe data among themselves in the form of Poisson arrivals to disperse their\nknowledge about the source. The total gossiping rate is bounded by a\nconstraint. The goal of the network is to be as timely as possible with the\nsource. We propose a scheme which we coin \\emph{age sense updating multiple\naccess in networks (ASUMAN)}, which is a distributed opportunistic gossiping\nscheme, where after each time the source updates itself, each node waits for a\ntime proportional to its current age and broadcasts a signal to the other nodes\nof the network.

We calculate the\naverage age for a typical node in such a network with symmetric settings, and\nshow that the theoretical upper bound on the age scales as $O(1)$. ASUMAN, with\nan average age of $O(1)$, offers significant gains compared to a system where\nthe nodes just gossip blindly with a fixed update rate, in which case the age\nscales as $O(\\log n)$. Further, we analyzed the performance of ASUMAN for\nfractional, finitely connected, sublinear and hierarchical cluster networks.\nFinally, we show that the $O(1)$ age scaling can be extended to asymmetric\nsettings as well.

Yet we know little\nabout how politicians focus on, talk about, and portray climate change on\nsocial media. Here we study it from the perspective of political advertisement.\nWe use Meta's Ad Library to collect 602,546 ads that have been issued by US\nCongress members since mid-2018. Out of those only 19,176 (3.2%) are\nclimate-related. Analyzing this data, we find that Democrats focus\nsubstantially more on climate change than Republicans, with 99.7% of all\nclimate-related ads stemming from Democratic politicians. In particular, we\nfind this is driven by a small core of Democratic politicians, where 72% of all\nimpressions can be attributed to 10 politicians. Interestingly, we find a\nsignificant difference in the average amount of impressions generated per\ndollar spent between the two parties. Republicans generate on average 188% more\nimpressions with their climate ads for the same money spent as Democrats. We\nbuild models to explain the differences and find that demographic factors only\npartially explain the variance. Our results demonstrate differences of\nclimate-related advertisements of US congress members and reveal differences in\nadvertising characteristics between the two political parties.

We present Lighting-Aware Neural Field (LANe) for the\ncompositional synthesis of driving scenes in a physically consistent manner.\nSpecifically, we learn a scene representation that disentangles the static\nbackground and transient elements into a world-NeRF and class-specific\nobject-NeRFs to allow compositional synthesis of multiple objects in the scene.\nFurthermore, we explicitly designed both the world and object models to handle\nlighting variation, which allows us to compose objects into scenes with\nspatially varying lighting. This is achieved by constructing a light field of\nthe scene and using it in conjunction with a learned shader to modulate the\nappearance of the object NeRFs.

When looking at an image, we can decompose\nthe scene into entities and their parts as well as obtain the dependencies\nbetween them. To mimic such capability, we propose Visual Dependency\nTransformers (DependencyViT) that can induce visual dependencies without any\nlabels. We achieve that with a novel neural operator called \\emph{reversed\nattention} that can naturally capture long-range visual dependencies between\nimage patches. Specifically, we formulate it as a dependency graph where a\nchild token in reversed attention is trained to attend to its parent tokens and\nsend information following a normalized probability distribution rather than\ngathering information in conventional self-attention. With such a design,\nhierarchies naturally emerge from reversed attention layers, and a dependency\ntree is progressively induced from leaf nodes to the root node unsupervisedly.\n  DependencyViT offers several appealing benefits. (i) Entities and their parts\nin an image are represented by different subtrees, enabling part partitioning\nfrom dependencies; (ii) Dynamic visual pooling is made possible. The leaf nodes\nwhich rarely send messages can be pruned without hindering the model\nperformance, based on which we propose the lightweight DependencyViT-Lite to\nreduce the computational and memory footprints; (iii) DependencyViT works well\non both self- and weakly-supervised pretraining paradigms on ImageNet, and\ndemonstrates its effectiveness on 8 datasets and 5 tasks, such as unsupervised\npart and saliency segmentation, recognition, and detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 17:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

Semantic information is\ndefined as the subset of correlations, measured via the transfer entropy,\nbetween agent $A$ and environment $E$ that is necessary for the agent to\nmaintain its viability $V$. Viability, in turn, is endogenously defined as\nopposed to the use of exogenous quantities like utility functions. In our\nmodel, the forager's movements are determined by its ability to measure, via a\nsensor, the presence of an individual unit of resource, while the viability\nfunction is its expected lifetime. Through counterfactual interventions --\nscrambling the correlations between agent and environment via noising the\nsensor -- we demonstrate the presence of a critical value of the noise\nparameter, $\\eta_c$, above which the forager's expected lifetime is\ndramatically reduced. On the other hand, for $\\eta < \\eta_c$ there is\nlittle-to-no effect on its ability to survive. We refer to this boundary as the\nsemantic threshold, quantifying the subset of agent-environment correlations\nthat the agent actually needs to maintain its desired state of staying alive.\nEach bit of information affects the agent's ability to persist both above and\nbelow the semantic threshold. Modeling the viability curve and its semantic\nthreshold via forager/environment parameters, we show how the correlations are\ninstantiated.

However, recent works in this area face a trade-off.\nFinetuning the pretrained model to achieve strong supervised performance\nresults in low zero-shot generalization. Similarly, freezing the backbone to\nretain zero-shot capability causes significant drop in supervised accuracy.\nBecause of this, recent works in literature typically train separate models for\nsupervised and zero-shot action recognition. In this work, we propose a\nmultimodal prompt learning scheme that works to balance the supervised and\nzero-shot performance under a single unified training. Our prompting approach\non the vision side caters for three aspects: 1) Global video-level prompts to\nmodel the data distribution; 2) Local frame-level prompts to provide per-frame\ndiscriminative conditioning; and 3) a summary prompt to extract a condensed\nvideo representation. Additionally, we define a prompting scheme on the text\nside to augment the textual context. Through this prompting scheme, we can\nachieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on Kinetics-600, HMDB51 and\nUCF101 while remaining competitive in the supervised setting. By keeping the\npretrained backbone frozen, we optimize a much lower number of parameters and\nretain the existing general representation which helps achieve the strong\nzero-shot performance.

Wikidata statements are annotated with qualifier-value\npairs that are used to depict information, such as the validity context of the\nstatement, its causality, provenances, etc. Handling the qualifiers in\nreasoning is a challenging problem. When defining inference rules (in\nparticular, rules on ontological properties (x subclass of y, z instance of x,\netc.)), one must consider the qualifiers, as most of them participate in the\nsemantics of the statements. This poses a complex problem because a) there is a\nmassive number of qualifiers, and b) the qualifiers of the inferred statement\nare often a combination of the qualifiers in the rule condition. In this work,\nwe propose to address this problem by a) defining a categorization of the\nqualifiers b) formalizing the Wikidata model with a many-sorted logical\nlanguage; the sorts of this language are the qualifier categories.

A resource\nthat is matched is 'used' for a random duration, drawn independently from a\nresource-dependent distribution, after which it returns and is able to be\nmatched again. We study the performance of the greedy policy, which matches\nrequests to the resource that yields the highest reward. Previously, it was\nknown that the greedy policy is 1/2 competitive against a clairvoyant benchmark\nthat knows the request sequence in advance. In this work, we improve this\nresult by introducing a parameter that quantifies the degree of reusability of\nthe resources. Specifically, if p represents the smallest probability over the\nusage distributions that a matched resource returns in one time step, the\ngreedy policy achieves a competitive ratio of $1/(2-p)$. Furthermore, when the\nusage distributions are geometric, we establish a stronger competitive ratio of\n$(1+p)/2$, which we demonstrate to be tight. Both of these results align with\nthe known results in the two extreme scenarios: p = 0 corresponds to\nnon-reusable resources, where 1/2 is known to be tight, while p = 1 corresponds\nto every resource returning immediately, where greedy is the optimal policy and\nhence the competitive ratio is 1. Finally, we show that both results are robust\nto approximations of the greedy policy. Our work demonstrates that the\nreusability of resources can enhance performance compared to the non-reusable\nsetting, and that a simple greedy policy suffices when the degree of\nreusability is high. Our insights contribute to the understanding of how\nresource reusability can influence the performance of online algorithms, and\nhighlight the potential for improved performance as the degree of reusability\nincreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 21:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

In this research, we propose an algorithm to\nrestore the true color (albedo) in underwater imagery by jointly learning the\neffects of the medium and neural scene representations. Our approach models\nwater effects as a combination of light attenuation with distance and\nbackscattered light. The proposed neural scene representation is based on a\nneural reflectance field model, which learns albedos, normals, and volume\ndensities of the underwater environment. We introduce a logistic regression\nmodel to separate water from the scene and apply distinct light physics during\ntraining. Our method avoids the need to estimate complex backscatter effects in\nwater by employing several approximations, enhancing sampling efficiency and\nnumerical stability during training. The proposed technique integrates\nunderwater light effects into a volume rendering framework with end-to-end\ndifferentiability. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data\ndemonstrate that our method effectively restores true color from underwater\nimagery, outperforming existing approaches in terms of color consistency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 21:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

For image-text\nretrieval, this manifests in retrieved sentences that mention objects that are\nnot present in the query image.

GHG emissions from the\nbuilding sector are made up of embodied emissions and operational emissions.\nRecognizing the importance of reducing energy use and emissions associated with\nthe building sector, governments have introduced policies, standards, and\ndesign guidelines to improve building energy performance and reduce GHG\nemissions associated with operating buildings. However, policy initiatives that\nreduce embodied emissions of the existing building sector are lacking. This\nresearch aims to develop policy strategies to reduce embodied carbon emissions\nin retrofits. In order to achieve this goal, this research conducted a\nliterature review and identification of policies and financial incentives in\nBritish Columbia (BC) for reducing overall GHG emissions from the existing\nbuilding sector. Then, this research analyzed worldwide policies and incentives\nthat reduce embodied carbon emissions in the existing building sector.

The process inevitably exhibits selection biases,\ni.e. news sources' typical patterns of choosing what information to include in\nnews coverage, due to their agenda differences. To understand the magnitude and\nimplications of selection biases, one must first discover (1) on what topics do\nsources typically have diverging definitions of \"newsworthy\" information, and\n(2) do the content selection patterns correlate with certain attributes of the\nnews sources, e.g. ideological leaning, etc.\n  The goal of the paper is to investigate and discuss the challenges of\nbuilding scalable NLP systems for discovering patterns of media selection\nbiases directly from news content in massive-scale news corpora, without\nrelying on labeled data. To facilitate research in this domain, we propose and\nstudy a conceptual framework, where we compare how sources typically mention\ncertain controversial entities, and use such as indicators for the sources'\ncontent selection preferences. We empirically show the capabilities of the\nframework through a case study on NELA-2020, a corpus of 1.8M news articles in\nEnglish from 519 news sources worldwide. We demonstrate an unsupervised\nrepresentation learning method to capture the selection preferences for how\nsources typically mention controversial entities.

Replacing isolation boundary conditions by\nperiodic boundary conditions changes the domain topology and dynamics of each\nscenario, by affecting the outcome of gravitational cooling. With periodic\nboundary conditions, the ground-state equilibrium solution and Gaussian\nfluctuation each evolve toward the single equilibrium solitonic core of the\nisolated case, but surrounded by a tail, unlike the isolated versions. The case\nof head-on, binary mergers illustrates additional effects, caused by the pull\nsuffered by the system due to the infinite network of periodic images along\neach direction of the domain. Binary merger with angular momentum is the first\nscenario we found in which the tail has a polynomial profile when using a\nperiodic domain. Finally, the 3D merger of many, randomly-placed solitonic\ncores of different mass makes a solitonic core surrounded by a tail with\npower-law-like density profile, for periodic boundary conditions, while\nproducing a core with a much sharper fall-off in the isolated case. This\nsuggests that the conclusion of earlier work that the ground-state equilibrium\nsolution is an attractor for the asymptotic state is true even in 3D and for\ngeneral circumstances, but only if gravitational cooling is able to carry mass\nand energy off to infinity, which isolation boundary conditions allow, but\nperiodic ones do not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 23:56:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 16:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

We then develop a minimal, qualitative tight binding model for\nZrSiSe that has the proper SOC-induced gap openings and electron symmetries.\nThe model relies on the density-functional-theory (DFT) electronic dispersion\nobtained with a tool in which electronic states are written in terms of\nlocalized atomic orbitals [{\\em J. Phys.: Condens. Matter} {\\bf 14}, 2745\n(2002)]: we remove orbitals gradually, and perform calculations with SOC turned\non, to arrive at a minimal set of parameters that include silicon and zirconium\natomic orbitals. We are able to determine that the electronic bands due to\nsilicon in previous model lie above the Fermi energy. Our tight binding model\nwith SOC is shown to describe ZrSiSe slabs as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 01:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

In this paper, we introduce generative\nagents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior.\nGenerative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint,\nwhile authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate\nconversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next\nday. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a\nlarge language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences\nusing natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level\nreflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate\ngenerative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by\nThe Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents\nusing natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce\nbelievable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with\nonly a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's\nDay party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the\nnext two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the\nparty, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We\ndemonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent\narchitecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically\nto the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with\ncomputational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and\ninteraction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 01:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

Many models have been proposed, each with specific strengths\nand weaknesses. Here, we put forth a new model where the client trusts only its\nclassical processing, makes no computational assumptions, and interacts with a\nquantum server in a single round. In addition, during a set-up phase, the\nclient specifies the size $n$ of the computation and receives an untrusted,\noff-the-shelf (OTS) quantum device that is used to report the outcome of a\nsingle constant-sized measurement from a predetermined logarithmic-sized input.\nIn the OTS model, we thus picture that a single quantum server does the bulk of\nthe computations, while the OTS device is used as an untrusted and generic\nverification device, all in a single round.\n  We show how to delegate polynomial-time quantum computations in the OTS\nmodel. Scaling up the technique also yields an interactive proof system for all\nof QMA, which, furthermore, we show can be accomplished in statistical\nzero-knowledge. This yields the first relativistic (one-round), two-prover\nzero-knowledge proof system for QMA.\n  As a proof approach, we provide a new self-test for $n$-EPR pairs using only\nconstant-sized Pauli measurements, and show how it provides a new avenue for\nthe use of simulatable codes for local Hamiltonian verification.

First, we\nfind that input normalization for LP is crucial to eliminate performance\nvariations according to the hyperparameters. Specifically, batch normalization\nbefore feeding inputs to a linear classifier considerably improves the\nstability of evaluation, and also resolves inconsistency of $k$-NN and LP\nmetrics. Second, for TL, we demonstrate that a weight decay parameter in SSL\nsignificantly affects the transferability of learned representations, which\ncannot be identified by LP or $k$-NN evaluations on the upstream dataset.

In\nthis work, we propose a ladder self-attention block with multiple branches and\na progressive shift mechanism to develop a light-weight transformer backbone\nthat requires less computing resources (e.g. a relatively small number of\nparameters and FLOPs), termed Progressive Shift Ladder Transformer (PSLT).\nFirst, the ladder self-attention block reduces the computational cost by\nmodelling local self-attention in each branch. In the meanwhile, the\nprogressive shift mechanism is proposed to enlarge the receptive field in the\nladder self-attention block by modelling diverse local self-attention for each\nbranch and interacting among these branches. Second, the input feature of the\nladder self-attention block is split equally along the channel dimension for\neach branch, which considerably reduces the computational cost in the ladder\nself-attention block (with nearly 1/3 the amount of parameters and FLOPs), and\nthe outputs of these branches are then collaborated by a pixel-adaptive fusion.\nTherefore, the ladder self-attention block with a relatively small number of\nparameters and FLOPs is capable of modelling long-range interactions. Based on\nthe ladder self-attention block, PSLT performs well on several vision tasks,\nincluding image classification, objection detection and person\nre-identification.

Our proposed framework consists of three stages: garment\nembedding, single-layered garment draping, and untangling. The model represents\na garment independent to its topological structure by mapping it onto the $UV$\nmap of a human body model, allowing for the ability to handle previously unseen\ngarments.

However, DNNs are far from infallible, and\nincorrect behavior of DNNs can have disastrous real-world consequences. This\npaper addresses the problem of architecture-preserving V-polytope provable\nrepair of DNNs. A V-polytope defines a convex bounded polytope using its vertex\nrepresentation. V-polytope provable repair guarantees that the repaired DNN\nsatisfies the given specification on the infinite set of points in the given\nV-polytope. An architecture-preserving repair only modifies the parameters of\nthe DNN, without modifying its architecture. The repair has the flexibility to\nmodify multiple layers of the DNN, and runs in polynomial time. It supports\nDNNs with activation functions that have some linear pieces, as well as\nfully-connected, convolutional, pooling and residual layers. To the best our\nknowledge, this is the first provable repair approach that has all of these\nfeatures. We implement our approach in a tool called APRNN.

The fluid\nconsidered is Newtonian and incompressible. Darcy model is used to narrate the\nflow in the porous layer and at the interface, the Beavers-Joseph condition is\nused. The Chebyshev collocation method is used to solve the generalized\neigenvalue problem.

Nowadays, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has revealed significant success\nacross various domains, offering the potential to overcome these limitations:\n1) generative AI can produce personalized items to meet users' specific\ninformation needs, and 2) the newly emerged ChatGPT significantly facilitates\nusers to express information needs more precisely via natural language\ninstructions. In this light, the boom of AIGC points the way towards the\nnext-generation recommender paradigm with two new objectives: 1) generating\npersonalized content through generative AI, and 2) integrating user\ninstructions to guide content generation.\n  To this end, we propose a novel Generative Recommender paradigm named\nGeneRec, which adopts an AI generator to personalize content generation and\nleverages user instructions to acquire users' information needs.

Therefore, a\ndeep neural network (DNN)-based fault classifier has to be able to distinguish\nnoise from machine sound and be robust to mixed noises. To deal with these\nproblems, we investigate on-site noise exposure (ONE) that exposes a DNN model\nto the noises recorded in the same environment where the machine operates. Like\nthe outlier exposure technique, noise exposure trains a DNN classifier to\nproduce a uniform predicted probability distribution against noise-only data.\nDuring inference, the DNN classifier trained by ONE outputs the maximum softmax\nprobability as the noise score and determines the noise-only period.

To achieve the two purposes, they should iteratively\ntraverse the corpus and the entity vocabulary provided in the datasets,\nresulting in poor efficiency and scalability. The experimental results indicate\nthat the time consumed by the retrieval-based ESE methods increases linearly\nwith entity vocabulary and corpus size.

The two research paths have been independently established\nin the community. In this paper, we develop a novel perspective by unifying\nMixers and GCNs.

Therefore, different parameters, including orbits,\nof the globular clusters is a valuable tool for studying the Milky Way\nevolution. However, since the evolution of the 3D mass distribution of the MW\nis poorly constrained, the orbits of the clusters are usually calculated in\nstatic potentials.\n  Aims. In this work, we study the evolution of the GCs in several external\npotentials, where we aim to quantify the effects of the evolving galaxy\npotential on the orbits of the GCs. Methods. For the orbits calculation we used\nfive MW-like potentials from IllustrisTNG-100 simulation. The orbits of 159 GCs\nwere integrated using a high-order N-body parallel dynamic code phi-GPU, with\ninitial conditions obtained from recent Gaia DR3 catalogues.\n  Results. We provide a classification of the GCs orbits according to their 3D\nshapes and association with different components of the MW (disk, halo, bulge).\nWe also found that the globular clusters in the external potentials have\nroughly similar energy-angular momentum distributions at the present time.\nHowever, both total energy and total angular momentum of the GCs are not\nconserved due to time-varying nature of the potentials. In some extreme cases,\nthe total energy can change up to 40% (18 objects) over the last 5 Gyr of\nevolution. We found that the in-situ formed GCs are less affected by the\nevolution of the TNG potentials as compared to the clusters which are likely\nformed ex-situ. Therefore, our results suggest that time-varying potentials\nsignificantly affect the orbits of the GC, thus making it vital for\nunderstanding the formation of the MW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 08:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Deep learning has shown impressive performance\non the MSTAR dataset. However, data bias in a small dataset, such as background\ncorrelation, impairs the causality of these methods, i.e., discriminative\nfeatures contain target and background differences. Moreover, different\noperating conditions of SAR lead to target signatures and background clutter\nvariations in imaging results. However, many deep learning-based methods only\nverify robustness to target or background variations in the current\nexperimental setting. In this paper, we propose a novel domain alignment\nframework named Hierarchical Disentanglement-Alignment Network (HDANet) to\nenhance features' causality and robustness. Concisely, HDANet consists of three\nparts: The first part uses data augmentation to generate signature variations\nfor domain alignment. The second part disentangles the target features through\na multitask-assisted mask to prevent non-causal clutter from interfering with\nsubsequent alignment and recognition. Thirdly, a contrastive loss is employed\nfor domain alignment to extract robust target features, and the SimSiam\nstructure is applied to mitigate conflicts between contrastive loss and feature\ndiscrimination. Finally, the proposed method shows high robustness across\nMSTAR's multiple target, sensor, and environment variants. Noteworthy, we add a\nnew scene variant to verify the robustness to target and background variations.\nMoreover, the saliency map and Shapley value qualitatively and quantitatively\ndemonstrate causality.

This letter presents a\nnovel method using graph attention (GraphAC) for encoder-decoder based audio\ncaptioning. In the encoder, a graph attention module is introduced after the\nPANNs to learn contextual association (i.e. the dependency among the audio\nfeatures over different time frames) through an adjacency graph, and a top-k\nmask is used to mitigate the interference from noisy nodes. The learnt\ncontextual association leads to a more effective feature representation with\nfeature node aggregation.

Deep reinforcement learning-based methods address the FRP\nproblem, however, suffer from the issues of generalization and scalability. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a method that uses Collision Probability\n(CP) to help the robot navigate safely through crowds. The inclusion of CP in\nthe observation space gives the robot a sense of the level of danger of the\nmoving crowd. The robot will navigate through the crowd when it appears safe\nbut will take a detour when the crowd is moving aggressively. By focusing on\nthe most dangerous obstacle, the robot will not be confused when the crowd\ndensity is high, ensuring scalability of the model.

We show that a permutation invariant encoding\nimproves in accuracy as the number of points contained in the point cloud\nincreases, while non-invariant quantum encodings decrease in accuracy. This\ndemonstrates that by implementing permutation invariance into the encoding, the\nmodel exhibits improved generalisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 11:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

These bands could show novel 1D physics, including\na new type of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior, multi-orbital Mott insulator\nphysics, and an unusual optical absorption, due to the simultaneous presence of\nthe spin-orbit coupling, strong correlation, multiple orbitals, Rashba spin\nsplitting, and broken symmetry. For the half-filled 1D bands, we find, quite\nsurprisingly, a broadening of the 1D bands due to correlation, as opposed to\nthe expected band narrowing. This is interpreted to be due to multiple orbitals\nforming the single Hubbard band at different points of the Brillouin zone.\nFurthermore, due to the presence of an intrinsic electric field along the\nlateral direction, the 1D bands are Rashba spin-split and provide a new\nmechanism for tuning the valley dependent optical transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 12:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

This allows them to be used as means of diagnosing\nplasma parameters and processes occurring in it. Plasma diagnostics, in turn,\nrequires a sufficiently reliable MHD model to describe the wave evolution. In\nour paper, we focus on obtaining the exact analytical solution to the problem\nof the linear evolution of standing slow magnetoacoustic (MA) waves in coronal\nloops. Our consideration of the properties of slow waves is conducted using the\ninfinite magnetic field assumption. The main contribution to the wave dynamics\nin this assumption comes from such processes as thermal conduction, unspecified\ncoronal heating, and optically thin radiation cooling. In our consideration,\nthe wave periods are assumed to be short enough so that the thermal misbalance\nhas a weak effect on them. Thus, the main non-adiabatic process affecting the\nwave dynamics remains thermal conduction. The exact solution of the\nevolutionary equation is obtained using the Fourier method. This means that it\nis possible to trace the evolution of any harmonic of the initial perturbation,\nregardless of whether it belongs to entropy or slow mode. We show that the\nfraction of energy between entropy and slow mode is defined by the thermal\nconduction and coronal loop parameters. It is shown for which parameters of\ncoronal loops it is reasonable to associate the full solution with a slow wave,\nand when it is necessary to take into account the entropy wave. Furthermore, we\nobtain the relationships for the phase shifts of various plasma parameters\napplicable to any values of harmonic number and thermal condition coefficient.\nIn particular, it is shown that the phase shifts between density and\ntemperature perturbations for the second harmonic of the slow wave vary between\n$\\pi/2$ to 0, but are larger than for the fundamental harmonic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 17:54:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

To address these, we propose to extend A2J-the\nstate-of-the-art depth-based 3D single hand pose estimation method-to RGB\ndomain under interacting hand condition. Our key idea is to equip A2J with\nstrong local-global aware ability to well capture interacting hands' local fine\ndetails and global articulated clues among joints jointly. To this end, A2J is\nevolved under Transformer's non-local encoding-decoding framework to build\nA2J-Transformer. It holds 3 main advantages over A2J. First, self-attention\nacross local anchor points is built to make them global spatial context aware\nto better capture joints' articulation clues for resisting occlusion. Secondly,\neach anchor point is regarded as learnable query with adaptive feature learning\nfor facilitating pattern fitting capacity, instead of having the same local\nrepresentation with the others. Last but not least, anchor point locates in 3D\nspace instead of 2D as in A2J, to leverage 3D pose prediction.

However, cyberattack\ndetection in smart grids now faces new challenges, including privacy\npreservation and decentralized power zones with strategic data owners. To\naddress these technical bottlenecks, this paper proposes a novel Federated\nLearning-based privacy-preserving and communication-efficient attack detection\nframework, known as FedDiSC, that enables Discrimination between power System\ndisturbances and Cyberattacks. Specifically, we first propose a Federated\nLearning approach to enable Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition subsystems\nof decentralized power grid zones to collaboratively train an attack detection\nmodel without sharing sensitive power related data. Secondly, we put forward a\nrepresentation learning-based Deep Auto-Encoder network to accurately detect\npower system and cybersecurity anomalies. Lastly, to adapt our proposed\nframework to the timeliness of real-world cyberattack detection in SGs, we\nleverage the use of a gradient privacy-preserving quantization scheme known as\nDP-SIGNSGD to improve its communication efficiency. Extensive simulations of\nthe proposed framework on publicly available Industrial Control Systems\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve superior detection\naccuracy while preserving the privacy of sensitive power grid related\ninformation. Furthermore, we find that the gradient quantization scheme\nutilized improves communication efficiency by 40% when compared to a\ntraditional federated learning approach without gradient quantization which\nsuggests suitability in a real-world scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 13:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

However,\nthis problem is generally challenging to solve due to its non-convex and\nnon-smooth nature. Existing solutions are limited by one or more of the\nfollowing restrictions: (i) they are full gradient methods that require high\ncomputational costs in each iteration; (ii) they are not capable of solving\ngeneral nonsmooth composite problems; (iii) they are infeasible methods and can\nonly achieve the feasibility of the solution at the limit point; (iv) they lack\nrigorous convergence guarantees; (v) they only obtain weak optimality of\ncritical points. In this paper, we propose \\textit{\\textbf{OBCD}}, a new Block\nCoordinate Descent method for solving general nonsmooth composite problems\nunder Orthogonality constraints. \\textit{\\textbf{OBCD}} is a feasible method\nwith low computation complexity footprints. In each iteration, our algorithm\nupdates $k$ rows of the solution matrix ($k\\geq2$ is a parameter) to preserve\nthe constraints. Then, it solves a small-sized nonsmooth composite optimization\nproblem under orthogonality constraints either exactly or approximately. We\ndemonstrate that any exact block-$k$ stationary point is always an approximate\nblock-$k$ stationary point, which is equivalent to the critical stationary\npoint. We are particularly interested in the case where $k=2$ as the resulting\nsubproblem reduces to a one-dimensional nonconvex problem. We propose a\nbreakpoint searching method and a fifth-order iterative method to solve this\nproblem efficiently and effectively. We also propose two novel greedy\nstrategies to find a good working set to further accelerate the convergence of\n\\textit{\\textbf{OBCD}}. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on\nseveral tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 13:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

Inferring BEV semantic\nsegmentation conditioned on multi-camera-view images is a popular scheme in the\ncommunity as cheap devices and real-time processing. The recent work\nimplemented this task by learning the content and position relationship via the\nvision Transformer (ViT). However, the quadratic complexity of ViT confines the\nrelationship learning only in the latent layer, leaving the scale gap to impede\nthe representation of fine-grained objects.

Thus, the\ndevelopment environment must support reliability-related events such as the\nfailure of a sensor, malfunction of a subsystem, and foreseen events of Cyber\nsecurity attacks. This paper presents the SCART framework - an innovative\nsolution that aims to allow extending simulation environments of real-time\nsystems with the capability to incorporate reliability-related events and\nadvanced cyber security attacks, e.g., an attack on a single sensor as well as\n\"complex security attacks\" that aim to change the behavior of a group of\nsensors. We validate our system by applying the new proposed environment on\ncontrol a drone's flight control system including its navigation system that\nuses machine learning algorithms. Such a system is very challenging since it\nrequires many experiments that can hardly be achieved by using live systems. We\nshowed that using SCART is very efficient, can increase the model's accuracy,\nand significantly reduce false-positive rates. Some of these experiments were\nalso validated using a set of \"real drones\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 14:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

We show how the requirements\nspecification can be fruitfully integrated into the standard machine learning\ndevelopment pipeline, proposing a novel pyramid development process in which\nrequirements definition may impact all the subsequent phases in the pipeline,\nand viceversa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 14:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

By eliminating the need to solve the ACOPF every few\nminutes, the paper showcases how a realtime feedback controller can be utilized\nin lieu of ACOPF and its variants. By (i) forming the grid dynamics as a system\nof differential algebraic equations (DAE) that naturally encode the non-convex\npower flow constraints, (ii) utilizing advanced DAE-Lyapunov theory, and (iii)\ndesigning a feedback controller that captures realtime uncertainty while being\nuncertainty-unaware, the presented approach demonstrates promises of obtaining\nsolutions that are close to the OPF ones without needing to solve the OPF. The\nproposed controller responds in realtime to deviations in renewables generation\nand loads, guaranteeing transient stability, while always yielding feasible\nsolutions of the ACOPF with no constraint violations. As the studied approach\nherein indeed yields slightly more expensive realtime generator setpoints, the\ncorresponding price of realtime control and regulation is examined.\nCost-comparisons with the traditional ACOPF are also showcased -- all via case\nstudies on standard power networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 15:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

This exploration implies heavy workloads for domain experts, and an\nautomatic compression method is needed. However, the huge search space of the\nautomatic method introduces plenty of computing budgets that make the automatic\nprocess challenging to be applied in real scenarios. In this paper, we propose\nan end-to-end framework named AutoQNN, for automatically quantizing different\nlayers utilizing different schemes and bitwidths without any human labor.\nAutoQNN can seek desirable quantizing schemes and mixed-precision policies for\nmainstream DNN models efficiently by involving three techniques: quantizing\nscheme search (QSS), quantizing precision learning (QPL), and quantized\narchitecture generation (QAG). QSS introduces five quantizing schemes and\ndefines three new schemes as a candidate set for scheme search, and then uses\nthe differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) algorithm to seek the\nlayer- or model-desired scheme from the set. QPL is the first method to learn\nmixed-precision policies by reparameterizing the bitwidths of quantizing\nschemes, to the best of our knowledge. QPL optimizes both classification loss\nand precision loss of DNNs efficiently and obtains the relatively optimal\nmixed-precision model within limited model size and memory footprint. QAG is\ndesigned to convert arbitrary architectures into corresponding quantized ones\nwithout manual intervention, to facilitate end-to-end neural network\nquantization.

The proposed device actively measures the\nsolubility by transmitting a solution using a background image. The proposed\nsystem is a combination of a device that uses a background image and a method\nfor estimating the dissolution and particle presence by changing the background\nimage. The proposed device consists of four parts: camera, display, adjustment,\nand server units. The camera unit is made up of a rear image sensor on a mobile\nphone. The display unit is comprised of a tablet screen. The adjustment unit is\ncomposed of rotating and height-adjustment jigs. Finally, the server unit\nconsists of a socket server for communication between the units and a PC,\nincluding an automated solubility analysis system implemented in Python. The\ndissolution status of the solution was divided into four categories and a case\nstudy was conducted. The algorithms were trained based on these results. Six\norganic materials and four organic solvents were combined with 202 tests to\ntrain the developed algorithm. As a result, the evaluation rate for the\ndissolution state exhibited an accuracy of 95 %. In addition, the device and\nmethod must develop a feedback function that can add a solvent or solute after\ndissolution detection using solubility results for use in autonomous systems,\nsuch as a synthetic automation system. Finally, the diversification of the\nsensing method is expected to extend not only to the solution but also to the\nsolubility and homogeneity analysis of the film.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 08:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Although DNA has high\ndurability and extremely high density in nature, its potential as the basis of\nstorage devices is currently hindered by limitations such as expensive and\ncomplex fabrication processes and time-consuming read-write operations. In this\narticle, we propose the use of a DNA crossbar array architecture for an\nelectrically readable Read-Only Memory (DNA-ROM). While information can be\nwritten error-free to a DNA-ROM array using appropriate sequence encoding, its\nread accuracy can be affected by several factors such as array size,\ninterconnect resistance, and Fermi energy deviations from HOMO levels of DNA\nstrands employed in the crossbar. We study the impact of array size and\ninterconnect resistance on the bit error rate of a DNA-ROM array through\nextensive Monte Carlo simulations. We have also analyzed the performance of our\nproposed DNA crossbar array for an image storage application, as a function of\narray size and interconnect resistance. While we expect that future advances in\nbioengineering and materials science will address some of the fabrication\nchallenges associated with DNA crossbar arrays, we believe that the\ncomprehensive body of results we present in this paper establishes the\ntechnical viability of DNA crossbar arrays as low-power, high-density storage\ndevices. Finally, our analysis of array performance vis-a-vis interconnect\nresistance should provide valuable insights into aspects of the fabrication\nprocess such as the proper choice of interconnects necessary for ensuring high\nread accuracies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 20:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

The total distance driven by\nthe vehicles and the fleet size can be reduced by employing ridesharing, i.e.,\nby assigning multiple passengers to one vehicle. However, finding the optimal\npassenger-vehicle assignment in an MoD system is a hard combinatorial problem.\nIn this work, we demonstrate how the VGA method, a recently proposed systematic\nmethod for ridesharing, can be used to compute the optimal passenger-vehicle\nassignments and corresponding vehicle routes in a massive-scale MoD system. In\ncontrast to existing works, we solve all passenger-vehicle assignment problems\nto optimality, regularly dealing with instances containing thousands of\nvehicles and passengers. Moreover, to examine the impact of using optimal\nridesharing assignments, we compare the performance of an MoD system that uses\noptimal assignments against an MoD system that uses assignments computed using\ninsertion heuristic and against an MoD system that uses no ridesharing. We\nfound that the system that uses optimal ridesharing assignments subject to the\nmaximum travel delay of 4 minutes reduces the vehicle distance driven by 57 %\ncompared to an MoD system without ridesharing. Furthermore, we found that the\noptimal assignments result in a 20 % reduction in vehicle distance driven and 5\n% lower average passenger travel delay compared to a system that uses insertion\nheuristic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 12:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}
