Of these,\nso-called particle swarm optimisation (PSO) approaches have proven to be highly\neffective in a number of application areas. Given the maturity of the PSO\nfield, it is likely that novel variants of the PSO algorithm stand to offer\nonly marginal gains in terms of performance -- there is, after all, no free\nlunch. Instead of only chasing performance on suites of benchmark optimisation\nfunctions, it is argued herein that research effort is better placed in the\npursuit of algorithms that also have other useful properties. In this work, a\nhighly-general, interpretable variant of the PSO algorithm -- particle\nattractor algorithm (PAO) -- is proposed. Furthermore, the algorithm is\ndesigned such that the transition densities (describing the motions of the\nparticles from one generation to the next) can be computed exactly in closed\nform for each step. Access to closed-form transition densities has important\nramifications for the closely-related field of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). In\norder to demonstrate that the useful properties do not come at the cost of\nperformance, PAO is compared to several other state-of-the art heuristic\noptimisation algorithms in a benchmark comparison study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 16:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

We employ ZNE on\n\\emph{logically encoded} qubits rather than \\emph{physical} qubits. This\napproach will be useful in a regime where quantum error correction (QEC) is\nimplementable but the number of qubits available for QEC is limited. Apart from\nillustrating the utility of a traditional ZNE approach (circuit-level unitary\nfolding) for the QEC regime, we propose a novel noise scaling ZNE method\nspecifically tailored to QEC: \\emph{distance scaled ZNE (DS-ZNE)}. DS-ZNE\nscales the distance of the error correction code, and thereby the resulting\nlogical error rate, and utilizes this code distance as the scaling `knob' for\nZNE. Logical qubit error rates are scaled until the maximum achievable code\ndistance for a fixed number of physical qubits, and lower error rates (i.e.,\neffectively higher code distances) are achieved via extrapolation techniques\nmigrated from traditional ZNE. Furthermore, to maximize physical qubit\nutilization over the ZNE experiments, logical executions at code distances\nlower than the maximum allowed by the physical qubits on the quantum device are\nparallelized to optimize device utilization. We validate our proposal with\nnumerical simulation and confirm that ZNE lowers the logical error rates and\nincreases the effective code distance beyond the physical capability of the\nquantum device. For instance, at a physical code distance of 11, the DS-ZNE\neffective code distance is 17, and at a physical code distance of 13, the\nDS-ZNE effective code distance is 21. When the proposed technique is compared\nagainst unitary folding ZNE under the constraint of a fixed number of\nexecutions of the quantum device, DS-ZNE outperforms unitary folding by up to\n92\\% in terms of the post-ZNE logical error rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 17:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: their sharpness,\ntransitioning seemingly instantaneously from not present to present, and their\nunpredictability, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable model scales. Here, we\npresent an alternative explanation for emergent abilities: that for a\nparticular task and model family, when analyzing fixed model outputs, emergent\nabilities appear due to the researcher's choice of metric rather than due to\nfundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or\ndiscontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or\ncontinuous metrics produce smooth, continuous predictable changes in model\nperformance. We present our alternative explanation in a simple mathematical\nmodel, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm\nthree predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT/GPT-3\nfamily on tasks with claimed emergent abilities; (2) make, test and confirm two\npredictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on\nBIG-Bench; and (3) show to choose metrics to produce never-before-seen\nseemingly emergent abilities in multiple vision tasks across diverse deep\nnetworks.

In\nthis paper, we present LLaMA-Adapter V2, a parameter-efficient visual\ninstruction model. Specifically, we first augment LLaMA-Adapter by unlocking\nmore learnable parameters (e.g., norm, bias and scale), which distribute the\ninstruction-following ability across the entire LLaMA model besides adapters.\nSecondly, we propose an early fusion strategy to feed visual tokens only into\nthe early LLM layers, contributing to better visual knowledge incorporation.\nThirdly, a joint training paradigm of image-text pairs and\ninstruction-following data is introduced by optimizing disjoint groups of\nlearnable parameters. This strategy effectively alleviates the interference\nbetween the two tasks of image-text alignment and instruction following and\nachieves strong multi-modal reasoning with only a small-scale image-text and\ninstruction dataset. During inference, we incorporate additional expert models\n(e.g. captioning/OCR systems) into LLaMA-Adapter to further enhance its image\nunderstanding capability without incurring training costs.

One such\nscenario is the dark axion portal model. The primary decay chain that we study\nis the Higgs to dark photon ($\\gamma_D$) pairs that subsequently decay into a\nphoton ($\\gamma$) and an axion-like particle ($a$). The axion-like particles\nthen decay into photon pairs. Hence, the signal is a six-photon Higgs decay:\n$h\\rightarrow \\gamma_D\\,\\gamma_D\\rightarrow 2\\,\\gamma 2\\,a\\rightarrow 6\\gamma$.\nHowever, depending on the relevant kinematics, the photons can become\nwell-collimated and appear as photon-jets (multiple photons that appear as a\nsingle photon in the detector) or $\\xi$-jets (non-isolated multi-photon signals\nthat do not pass the isolation criterion). These effects cause the true\nsix-photon resonance to appear as other multi-photon signals, such as two and\nfour photons. We classify the mass regions where two, four, and six-photon\nresonances dominate. The four-photon signal is particularly interesting. These\nevents mainly occur when the photons from the axion-like particles are\ncollimated into photon-jets. The decay of the dark photon is then\n$\\gamma_D\\rightarrow \\gamma a\\rightarrow \\gamma+\\gamma$-jet, which is an\napparent violation of the Landau-Yang theorem.

In this\npaper, we study dynamical friction on galactic bars spinning down at an\narbitrary speed, seamlessly connecting the fast and slow limits. We treat the\nbar-halo interaction as a restricted $N$-body problem and solve the\ncollisionless Boltzmann equation using the angle-averaged Hamiltonian. The\nphase-space distribution and density wakes predicted by our averaged model are\nin excellent agreement with full 3D simulations. In the slow regime where\nresonant trapping occurs, we show that, in addition to the frictional torque,\nangular momentum is transferred directly due to the migration of the trapped\nphase-space: trapped orbits comoving with the resonance typically gain angular\nmomentum, while untrapped orbits leaping over the trapped island lose angular\nmomentum. Due to the negative gradient in the distribution function, gainers\ntypically outnumber the losers, resulting in a net negative torque on the\nperturber. The torque due to the untrapped orbits was identified by Tremaine &\nWeinberg, who named the phenomenon dynamical feedback. Here we derive the\ncomplete formula for dynamical feedback, accounting for both trapped and\nuntrapped orbits. Using our revised formula, we show that dynamical feedback\ncan comprise up to $30\\%$ of the total torque on the Milky Way's bar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

In the frame where the two fluids move in opposite\ndirections with equal speed $v$, the upper bound of unstable velocities\ncorresponds to an effective relativistic Mach number $M_{re} \\equiv v/v_{\\rm\nf\\perp} \\sqrt{(1-v_{\\rm f\\perp}^2)/(1-v^2)} \\cos\\theta=\\sqrt{2}$, where $v_{rm\nf\\perp}=[v_A^2+c_{\\rm s}^2(1-v_A^2)]^{1/2}$ is the fast speed assuming a\nmagnetic field perpendicular to the wavevector (here, all velocities are in\nunits of the speed of light), and $\\theta$ is the laboratory-frame angle\nbetween the flow velocity and the wavevector projection onto the shear\ninterface. Our results have implications for shear flows in the magnetospheres\nof neutron stars and black holes -- both for single objects and for merging\nbinaries -- where the Alfv\\'en speed may approach the speed of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 18:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Sparse\ninput NeRFs were recently regularized by providing dense depth estimated from\npre-trained networks as supervision, to achieve improved performance over\nsparse depth constraints.

As\na result, the calculated data values depend on many design choices of the\nunderlying learning algorithm. However, this dependence is undesirable for many\nuse cases of data valuation, such as setting priorities over different data\nsources in a data acquisition process and informing pricing mechanisms in a\ndata marketplace. In these scenarios, data needs to be valued before the actual\nanalysis and the choice of the learning algorithm is still undetermined then.\nAnother side-effect of the dependence is that to assess the value of individual\npoints, one needs to re-run the learning algorithm with and without a point,\nwhich incurs a large computation burden.\n  This work leapfrogs over the current limits of data valuation methods by\nintroducing a new framework that can value training data in a way that is\noblivious to the downstream learning algorithm. (1) We develop a proxy for the\nvalidation performance associated with a training set based on a\nnon-conventional class-wise Wasserstein distance between the training and the\nvalidation set. We show that the distance characterizes the upper bound of the\nvalidation performance for any given model under certain Lipschitz conditions.\n(2) We develop a novel method to value individual data based on the sensitivity\nanalysis of the class-wise Wasserstein distance. Importantly, these values can\nbe directly obtained for free from the output of off-the-shelf optimization\nsolvers when computing the distance. (3) We evaluate our new data valuation\nframework over various use cases related to detecting low-quality data and show\nthat, surprisingly, the learning-agnostic feature of our framework enables a\nsignificant improvement over the state-of-the-art performance while being\norders of magnitude faster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 19:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

[Principal Idea] To address this problem, we propose REIT,\nan extensible architecture for Requirements Elicitation Interview Trainer\nsystem based on emerging technologies for education.

The participants demonstrated higher\nlearning gain when trained with RoREIT, but they found VoREIT more engaging and\neasier to use.

Fisheye data has the wider\nfield of view advantage over other types of cameras, but this comes at the\nexpense of high radial distortion. As a result, objects further from the center\nexhibit deformations that make it difficult for a model to identify their\nsemantic context. While previous work has attempted architectural and training\naugmentation changes to alleviate this effect, no work has attempted to guide\nthe model towards learning a representation space that reflects this\ninteraction between distortion and semantic context inherent to fisheye data.\nWe introduce an approach to exploit this relationship by first extracting\ndistortion class labels based on an object's distance from the center of the\nimage. We then shape a backbone's representation space with a weighted\ncontrastive loss that constrains objects of the same semantic class and\ndistortion class to be close to each other within a lower dimensional embedding\nspace. This backbone trained with both semantic and distortion information is\nthen fine-tuned within an object detection setting to empirically evaluate the\nquality of the learnt representation.

This viewpoint is widely held both in practical applications\nand foundational research. The former applications treat information theory as\na pure mathematical tool; while in the latter, information plays a central role\nin many reconstructions of quantum theory. However, the concept of information\nis usually remained obscure. We are investigating the information towards the\nreconstruction of quantum theory from an operational approach: what is the\ninformation gained from the quantum measurement data. We start from the\ngeneralization of continuous entropy and find there is more than one natural\nmeasure of the information gained as more data is received. One of these\n(differential information gain) can increase or decrease with more data,\ndepending upon the prior; another measure (relative information gain) is an\nincreasing function of the amount of data even when the amount of data is\nfinite, and is asymptotically insensitive to the specific data or choice of\nprior. Both two measures can be regarded as extensions of relative entropy.\n  We propose a Principle of Information Increase from Summhammer's intuitive\nidea: more data lead to more knowledge. This principle is used to filter\nchoices of prior for prior-sensitive information measures when investigating\nthe information gain from data of quantum measurements. Both numerical and\nasymptotic analysis are conducted using beta distribution priors. It is showed\nthat in two-outcome quantum systems differential information gain will be more\nphysical meaningful and Jeffreys' prior exhibits a special behavior which is\nthe strong robustness of information gain over all possible data. The expected\nvalues of both information gain are equivalent, which suggests that the\nexpected form is unique and the discrepancies are disappeared when taking the\naverages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 20:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Unlike spin ice materials of atomic\norigin, the dynamic state in artificial honeycomb spin ice is conventionally\ndescribed in terms of finite size domain wall kinetics that require magnetic\nfield or current application. Contrary to this common understanding, here we\nshow that thermally tunable artificial permalloy honeycomb lattice manifests a\nperpetual dynamic state due to self-propelled magnetic charge defect relaxation\nin the absence of any external tuning agent. Quantitative investigation of\nmagnetic charge defect dynamics using neutron spin echo spectroscopy reveals\nsub-ns relaxation times that are comparable to monopole's relaxation in bulk\nspin ices. Most importantly, the kinetic process remains unabated at low\ntemperature where thermal fluctuation is negligible.

Here, we investigate\nhow this often overlooked processing step affects the quality of an emulator's\npredictions. We implement two ML architectures from a class of methods called\nreservoir computing: (1) a form of Nonlinear Vector Autoregression (NVAR), and\n(2) an Echo State Network (ESN). Despite their simplicity, it is well\ndocumented that these architectures excel at predicting low dimensional chaotic\ndynamics. We are therefore motivated to test these architectures in an\nidealized setting of predicting high dimensional geophysical turbulence as\nrepresented by Surface Quasi-Geostrophic dynamics. In all cases, subsampling\nthe training data consistently leads to an increased bias at small spatial\nscales that resembles numerical diffusion. Interestingly, the NVAR architecture\nbecomes unstable when the temporal resolution is increased, indicating that the\npolynomial based interactions are insufficient at capturing the detailed\nnonlinearities of the turbulent flow. The ESN architecture is found to be more\nrobust, suggesting a benefit to the more expensive but more general structure.\nSpectral errors are reduced by including a penalty on the kinetic energy\ndensity spectrum during training, although the subsampling related errors\npersist.

However, SSL models are biased to the\npretraining data. When SSL models are finetuned with data from another domain,\ndomain shifting occurs and might cause limited knowledge transfer for\ndownstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, domain\nresponsible adaptation and finetuning (DRAFT), to reduce domain shifting in\npretrained speech models, and evaluate it for a causal and non-causal\ntransformer. For the causal transformer, an extension of APC (E-APC) is\nproposed to learn richer information from unlabelled data by using multiple\ntemporally-shifted sequences to perform prediction. For the non-causal\ntransformer, various solutions for using the bidirectional APC (Bi-APC) are\ninvestigated. In addition, the DRAFT framework is examined for Wav2vec2.0 and\nHuBERT methods, which use non-causal transformers as the backbone.

The\nrelative WER improvements of up to 19.7% on the two child tasks are observed\nwhen compared to the pretrained models without adaptation.

Currently, nearly-linear\ntime algorithms only exist for graphic and partition matroids [ICALP '19]. In\nthis work, we develop algorithms for monotone submodular maximization\nconstrained by graphic, transversal matroids, or laminar matroids in time\nnear-linear in the size of their representation. Our algorithms achieve an\noptimal approximation of $1-1/e-\\epsilon$ and both generalize and accelerate\nthe results of Ene and Nguyen [ICALP '19].

A possible source for this mismatch is the\nreliance on only photometric cues provided by RGB image inputs, which may\nultimately lead to sub-optimal adaptation.

The prevalence of this issue in\novercrowded and resource-constrained hospitals can compromise the accuracy of\nmedical diagnoses. Therefore, this study aims to discover the optimal\ntransformation method for detecting CVDs using noisy heart sound signals and\npropose a noise robust network to improve the CVDs classification\nperformance.For the identification of the optimal transformation method for\nnoisy heart sound data mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), short-time\nFourier transform (STFT), constant-Q nonstationary Gabor transform (CQT) and\ncontinuous wavelet transform (CWT) has been used with VGG16. Furthermore, we\npropose a novel convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) architecture\ncalled noise robust cardio net (NRC-Net), which is a lightweight model to\nclassify mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, mitral valve\nprolapse, and normal heart sounds using PCG signals contaminated with\nrespiratory and random noises. An attention block is included to extract\nimportant temporal and spatial features from the noisy corrupted heart\nsound.The results of this study indicate that,CWT is the optimal transformation\nmethod for noisy heart sound signals. When evaluated on the GitHub heart sound\ndataset, CWT demonstrates an accuracy of 95.69% for VGG16, which is 1.95%\nbetter than the second-best CQT transformation technique. Moreover, our\nproposed NRC-Net with CWT obtained an accuracy of 97.4%, which is 1.71% higher\nthan the VGG16.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2023 01:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

A\nranking model is further utilized to learn a score function that helps\nrecommend a list of ranked parking spots for a specific on-street parking\nquery. The method is verified using the on-street parking meter data in Hong\nKong and San Francisco. By comparing with the other two types of methods:\nprediction-only and prediction-then-recommendation, the proposed\ndirect-recommendation method achieves satisfactory performance in different\nmetrics. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that the proposed ESGraph and\nthe recommendation model are more efficient in terms of computational\nefficiency as well as saving drivers' on-street parking time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2023 03:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

The role of alignment is well-studied for\nlow-level enhancement in video, but existing works have overlooked one critical\nstep -- re-sampling. Most works, regardless of how they compensate for motion\nbetween frames, be it flow-based warping or deformable convolution/attention,\nuse the default choice of bilinear interpolation for re-sampling. However,\nbilinear interpolation acts effectively as a low-pass filter and thus hinders\nthe aim of recovering high-frequency content for super-resolution.\n  This paper studies the impact of re-sampling on alignment for video\nsuper-resolution. Extensive experiments reveal that for alignment to be\neffective, the re-sampling should preserve the original sharpness of the\nfeatures and prevent distortions. From these observations, we propose an\nimplicit alignment method that re-samples through a window-based\ncross-attention with sampling positions encoded by sinusoidal positional\nencoding. The re-sampling is implicitly computed by learned network weights.\nExperiments show that the proposed implicit alignment enhances the performance\nof state-of-the-art frameworks with minimal impact on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2023 03:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

This is not only time-consuming, but also\ninaccurate during time-varying grid conditions, while on top of that, the\nidentified nonparametric model cannot be immediately used for stability\nanalysis or control design. To tackle these problems, we propose to use\nparametric system identification techniques (e.g., prediction error or subspace\nmethods) to obtain a parametric impedance model directly from time-domain\ncurrent and voltage data.

Second, it helps to preserve the smoothness of the free surface\nand to reduce mass loss.

The holy grail of such approaches is the\nfree-living scenario, in which data are collected continuously and\nunobtrusively during every day life. However, obtaining fine-grained\nground-truth and remaining unobtrusive is a contradiction and therefore, the\nproblem is usually addressed via multiple-instance learning. Yet for large\nscale studies, obtaining even the necessary coarse ground-truth is not trivial,\nas a complete neurological evaluation is required. In contrast, large scale\ncollection of data without any ground-truth is much easier. Nevertheless,\nutilizing unlabelled data in a multiple-instance setting is not\nstraightforward, as the topic has received very little research attention. Here\nwe try to fill this gap by introducing a new method for combining\nsemi-supervised with multiple-instance learning.

These works, however, often use an idealistic\nassumption that the risk is constant and not affected by individual behaviors.\nWe here develop a coevolutionary game approach that captures the coupled\ndynamics of cooperation and risk. In particular, the level of contributions in\na population affects the state of risk, while the risk in turn influences\nindividuals' behavioral decision-making. Importantly, we explore two\nrepresentative feedback forms describing the possible effect of strategy on\nrisk, namely, linear and exponential feedbacks. We find that cooperation can be\nmaintained in the population by keeping at a certain fraction or forming an\nevolutionary oscillation with risk, independently of the feedback type.\nHowever, such evolutionary outcome depends on the initial state.

We investigate to which extent this foreground may impact the\nCMB fluctuations map and create the so-called CMB anomalies. Using the observed\ntemperature decrements around the galaxies, and making some general assumptions\nabout the unknown interaction, we propose a common radial temperature profile.\nBy assigning this profile to nearby galaxies in the redshift range\n$z=[0.004,0.02]$ we create a foreground map model.

In-situ synchrotron\ndiffraction has unraveled a medium-range ordering process dominated by\nedge-sharing cluster connectivity during the liquid-liquid phase transition.\nMoreover, nanodomains with topological order have been found to exist in\ncomposition with liquid-liquid phase transition, manifesting as hexagonal\npatterns in small-angle neutron scattering profiles. The liquid-liquid phase\ntransition can induce the nanodomains to be more locally ordered, generating\nstronger exchange interactions due to the reduced Fe-Fe bond and the enhanced\nstructural order, leading to the increment of saturation magnetization.\nFurthermore, the increased local heterogeneity in the medium range scale\nenhances the magnetic anisotropy, promoting the permeability response under\napplied stress and leading to a better stress-impedance effect. These\nexperimental results pave the way to tailor the magnetic structure and\nperformance through the liquid-liquid phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2023 15:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

From the first-principles electronic structure perspective, one\nof the outstanding problems is accurately and efficiently calculating how the\nfrontier quasiparticle levels of one component are aligned in energy with those\nof another at the interface, i.e., the so-called interfacial band alignment or\nlevel alignment. The alignment or the energy offset of these frontier levels is\nassociated with the charge-transfer barrier across the interface and therefore\ndictates the interfacial dynamics. Although many-body perturbation theory\nprovides a formally rigorous framework for computing the interfacial electronic\nstructure, it is often associated with a high computational cost and is limited\nby its perturbative nature. It is therefore of great interest to develop\npractical alternatives, preferably based on density functional theory (DFT),\nwhich is known for its balance between efficiency and accuracy. However,\nconventional developments of density functionals largely focus on total\nenergies and thermodynamic properties, and the design of functionals aiming for\ninterfacial electronic structure is only emerging recently. This Review is\ndedicated to a self-contained narrative of the interfacial electronic structure\nproblem and the efforts of the DFT community in tackling it.

This is followed by a review of early examinations of the\nsurface exchange-correlation hole and the exchange-correlation potential, which\nare central quantities in DFT.

The fluid is at zero\nReynolds number, and the viscosity varies linearly in space in an arbitrary\ndirection with respect to the external force. First, we obtain the correction\nto the spheroid's rigid body motion in the limit of small viscosity gradients,\nusing a perturbation expansion combined with the reciprocal theorem. Next, we\ndetermine the general form of the particle's mobility tensor relating its rigid\nbody motion to an external force and torque. The viscosity gradient does not\nalter the force/translation and torque/rotation relationships, but introduces\nnew force/rotation and torque/translation couplings that are determined for a\nwide range of particle aspect ratios. Finally, we discuss results for the\nspheroid's rotation and center-of-mass trajectory during sedimentation.\nDepending on the viscosity gradient direction and particle shape, a steady\norientation may arise at long times or the particle may tumble continuously.\nThese results are significantly different from the case when no viscosity\ngradient is present, where the particle stays at its initial orientation for\nall times.

Besides, auxiliary classifiers are proposed to make\nrelation networks capture class-oriented relation that benefits classification\ntask. Experiments demonstrate that CORSD achieves remarkable improvements.\nCompared to baseline, 3.8%, 1.5% and 4.5% averaged accuracy boost can be\nobserved on CIFAR100, ImageNet and CUB-200-2011, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 16:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

He proposed that the final result of the\ngravitational collapse should not be an event horizon, but an apparent horizon\ninstead. On the other hand, Hawking did not give a mechanism for how this could\nwork. In the same year, Vaz endorsed Hawking's proposal in a quantum\ngravitational model of dust collapse by winning the Second Prize in the 2014\nGravity Research Foundation Essay Competition. He indeed showed that continued\ncollapse to a singularity can only be obtained if one combines two independent\nand entire solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Vaz's interpretation of\nthe paradox was in terms of simply forbidding such a combination. This leads\nnaturally to matter condensing on the apparent horizon during quantum collapse.\nIn that way, an entirely new framework for black holes (BHs) has emerged. The\napproach of Vaz was also consistent with Einstein's idea in 1939 of the\nlocalization of the collapsing particles within a thin spherical shell. In this\nwork we derive the BH mass and energy spectra via a Schrodinger-like approach,\nby further supporting Vaz's conclusions that instead of a spacetime singularity\ncovered by an event horizon, the final result of the gravitational collapse is\nan essentially quantum object, an extremely compact \"dark star\". This\n\"gravitational atom\" is held up not by any degeneracy pressure but by quantum\ngravity in the same way that ordinary atoms are sustained by quantum mechanics.\nFinally, by evoking the generalized uncertainty principle, the maximum value of\nthe density of Vaz's shell will be estimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2023 09:37:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 May 2023 10:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Healthy RBCs have a biconcave shape and\na flexible membrane enabling them to undergo substantial reversible elastic\ndeformation as they traverse narrow capillaries during microcirculation. This\nRBC deformability is critical for efficient circulation while the unique\nbiconcave shape of healthy RBCs is attributed to their specific volume, which\naffects the amount of oxygen they can carry. However, despite extensive\nresearch, the underlying mechanism that determines the optimal RBC volume\nremains unknown. This paper examines the impact of RBC volume on the efficiency\nof oxygen transport from a fluid dynamics standpoint. Our investigation reveals\nthat RBCs with volumes similar to those observed in vivo demonstrate superior\noxygen transport efficiency in circular tubes similar to arterioles, which\nrepresent areas of the circulatory system with the highest flow resistance.\nFurthermore, we identify mechanisms that impair oxygen transport when the RBC\nvolume deviates from the optimal value. While healthy RBCs produce a maximum\ncell-free layer thickness that affects flow dissipation, smaller RBC volumes\nresult in greater deformations and thus dissipate more energy. Strikingly, the\nflow resistance is minimized at the reduced volume of healthy RBCs. Our study\nhighlights that the volume of healthy RBCs maximizes oxygen transport\nefficiency and may offer insight into developing targeted treatments for\ncirculatory disorders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 21:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

It contains more than 2.8 million\nobjects, each with image(s), listing text, mass, price, product ratings, and\nposition in Amazon's product-category taxonomy. We also design a comprehensive\ntaxonomy of 182 physical materials (e.g., Plastic $\\rightarrow$ Thermoplastic\n$\\rightarrow$ Acrylic). Objects are annotated with one or more materials from\nthis taxonomy. With the numerous attributes available for each object, we\ndevelop a Smart Labeling framework to quickly add new binary labels to all\nobjects with very little manual labeling effort, making the dataset extensible.\nEach object attribute in our dataset can be included in either the model inputs\nor outputs, leading to combinatorial possibilities in task configurations. For\nexample, we can train a model to predict the object category from the listing\ntext, or the mass and price from the product listing image. EMMa offers a new\nbenchmark for multi-task learning in computer vision and NLP, and allows\npractitioners to efficiently add new tasks and object attributes at scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2023 09:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}
