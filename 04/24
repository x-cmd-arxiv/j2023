To implement a general\nvision model, we need to develop deep learning models that can adaptively\nselect valid information from multi-modal data. This is mainly based on two\nreasons. Multi-modal learning can break through the inherent defects of\nsingle-modal data, and adaptive information selection can reduce chaos in\nmulti-modal data. To tackle this problem, we propose a universal\nuncertainty-aware multi-modal fusion model. It adopts a multi-pipeline loosely\ncoupled architecture to combine the features and results from point clouds and\nimages. To quantify the correlation in multi-modal information, we model the\nuncertainty, as the inverse of data information, in different modalities and\nembed it in the bounding box generation. In this way, our model reduces the\nrandomness in fusion and generates reliable output. Moreover, we conducted a\ncompleted investigation on the KITTI 2D object detection dataset and its\nderived dirty data. Our fusion model is proven to resist severe noise\ninterference like Gaussian, motion blur, and frost, with only slight\ndegradation. The experiment results demonstrate the benefits of our adaptive\nfusion.

Especially, arrays of\nsuperconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) could require more\nthan $10^6$ readout lines. Performing signal processing operations at low\ntemperatures could be a solution. Nanocryotrons, superconducting nanowire\nthree-terminal devices, are good candidates for integrating sensing and\nelectronics on the same technological platform as SNSPDs in photon-counting\napplications. In this work, we demonstrated that it is possible to read out,\nprocess, encode, and store the output of SNSPDs using exclusively\nsuperconducting nanowires.

These techniques are further integrated as GACER -- an automated\noptimization framework that provides high-utilization, high-throughput, and\nlow-latency multi-tenant computing support. And our experiments demonstrate\nthat GACER significantly improves the overall resource utilization and\nconsistently achieves outstanding speedups compared to native GPU computing\nframeworks and existing state-of-the-art optimization works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 20:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

In this paper we consider\ncollaborative settings where the human and robot have the same objective, and\nthe human is uncertain about the robot's type (i.e., the robot's internal\nstate). We extend a recursive combination of Bayesian Nash equilibrium and the\nBellman equation to solve for optimal robot policies.

This has become one of the favorite channels of\ncommunication with companies in recent years. However, contact centers face\noperational challenges, since the measurement of common proxies for customer\nexperience, such as knowledge of whether customers have abandoned the queue and\ntheir willingness to wait for service (patience), are subject to information\nuncertainty. We focus this research on the impact of a main source of such\nuncertainty: silent abandonment by customers. These customers leave the system\nwhile waiting for a reply to their inquiry, but give no indication of doing so,\nsuch as closing the mobile app of the interaction. As a result, the system is\nunaware that they have left and waste agent time and capacity until this fact\nis realized. In this paper, we show that 30%-67% of the abandoning customers\nabandon the system silently, and that such customer behavior reduces system\nefficiency by 5%-15%. To do so, we develop methodologies to identify\nsilent-abandonment customers in two types of contact centers: chat and\nmessaging systems. We first use text analysis and an SVM model to estimate the\nactual abandonment level. We then use a parametric estimator and develop an\nexpectation-maximization algorithm to estimate customer patience accurately, as\ncustomer patience is an important parameter for fitting queueing models to the\ndata. We show how accounting for silent abandonment in a queueing model\nimproves dramatically the estimation accuracy of key measures of performance.\nFinally, we suggest strategies to operationally cope with the phenomenon of\nsilent abandonment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 21:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

The event was recorded by multiple solar instruments including\nthe Nan\\c{c}ay Radioheliograh that measure the properties of the radio source.\nThe BBPs start $\\sim$24 min before the flare onset, extending from $<$ 360 to\nabove 800 MHz with no discernible spectral drift. The BBPs consist of two\nstages, during the first stage the main source remains stationary, during the\nsecond stage it moves outward along with a steepening extreme-ultraviolet (EUV)\nwave driven by the eruption of a high-temperature structure. In both stages, we\nobserve frequent EUV brightenings and jets originating from the flare region.\nDuring the second stage, the BBPs become denser in number and stronger in\ngeneral, with the level of the polarization increasing gradually from $<$ 20%\nto $>$ 60% in the right-handed sense. These observations indicate the\nsteepening EUV wave is important to the BBPs during the second stage, while the\npreflare reconnections causing the jets and EUV brightenings are important in\nboth stages. This is the first time such a strong association of an EUV wave\nwith BBPs is reported.

The proposed strategy, inspired by a hierarchical\nframework, is coordinated by the upper layer of path-tracking control and the\nlower layer of direct yaw moment control. Based on the linear time-varying\nmodel predictive control (LTV MPC) algorithm, the effects of prediction horizon\nand weight coefficients on the path-tracking accuracy and yaw stability of the\nvehicle are compared and analyzed first.

In this regard, most existing\nstudies assume the boundary separating the cured and non-cured subjects with\nrespect to the covariates to be linear. As such, they can only capture simple\neffects of the covariates on the cured/non-cured probability.

In\ncontrast to the case of the archetype kagome system AV3Sb5 (A= K, Rb, Cs), the\nvan Hove singularities in ScV6Sn6 remain intact across the charge order\ntransition, indicating a marginal role of the electronic instability from the V\nkagome lattice. Instead, we identified a three-dimensional band with dominant\nplanar Sn character opening a large charge order gap of 260 meV and strongly\nreconstructing the Fermi surface. Our complementary phonon dispersion\ncalculations further emphasize the role of the structural components other than\nthe V kagome lattice by revealing the unstable planar Sn and Sc phonon modes\nassociated to the root3*root3 phase. Finally, in the constructed phase diagram\nof Sc(V1-xCrx)6Sn6, the charge order remains robust in a wide doping range x =\n0 ~ 0.10 against the Fermi level shift up to ~ 120 meV, further making the\nelectronic scenarios such as Fermi surface or saddle point nesting unlikely.\nOur multimodal investigations demonstrate that the physics of ScV6Sn6 is\nfundamentally different from the canonical kagome metal AV3Sb5, uncovering a\nnew mechanism to induce symmetry-breaking phase transition in kagome lattice\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 04:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Nearly all existing feature-distillation methods use L2 distance or\nits slight variants as the distance metric between teacher and student\nfeatures.

Considering this, we argue that the similarity between\nteacher and student features should not be measured merely based on their\nappearance (i.e., L2 distance), but should, more importantly, be measured by\ntheir difference in function, namely how later layers of the network will read,\ndecode, and process them.

With FCFD, the\nstudent mimics the teacher more faithfully and learns more from the teacher.\nExtensive experiments on image classification and object detection demonstrate\nthe superiority of FCFD to existing methods.

Portfolio optimization is a process of modulating asset distributions\nto maximize expected returns and minimize risks. To obtain the expected\nreturns, deep learning models have been explored in recent years. However, due\nto the deterministic nature of the models, it is difficult to consider the risk\nof portfolios because conventional deep learning models do not know how\nreliable their predictions can be. To address this limitation, this paper\nproposes a probabilistic model, namely predictive auxiliary classifier\ngenerative adversarial networks (PredACGAN). The proposed PredACGAN utilizes\nthe characteristic of the ACGAN framework in which the output of the generator\nforms a distribution. While ACGAN has not been employed for predictive models\nand is generally utilized for image sample generation, this paper proposes a\nmethod to use the ACGAN structure for a probabilistic and predictive model.\nAdditionally, an algorithm to use the risk measurement obtained by PredACGAN is\nproposed. In the algorithm, the assets that are predicted to be at high risk\nare eliminated from the investment universe at the rebalancing moment.\nTherefore, PredACGAN considers both return and risk to optimize portfolios. The\nproposed algorithm and PredACGAN have been evaluated with daily close price\ndata of S&P 500 from 1990 to 2020.

Closed-loop systems can continually\ncheck whether the resonator is at resonance and accordingly adjust the\nfrequency of the driving signal. In this work, we study three resonance\nfrequency tracking schemes, a feedback-free (FF), a self-sustaining oscillator\n(SSO), and a phase-locked loop oscillator (PLLO) scheme.

We use\nan idealised global spherical Boussinesq model to study the influence of stable\nstratification and semi-convective layers on tidal dissipation rates. We carry\nout analytical and numerical calculations considering realistic tidal forcing\nand measure how the viscous and thermal dissipation rates depend on the\nparameters relating to the internal stratification profile. We find that the\nstrongly frequency-dependent tidal dissipation rate is highly dependent on the\nparameters relating to the stable stratification, with strong resonant peaks\nthat align with the internal modes of the system. The locations and sizes of\nthese resonances depend on the form and parameters of the stratification, which\nwe explore both analytically and numerically. Our results suggest that stable\nstratification can significantly enhance the tidal dissipation in particular\nfrequency ranges. Analytical calculations in the low frequency regime give us\nscaling laws for the key parameters, including the tidal quality factor $Q'$\ndue to internal gravity waves. Stably stratified layers can significantly\ncontribute to tidal dissipation in solar and extrasolar giant planets, and we\nestimate substantial tidal evolution for hot Neptunes.

MIL can be broadly\ncategorized into two types: traditional methods and those based on deep\nlearning. These approaches have yielded significant results, especially with\nregards to their problem-solving strategies and experimental validation,\nproviding valuable insights for researchers in the MIL field. However, a\nconsiderable amount of knowledge is often trapped within the algorithm, leading\nto subsequent MIL algorithms that solely rely on the model's data fitting to\npredict unlabeled samples. This results in a significant loss of knowledge and\nimpedes the development of more intelligent models. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel data-driven knowledge fusion for deep multi-instance learning (DKMIL)\nalgorithm. DKMIL adopts a completely different idea from existing deep MIL\nmethods by analyzing the decision-making of key samples in the data set\n(referred to as the data-driven) and using the knowledge fusion module designed\nto extract valuable information from these samples to assist the model's\ntraining. In other words, this module serves as a new interface between data\nand the model, providing strong scalability and enabling the use of prior\nknowledge from existing algorithms to enhance the learning ability of the\nmodel. Furthermore, to adapt the downstream modules of the model to more\nknowledge-enriched features extracted from the data-driven knowledge fusion\nmodule, we propose a two-level attention module that gradually learns shallow-\nand deep-level features of the samples to achieve more effective\nclassification.

We argue that one of the causes of this defect\nis that the surround-view Transformers do not consider the stereo-specific\nimage correspondence information. In a surround-view system, the overlapping\nareas are small, and thus correspondence is not a primary issue. In this paper,\nwe explore the model design of vision Transformers in stereo 3D object\ndetection, focusing particularly on extracting and encoding the task-specific\nimage correspondence information. To achieve this goal, we present TS3D, a\nTransformer-based Stereo-aware 3D object detector.

Then, we construct\nreduced-order-models (ROMs) on the embedded manifold via two techniques:\nFeedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) and the Koopman operator. Finally, for\npredicting the out-of-sample long-term dynamics of brain activity in the\nambient fMRI space, we solve the pre-image problem coupling DMs with Geometric\nHarmonics (GH) when using FNNs and the Koopman modes per se. For our\nillustrations, we have assessed the performance of the two proposed schemes\nusing a benchmark fMRI dataset with recordings during a visuo-motor task.

Despite this progress and\ntremendous research efforts, several issues still need to be addressed that\nlimit the applicability of DNNs in automated driving. The bad generalization of\nDNNs to new, unseen domains is a major problem on the way to a safe,\nlarge-scale application, because manual annotation of new domains is costly,\nparticularly for semantic segmentation. For this reason, methods are required\nto adapt DNNs to new domains without labeling effort. The task, which these\nmethods aim to solve is termed unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). While\nseveral different domain shifts can challenge DNNs, the shift between synthetic\nand real data is of particular importance for automated driving, as it allows\nthe use of simulation environments for DNN training.

We aim at finding what\nare the minimum ingredients needed to trigger a dynamo instability and what is\nthe relation between dynamo and the growth of vorticity.\n  We use the Pencil code to run resistive MHD direct numerical simulations. We\nreport no dynamo in all cases where only rotation is included, regardless on\nthe equation of state. Conversely, the inclusion of a background sinusoidal\nshearing profile leads to an hydrodynamic instability that produces an\nexponential growth of the vorticity at all scales, starting from small ones.\nThis is know as vorticity dynamo. The onset of this instability occurs after a\nrather long temporal evolution of several thousand turbulent turnover times.\nThe vorticity dynamo in turn drives an exponential growth of the magnetic\nfield, first at small scales, then also at large one. The instability then\nsaturates and the magnetic field approximately reaches equipartition with the\nturbulent kinetic energy. During the saturation phase we can observe a winding\nof the magnetic field in the direction of the shearing flow. By varying the\nintensity of the shear we see that the growth rates of this instability change.\nThe inclusion of the baroclinic term delays the onset of the vorticity dynamo\nbut leads to a more rapid growth.\n  We demonstrate how in the presence of shear, even a purely irrotational\nforcing amplifies the field to equipartition.

The force depends\non material properties, loading conditions and external factors such as\ntemperature and humidity, but also contact aging has been identified as a\nprimary factor. Several aging mechanisms have been proposed, including\nincreased \"contact quantity\" due to plastic or elastic creep and enhanced\n\"contact quality\" due to formation of strong interfacial bonds. While proposed\nmechanisms for frictional aging have been dependent upon the presence of a\nnormal force, this factor is not a fundamental prerequisite for the occurrence\nof aging. In light of this, we present a novel demonstration of a substantial\nfrictional aging effect within a cubic silicon carbide system, even when a\nnormal force is entirely absent. Our observations indicate that the\ntime-evolution of the frictional aging effect follows a logarithmic behavior,\nwhich is a pattern that has been previously observed in numerous other\nmaterials. To explain this behavior, we provide a derivation that is rooted in\nbasic statistical mechanics, demonstrating that surface diffusion, a phenomenon\nthat serves to minimize surface energy in the interface region, can account for\nthe observed behavior. Upon application of a normal force, the friction force\nis enhanced owing to the presence of plastic creep. Although aging resulting\nfrom plastic and elastic creep is widely recognized and incorporated into most\nfriction laws, diffusion-driven aging has received comparatively less\nattention. The ultimate objective is to develop or redesign friction laws by\nincorporating the microscopic behavior, with the potential to enhance their\neffectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 09:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

The problem becomes more challenging with the presence of\nunobserved confounders. When there are unobserved confounders, the commonly\nused back-door adjustment is not applicable. Although the instrumental variable\n(IV) methods can deal with unobserved confounders, they all assume that the\ntreatment directly affects the outcome, and there is no mediator between the\ntreatment and the outcome. This paper aims to use the front-door criterion to\naddress the challenging problem with the presence of unobserved confounders and\nmediators. In practice, it is often difficult to identify the set of variables\nused for front-door adjustment from data. By leveraging the ability of deep\ngenerative models in representation learning, we propose FDVAE to learn the\nrepresentation of a Front-Door adjustment set with a Variational AutoEncoder,\ninstead of trying to search for a set of variables for front-door adjustment.\nExtensive experiments on synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of FDVAE\nand its superiority over existing methods. The experiments also show that the\nperformance of FDVAE is not sensitive to the causal strength of unobserved\nconfounders and is feasible in the case of dimensionality mismatch between\nlearned representations and the ground truth. We further apply the method to\nthree real-world datasets to demonstrate its potential applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 10:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

This lag is small, and systematically\ndecreases with increasing mass accretion rate towards the hard-soft transition,\nconsistent with a decreasing truncation radius between the thin disc and X-ray\nhot inner flow. However, the soft lag suddenly increases dramatically just\nbefore the spectrum becomes disc-dominated (hard-intermediate state).\nInterpreting this as reverberation requires that the X-ray source distance from\nthe disc increases dramatically, potentially consistent with switching to\nX-rays produced in the radio jet. However, this change in lag behaviour occurs\nwithout any clear change in hard X-ray spectrum, and before the plasmoid\nejection event which might produce such a source (soft-intermediate state).\nInstead, we show how the soft lag can be interpreted in the context of\npropagation lags from mass accretion rate fluctuations. These normally produce\nhard lags, as the model has radial stratification, with fluctuations from\nlarger radii modulating the harder spectra produced at smaller radii. However,\nall that is required to switch the sign is that the hottest Comptonized\nemission has seed photons which allow it to extend down in energy below the\nsofter emission from the slower variable turbulent region from the inner edge\nof the disc.

The generalized CEM is described within a\nmathematical framework and it is shown to work numerically with various\nexamples of up to six components from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 11:51:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 08:43:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 08:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

With large neural models and massive\navailable data, current dialogue systems have access to more knowledge than any\npeople in their life. However, current dialogue systems still do not perform at\na human level. One major gap between conversational agents and humans lies in\ntheir abilities to be aware of social norms. The development of socially-aware\ndialogue systems is impeded due to the lack of resources. In this paper, we\npresent the first socially-aware dialogue corpus - SocialDial, based on Chinese\nsocial culture. SocialDial consists of two parts: 1,563 multi-turn dialogues\nbetween two human speakers with fine-grained labels, and 4,870 synthetic\nconversations generated by ChatGPT. The human corpus covers five categories of\nsocial norms, which have 14 sub-categories in total. Specifically, it contains\nsocial factor annotations including social relation, context, social distance,\nand social norms. However, collecting sufficient socially-aware dialogues is\ncostly. Thus, we harness the power of ChatGPT and devise an ontology-based\nsynthetic data generation framework. This framework is able to generate\nsynthetic data at scale. To ensure the quality of synthetic dialogues, we\ndesign several mechanisms for quality control during data collection. Finally,\nwe evaluate our dataset using several pre-trained models, such as BERT and\nRoBERTa. Comprehensive empirical results based on state-of-the-art neural\nmodels demonstrate that modeling of social norms for dialogue systems is a\npromising research direction. To the best of our knowledge, SocialDial is the\nfirst socially-aware dialogue dataset that covers multiple social factors and\nhas fine-grained labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 11:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

In this work, we present a fundamentally different approach\ncalled Cut-Shortcut for fast and precise pointer analysis for Java. Its insight\nis simple: the main effect of cloning methods under different contexts is to\nfilter spurious object flows that have been merged inside a callee method; from\nthe view of a typical pointer flow graph (PFG), such effect can be simulated by\ncutting off (Cut) the edges that introduce precision loss to certain pointers\nand adding Shortcut edges directly from source pointers to the target ones\ncircumventing the method on PFG. As a result, we can achieve the effect of\ncontext sensitivity without contexts. We identify three general program\npatterns and develop algorithms based on them to safely cut off and add\nshortcut edges on PFG, formalize them and formally prove the soundness. To\ncomprehensively validate Cut-Shortcut's effectiveness, we implement two\nversions of Cut-Shortcut for two state-of-the-art pointer analysis frameworks\nfor Java, one in Datalog for the declarative Doop and the other in Java for the\nimperative Tai-e, and we consider all the large and complex programs used in\nrecent literatures that meet the experimental requirements. The evaluation\nresults are extremely promising: Cut-Shortcut is even able to run faster than\ncontext insensitivity for most evaluated programs while obtaining high\nprecision that is comparable to context sensitivity (if scalable) in both\nframeworks.

TransMix uses\nunreliable attention maps to compute mixed attention labels that can affect the\nmodel. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose MaskMix and Progressive\nAttention Labeling (PAL) in image and label space, respectively. In detail,\nfrom the perspective of image space, we design MaskMix, which mixes two images\nbased on a patch-like grid mask. In particular, the size of each mask patch is\nadjustable and is a multiple of the image patch size, which ensures each image\npatch comes from only one image and contains more global contents. From the\nperspective of label space, we design PAL, which utilizes a progressive factor\nto dynamically re-weight the attention weights of the mixed attention label.\nFinally, we combine MaskMix and Progressive Attention Labeling as our new data\naugmentation method, named MixPro.

In our work, we propose a new\nsemi-GF coordinated random access (RA) protocol, denoted as partial-information\nmultiple access (PIMA), to reduce packet loss and latency, particularly in the\npresence of sporadic activations. We consider a machine-type communications\n(MTC) scenario, wherein devices need to transmit data packets in the uplink to\na base station (BS). When using PIMA, the BS can acquire partial information on\nthe instantaneous traffic conditions and, using compute-over-the-air\ntechniques, estimate the number of devices with packets waiting for\ntransmission in their queue. Based on this knowledge, the BS assigns to each\ndevice a single slot for transmission. However, since each slot may still be\nassigned to multiple users, collisions may occur. Both the total number of\nallocated slots and the user assignments are optimized, based on the estimated\nnumber of active users, to reduce collisions and improve the efficiency of the\nmultiple access scheme. To prove the validity of our solution, we compare PIMA\nto time-division multiple-access (TDMA) and slotted ALOHA (SALOHA) schemes, the\nideal solutions for orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in the time domain in the\ncase of low and high traffic conditions, respectively.

Distinct from previous\nKG-based approaches, KIRS-CL utilizes structural and connectivity information\nwith high-quality item embeddings learned by encoding KG triples with a\npre-trained language model. These well-trained entity representations enable\nKIRS-CL to find the item to recommend via the preference connection between the\nuser and the item. Additionally, to improve the generalizability of our\nframework, we introduce a contrastive warm-up learning strategy, making it\ncapable of dealing with both warm- and cold-start recommendation scenarios.\nExtensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate remarkable\nimprovements over state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 13:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Based on in-situ experimental observations, post-mortem\nmicrotomography and acoustic simulations, the present work provides direct\nevidence on the role of cavitation bubbles in the stone surface fragmentation\nby correlating the detected damages to the observed bubble activity. Our\nresults show that not all clouds erode the stone, but only those located in\npreferential nucleation sites whose locations are herein examined. In addition,\nquantitative characterizations of the bubble clouds and their trajectories\nwithin the ultrasonic field are discussed.

In general, women are\nunder-represented on these teams and face challenges and difficulties in their\nworkplaces. When it comes to women who are mothers, these challenges can be\namplified and directly impact these women's professional lives, both in\nindustry and academia. However, little is known about women ICT practitioners'\nperceptions of the challenges of maternity in their professional careers.\nObjective: This paper investigates mothers' challenges and difficulties in\nglobal software development teams. Method: We conducted a survey with women ICT\npractitioners who work in academia and global technology companies. We surveyed\n141 mothers from different countries and employed mixed methods to analyze the\ndata. Results: Our findings reveal that women face sociocultural challenges,\nincluding work-life balance issues, bad jokes, and moral harassment.\nFurthermore, few women occupy leadership positions in software teams, and most\nreported that they did not have a support network during and after maternity\nleave, feeling overloaded. The surveyed women suggested a set of actions to\nreduce the challenges they face in their workplaces, such as: i) changing\nculture; ii) creating a code of conduct for men; iii) more empathy; iv)\ncreating childcare within companies; and v) creating opportunities/programs for\nwomen in the software industry and academia.

In the ViEWS forecasting challenge, a\nprediction competition on state-based violence, a novel evaluation score called\ntargeted absolute deviation with direction augmentation (TADDA) has therefore\nbeen suggested, which accounts for both for the sign and magnitude of\nlog-changes. While it has a straightforward intuitive motivation, the empirical\nresults of the challenge show that a no-change model always predicting a\nlog-change of zero outperforms all submitted forecasting models under the TADDA\nscore.

Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to\ndesign metamaterials with multiple nonlinear deformations of arbitrary\ncomplexity. To this end, we introduce a novel sequential nonlinear method to\ndesign multiple target modes.

These pathological images are traditionally divided into small\npatches to enable deep learning due to hardware limitations.

In this paper, we propose a fast and\nstructure-aware halftoning method via a data-driven approach.

Contemporary techniques can be divided\ninto two groups: fine-tuning based and meta-learning based approaches. While\nmeta-learning approaches aim to learn dedicated meta-models for mapping samples\nto novel class models, fine-tuning approaches tackle few-shot detection in a\nsimpler manner, by adapting the detection model to novel classes through\ngradient based optimization. Despite their simplicity, fine-tuning based\napproaches typically yield competitive detection results. Based on this\nobservation, we focus on the role of loss functions and augmentations as the\nforce driving the fine-tuning process, and propose to tune their dynamics\nthrough meta-learning principles. The proposed training scheme, therefore,\nallows learning inductive biases that can boost few-shot detection, while\nkeeping the advantages of fine-tuning based approaches. In addition, the\nproposed approach yields interpretable loss functions, as opposed to highly\nparametric and complex few-shot meta-models.

Encoded diffraction offers a hybrid approach that pairs\nanalog wave propagation with digital back-end electronics, however the\nintermediate sensor patterns are correlations rather than linear signal\nweights, which limits the development of robust and efficient downstream\nanalyses. Here, with vortex encoders, we show that the solution for the signal\nfield from sensor intensity adopts the form of polynomial regression, which is\nsubsequently solved with a learned, linear transformation. This result\nestablishes an analytic rationale for a spectral-methods paradigm in physically\nrealized machine learning systems. To demonstrate this paradigm, we quantify\nthe learning that is transferred with an image basis using speckle parameters,\nSingular-Value Decomposition Entropy ($H_{SVD}$) and Speckle-Analogue Density\n(SAD). We show that $H_{SVD}$, a proxy for image complexity, indicates the rate\nat which a model converges. Similarly, SAD, an averaged spatial frequency,\nmarks a threshold for structurally similar reconstruction. With a vortex\nencoder, this approach with parameterized training may be extended to distill\nfeatures. In fact, with images reconstructed with our models, we achieve\nclassification accuracies that rival decade-old, state-of-the-art computer\nalgorithms. This means that the process of learning compressed spectral\ncorrelations distills features to aid image classification, even when the goal\nimages are feature-agnostic speckles.

To trace the\nevolving properties of graphs, it is necessary to maintain every change of both\nvertices and edges in graph databases with the support of temporal features.\nExisting works either maintain all changes in a single graph or periodically\nmaterialize snapshots to maintain the historical states of each vertex and edge\nand process queries over proper snapshots. The former approach presents poor\nquery performance due to the ever-growing graph size as time goes by, while the\nlatter one suffers from prohibitively high storage overheads due to large\nredundant copies of graph data across different snapshots. In this paper, we\npropose a hybrid data storage engine, which is based on the MVCC mechanism, to\nseparately manage current and historical data, which keeps the current graph as\nsmall as possible. In our design, changes in each vertex or edge are stored\nonce. To further reduce the storage overhead, we simply store the changes as\nopposed to storing the complete snapshot. To boost the query performance, we\nplace a few anchors as snapshots to avoid deep historical version traversals.\nBased on the storage engine, a temporal query engine is proposed to reconstruct\nsubgraphs as needed on the fly. Therefore, our alternative approach can provide\nfast querying capabilities over subgraphs at a past time point or range with\nsmall storage overheads. To provide native support of temporal features, we\nintegrate our approach into Memgraph, and call the extended database system\nTGDB(Temporal Graph Database). Extensive experiments are conducted on four real\nand synthetic datasets. The results show TGDB performs better in terms of both\nstorage and performance against state-of-the-art methods and has almost no\nperformance overheads by introducing the temporal features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 15:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Indeed, the epidemic of COVID-19 clearly demonstrated\nthat people changed their activity in response to the epidemic, which\nsubsequently modified the disease dynamics. To predict the behavioral change\nrelevant to the disease dynamics, we need to know the epidemic situation (e.g.,\nthe number of reported cases) at the moment of decision to change behavior.\nHowever, it is difficult to identify the timing of decision-making. In this\nstudy, we analyzed travel accommodation reservation data in four prefectures of\nJapan to observe decision-making timings and how it responded to the changing\nepidemic situation during Japan's Coronavirus Disease 2019 (eight waves until\nFebruary 2023). To this end, we defined 'mobility avoidance index' to indicate\npeople's decision of mobility avoidance and quantified it using the time-series\nof the accommodation booking/cancellation data. Our analysis revealed\nsemi-quantitative rules for day-to-day decision-making of human mobility under\na given epidemic situation. We observed matches of the peak dates of the index\nand the number of reported cases. Additionally, we found that mobility\navoidance index increased/decreased linearly with the logarithmic number of\nreported cases during the first epidemic wave.

To ensure safe and\nefficient point-to-point navigation an appropriate algorithm should be chosen\nkeeping the robot's dimensions and its classification in mind. Autonomous\nrobots use path-planning algorithms to safely navigate a dynamic, dense, and\nunknown environment. A few metrics for path planning algorithms to be taken\ninto account are safety, efficiency, lowest-cost path generation, and obstacle\navoidance. Before path planning can take place we need map representation which\ncan be discretized or open configuration space. Discretized configuration space\nprovides node/connectivity information from one point to another. While in\nopen/free configuration space it is up to the algorithm to create a list of\nnodes and then find a feasible path. Both types of maps are populated by\nobstacle positions using perception obstacle detection techniques to represent\ncurrent obstacles from the perspective of the robot. For open configuration\nspaces, sampling-based planning algorithms are used. This paper aims to explore\nvarious types of Sampling-based path-planning algorithms such as Probabilistic\nRoadMap (PRM), and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT).

This surprising\neffect can be easily reproduced in the lab with off-the-shelf components. Here\nwe investigate this novel type of magnetic levitation experimentally and\nclarify the underlying physics. Using a 19 mm diameter spherical NdFeB magnet\nas rotor magnet, we capture the detailed motion of levitating, spherical NdFeB\nmagnets, denoted floater magnets, as well as the influence of rotation speed\nand magnet size on the levitation. We find that as levitation occurs, the\nfloater magnet frequency-locks with the rotor magnet, and, noticeably, that the\nmagnetization of the floater is oriented close to the axis of rotation and\ntowards the like pole of the rotor magnet. This is in contrast to what might be\nexpected by the laws of magnetostatics as the floater is observed to align its\nmagnetization essentially perpendicular to the magnetic field of the rotor.\nMoreover, we find that the size of the floater has a clear influence on the\nlevitation: the smaller the floater, the higher the rotor speed necessary to\nachieve levitation, and the further away the levitation point shifts. Despite\nthe unexpected magnetic configuration during levitation, we verify that\nmagnetostatic interactions between the rotating magnets are responsible for\ncreating the equilibrium position of the floater. Hence, this type of magnetic\nlevitation does not rely on gravity as a balancing force to achieve an\nequilibrium position. Based on theoretical arguments and a numerical model, we\nshow that a constant, vertical field and eddy-current enhanced damping is\nsufficient to produce levitation, and to display the same trends with respect\nto rotation speed and the floater magnet size as seen in the experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 08:31:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}
