The MD simulations include\noedometer creep, shear creep, direct shear tests, and stress relaxation. The\nnumerical results show that the nanoscale creep mechanism of clay is related to\nparticle rotation, translation, and stacking under different loading\nconditions. The clay sample under creep shows two types of particle\narrangements, i.e., the shifted face-to-face configuration and the face-to-edge\nconfiguration. The orientation angle of clay particles is computed to track the\nrotation of individual particles due to creep. The fabric variation of the clay\nunder creep is characterized by the dihedral angle between the basal particle\nplane and the x-y plane and the order parameter. It is found that the factors\naffecting the microstructure variation of the clay aggregate include stress\nlevels, loading rates, and particle sizes.

These\nstrategies are generally two-stage pipelines: \\emph{i)} an offline re-ranking\npolicy construction step and \\emph{ii)} an online sampling of rankings step.\nBuilding a re-ranking policy requires repeatedly solving a constrained\noptimization problem, one for each issued query. Thus, it is necessary to\nrecompute the optimization procedure for any new/unseen query. Regarding\nsampling, the Birkhoff-von-Neumann decomposition (BvND) is the favored approach\nto draw rankings from any DS-based policy. However, the BvND is too costly to\ncompute online. Hence, the BvND as a sampling solution is memory-consuming as\nit can grow as $\\gO(N\\, n^2)$ for $N$ queries and $n$ documents.\n  This paper offers a novel, fast, lightweight way to predict fair stochastic\nre-ranking policies: Constrained Meta-Optimal Transport (CoMOT).

It also displays fairness and ranking\nperformance similar to the original optimization-based policy. Furthermore, we\nempirically validate the effectiveness of GumMS to approximate DS-based\npolicies in expectation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2023 18:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

The task\nis challenging due to the significant differences between V and I modalities,\nespecially under real-world conditions, where images are corrupted by, e.g,\nblur, noise, and weather. Indeed, state-of-art V-I ReID models cannot leverage\ncorrupted modality information to sustain a high level of accuracy. In this\npaper, we propose an efficient model for multimodal V-I ReID -- named\nMultimodal Middle Stream Fusion (MMSF) -- that preserves modality-specific\nknowledge for improved robustness to corrupted multimodal images. In addition,\nthree state-of-art attention-based multimodal fusion models are adapted to\naddress corrupted multimodal data in V-I ReID, allowing to dynamically balance\neach modality importance. Recently, evaluation protocols have been proposed to\nassess the robustness of ReID models under challenging real-world scenarios.\nHowever, these protocols are limited to unimodal V settings. For realistic\nevaluation of multimodal (and cross-modal) V-I person ReID models, we propose\nnew challenging corrupted datasets for scenarios where V and I cameras are\nco-located (CL) and not co-located (NCL). Finally, the benefits of our Masking\nand Local Multimodal Data Augmentation (ML-MDA) strategy are explored to\nimprove the robustness of ReID models to multimodal corruption. Our experiments\non clean and corrupted versions of the SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and ThermalWORLD\ndatasets indicate the multimodal V-I ReID models that are more likely to\nperform well in real-world operational conditions. In particular, our ML-MDA is\nan important strategy for a V-I person ReID system to sustain high accuracy and\nrobustness when processing corrupted multimodal images.

Specifically, we propose MinMaxLTTB, a\ntwo-step algorithm that marks a significant enhancement in the scalability of\nLTTB. MinMaxLTTB entails the following two steps: (i) the MinMax algorithm\npreselects a certain ratio of minimum and maximum data points, followed by (ii)\napplying the LTTB algorithm on only these preselected data points, effectively\nreducing LTTB's time complexity. The low computational cost of the MinMax\nalgorithm, along with its parallelization capabilities, facilitates efficient\npreselection of data points. Additionally, the competitive performance of\nMinMax in terms of visual representativeness also makes it an effective\nreduction method. Experiments show that MinMaxLTTB outperforms LTTB by more\nthan an order of magnitude in terms of computation time. Furthermore,\npreselecting a small multiple of the desired output size already provides\nsimilar visual representativeness compared to LTTB. In summary, MinMaxLTTB\nleverages the computational efficiency of MinMax to scale LTTB, without\ncompromising on LTTB's favored visualization properties.

However, the inherent complexity of ecological systems\nmakes simple models subject to modeling bias due to simplifying assumptions or\nunaccounted factors, limiting their predictive power for complex ecological\ncommunities. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) have surged\nrecently as a machine-learning algorithm that preserves the dynamic nature of\nthe data. NODEs consist of dynamical models where populations are modeled using\na neural network instead of a parametric function. This preservation of the\ndata dynamics is an advantage for modeling ecological time series in comparison\nto other state-of-the-art methods. However, the question of how NODEs perform\nas a forecasting tool of ecological communities is still unanswered. Here we\nexplore this question using simulated time series of population densities of\nmultiple competing species in a time-varying environment. We explore the\nperformance of NODEs by fitting them using time series of different community\nsizes and different training data sizes. We find that NODEs provide less\nuncertain forecasts than the standard ARIMA models. In addition, we find that\ncombining NODEs with parametric models can recover the final community size of\nour simulated time series better than ARIMA or NODE models. We also discuss\nways to improve the forecasting performance of NODEs.

Visual Odometry (VO) is a practical substitute for\nunreliable GPS and compass sensors, especially in indoor environments. While\nSLAM-based methods show a solid performance without large data requirements,\nthey are less flexible and robust w.r.t. to noise and changes in the sensor\nsuite compared to learning-based approaches. Recent deep VO models, however,\nlimit themselves to a fixed set of input modalities, e.g., RGB and depth, while\ntraining on millions of samples. When sensors fail, sensor suites change, or\nmodalities are intentionally looped out due to available resources, e.g., power\nconsumption, the models fail catastrophically. Furthermore, training these\nmodels from scratch is even more expensive without simulator access or suitable\nexisting models that can be fine-tuned. While such scenarios get mostly ignored\nin simulation, they commonly hinder a model's reusability in real-world\napplications. We propose a Transformer-based modality-invariant VO approach\nthat can deal with diverse or changing sensor suites of navigation agents. Our\nmodel outperforms previous methods while training on only a fraction of the\ndata.

This stands in contrast to the classical case, where efficient\ncomputationally-secure schemes have been long known for all access structures\nin $\\mathsf{monotone~P}$, and one can even obtain shares which are much shorter\nthan the secret which is impossible with perfect security.\n  In this work, we initiate the study of computationally-secure QSS and show\nthat computational assumptions help significantly in building QSS schemes.

Unfortunately, blockchain-based Metaverse faces serious challenges\nsuch as massive resource demands, scalability, and security concerns. To\naddress these issues, this paper proposes a novel sharding-based blockchain\nframework, namely MetaShard, for Metaverse applications. Particularly, we first\ndevelop an effective consensus mechanism, namely Proof-of-Engagement, that can\nincentivize MUs' data and computing resource contribution. Moreover, to improve\nthe scalability of MetaShard, we propose an innovative sharding management\nscheme to maximize the network's throughput while protecting the shards from\n51% attacks. Since the optimization problem is NP-complete, we develop a hybrid\napproach that decomposes the problem (using the binary search method) into\nsub-problems that can be solved effectively by the Lagrangian method. As a\nresult, the proposed approach can obtain solutions in polynomial time, thereby\nenabling flexible shard reconfiguration and reducing the risk of corruption\nfrom the adversary. Extensive numerical experiments show that, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art commercial solvers, our proposed approach can achieve up to\n66.6% higher throughput in less than 1/30 running time.

The computational effort for the excitation energy calculation,\ntherefore, scales linearly with system size and is negligible compared with the\nground-state calculation of the (N-2)-electron system, where N is the electron\nnumber of the molecule.

In this paper, we consider an OPF\nproblem based on the LinDistFlow model for a single-phase radial power network.\nWe derive closed-form solutions to the marginal values of both real and\nreactive power demands. We also derive upper bounds on the congestion price\n(a.k.a. `shadow price'), which denotes the change in marginal demand prices\nwhen the apparent power flow limits of certain lines are binding at optimum.\nVarious cases of our result are discussed while simulations are carried out on\na $141$-bus radial power network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2023 05:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

In\nan experiment, continuous motion of the droplet is achieved when it is located\nover an active electrode with a horizontal ground wire placed just above in an\nopen EWOD configuration. Using a CCD camera, the instantaneous centroid\nposition of the droplet is determined and its velocity is inferred by numerical\ndifferentiation. The edge-detected image is also used to determine the\nadvancing and receding contact angles of the moving drop relative to the\nsubstrate. Motion of 2, 6, and 10 microliter water droplets for voltages in the\nrange of 170-270 VDC is examined to investigate the effect of drop volume and\nvoltage on drop deformation and velocity. Simulations have been carried out\nusing COMSOL Multiphysics with full coupling between the electric field and\nhydrodynamics. The motion of the droplet is initiated by Young-Lippmann\nspreading at the three-phase contact line, followed by a nonuniform electric\nforce field distributed between the active electrode and the ground wire\nlocalized at the droplet-air interface. The solver evaluates the Maxwell's\nstress tensor and introduces it as a volumetric electrostatic force in the\nNavier-Stokes equations. The fully coupled numerical solution shows a good\nmatch with experimentally determined drop movement over a silicone oil-coated\nPDMS layer for which contact line friction is absent. A contact angle model\nwith friction leads to close agreement between simulations and drop motion over\na bare PDMS layer. Over both surfaces, continuous motion of the water droplet\nis seen to be achieved in three stages, namely, initial spreading,\nacceleration, and attainment of constant speed. Numerical modeling that\nincludes electric field-fluid flow coupling is shown to yield data in\nconformity with experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2023 07:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Compared\nwith traditional RIS-aided MEC, STAR-RIS extends the service coverage from\nhalf-space to full-space and provides new flexibility for improving the\ncomputation rate for end users. However, the STAR-RIS-aided MEC system design\nis a challenging problem due to the non-smooth and non-convex binary amplitude\ncoefficients with coupled phase shifters. To fill this gap, this paper\nformulates a computation rate maximization problem via the joint design of the\nSTAR-RIS phase shifts, reflection and transmission amplitude coefficients, the\nreceive beamforming vectors, and energy partition strategies for local\ncomputing and offloading. To tackle the discontinuity caused by binary\nvariables, we propose an efficient smoothing-based method to decrease\nconvergence error, in contrast to the conventional penalty-based method, which\nbrings many undesired stationary points and local optima. Furthermore, a fast\niterative algorithm is proposed to obtain a stationary point for the joint\noptimization problem, with each subproblem solved by a low-complexity\nalgorithm, making the proposed design scalable to a massive number of users and\nSTAR-RIS elements. Simulation results validate the strength of the proposed\nsmoothing-based method and show that the proposed fast iterative algorithm\nachieves a higher computation rate than the conventional method while saving\nthe computation time by at least an order of magnitude. Moreover, the resultant\nSTAR-RIS-aided MEC system significantly improves the computation rate compared\nto other baseline schemes with conventional reflect-only/transmit-only RIS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2023 09:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

To lift such a restriction and permit FFT on\nirregular geometries as well as topology changes, we introduce domain agnostic\nFourier neural operator (DAFNO), a novel neural operator architecture for\nlearning surrogates with irregular geometries and evolving domains. The key\nidea is to incorporate a smoothed characteristic function in the integral layer\narchitecture of FNOs, and leverage FFT to achieve rapid computations, in such a\nway that the geometric information is explicitly encoded in the architecture.\nIn our empirical evaluation, DAFNO has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy as\ncompared to baseline neural operator models on two benchmark datasets of\nmaterial modeling and airfoil simulation.

The\nmicrostructure of the samples was studied by means of Scanning Electron\nMicroscopy, Electron Backscatter Diffraction, and Transmission Electron\nMicroscopy. The aging treatment leads to the formation of an ordered\nface-centered cubic L12 phase named k-carbide.

During this process, the strength\nand hardness of the steel increase while maintaining a relatively high\nelongation. The best combination of high strength and ductility was achieved at\nthe aging condition of 8 h at 550 degrees Celsius with an ultimate tensile\nstrength up to 1157 MPa and total elongation of 51%.

In this paper, the three most prominent classical\nevolutionary strategies Lamarckian, Darwinian, and Baldwinian are implemented\nand compared in an agent-based simulation. The dynamics of optimization and\nlearning are studied in constant as well as in dynamic environments, both as\nsingle evolutionary strategy populations and as mixed evolutionary strategy\npopulations. The three different agent types are implemented as simple objects\nthat need to gather resources to replicate. The agent fitness is defined\nthrough a bitstring match between the agent and the environment and to\nreplicate each agent needs to gather sufficient resources. To make a fair\ncomparison between the three different evolutionary methods, we can assume that\nboth the ability to learn within an individual's lifetime and the learning\nprocess itself require additional resources compared to an evolutionary process\nwithout lifetime learning. When all three strategies coexist and we vary the\nreplication costs for the different strategies we find the following general\npattern: The evolutionary advantage decreases for Lamarckian and Baldwinian\nstrategies as their learning costs increase and/or as their relative\nreplication costs increase compared to the Darwinian strategies, and in most\nsituations the Baldwinian strategy performs in between the Darwinian and\nLamarckian strategies.

This model is\ndeveloped within the framework of the 1D CNN and U-Net, incorporating a network\nencoder derived from our previous work, known as WADNet. Two subtasks with\nrespect to the segmentation of trajectories are addressed in this work,\nfocusing on those with varying diffusion exponents and dynamics models,\nrespectively.
