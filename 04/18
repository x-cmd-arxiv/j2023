The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) observed around\n450,000 eclipsing binaries (EBs) towards the Galactic Bulge. Decade-long\nphotometric observations such as these provide an exceptional opportunity to\nthoroughly examine the targets. However, observing dense stellar fields such as\nthe Bulge may result in blends and contamination by close objects.\n  Aims. We searched for periodic variations in the residual light curves of EBs\nin OGLE-IV and created a new catalogue for the EBs that contain `background'\nsignals after the investigation of the source of the signal.\n  Methods. From the about half a million EB systems, we selected those that\ncontain more than 4000 data points. We fitted the EB signal with a simple model\nand subtracted it. To identify periodical signals in the residuals, we used a\nGPU-based phase dispersion minimisation python algorithm called cuvarbase and\nvalidated the found periods with Lomb-Scargle periodograms. We tested the\nreliability of our method with artificial light curves.\n  Results. We identified 354 systems where short-period background variation\nwas significant. In these cases, we determined whether it is a new variable or\njust the result of contamination by an already catalogued nearby one. We\nclassified 292 newly found variables into EB, $\\delta$ Scuti, or RR Lyrae\ncategories, or their sub-classes, and collected them in a catalogue. We also\ndiscovered four new doubly eclipsing systems and one eclipsing multiple system\nwith a $\\delta$ Scuti variable, and modelled the outer orbits of the\ncomponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 16:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

The original quantum algorithm is based on continuous time\nquantum walks (CTQW), and it has never been clear whether there are efficient\nalgorithms based on discrete time quantum walks (DTQW) until recently the\nmultidimensional quantum walk framework was proposed (Jeffery and Zur,\nSTOC'2023). In this paper, we propose a rather concise algorithm based purely\non the simplest coined quantum walks, which is simply to iterate the naturally\ndefined coined quantum walk operator for a predetermined time $T \\in O(n \\log\nn)$ and then measure to obtain the exit name with $\\Omega(\\frac{1}{n})$\nprobability. The algorithm can be further promoted to be error-free and with\n$O(n^{1.5} \\log n)$ query complexity. The numerical simulation strongly implies\nthat the actual complexity of our algorithm is $O(n^{4/3})$.\n  The significance of our results may be seen as follows. (i) Our algorithm is\nrather concise compared with the one in (Jeffery and Zur, STOC'2023), which not\nonly changes the stereotype that the exiting DTQW frameworks before the\nmultidimensional one can achieve at most a quadratic speedup over the best\nclassical algorithm, but also re-displays the power of the simplest framework\nof quantum walks. (ii) Our algorithm can be made error-free theoretically,\nwhereas all the existing methods cannot. Thus, it is one of the few examples of\nan exponential separation between the error-free (exact) quantum and the\nrandomized query complexities, which perhaps also change people's idea that\nquantum mechanics is inherently probabilistic and thus deterministic quantum\nalgorithms with exponential speedups for the problem are out of the question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 16:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

By JIT-VD, the\ncommits' authors, who understand the commits properly, can review these\ndangerous commits and fix them if necessary while the relevant modifications\nare still fresh in their minds. In this paper, we propose CodeJIT, a novel\ncode-centric learning-based approach for just-in-time vulnerability detection.\nThe key idea of CodeJIT is that the meaning of the code changes of a commit is\nthe direct and deciding factor for determining if the commit is dangerous for\nthe code. Based on that idea, we design a novel graph-based representation to\nrepresent the semantics of code changes in terms of both code structures and\nprogram dependencies.

In this paper, we challenge this assumption and\nintroduce a backdoor attack that completely resides within a common hardware\naccelerator for machine learning. Outside of the accelerator, neither the\nlearning model nor the software is manipulated, so that current defenses fail.\nTo make this attack practical, we overcome two challenges: First, as memory on\na hardware accelerator is severely limited, we introduce the concept of a\nminimal backdoor that deviates as little as possible from the original model\nand is activated by replacing a few model parameters only. Second, we develop a\nconfigurable hardware trojan that can be provisioned with the backdoor and\nperforms a replacement only when the specific target model is processed. We\ndemonstrate the practical feasibility of our attack by implanting our hardware\ntrojan into the Xilinx Vitis AI DPU, a commercial machine-learning accelerator.\nWe configure the trojan with a minimal backdoor for a traffic-sign recognition\nsystem. The backdoor replaces only 30 (0.069%) model parameters, yet it\nreliably manipulates the recognition once the input contains a backdoor\ntrigger. Our attack expands the hardware circuit of the accelerator by 0.24%\nand induces no run-time overhead, rendering a detection hardly possible. Given\nthe complex and highly distributed manufacturing process of current hardware,\nour work points to a new threat in machine learning that is inaccessible to\ncurrent security mechanisms and calls for hardware to be manufactured only in\nfully trusted environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 16:24:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 07:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

The AE stability of CFETR plasmas improves if the ITB\nis located inwards, case A, showing AEs with lower growth rates with respect to\nthe case B. The AEs growth rate is smaller in the case A because the modes are\nlocated in the inner-middle plasma region where the stabilizing effect of the\nmagnetic shear is stronger with respect to the case B.

We present a first ever look at M94's\nstellar halo, which we expect to contain a fossil record of M94's past mergers.\nUsing Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam, we resolve and identify red giant branch\n(RGB) stars in M94's halo, finding two distinct populations.

However, writing\nnumerous impressions can be laborious and error-prone for radiologists.\nAlthough recent studies have achieved promising results in automatic impression\ngeneration using large-scale medical text data for pre-training and fine-tuning\npre-trained language models, such models often require substantial amounts of\nmedical text data and have poor generalization performance. While large\nlanguage models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown strong generalization\ncapabilities and performance, their performance in specific domains, such as\nradiology, remains under-investigated and potentially limited. To address this\nlimitation, we propose ImpressionGPT, which leverages the in-context learning\ncapability of LLMs by constructing dynamic contexts using domain-specific,\nindividualized data. This dynamic prompt approach enables the model to learn\ncontextual knowledge from semantically similar examples from existing data.\nAdditionally, we design an iterative optimization algorithm that performs\nautomatic evaluation on the generated impression results and composes the\ncorresponding instruction prompts to further optimize the model. The proposed\nImpressionGPT model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both MIMIC-CXR and\nOpenI datasets without requiring additional training data or fine-tuning the\nLLMs. This work presents a paradigm for localizing LLMs that can be applied in\na wide range of similar application scenarios, bridging the gap between\ngeneral-purpose LLMs and the specific language processing needs of various\ndomains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 17:13:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 08:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

It could couple feebly\nor with the same strength as the visible sector which would result in either a\ncold or a hot hidden sector at the end of reheating. These two possibilities\ncould lead to significantly different outcomes for observables. We investigate\nthe thermal evolution of the two sectors in a cosmologically consistent hidden\nsector dark matter model where the hidden sector and the visible sector are\nthermally coupled and their thermal evolution occurs without the assumption of\nseparate entropy conservation for each sector. Within this framework we analyze\nseveral phenomena to illustrate their dependence on the initial conditions.\nThese include the allowed parameter space of models, dark matter relic density,\nproton-dark matter cross section, effective massless neutrino species at BBN\ntime, self-interacting dark matter cross-section, where self-interaction occurs\nvia exchange of dark photon, and Sommerfeld enhancement.

A celebrated example is the quantum\nanomalous Hall (QAH) state, which exhibits an integer quantum Hall effect at\nzero magnetic field thanks to its intrinsic ferromagnetism. In the presence of\nstrong electron-electron interactions, exotic fractional-QAH (FQAH) states at\nzero magnetic field can emerge. These states could host fractional excitations,\nincluding non-Abelian anyons - crucial building blocks for topological quantum\ncomputation. Flat Chern bands are widely considered as a desirable venue to\nrealize the FQAH state.

Moreover, the v=-1 state exhibits a dispersion\ncorresponding to Chern number -1, consistent with the predicted QAH state. In\ncomparison, several non-ferromagnetic states on the electron doping side do not\ndisperse, i.e., are trivial correlated insulators.

Unlike existing VQ-based methods that operate in the discrete\nspace, continuous VQ-diffuser directly outputs the continuous pose embeddings\nfor better motion modeling. Finally, motion-aware masking strategy is designed\nto mask the pose embeddings spatial-temporally to enhance the temporal\ncoherence. Moreover, to facilitate the task of text-driven human video\ngeneration, we contribute a Fashion-Text2Video dataset with manually annotated\naction labels and text descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nText2Performer generates high-quality human videos (up to 512x256 resolution)\nwith diverse appearances and flexible motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 17:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

We divide galaxies with a detected H$\\alpha$ emission\nline and coverage of H$\\beta$ into eight groups by stellar mass, star formation\nrate (SFR), and inclination (i.e., axis ratio), then stack their spectra. From\neach stack, we measure Balmer decrement and gas-phase metallicity, then we\ncompute median \\AV and UV continuum spectral slope ($\\beta$). First, we find\nthat none of the dust properties (Balmer decrement, \\AV, $\\beta$) vary with\naxis ratio. Second, both stellar and nebular attenuation increase with\nincreasing galaxy mass, showing little residual dependence on SFR or\nmetallicity. Third, nebular emission is more attenuated than stellar emission,\nand this difference grows even larger at higher galaxy masses and SFRs. Based\non these results, we propose a three-component dust model where attenuation\npredominantly occurs in star-forming regions and large, dusty star-forming\nclumps, with minimal attenuation in the diffuse ISM. In this model, nebular\nattenuation primarily originates in clumps, while stellar attenuation is\ndominated by star-forming regions. Clumps become larger and more common with\nincreasing galaxy mass, creating the above mass trends. Finally, we argue that\na fixed metal yield naturally leads to mass regulating dust attenuation.

Our method does not need to know the human's task (i.e., what the\nhuman is using these signals for). Instead, our insight is that interpretable\ninterfaces should select signals that maximize correlation between the human's\nactions and the information the interface is trying to convey. Applying this\ninsight we develop LIMIT: Learning Interfaces to Maximize Information Transfer.\nLIMIT optimizes a tractable, real-time proxy of information gain in continuous\nspaces.

Subgraph classification has applications such as predicting the cellular\nfunction of a group of proteins or identifying rare diseases given a collection\nof phenotypes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the de facto solution for node,\nlink, and graph-level tasks but fail to perform well on subgraph classification\ntasks. Even GNNs tailored for graph classification are not directly\ntransferable to subgraph classification as they ignore the external topology of\nthe subgraph, thus failing to capture how the subgraph is located within the\nlarger graph. The current state-of-the-art models for subgraph classification\naddress this shortcoming through either labeling tricks or multiple\nmessage-passing channels, both of which impose a computation burden and are not\nscalable to large graphs. To address the scalability issue while maintaining\ngeneralization, we propose Stochastic Subgraph Neighborhood Pooling (SSNP),\nwhich jointly aggregates the subgraph and its neighborhood (i.e., external\ntopology) information without any computationally expensive operations such as\nlabeling tricks. To improve scalability and generalization further, we also\npropose a simple data augmentation pre-processing step for SSNP that creates\nmultiple sparse views of the subgraph neighborhood. We show that our model is\nmore expressive than GNNs without labeling tricks.

The primary goal of a GNN is to\nlearn an embedding for each graph node in a dataset that encodes both the node\nfeatures and the local graph structure around the node. Embeddings generated by\na GNN for a graph node are unique to that GNN. Prior work has shown that GNNs\nare prone to model extraction attacks. Model extraction attacks and defenses\nhave been explored extensively in other non-graph settings. While detecting or\npreventing model extraction appears to be difficult, deterring them via\neffective ownership verification techniques offer a potential defense. In\nnon-graph settings, fingerprinting models, or the data used to build them, have\nshown to be a promising approach toward ownership verification. We present\nGrOVe, a state-of-the-art GNN model fingerprinting scheme that, given a target\nmodel and a suspect model, can reliably determine if the suspect model was\ntrained independently of the target model or if it is a surrogate of the target\nmodel obtained via model extraction. We show that GrOVe can distinguish between\nsurrogate and independent models even when the independent model uses the same\ntraining dataset and architecture as the original target model. Using six\nbenchmark datasets and three model architectures, we show that consistently\nachieves low false-positive and false-negative rates. We demonstrate that is\nrobust against known fingerprint evasion techniques while remaining\ncomputationally efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 19:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

To combat this, OSPs have implemented\nvarious policies, such as tagging, to notify users about potentially misleading\ninformation. However, these policies are often transparent and therefore\nsusceptible to being exploited by content creators, who may not be willing to\ninvest effort into producing authentic content, causing the viral spread of\nmisinformation. Instead of mitigating the reach of existing misinformation,\nthis work focuses on a solution of prevention, aiming to stop the spread of\nmisinformation before it has a chance to gain momentum. We propose a Bayesian\npersuaded branching process ($\\operatorname{BP}^2$) to model the strategic\ninteractions among the OSP, the content creator, and the user. The\nmisinformation spread on OSP is modeled by a multi-type branching process,\nwhere users' positive and negative comments influence the misinformation\nspreading. Using a Lagrangian induced by Bayesian plausibility, we characterize\nthe OSP's optimal policy under the perfect Bayesian equilibrium. The convexity\nof the Lagrangian implies that the OSP's optimal policy is simply the fully\ninformative tagging policy: revealing the content's accuracy to the user. Such\na tagging policy solicits the best effort from the content creator in reducing\nmisinformation, even though the OSP exerts no direct control over the content\ncreator.

When forecasting blood glucose, for example,\nintrinsic effects can be inferred from the history of the target signal alone\n(\\textit{i.e.} blood glucose), but accurately modeling the impact of extrinsic\neffects requires auxiliary signals, like the amount of carbohydrates ingested.\nStandard forecasting techniques often assume that extrinsic and intrinsic\neffects vary at similar rates. However, when auxiliary signals are generated at\na much lower frequency than the target variable (e.g., blood glucose\nmeasurements are made every 5 minutes, while meals occur once every few hours),\neven well-known extrinsic effects (e.g., carbohydrates increase blood glucose)\nmay prove difficult to learn. To better utilize these \\textit{sparse but\ninformative variables} (SIVs), we introduce a novel encoder/decoder forecasting\napproach that accurately learns the per-timepoint effect of the SIV, by (i)\nisolating it from intrinsic effects and (ii) restricting its learned effect\nbased on domain knowledge.

Multi-task learning (MTL) represents an\neffective approach where multiple tasks share an encoder to extract\nrepresentative features from the input frame, followed by task-specific\ndecoders to generate predictions for each task. Generally, the shared encoder\nin MTL models needs to have a large representational capacity in order to\ngeneralize well to various tasks and input data, which has a negative effect on\nthe inference latency. In this paper, we argue that due to the large variations\nin the complexity of the input frames, some computations might be unnecessary\nfor the output. Therefore, we introduce AdaMTL, an adaptive framework that\nlearns task-aware inference policies for the MTL models in an input-dependent\nmanner. Specifically, we attach a task-aware lightweight policy network to the\nshared encoder and co-train it alongside the MTL model to recognize unnecessary\ncomputations. During runtime, our task-aware policy network decides which parts\nof the model to activate depending on the input frame and the target\ncomputational complexity. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL dataset\ndemonstrate that AdaMTL reduces the computational complexity by 43% while\nimproving the accuracy by 1.32% compared to single-task models. Combined with\nSOTA MTL methodologies, AdaMTL boosts the accuracy by 7.8% while improving the\nefficiency by 3.1X.

However, different shards' independent and random scheduling for\ncross-shard transactions results in numerous conflicts and aborts, since\ncross-shard transactions from different shards may access the same account. A\ndeterministic ordering can eliminate conflicts by determining a global order\nfor transactions before processing, as proved in the database field.\nUnfortunately, due to the intertwining of the Byzantine environment and\ninformation isolation among shards, there is no trusted party able to\npredetermine such an order for cross-shard transactions. To tackle this\nchallenge, this paper proposes Prophet, a conflict-free sharding blockchain\nbased on Byzantine-tolerant deterministic ordering. It first depends on\nuntrusted self-organizing coalitions of nodes from different shards to\npre-execute cross-shard transactions for prerequisite information about\nordering. It then determines a trusted global order based on stateless ordering\nand post-verification for pre-executed results, through shard cooperation.\nFollowing the order, the shards thus orderly execute and commit transactions\nwithout conflicts. Prophet orchestrates the pre-execution, ordering, and\nexecution processes in the sharding consensus for minimal overhead. We\nrigorously prove the determinism and serializability of transactions under the\nByzantine and sharded environment.

Thus, developing autonomous\nvehicles necessitates the ability to mimic such knowledge and model\ninteractions between road users to understand and navigate unpredictable,\ndynamic environments. However, since real-world scenarios often differ from\ntraining datasets, effectively modeling the behavior of various road users in\nan environment remains a significant research challenge. This reality\nnecessitates models that generalize to a broad range of domains and explicitly\nmodel interactions between road users and the environment to improve scenario\nunderstanding. Graph learning methods address this problem by modeling\ninteractions using graph representations of scenarios. However, existing\nmethods cannot effectively transfer knowledge gained from the training domain\nto real-world scenarios. This constraint is caused by the domain-specific rules\nused for graph extraction that can vary in effectiveness across domains,\nlimiting generalization ability.

In a moderately-inclined disk galaxy, the\nfraction of reddened stars is expected to be 50% everywhere, assuming that dust\nlies in a thin midplane. In a thickened disk, however, a wide range of radii\nproject onto the line of sight. Assuming stellar density declines with radius,\nthis geometrical projection leads to differences in the numbers of stars on the\nnear and far sides of the thin dust layer. The fraction of reddened stars will\nthus differ from the 50% prediction, with a deviation that becomes larger for\npuffier disks. We map the fraction of reddened red giant branch (RGB) stars\nacross M31, which shows prominent dust lanes on only one side of the major\naxis. The fraction of reddened stars varies systematically from 20% to 80%,\nwhich requires that these stars have an exponential scale height h_z that is\n0.14+/-0.015 times the exponential scale length (h_r~5.5kpc). M31's RGB stars\nmust therefore have h_z=770+/-80pc, which is far thicker than the Milky Way's\nthin disk, but comparable to its thick disk. The lack of a significant thin\ndisk in M31 is unexpected, but consistent with its interaction history and high\ndisk velocity dispersion.

The size of the maximal clique\n(clique number) of a graph is a classic NP-complete problem; a Paley graph is a\ndeterministic graph where two vertices are connected if their difference is a\nquadratic residue modulo certain prime powers. Improving the upper bound for\nthe Paley graph clique number for odd prime powers is an open problem in\ncombinatorics. Moreover, since quadratic residues exhibit pseudorandom\nproperties, Paley graphs are related to the construction of deterministic\nrestricted isometries, an open problem in compressed sensing and sparse\nrecovery. Recent work provides evidence that the current upper bounds can be\nimproved by the sum-of-squares (SOS) relaxations. In particular the bounds\ngiven by the SOS relaxations of degree 4 (SOS-4) are asymptotically growing at\nan order smaller than square root of the prime. However computations of SOS-4\nbecome intractable with respect to large graphs. Gvozdenovic et al. introduced\na more computationally efficient block-diagonal hierarchy of SDPs that refines\nthe SOS hierarchy.

We argue that for proper description of the pseudogap one\nneeds to sum up infinite series of diagrams for both the fermionic self-energy\nand the SDW order parameter in the SDW state or the magnetic correlation length\nin the paramagnetic state. We use eikonal approach to sum up an infinite series\nof diagrammatic contributions from thermal fluctuations. Earlier studies found\nthat in the SDW state, the spectral function $A_{\\bf k} (\\omega)$ of a hot\nfermion at a finite $T$ is exponentially small below the energy scale $\\Delta\n(T)$, which scales with SDW order and vanishes at the ordering temperature\n$T_N$, and has a hump at a larger frequency $\\Delta_{\\rm pg}$, comparable to\nthe zero-temperature SDW gap $\\Delta (T=0)$.

Given two ordered, edge-labeled trees $T_1$ and\n$T_2$, the edit distance between $T_1$ and $T_2$ is defined as the minimum\ntotal cost of operations that transform $T_1$ into $T_2$. In one operation, we\ncan contract an edge, split a vertex into two or change the label of an edge.\nFor the weighted version of the problem, where the cost of each operation\ndepends on the type of the operation and the label on the edge involved,\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ time algorithms are known for both rooted and unrooted\ntrees. The existence of a truly subcubic $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3-\\epsilon})$ time\nalgorithm is unlikely, as it would imply a truly subcubic algorithm for the\nAPSP problem. However, recently Mao (FOCS'21) showed that if we assume that\neach operation has a unit cost, then the tree edit distance between two rooted\ntrees can be computed in truly subcubic time. In this paper, we show how to\nadapt Mao's algorithm to make it work for unrooted trees and we show an\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{(7\\omega + 15)/(2\\omega + 6)}) \\leq\n\\mathcal{O}(n^{2.9417})$ time algorithm for the unweighted tree edit distance\nbetween two unrooted trees, where $\\omega \\leq 2.373$ is the matrix\nmultiplication exponent.

The identification of\nsuch dense-packings is a considerable challenge, and we solve it for $D^2=2, 3,\n4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$ as well as for $D^2=2\\ell^2$, where\n$\\ell\\in\\mathbb{N}$. For the former family of values of $D^2$ our proofs are\nself-contained. For $D^2=2\\ell^2$ our results are based on the proof of\nKepler's conjecture. Depending on the value of $D^2$, we encounter three\nphysically distinct situations: (i) finitely many periodic ground states, (ii)\ncountably many layered periodic ground states and (iii) countably many not\nnecessarily layered periodic ground states. For the first two cases we use the\nPirogov-Sinai theory and identify the corresponding periodic Gibbs\ndistributions for $D^2=2,3,5,8,9,10,12$ and $D^2=2\\ell^2$, $\\ell\\in\\mathbb{N}$,\nin a high-density regime $u>u_*(D^2)$, where the system is ordered and tends to\nfluctuate around some ground states. In particular, for $D^2=5$ only a finite\nnumber out of countably many layered periodic ground states generate pure\nphases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 22:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Under the `pay-as-you-go' billing\nmodel, the server rental cost is proportional to the total time that servers\nare actively running jobs. The problem of efficiently allocating a sequence of\nonline jobs to servers without exceeding the resource capacity of any server\nwhile minimizing total server usage time can be modelled as a variant of the\ndynamic bin packing problem (DBP), called MinUsageTime DBP.\n  In this work, we initiate the study of the problem with multi-dimensional\nresource demands (e.g. CPU/GPU usage, memory requirement, bandwidth usage,\netc.), called MinUsageTime Dynamic Vector Bin Packing (DVBP). We study the\ncompetitive ratio (CR) of Any Fit packing algorithms for this problem. We show\nalmost-tight bounds on the CR of three specific Any Fit packing algorithms,\nnamely First Fit, Next Fit, and Move To Front. We prove that the CR of Move To\nFront is at most $(2\\mu+1)d +1$, where $\\mu$ is the ratio of the max/min item\ndurations. For $d=1$, this significantly improves the previously known upper\nbound of $6\\mu+7$ (Kamali & Lopez-Ortiz, 2015).

The unprecedented\nstreamwise length - until $x/D \\approx 120$ - of the simulation enables\ninvestigation of the near and far wake. The near wake is dominated by the\nvortex shedding (VS) mode residing at azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$ and Strouhal\nnumber $\\textit{St} = 0.135$. After filtering out the VS structure, conclusive\nevidence of large-scale streaks with frequency $\\textit{St} \\rightarrow 0$,\nequivalently streamwise wavenumber $k_x \\rightarrow 0$ in the wake, becomes\napparent in visualizations and spectra.

Conditionally\naveraged streamwise vorticity fields reveal that the lift-up mechanism is\nactive in the near as well as the far wake, and that ejections contribute more\nthan sweep to events of intense $-u'_xu'_r$. Spectral proper orthogonal\ndecomposition (SPOD) is employed to extract the energy and the spatiotemporal\nfeatures of the large-scale streaks.

Optimistic visions of 'what artificial\nintelligence (AI) can do' places demands on WoZ platforms to simulate smarter\nsystems and more complex interactions. This raises the question of whether the\ntypical approach of employing a single Wizard is sufficient. Moreover, while\nexisting work has employed multiple Wizards in WoZ studies, a multi-Wizard\napproach has not been systematically studied in terms of feasibility,\neffectiveness, and challenges. We offer Wizundry, a real-time, web-based WoZ\nplatform that allows multiple Wizards to collaboratively operate a\nspeech-to-text based system remotely. We outline the design and technical\nspecifications of our open-source platform, which we iterated over two design\nphases.

However, With the new\nhealthcare paradigm shifting from hospital care to home care, there is a gap in\nrobotic systems that can provide care at home. This paper introduces Mobile\nRobotic Balance Assistant (MRBA), a compact and cost-effective balance\nassistive robot that can provide both rehabilitation training and activities of\ndaily living (ADLs) assistance at home. A three degrees of freedom (3-DoF)\nrobotic arm was designed to mimic the therapist arm function to provide balance\nassistance to the user. To minimize the interference to users' natural pelvis\nmovements and gait patterns, the robot must have a Human-Robot Interface(HRI)\nthat can detect user intention accurately and follow the user's movement\nsmoothly and timely. Thus, a graceful user following control rule was proposed.\nThe overall control architecture consists of two parts: an observer for human\ninputs estimation and an LQR-based controller with disturbance rejection.

However, previous studies on\nPBFT and RAFT rarely consider the channel performance of the physical layer,\nsuch as path loss and channel fading, resulting in research results that are\nfar from real networks. Additionally, 6G communications will widely deploy\nhigh-frequency signals such as terahertz (THz) and millimeter wave (mmWave),\nwhile performances of PBFT and RAFT are still unknown when these signals are\ntransmitted in wireless PBFT or RAFT networks. Therefore, it is urgent to study\nthe performance of non-ideal wireless PBFT and RAFT networks with THz and\nmmWave signals, to better make PBFT and RAFT play a role in the 6G era. In this\npaper, we study and compare the performance of THz and mmWave signals in\nnon-ideal wireless PBFT and RAFT networks, considering Rayleigh Fading (RF) and\nclose-in Free Space (FS) reference distance path loss.

Changes in halo concentration therefore impact the SZ signal, with\nimplications for cosmological and other analyses of SZ-selected clusters. We\ninvestigate the concentration-SZ relation in theory and simulations. We find\nthat the impact of concentration on the inner SZ profile ($R \\lesssim 0.75\nR_{200c}$) can be captured with standard polytropic gas models. However, we\nfind that such models do a poor job of reproducing the outer SZ profiles ($R\n\\gtrsim 0.75 R_{200c}$) and the relation between the integrated SZ signal, $Y$,\nand concentration. This disagreement results from a sharp truncation of the gas\npressure profile near the splashback radius, likely caused by virial shocks. We\ndevelop a simple description of the truncation that leads to a good match with\nsimulated SZ profiles out to several $R_{200c}$ for clusters of varying mass\nand concentration, and that also accurately predicts the concentration-$Y$\nrelationship.

It is very interesting to study if these new Abelian-like\nmonopoles are responsible for color confinement in the continuum $SU(3)$ QCD,\nsince any reliable candidate of color magnetic monopoles is not known yet. If\nthese new Abelian-like monopoles exist in the continuum limit, the Abelian dual\nMeissner effect occurs, so that the linear part of the static potential between\na quark-antiquark pair is reproduced fully by those of Abelian and monopole\nstatic potentials.

It is shown that the perfect Abelian dominance is\nreproduced fairly well, whereas the perfect monopole dominance seems to be\nrealized for large $\\beta$ when use is made of the smooth lattice\nconfigurations in the maximally Abelian (MA) gauge.

To explore how\nto use the masked language model in adversarial detection, we propose a novel\ntextual adversarial example detection method, namely Masked Language\nModel-based Detection (MLMD), which can produce clearly distinguishable signals\nbetween normal examples and adversarial examples by exploring the changes in\nmanifolds induced by the masked language model. MLMD features a plug and play\nusage (i.e., no need to retrain the victim model) for adversarial defense and\nit is agnostic to classification tasks, victim model's architectures, and\nto-be-defended attack methods.

However, this assumption is not always\nvalid, especially when it comes to chatbots utilized in industries like\nbanking, hotel reservations, and airline bookings. This research paper aims to\nfill this gap by exploring the task of Speaker Profiling in Conversations\n(SPC). The primary objective of SPC is to produce a summary of persona\ncharacteristics for each individual speaker present in a dialogue. To\naccomplish this, we have divided the task into three subtasks: persona\ndiscovery, persona-type identification, and persona-value extraction. Given a\ndialogue, the first subtask aims to identify all utterances that contain\npersona information. Subsequently, the second task evaluates these utterances\nto identify the type of persona information they contain, while the third\nsubtask identifies the specific persona values for each identified type. To\naddress the task of SPC, we have curated a new dataset named SPICE, which comes\nwith specific labels.

Therefore, an effective actor relation learning method\nis crucial for the GAR task. The previous works mainly learn the interaction\nrelation by the well-designed GCNs or Transformers. For example, to infer the\nactor interaction relation, GCNs need a learnable adjacency, and Transformers\nneed to calculate the self-attention. Although the above methods can model the\ninteraction relation effectively, they also increase the complexity of the\nmodel (the number of parameters and computations). In this paper, we design a\nnovel MLP-based method for Actor Interaction Relation learning (MLP-AIR) in\nGAR. Compared with GCNs and Transformers, our method has a competitive but\nconceptually and technically simple alternative, significantly reducing the\ncomplexity. Specifically, MLP-AIR includes three sub-modules: MLP-based Spatial\nrelation modeling module (MLP-S), MLP-based Temporal relation modeling module\n(MLP-T), and MLP-based Relation refining module (MLP-R). MLP-S is used to model\nthe spatial relation between different actors in each frame. MLP-T is used to\nmodel the temporal relation between different frames for each actor. MLP-R is\nused further to refine the relation between different dimensions of relation\nfeatures to improve the feature's expression ability. To evaluate the MLP-AIR,\nwe conduct extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, including the\nVolleyball and Collective Activity datasets. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat MLP-AIR can get competitive results but with low complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 08:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Despite their immense capacity and the abundance of multimodal training\ndata, recent work has revealed the strong tendency of video-text models towards\nframe-based spatial representations, while temporal reasoning remains largely\nunsolved. In this work, we identify several key challenges in temporal learning\nof video-text transformers: the spatiotemporal trade-off from limited network\nsize; the curse of dimensionality for multi-frame modeling; and the diminishing\nreturns of semantic information by extending clip length. Guided by these\nfindings, we propose SViTT, a sparse video-text architecture that performs\nmulti-frame reasoning with significantly lower cost than naive transformers\nwith dense attention. Analogous to graph-based networks, SViTT employs two\nforms of sparsity: edge sparsity that limits the query-key communications\nbetween tokens in self-attention, and node sparsity that discards uninformative\nvisual tokens. Trained with a curriculum which increases model sparsity with\nthe clip length, SViTT outperforms dense transformer baselines on multiple\nvideo-text retrieval and question answering benchmarks, with a fraction of\ncomputational cost.

Using the bottom-up tree, we build DILI in\na top-down manner, individualizing the fanouts for internal nodes according to\nlocal distributions. DILI strikes a good balance between the number of leaf\nnodes and the height of the tree, two critical factors of key search time.\nMoreover, we design flexible algorithms for DILI to efficiently insert and\ndelete keys and automatically adjust the tree structure when necessary.\nExtensive experimental results show that DILI outperforms the state-of-the-art\nalternatives on different kinds of workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 08:27:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 11:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

In\naddition, tetrodes require high voltage to operate, which translates to risk of\nflashovers and the necessity to perform conditioning procedures, limiting the\noverall reliability.

Two types of sensor faults are\nconsidered: complete failure and sensor deterioration. The proposed method is\napplicable to general autonomous nonlinear systems without making any\nassumptions about its triangular and/or normal form, which is usually\nconsidered in the observer design literature. The key aspect of our approach is\na learning-based design of the Luenberger observer, which involves using a\nneural network to approximate the injective map that transforms the nonlinear\nsystem into a stable linear system with output injection. This learning-based\nLuenberger observer accurately estimates the system's state, allowing for the\ndetection of sensor faults through residual generation. The residual is\ncomputed as the norm of the difference between the system's measured output and\nthe observer's predicted output vectors. Fault isolation is achieved by\ncomparing each sensor's measurement with its corresponding predicted value. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing and isolating sensor\nfaults while remaining robust in the presence of measurement noise and system\nuncertainty. We validate our method through numerical simulations of sensor\nfaults in a network of Kuramoto oscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 09:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Recently, deep\ngenerative models, particularly diffusion models inspired by classical\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamics, have made significant progress. While diffusion\nmodels have proven to be powerful in solving inverse problems and producing\nhigh-quality reconstructions, applying them directly to the source localization\nis infeasible for two reasons. Firstly, it is impossible to calculate the\nposterior disseminated results on a large-scale network for iterative denoising\nsampling, which would incur enormous computational costs. Secondly, in the\nexisting methods for this field, the training data itself are ill-posed\n(many-to-one); thus simply transferring the diffusion model would only lead to\nlocal optima.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage optimization framework,\nthe source localization denoising diffusion model (SL-Diff). In the coarse\nstage, we devise the source proximity degrees as the supervised signals to\ngenerate coarse-grained source predictions. This aims to efficiently initialize\nthe next stage, significantly reducing its convergence time and calibrating the\nconvergence process.

However, in practice, this\nstationarity is usually not met and the distribution of inputs differs, leading\nto unexpected performance of the learned model in deployment. The issue in\nwhich the training and test data inputs follow different probability\ndistributions while the input-output relationship remains unchanged is referred\nto as covariate shift. In this paper, the performance of conventional machine\nlearning models was experimentally evaluated in the presence of covariate\nshift. Furthermore, a region-based evaluation was performed by decomposing the\ndomain of probability density function of the input data to assess the\nclassifier's performance per domain region. Distributional changes were\nsimulated in a two-dimensional classification problem. Subsequently, a higher\nfour-dimensional experiments were conducted. Based on the experimental\nanalysis, the Random Forests algorithm is the most robust classifier in the\ntwo-dimensional case, showing the lowest degradation rate for accuracy and\nF1-score metrics, with a range between 0.1% and 2.08%. Moreover, the results\nreveal that in higher-dimensional experiments, the performance of the models is\npredominantly influenced by the complexity of the classification function,\nleading to degradation rates exceeding 25% in most cases. It is also concluded\nthat the models exhibit high bias towards the region with high density in the\ninput space domain of the training samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 09:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

The data encountered by SBRS is typically highly sparse, which also\nserves as one of the bottlenecks limiting the accuracy of recommendations. So\nContrastive Learning(CL) is applied in SBRS owing to its capability of\nimproving embedding learning under the condition of sparse data. However,\nexisting CL strategies are limited in their ability to enforce finer-grained\n(e.g., factor-level) comparisons and, as a result, are unable to capture subtle\ndifferences between instances. More than that, these strategies usually use\nitem or segment dropout as a means of data augmentation which may result in\nsparser data and thus ineffective self-supervised signals. By addressing the\ntwo aforementioned limitations, we introduce a novel multi-granularity CL\nframework. Specifically, two extra augmented embedding convolution channels\nwith different granularities are constructed and the embeddings learned by them\nare compared with those learned from original view to complete the CL tasks. At\nfactor-level, we employ Disentangled Representation Learning to obtain\nfiner-grained data(e.g. factor-level embeddings), with which we can construct\nfactor-level convolution channels. At item-level, the star graph is deployed as\nthe augmented data and graph convolution on it can ensure the effectiveness of\nself-supervised signals. Compare the learned embeddings of these two views with\nthe learned embeddings of the basic view to achieve CL at two granularities.\nFinally, the more precise item-level and factor-level embeddings obtained are\nreferenced to generate personalized recommendations for the user. The proposed\nmodel is validated through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets,\nshowcasing superior performance compared to existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 10:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Exciting a significant fraction of magnetic ions requires a very\nintense incoming light beam, as orbital resonances are often weak compared to\nabove-band-gap excitations. In the latter case, a sizeable reduction of the\nmagnetization occurs as the absorbed energy increases the spin temperature,\nmasking the non-thermal optical effects. Here, using ultrafast x-ray\nspectroscopy, we were able to resolve changes in the magnetization state\ninduced by resonant absorption of infrared photons in Co-doped yttrium iron\ngarnet, with negligible thermal effects. We found that the optical excitation\nof the Co ions affects the two distinct magnetic Fe sublattices differently,\nresulting in a transient non-collinear magnetic state.

It\nonly requires the environment-specific constraint functions itself a priori and\nnot a complete model (i.e. plant, disturbance and noise models, and prediction\nmodels for states not included in the plant model - e.g. demand forecasts,\nweather forecasts, price forecasts). The project-specific upfront and ongoing\nengineering efforts are therefore still reduced, better representations of the\nunderlying system dynamics can still be learned and modelling bias is kept to a\nminimum (no model-based objective function). However, even the constraint\nfunctions alone are not always trivial to accurately provide in advance,\nleading to potentially unsafe behaviour. In this paper, we present two novel\nadvancements: (I) combining the Optlayer and SafeFallback method, named\nOptLayerPolicy, to increase the initial utility while keeping a high sample\nefficiency. (II) introducing self-improving hard constraints, to increase the\naccuracy of the constraint functions as more data becomes available so that\nbetter policies can be learned. Both advancements keep the constraint\nformulation decoupled from the RL formulation, so that new (presumably better)\nRL algorithms can act as drop-in replacements. We have shown that, in a\nsimulated multi-energy system case study, the initial utility is increased to\n92.4% (OptLayerPolicy) compared to 86.1% (OptLayer) and that the policy after\ntraining is increased to 104.9% (GreyOptLayerPolicy) compared to 103.4%\n(OptLayer) - all relative to a vanilla RL benchmark. While introducing\nsurrogate functions into the optimization problem requires special attention,\nwe do conclude that the newly presented GreyOptLayerPolicy method is the most\nadvantageous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 10:52:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 11:56:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

Genetic programming (GP) has been\nthe dominator in solving SR problems. However, as the scale of SR problems\nincreases, GP often poorly demonstrates and cannot effectively address the\nreal-world high-dimensional problems. This limitation is mainly caused by the\nstochastic evolutionary nature of traditional GP in constructing the trees. In\nthis paper, we propose a differentiable approach named DGP to construct GP\ntrees towards high-dimensional SR for the first time. Specifically, a new data\nstructure called differentiable symbolic tree is proposed to relax the discrete\nstructure to be continuous, thus a gradient-based optimizer can be presented\nfor the efficient optimization. In addition, a sampling method is proposed to\neliminate the discrepancy caused by the above relaxation for valid symbolic\nexpressions. Furthermore, a diversification mechanism is introduced to promote\nthe optimizer escaping from local optima for globally better solutions. With\nthese designs, the proposed DGP method can efficiently search for the GP trees\nwith higher performance, thus being capable of dealing with high-dimensional\nSR. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DGP, we conducted various experiments\nagainst the state of the arts based on both GP and deep neural networks. The\nexperiment results reveal that DGP can outperform these chosen peer competitors\non high-dimensional regression benchmarks with dimensions varying from tens to\nthousands. In addition, on the synthetic SR problems, the proposed DGP method\ncan also achieve the best recovery rate even with different noisy levels. It is\nbelieved this work can facilitate SR being a powerful alternative to\ninterpretable ML for a broader range of real-world problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 11:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

To\nbetter grasp the subtle effect of active motion on the process of\nvitrification, a number of active mode-coupling theories (MCTs) have recently\nbeen developed. These have proven capable of qualitatively predicting important\nparts of the active glassy phenomenology. However, most efforts so far have\nonly considered single-component materials, and their derivations are arguably\nmore complex than the standard MCT case, which might hinder broader usage. Here\nwe present a detailed derivation of a distinct active MCT for mixtures of\nathermal self-propelled particles that is more transparent than previously\nintroduced versions. The key insight is that we can follow a similar strategy\nfor our overdamped active system as is typically used for passive underdamped\nMCT. Interestingly, when only considering one particle species, our theory\ngives the exact same result as the one obtained in previous work which employed\na highly different mode-coupling strategy. Moreover, we assess the quality of\nthe theory and its novel extension to multi-component materials by using it to\npredict the dynamics of a Kob-Andersen mixture of athermal active Brownian\nquasi-hard spheres. We demonstrate that our theory is able to capture all\nqualitative features, most notably the location of the optimum of the dynamics\nwhen the persistence length and cage length coincide, for each combination of\nparticle types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 12:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

As it is particularly difficult to achieve this enthusiasm\ninitially in young females, prior work has identified gender-specific\ndifferences in the programming behavior of young learners. Since pair\nprogramming, which turns programming into a more sociable activity, has been\nproposed as an approach to support programming education, in this paper we aim\nto investigate whether similar gender-specific characteristics can also be\nobserved during pair programming. Therefore, we designed a gender-neutral\nintroductory SCRATCH programming course tailored for integrating pair\nprogramming principles, and conducted it with a total of 139 students aged\nbetween 8 and 14 years. To identify gender-dependent differences and\nsimilarities, we measure the attitude towards programming and the course\nsetting, observe the behavior of the students while programming, and analyze\nthe code of the programs for different gender-combinations. Overall, our study\ndemonstrates that pair programming is well suited for young learners and\nresults in a positive attitude. While the resulting programs are similar in\nquality and complexity independent of gender, differences are evident when it\ncomes to the compliance to pair programming roles, the exploration of code, and\nthe creative customization of programs. These findings contribute to an\nin-depth understanding of social and technical gender specifics of pair\nprogramming, and provide educators with resources and guidance for implementing\ngender-sensitive pair programming in the classroom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 12:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Yet, it is known to be extremely\nchallenging in practice to design a correct reward function for even simple\ntasks. Human-in-the-loop (HiL) RL allows humans to communicate complex goals to\nthe RL agent by providing various types of feedback. However, despite achieving\ngreat empirical successes, HiL RL usually requires too much feedback from a\nhuman teacher and also suffers from insufficient theoretical understanding.

Objective: We evaluate the\nacceptance of formal methods by Bosch automotive engineers, particularly\nwhether the difficulty of understanding verification results can be reduced.\nMethod: We perform two different exploratory studies. First, we conduct a user\nsurvey to explore challenges in identifying inconsistent specifications and\nusing formal methods by Bosch automotive engineers.

We use a well-known\ncost-benefit integrated assessment model, the Dynamic Integrated\nClimate-Economy (DICE) model, with its climate component replaced by the\nFinite-amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model (v2.1). The climate uncertainty\nin FaIR is sampled with an ensemble that is consistent with historically\nobserved climate and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed\nranges of key climate variables such as equilibrium climate sensitivity. Three\nscenarios are produced: a pathway similar to the \"optimal welfare\" scenario of\nDICE that has similar warming outcomes to current policies, and pathways that\nlimit warming to \"well-below\" 2C and 1.5C with low overshoot, in line with\nParis Agreement long-term temperature goals.

Unlike existing\narchitectures that require multiple pretrained language models (PLMs) to\nprocess a pair of the original and corrupted (subtly modified) sentences, D2CSE\navoids cumbersome fine-tuning of multiple PLMs by only optimizing continuous\nprompts by performing multiple tasks -- i.e., contrastive learning and\nconditional replaced token detection all done in a self-guided manner. D2CSE\noverloads a single PLM on continuous prompts and greatly saves memory\nconsumption as a result.

When applied in dynamic scenes, e.g.,\nautonomous driving, this consistency is usually violated in the dynamic areas,\nleading to corrupted estimations. Many multi-frame methods handle dynamic areas\nby identifying them with explicit masks and compensating the multi-view cues\nwith monocular cues represented as local monocular depth or features. The\nimprovements are limited due to the uncontrolled quality of the masks and the\nunderutilized benefits of the fusion of the two types of cues. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel method to learn to fuse the multi-view and monocular cues\nencoded as volumes without needing the heuristically crafted masks. As unveiled\nin our analyses, the multi-view cues capture more accurate geometric\ninformation in static areas, and the monocular cues capture more useful\ncontexts in dynamic areas.

PKS1830-211 is a\nremarkable radio-bright lensed quasar with a foreground molecular absorber at\nz=0.89. Small-scale morphological changes in the core-jet structure of the\nquasar -- which is magnified by the lensing -- result in a varying illumination\nof the absorber screen, which in turn causes variations in the absorption\nprofile. We aim to study the time variations of the system [...] in order to\nobtain constraints on both the quasar activity and small-scale structures in\nthe ISM of the absorber. We used ALMA to monitor the submm continuum emission,\ntogether with the absorption spectra of the H2O and CH molecules, with 17\nvisits spread over six months in 2016. [...] From the continuum data, we\nfollowed the evolution of the flux density, flux-density ratio, spectral index,\nand differential polarization between the two lensed images of the quasar; all\nquantities show significant variations related to the intrinsic activity of the\nquasar. We propose a simple parametric model of a core plus a ballistic plasmon\nto account for the continuum evolution, from which we constrain a time delay of\n25+/-3~days between lensed images. The spectral lines reveal significant\nvariations in the foreground absorption. A PCA highlights apparent wavy time\nvariations, possibly linked to the helical jet precession period of the quasar.\nFrom the deep averaged spectra towards the SW image, we detect the absorption\nof 13CH and estimate an abundance ratio of 12CH/13CH~150. We also measure the\noxygen isotopic ratios, 16O/18O=65.3+/-0.7 and 18O/17O=11.5+/-0.5. Finally, we\nfind a remarkable continuous shallow trough in the water absorption spanning a\nvelocity interval of nearly 500 km/s.

Arranging all components inside a GUI layout manually is a\ntime-consuming task. In order to assist designers, we developed a method named\nGUILGET to automatically generate GUI layouts from positional constraints\nrepresented as GUI arrangement graphs (GUI-AGs). The goal is to support the\ninitial step of GUI design by producing realistic and diverse GUI layouts. The\nexisting image layout generation techniques often cannot incorporate GUI design\nconstraints. Thus, GUILGET needs to adapt existing techniques to generate GUI\nlayouts that obey to constraints specific to GUI designs.

In this context, the Apollon laser is designed to reach\nan exceptional multi-petawatt laser peak power, thus aiming at achieving\nunprecedented accelerating gradients and bringing a scientific breakthrough in\nthe field of LWFA.\n  Since the quality of the self-injected electron bunches is very sensitive to\nthe condition of the laser, it is very important to take into account realistic\nlaser features when performing LWFA simulations. In this paper, we aim at\nunderstanding the implications of laser imperfections on the electrons produced\nwith the self-injection scheme in the bubble regime. For this purpose, we carry\non a numerical study of LWFA where we include experimentally measured laser\nprofiles from the Apollon facility in full three dimensional Particle-In-Cell\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 14:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

We introduce an easy-to-use, open source\nknowledge graph framework that is based on knowledge graph building blocks\n(KGBBs). KGBBs are small information modules for knowledge-processing, each\nbased on a specific type of semantic unit. By interrelating several KGBBs, one\ncan specify a KGBB-driven FAIREr knowledge graph. Besides implementing semantic\nunits, the KGBB Framework clearly distinguishes and decouples an internal\nin-memory data model from data storage, data display, and data access/export\nmodels. We argue that this decoupling is essential for solving many problems of\nknowledge management systems. We discuss the architecture of the KGBB Framework\nas we envision it, comprising (i) an openly accessible KGBB-Repository for\ndifferent types of KGBBs, (ii) a KGBB-Engine for managing and operating FAIREr\nknowledge graphs (including automatic provenance tracking, editing changelog,\nand versioning of semantic units); (iii) a repository for KGBB-Functions; (iv)\na low-code KGBB-Editor with which domain experts can create new KGBBs and\nspecify their own FAIREr knowledge graph without having to think about semantic\nmodelling.

To address the catastrophic forgetting\nissue, a novel adapter-based strategy is proposed to help effectively learn a\nset of new diseases at each round (or task) of continual learning, without\nchanging the shared feature extractor. The learnable lightweight task-specific\nadapter(s) can be flexibly designed (e.g., two convolutional layers) and then\nadded to the pretrained and fixed feature extractor. Together with a specially\ndesigned task-specific head which absorbs all previously learned old diseases\nas a single 'out-of-distribution' category, task-specific adapter(s) can help\nthe pretrained feature extractor more effectively extract discriminative\nfeatures between diseases. In addition, a simple yet effective fine-tuning is\napplied to collaboratively fine-tune multiple task-specific heads such that\noutputs from different heads are comparable and consequently the appropriate\nclassifier head can be more accurately selected during model inference.\nExtensive empirical evaluations on three image datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of the proposed method in continual learning of new\ndiseases.

Recently, the single-stage WSSS was awakened to\nalleviate problems of the expensive computational costs and the complicated\ntraining procedures in multi-stage WSSS. However, results of such an immature\nmodel suffer from problems of background incompleteness and object\nincompleteness. We empirically find that they are caused by the insufficiency\nof the global object context and the lack of the local regional contents,\nrespectively. Under these observations, we propose a single-stage WSSS model\nwith only the image-level class label supervisions, termed as Weakly Supervised\nFeature Coupling Network (WS-FCN), which can capture the multi-scale context\nformed from the adjacent feature grids, and encode the fine-grained spatial\ninformation from the low-level features into the high-level ones. Specifically,\na flexible context aggregation module is proposed to capture the global object\ncontext in different granular spaces. Besides, a semantically consistent\nfeature fusion module is proposed in a bottom-up parameter-learnable fashion to\naggregate the fine-grained local contents. Based on these two modules, WS-FCN\nlies in a self-supervised end-to-end training fashion. Extensive experimental\nresults on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of WS-FCN, which can achieve state-of-the-art\nresults by 65.02\\% and 64.22\\% mIoU on PASCAL VOC 2012 val set and test set,\n34.12\\% mIoU on MS COCO 2014 val set, respectively.

Its high proper motion and low dispersion measure result in such\nsignificant interstellar scintillation that high signal-to-noise detections\nrequire long observing durations or fortuitous timing. We turn to the sensitive\nMeerKAT telescope and, combined with historic Parkes data, leverage PSR\nJ1933$-$6211's kinematic and relativistic effects to constrain its 3D orbital\ngeometry and the component masses. We obtain precise proper motion and parallax\nestimates, and measure their effects as secular changes in the Keplerian\norbital parameters: a variation in orbital period of $7(1) \\times 10^{-13}$ s\ns$^{-1}$ and a change in projected semi-major axis of $1.60(5) \\times 10^{-14}$\ns s$^{-1}$. A self-consistent analysis of all kinematic and relativistic\neffects yields a distance of $1.6^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ kpc, an orbital inclination,\n$i = 55(1)$ deg and a longitude of the ascending node, $\\Omega =\n255^{+8}_{-14}$ deg. The probability densities for $\\Omega$ and $i$ and their\nsymmetric counterparts, ($180-i$, $360-\\Omega$), are seen to depend on the\nfiducial orbit used to measure the time of periastron passage. We investigate\nthis unexpected dependence and rule out software-related causes using\nsimulations. Nevertheless, we constrain the pulsar and WD masses to\n$1.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ M$_\\odot$ and $0.43(5)$ M$_\\odot$ respectively. These\nstrongly disfavour a helium-dominated WD. The orbital similarities between PSRs\nJ1933$-$6211 and J1614$-$2230 suggest they underwent Case A Roche lobe\noverflow, an extended evolution while the companion star is still on the Main\nSequence.

One approach to seek material systems as hosts of\nsuch emergent phases is to realize localization of electronic wavefunctions due\nto the geometric frustration inherent in the crystal structure, resulting in\nflat electronic bands. Recently, such efforts have found a wide range of exotic\nphases in the two-dimensional kagome lattice, including magnetic order,\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking charge order, nematicity, and\nsuperconductivity.

More precisely, sliced optimal transport is\nthe concatenation of the well-known Radon transform and the cumulative density\ntransform, which analytically yields the solutions of the reduced transport\nproblems. Inspired by this concept, we propose two adaptions for optimal\ntransport on the 2-sphere. Firstly, as counterpart to the Radon transform, we\nintroduce the vertical slice transform, which integrates along all circles\northogonal to a given direction. Secondly, we introduce the weighted semicircle\ntransform, which integrates along all half great circles. Both transforms are\ngeneralized to arbitrary measures on the sphere. While the vertical slice\ntransform can be combined with optimal transport on the interval and leads to a\nsliced Wasserstein distance restricted to even probability measures, the\nsemicircle transform is related to optimal transport on the circle and results\nin a different sliced Wasserstein distance for arbitrary probability measures.\nThe applicability of both novel sliced optimal transport concepts on the sphere\nis demonstrated by proof-of-concept examples dealing with the interpolation and\nclassification of spherical probability measures. The numerical implementation\nrelies on the singular value decompositions of both transforms and fast Fourier\ntechniques. For the inversion with respect to probability measures, we propose\nthe minimization of an entropy-regularized Kullback--Leibler divergence, which\ncan be numerically realized using a primal-dual proximal splitting algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 15:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

As\nsoftware systems grow in complexity and scale, the number of configurations and\nassociated specifications required to ensure the correct operation can become\nlarge and prohibitively difficult to manipulate manually. Due to the fast pace\nof software development, it is often the case that correct software\nspecifications are not thoroughly checked or validated within the software\nitself.

In\ncontrast, during the inphase oscillations, the energy flow is reversed.\nTherefore, closed-loop controller requires only the information about phase\nshift, which is easily estimated from dynamic state signals through the\ncoherency index.

Unfortunately, current vulnerability screening\ntechniques are ineffective at identifying novel vulnerabilities or providing\ndevelopers with code vulnerability and classification. Furthermore, the\ndatasets used for vulnerability learning often exhibit distribution shifts from\nthe real-world testing distribution due to novel attack strategies deployed by\nadversaries and as a result, the machine learning model's performance may be\nhindered or biased. To address these issues, we propose a joint interpolated\nmultitasked unbiased vulnerability classifier comprising a transformer\n\"RoBERTa\" and graph convolution neural network (GCN).

Accurate probabilistic forecasts at low aggregation levels can\nimprove peer-to-peer energy sharing, demand response, and the operation of\nreliable distribution networks. However, these applications require not only\nprobabilistic demand forecasts, which involve quantification of the forecast\nuncertainty, but also determining which consumers to include in the aggregation\nto meet electricity supply at the forecast lead time. While research papers\nhave been proposed on the supply side, no similar research has been conducted\non the demand side. This paper presents a method for creating a portfolio that\noptimally aggregates demand for a given energy demand, minimizing forecast\ninaccuracy of overall low-level aggregation. Using probabilistic load forecasts\nproduced by either ARMA-GARCH models or kernel density estimation (KDE), we\npropose three approaches to creating a portfolio of residential households'\ndemand: Forecast Validated, Seasonal Residual, and Seasonal Similarity. An\nevaluation of probabilistic load forecasts demonstrates that all three\napproaches enhance the accuracy of forecasts produced by random portfolios,\nwith the Seasonal Residual approach for Korea and Ireland outperforming the\nothers in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 07:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}
