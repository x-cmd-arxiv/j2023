We refer to generating such simultaneous movements as performing 'spatial\ncompositions'. In contrast to temporal compositions that seek to transition\nfrom one action to another, spatial compositing requires understanding which\nbody parts are involved in which action, to be able to move them\nsimultaneously. Motivated by the observation that the correspondence between\nactions and body parts is encoded in powerful language models, we extract this\nknowledge by prompting GPT-3 with text such as \"what are the body parts\ninvolved in the action <action name>?\", while also providing the parts list and\nfew-shot examples. Given this action-part mapping, we combine body parts from\ntwo motions together and establish the first automated method to spatially\ncompose two actions. However, training data with compositional actions is\nalways limited by the combinatorics. Hence, we further create synthetic data\nwith this approach, and use it to train a new state-of-the-art text-to-motion\ngeneration model, called SINC (\"SImultaneous actioN Compositions for 3D human\nmotions\"). In our experiments, we find training on additional synthetic\nGPT-guided compositional motions improves text-to-motion generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 16:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

We\npresent evidence from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey for\nfading AGN activity in 6/93 post-starburst galaxies. These six galaxies show\nextended emission line regions (EELRs) consistent with ionization from past AGN\nactivity, analogous to \"Hanny's voorwerp\" and other systems where the OIII5007\nemission is bright enough to be visible in broadband imaging. Using the\ninfrared luminosities from IRAS to estimate the current AGN luminosity, we find\nthat 5/6 of the post-starburst galaxies have current AGN which have faded from\nthe peak luminosity required to have ionized the EELRs. Given the rate at which\nwe observe EELRs, the typical EELR visibility timescale, and an estimate of how\noften EELRs would be visible, we estimate the duty cycle of AGN activity during\nthe post-starburst phase. The timescale for the galaxy to cycle between peaks\nin AGN luminosity is $t_{\\rm EELR}\\sim1.1-2.3\\times10^5$ yr.

GPT-NER bridges the\ngap by transforming the sequence labeling task to a generation task that can be\neasily adapted by LLMs e.g., the task of finding location entities in the input\ntext \"Columbus is a city\" is transformed to generate the text sequence\n\"@@Columbus## is a city\", where special tokens @@## marks the entity to\nextract. To efficiently address the \"hallucination\" issue of LLMs, where LLMs\nhave a strong inclination to over-confidently label NULL inputs as entities, we\npropose a self-verification strategy by prompting LLMs to ask itself whether\nthe extracted entities belong to a labeled entity tag.\n  We conduct experiments on five widely adopted NER datasets, and GPT-NER\nachieves comparable performances to fully supervised baselines, which is the\nfirst time as far as we are concerned. More importantly, we find that GPT-NER\nexhibits a greater ability in the low-resource and few-shot setups, when the\namount of training data is extremely scarce, GPT-NER performs significantly\nbetter than supervised models.

This is problematic in case the user wants to preserve the\nprivacy of the data and the service provider does not want to reveal the\nweights of his CNN. Secure Inference allows the two parties to engage in a\nprotocol that preserves their respective privacy concerns, while revealing only\nthe inference result to the user. This is known as Multi-Party Computation\n(MPC). A major bottleneck of MPC algorithms is communication, as the parties\nmust send data back and forth. The linear component of a CNN (i.e.\nconvolutions) can be done efficiently with minimal communication, but the\nnon-linear part (i.e., ReLU) requires the bulk of communication bandwidth. We\npropose two ways to accelerate Secure Inference. The first is based on the\nobservation that the ReLU outcome of many convolutions is highly correlated.\nTherefore, we replace the per pixel ReLU operation by a ReLU operation per\npatch. Each layer in the network will benefit from a patch of a different size\nand we devise an algorithm to choose the optimal set of patch sizes through a\nnovel reduction of the problem to a knapsack problem. The second way to\naccelerate Secure Inference is based on cutting the number of bit comparisons\nrequired for a secure ReLU operation.

In this paper, we consider whether battery resources\ncan be used more efficiently in a setting where drivers, in addition to having\npersonal vehicle batteries, have access to a shared battery resource.

We provide affirmative answers to these\nquestions in a model where parties have access to shared EPR pairs, thus\ndemonstrating the cryptographic power of this resource.\n  First, we construct a one-shot (i.e., single message) string oblivious\ntransfer (OT) protocol with random receiver bit in the shared EPR pairs model,\nassuming the (sub-exponential) hardness of LWE. Building on this, we show that\n{\\em secure teleportation through quantum channels} is possible.

Segment Anything Model\n(SAM) is a foundation model that is intended to segment user-defined objects of\ninterest in an interactive manner.

Here, we\nperform an extensive evaluation of SAM's ability to segment medical images on a\ncollection of 19 medical imaging datasets from various modalities and\nanatomies. We report the following findings: (1) SAM's performance based on\nsingle prompts highly varies depending on the dataset and the task, from\nIoU=0.1135 for spine MRI to IoU=0.8650 for hip X-ray. (2) Segmentation\nperformance appears to be better for well-circumscribed objects with prompts\nwith less ambiguity and poorer in various other scenarios such as the\nsegmentation of brain tumors. (3) SAM performs notably better with box prompts\nthan with point prompts. (4) SAM outperforms similar methods RITM, SimpleClick,\nand FocalClick in almost all single-point prompt settings. (5) When\nmultiple-point prompts are provided iteratively, SAM's performance generally\nimproves only slightly while other methods' performance improves to the level\nthat surpasses SAM's point-based performance. We also provide several\nillustrations for SAM's performance on all tested datasets, iterative\nsegmentation, and SAM's behavior given prompt ambiguity. We conclude that SAM\nshows impressive zero-shot segmentation performance for certain medical imaging\ndatasets, but moderate to poor performance for others.

However, for adapting to\ndownstream tasks, they require a sufficient amount of labeled data since their\nrich features capture not only objects but also less relevant image background.\nIn contrast, Instance Discrimination (ID) methods focus on objects. In this\nwork, we study how to combine the efficiency and scalability of MIM with the\nability of ID to perform downstream classification in the absence of large\namounts of labeled data. To this end, we introduce Masked Autoencoder\nContrastive Tuning (MAE-CT), a sequential approach that applies Nearest\nNeighbor Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) to a pre-trained MAE. MAE-CT tunes the\nrich features such that they form semantic clusters of objects without using\nany labels. Applied to large and huge Vision Transformer (ViT) models, MAE-CT\nmatches or excels previous self-supervised methods trained on ImageNet in\nlinear probing, k-NN and low-shot classification accuracy as well as in\nunsupervised clustering accuracy. Notably, similar results can be achieved\nwithout additional image augmentations. While ID methods generally rely on\nhand-crafted augmentations to avoid shortcut learning, we find that nearest\nneighbor lookup is sufficient and that this data-driven augmentation effect\nimproves with model size. MAE-CT is compute efficient. For instance, starting\nfrom a MAE pre-trained ViT-L/16, MAE-CT increases the ImageNet 1% low-shot\naccuracy from 67.7% to 72.6%, linear probing accuracy from 76.0% to 80.2% and\nk-NN accuracy from 60.6% to 79.1% in just five hours using eight A100 GPUs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 17:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

The basic idea of GenCorres is to learn a parametric mesh\ngenerator to fit an unorganized deformable shape collection while constraining\ndeformations between adjacent synthetic shapes to preserve geometric structures\nsuch as local rigidity and local conformality. GenCorres presents three\nappealing advantages over existing JSM techniques. First, GenCorres performs\nJSM among a synthetic shape collection whose size is much bigger than the input\nshapes and fully leverages the data-driven power of JSM. Second, GenCorres\nunifies consistent shape matching and pairwise matching (i.e., by enforcing\ndeformation priors between adjacent synthetic shapes). Third, the generator\nprovides a concise encoding of consistent shape correspondences. However,\nlearning a mesh generator from an unorganized shape collection is challenging.\nIt requires a good initial fitting to each shape and can easily get trapped by\nlocal minimums. GenCorres addresses this issue by learning an implicit\ngenerator from the input shapes, which provides intermediate shapes between two\narbitrary shapes. We introduce a novel approach for computing correspondences\nbetween adjacent implicit surfaces and force the correspondences to preserve\ngeometric structures and be cycle-consistent. Synthetic shapes of the implicit\ngenerator then guide initial fittings (i.e., via template-based deformation)\nfor learning the mesh generator. Experimental results show that GenCorres\nconsiderably outperforms state-of-the-art JSM techniques on benchmark datasets.\nThe synthetic shapes of GenCorres preserve local geometric features and yield\ncompetitive performance gains against state-of-the-art deformable shape\ngenerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 17:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

There is consensus, however, that\ncreating a strict, global standard of \"acceptable\" content is untenable (e.g.,\nin the US, it is incompatible with Section 230 of the Communications Decency\nAct and the First Amendment).\n  In this work, we propose that algorithmic filtering should be regulated with\nrespect to a flexible, user-driven baseline. We provide a concrete framework\nfor regulating and auditing a social media platform according to such a\nbaseline. In particular, we introduce the notion of a baseline feed: the\ncontent that a user would see without filtering (e.g., on Twitter, this could\nbe the chronological timeline). We require that the feeds a platform filters\ncontain \"similar\" informational content as their respective baseline feeds, and\nwe design a principled way to measure similarity. This approach is motivated by\nrelated suggestions that regulations should increase user agency. We present an\nauditing procedure that checks whether a platform honors this requirement.\nNotably, the audit needs only black-box access to a platform's filtering\nalgorithm, and it does not access or infer private user information. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees on the strength of the audit.

Since synchronous gauge follows the free-fall\nframe of observers, the equivalence principle dictates that in the gradient\napproximation for the long-wavelength mode there is only a single, manifestly\ntime-independent consistency relation for the $N$-point function. This simple\nform is dictated by the initial mapping between synchronous and local\ncoordinates, unlike Newtonian gauge and its correspondingly separate dilation\nand Newtonian consistency relations.

The similarities of models with isosinglet VLQs and\nthe seesaw framework in the leptonic sector are pointed out. The existence of\nVLQs leads to flavour-changing neutral currents at tree level and deviations\nfrom unitarity of the CKM matrix, introducing rich phenomenological\nimplications. These new effects are naturally suppressed by the masses of the\nnew quarks, that are constrained to be above the electroweak scale. In\naddition, striking new effects can be achieved with the inclusion of an extra\ncomplex scalar singlet.

Using a statistical approach, we characterize the outcomes of\nthese stellar collisions within the inner parsec of the Galactic Center (GC).\nClose to the SMBH, where the velocity dispersion is larger than the escape\nspeed from a Sun-like star, collisions lead to mass loss. We find that the\nstellar population within $0.01$ pc is halved within about a Gyr because of\ndestructive collisions.

When diffusion occurs in presence of a constant bias to a {\\it\ngated} target, i.e., to a target that switches between an open and a closed\nstate, the dynamics essentially slows down compared to {\\it ungated}\ndrift-diffusion, resulting in an increase in the mean completion time. In this\nwork, we utilize stochastic resetting as an external protocol to counterbalance\nthe delay due to gating. We consider a particle that undergoes drift-diffusion\nin the presence of a stochastically gated target and is moreover subjected to a\nrate-limiting resetting dynamics. Calculating the minimal mean completion time\nrendered by an optimal resetting for this exactly-solvable system, we construct\na phase diagram that owns three distinct phases: (i) where resetting can make\ngated drift-diffusion faster even compared to the original ungated process,\n(ii) where resetting still expedites gated drift-diffusion, but not beyond the\noriginal ungated process, and (iii) where resetting fails to expedite gated\ndrift-diffusion. Gated drift-diffusion aptly models various stochastic\nprocesses such as chemical reactions that exclusively take place for certain\nactivated state of the reactants. Our work predicts the conditions where\nstochastic resetting can act as a useful strategy to enhance the rate of such\nprocesses without compromising on their selectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 18:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

In our work, we deform the bands of the Haldane model smoothly\nby varying one of its three nearest neighbour hopping amplitudes ($t_1$), while\nkeeping the other two ($t$) fixed. This breaks the $C_3$ symmetry of the\nHamiltonian, while the $M_x*T$ symmetry is preserved. The symmetry breaking\ncauses the Dirac cones to shift from the K and the K' points in the Brillouin\nzone (BZ) to an intermediate M point. This is evident from the Berry curvature\nplots which show a similar shift in the corresponding values as a function of\n$\\frac{t_1}{t}$. We observe two different topological phases, one being a\ntopological insulator (TI) phase and the other is a higher order topological\ninsulator (HOTI). The Chern number ($C$) remains perfectly quantized at a value\nof $C=1$ for the TI phase and goes to zero in the HOTI phase. Furthermore the\nevolution of the Wannier charge center (WCC) as the band is deformed shows a\njump in the TI phase indicating a non-trivial bulk.

However, the\ndistributed nature of FL and the unvetted participants' data makes it\nvulnerable to backdoor attacks. In these attacks, adversaries inject malicious\nfunctionality into the centralized model during training, leading to\nintentional misclassifications for specific adversary-chosen inputs. While\nprevious research has demonstrated successful injections of persistent\nbackdoors in FL, the persistence also poses a challenge, as their existence in\nthe centralized model can prompt the central aggregation server to take\npreventive measures to penalize the adversaries. Therefore, this paper proposes\na methodology that enables adversaries to effectively remove backdoors from the\ncentralized model upon achieving their objectives or upon suspicion of possible\ndetection. The proposed approach extends the concept of machine unlearning and\npresents strategies to preserve the performance of the centralized model and\nsimultaneously prevent over-unlearning of information unrelated to backdoor\npatterns, making the adversaries stealthy while removing backdoors. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first work that explores machine unlearning in FL\nto remove backdoors to the benefit of adversaries. Exhaustive evaluation\nconsidering image classification scenarios demonstrates the efficacy of the\nproposed method in efficient backdoor removal from the centralized model,\ninjected by state-of-the-art attacks across multiple configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 20:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

This principle of consensual blocking, as well as the\ntraditional core-defining principle of unilateral blocking and one straddling\nin between, can all be applied to partition-allocation pairs. Each such pair is\nmade up of a partition of the grand coalition and a corresponding allocation\nvector whose components are individually rational and efficient for the various\nconstituent coalitions of the given partition. For the resulting strong,\nmedium, and weak stability concepts, the first is core-compatible in that the\ntraditional core exactly contains those allocations that are associated through\nthis strong stability concept with the all-consolidated partition consisting of\nonly the grand coalition. Probably more importantly, the latter medium and weak\nstability concepts are universal. By this, we mean that any game, no matter how\n``poor'' it is, has its fair share of stable solutions.

One\nflexible strategy is the switched-array-based channel sounding, where antenna\nelements are activated at different time instants to measure the channel\nspatial characteristics. Although its hardware complexity is decreased due to\nfewer radio-frequency (RF) chains, sequentially switching the antenna elements\ncan result in aliasing in the joint estimation of angles and Doppler\nfrequencies of multipath components (MPCs). Therefore, pseudo-random switching\nhas been proposed to mitigate such aliasing and increase estimation accuracy in\nboth angular and Doppler domains. Nevertheless, the increased Doppler\nresolution could cause additional post-processing complexity of parameter\nestimation, which is relevant when the Doppler frequencies are not of interest,\ne.g., for spatial channel modeling. This paper proposes an improved hybrid\nsequential and random switching scheme. The primary purpose is to maintain the\nestimation accuracy of angles of MPCs while decreasing the resolution of\nDoppler frequencies for minimized complexity of channel parameter estimation. A\nsimulated-annealing algorithm is exploited to obtain an optimized switching\nsequence. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is also demonstrated with a\nrealistic antenna array.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 22:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

Firstly,\nSymes (1980, 1982) solved it explicitly via $QR$-factorization and conjugation.\nSecondly, Deift, Li, Nanda, and Tomei (1986) 'tridiagonalized' the system into\na family of tridiagonal Toda lattices which are solvable and integrable. In\nthis paper we derive their tridiagonalization procedure in a natural way using\nthe fact that the symmetric Toda flow is diffeomorphic to a twisted gradient\nflow on a flag variety, which may then be decomposed into flows on a product of\nGrassmannians. These flows may in turn be embedded into projective spaces via\nPl\\\"ucker embeddings, and mapped back to tridiagonal Toda lattice flows using\nMoser's construction. In addition, we study the tridiagonalized flows projected\nonto a product of permutohedra, using the twisted moment map of Bloch,\nFlaschka, and Ratiu (1990). These ideas are facilitated in a natural way by the\ntheory of total positivity, building on our previous work (2023).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 01:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Previous approaches that prune redundant tokens have\ndemonstrated a good trade-off between performance and computation costs.\nNevertheless, errors caused by pruning strategies can lead to significant\ninformation loss. Our quantitative experiments reveal that the impact of pruned\ntokens on performance should be noticeable. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel joint Token Pruning & Squeezing module (TPS) for compressing vision\ntransformers with higher efficiency. Firstly, TPS adopts pruning to get the\nreserved and pruned subsets. Secondly, TPS squeezes the information of pruned\ntokens into partial reserved tokens via the unidirectional nearest-neighbor\nmatching and similarity-based fusing steps. Compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, our approach outperforms them under all token pruning intensities.\nEspecially while shrinking DeiT-tiny&small computational budgets to 35%, it\nimproves the accuracy by 1%-6% compared with baselines on ImageNet\nclassification. The proposed method can accelerate the throughput of DeiT-small\nbeyond DeiT-tiny, while its accuracy surpasses DeiT-tiny by 4.78%.

Thus, we try to\napply the knowledge graph to recognize linear building patterns. First, we use\nthe property graph to express the spatial relations in proximity, similar and\nlinear arrangement between buildings; secondly, the rules of linear pattern\nrecognition are expressed as the rules of knowledge graph reasoning; finally,\nthe linear building patterns are recognized by using the rule-based reasoning\nin the built knowledge graph. The experimental results on a dataset containing\n1289 buildings show that the method in this paper can achieve the same\nprecision and recall as the existing methods; meanwhile, the recognition\nefficiency is improved by 5.98 times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 04:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

Further, any population is\ninherently heterogeneous i.e. people will hold a varied range of opinions\nregarding a topic and showcase a varied range of openness to get influenced by\nothers. In this paper, we demonstrate the different behavior put forward by\nopen- and close-minded agents towards an issue, when allowed to freely intermix\nand communicate.\n  We have shown that the intermixing among people leads to formation of opinion\necho chambers i.e. a small closed network of people who hold similar opinions\nand are not affected by opinions of people outside the network. Echo chambers\nare evidently harmful for a society because it inhibits free healthy\ncommunication among all and thus, prevents exchange of opinions, spreads\nmisinformation and increases extremist beliefs. This calls for reduction in\necho chambers, because a total consensus of opinion is neither possible nor is\nwelcome.

We illustrate the value\nof this approach by showing the extraordinary and ordinary changes Reddit went\nthrough during the pandemic. First, we show that typically when rapid growth\noccurs, it is driven by a few concentrated communities and within a narrow\nslice of language use.

In\nsuch a scenario, traditional line-of-sight (LOS) imaging methods only see the\nfront part of the object and typically fail to recover the occluded back\nregions.

Instead of separately recovering the LOS and NLOS signals, we adopt an\nimplicit neural network to represent the object, analogous to NeRF and NeTF.\nWhile transients are measured along straight rays in LOS but over the spherical\nwavefronts in NLOS, we derive differentiable ray propagation models to\nsimultaneously model both types of transient measurements so that the NLOS\nreconstruction also takes into account the direct LOS measurements and vice\nversa.

The comparison of two types of surfaces, a melt-formed\nsurface (MS) and a fracture surface (FS), demonstrates that the influence of\nthe alkali modifier on the surface properties depends strongly on the nature of\nthe surface. The FS exhibits a monotonic increase of modifier concentration\nwith increasing alkali size while the MS shows a saturation of alkali\nconcentration when going from Na to K glasses, indicating the presence of two\ncompeting mechanism that influence the properties of a MS. For the FS, we find\nthat larger alkali ions reduce the concentration of under-coordinated Si atoms\nand increase the fraction of two-membered rings, implying an enhanced chemical\nreactivity of the surface.

Hence, the\nanalysis of scanpaths in reading have attracted increasing attention across\nfields, ranging from cognitive science over linguistics to computer science. In\nparticular, eye-tracking-while-reading data has been argued to bear the\npotential to make machine-learning-based language models exhibit a more\nhuman-like linguistic behavior. However, one of the main challenges in modeling\nhuman scanpaths in reading is their dual-sequence nature: the words are ordered\nfollowing the grammatical rules of the language, whereas the fixations are\nchronologically ordered. As humans do not strictly read from left-to-right, but\nrather skip or refixate words and regress to previous words, the alignment of\nthe linguistic and the temporal sequence is non-trivial. In this paper, we\ndevelop Eyettention, the first dual-sequence model that simultaneously\nprocesses the sequence of words and the chronological sequence of fixations.\nThe alignment of the two sequences is achieved by a cross-sequence attention\nmechanism.

A remarkable consequence is emergence\nof the quasiparticle resonance, which has been predicted with the coordinate\nspace Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory, but not yet observed\nexperimentally. Purpose: We discuss possible observation of quasiparticle\nresonances in decay spectrum of unbound nuclei near the neutron drip-line. We\ndeal with an example of unbound nucleus ${}^{21}$C which disintegrates to\n${}^{20}$C and a neutron. Method: We describe a scattering state consisting of\n${}^{20}$C and a neutron in the framework of the HFB formalism. We assume that\na nucleon knockout reaction produces a doorway state of the decay, and we\nevaluate the decay spectrum by taking an overlap of the doorway state and the\nscattering state of ${}^{20}\\mathrm{C}+n$. A numerical calculation was\nperformed with the Woods-Saxon potential and a density-dependent effective\npairing interaction. Results: We show that the quasiparticle resonance appears\nas low-lying peaks in the decay spectrum of ${}^{21}$C. They originate from the\nweakly bound single-neutron orbits $2s_{1/2}$ and $1d_{5/2}$, but emerge as\nunbound resonant quasiparticle states under the influence of the neutron\npairing correlation. The resonance energy and the width of the calculated\nquasiparticle resonances are consistent with an experimental observation\nwhereas they are sensitive to the neutron pairing correlation. Conclusion: The\nresults suggest that nucleon knockout reactions populating the unbound nucleus\n${}^{21}\\mathrm{C}$ provide realistic opportunity of experimentally observing\nthe quasiparticle resonance and of disclosing the pairing correlation in\nneutron-rich nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 07:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

In this study, we propose a new method, robust prompt\nlearning with knowledge graph (RPLKG). Based on the knowledge graph, we\nautomatically design diverse interpretable and meaningful prompt sets. Our\nmodel obtains cached embeddings of prompt sets after one forwarding from a\nlarge pre-trained model. After that, model optimizes the prompt selection\nprocesses with GumbelSoftmax. In this way, our model is trained using\nrelatively little memory and learning time. Also, RPLKG selects the optimal\ninterpretable prompt automatically, depending on the dataset. In summary, RPLKG\nis i) interpretable, ii) requires small computation resources, and iii) easy to\nincorporate prior human knowledge. To validate the RPLKG, we provide\ncomprehensive experimental results on few-shot learning, domain generalization\nand new class generalization setting. RPLKG shows a significant performance\nimprovement compared to zero-shot learning and competitive performance against\nseveral prompt learning methods using much lower resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 08:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

Based on the observation, we renovate the\ncoarse-grained images and texts in the old benchmarks and establish the\nimproved benchmarks called MSCOCO-FG and Flickr30K-FG. Specifically, on the\nimage side, we enlarge the original image pool by adopting more similar images.\nOn the text side, we propose a novel semi-automatic renovation approach to\nrefine coarse-grained sentences into finer-grained ones with little human\neffort. Furthermore, we evaluate representative image-text retrieval models on\nour new benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We also\nanalyze the capability of models on fine-grained semantic comprehension through\nextensive experiments. The results show that even the state-of-the-art models\nhave much room for improvement in fine-grained semantic understanding,\nespecially in distinguishing attributes of close objects in images. Our code\nand improved benchmark datasets are publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/cwj1412/MSCOCO-Flikcr30K_FG, which we hope will inspire\nfurther in-depth research on cross-modal retrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 09:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

Neural networks are\ncurrently the most popular approach in the inverse problem of dynamical\nsystems. In order to obtain accurate dynamical equations, neural networks need\na large amount of trajectory data as a training set. To address this\nshortcoming, we propose a residual-based multi-peaks sampling algorithm.\nEvaluate the training results of each epoch of neural network, calculate the\nprobability density function $P(x)$ of the residual, perform sampling where the\n$P(x)$ is large, and add samples to the training set to retrain the neural\nnetwork.

Based on the observations of the limit-cycle behaviors of the\nsuperluminal jet source, GRS 1915+105, we infer that the transient jet\nejections could happen just after the slim disk emerging from the standard disk\nat some distance runs over the standard disk and reaches the vicinity of the\ncentral black hole. The standard disk releases about a half of the\ngravitational energy in the course of the accretion, but the released radiative\nenergy could be absorbed by the optically thick slim disk covering the standard\ndisk in this situation. Then, since the inward motion of the slim disk is much\nfaster than that of the standard disk, a quantity of energy released by an\namount of gas in the standard disk is received by the much smaller amount of\ngas in the slim disk. As the result, the energy per mass received by the slim\ndisk is expected to be largely amplified and is estimated to get highly\nrelativistic. Since the energy is much larger than the gravitational energy,\nthe height of the slim disk could significantly increase. Hence, the innermost\npart of the slim disk from which almost all the angular momentum has been\ntransferred outward could have a much larger height than the black hole size\nand collide with one another around the central axis of the disk, turning to an\noutward flow along the axis normal to the disk plane. The flow in this\ndirection can be approximated to be that through the de Laval nozzle and could\nbecome supersonic near the distance where the flow has the smallest cross\nsection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 09:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

We use two-dimensional\nrectangular bin packing (2DBP) as our foundation. Classical 2DBP algorithms\nminimize their products' makespan, but virtual memory systems employing demand\npaging deem such a criterion inappropriate. We view an allocator's placement\ndecisions as a solution to a 2DBP instance, optimizing some unknown criterion\nparticular to that allocator's policy. Our end product is a compact data\nstructure that fits e.g. the simulation of 80 million requests in a 350 MiB\nfile. By design, it is concerned with events residing entirely in virtual\nmemory; no information on memory accesses, indexing costs or any other factor\nis kept.\n  We bootstrap our contribution's significance by exploring its relationship to\nmaximum resident set size (RSS). Our baseline is the assumption that less\nfragmentation amounts to smaller peak RSS. We thus define a fragmentation\nmetric in the 2DBP substrate and compute it for 28 workloads linked to 4 modern\nallocators. We also measure peak RSS for the 112 resulting pairs. Our metric\nexhibits a strong monotonic relationship (Spearman coefficient $\\rho>0.65$) in\nhalf of those cases: allocators achieving better 2DBP placements yield\n$9\\%$-$30\\%$ smaller peak RSS, with the trends remaining consistent across two\ndifferent machines.\n  Considering our representation's minimalism, the presented empirical evidence\nis a robust indicator of its potency.

GCNH learns and combines separate representations for a\nnode and its neighbors, using one learned importance coefficient per layer to\nbalance the contributions of center nodes and neighborhoods. We conduct\nextensive experiments on eight real-world graphs and a set of synthetic graphs\nwith varying degrees of heterophily to demonstrate how the design choices for\nGCNH lead to a sizable improvement over a vanilla GCN. Moreover, GCNH\noutperforms state-of-the-art models of much higher complexity on four out of\neight benchmarks, while producing comparable results on the remaining datasets.\nFinally, we discuss and analyze the lower complexity of GCNH, which results in\nfewer trainable parameters and faster training times than other methods, and\nshow how GCNH mitigates the oversmoothing problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 11:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

Most existing deep metric learning methods attempt to\nmaximize the difference of inter-class features. And semantic related\ninformation is obtained by increasing the distance between samples of different\nclasses in the embedding space. However, compressing all positive samples\ntogether while creating large margins between different classes unconsciously\ndestroys the local structure between similar samples. Ignoring the intra-class\nvariance contained in the local structure between similar samples, the\nembedding space obtained from training receives lower generalizability over\nunseen classes, which would lead to the network overfitting the training set\nand crashing on the test set. To address these considerations, this paper\ndesigns a self-supervised generative assisted ranking framework that provides a\nsemi-supervised view of intra-class variance learning scheme for typical\nsupervised deep metric learning. Specifically, this paper performs sample\nsynthesis with different intensities and diversity for samples satisfying\ncertain conditions to simulate the complex transformation of intra-class\nsamples. And an intra-class ranking loss function is designed using the idea of\nself-supervised learning to constrain the network to maintain the intra-class\ndistribution during the training process to capture the subtle intra-class\nvariance. With this approach, a more realistic embedding space can be obtained\nin which global and local structures of samples are well preserved, thus\nenhancing the effectiveness of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on four\nbenchmarks have shown that this approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 13:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

In this paper, we focus on the well-studied problem of sorting\nand indexing string sets. Since the introduction of suffix trees in 1973,\ndozens of suffix sorting algorithms have been described in the literature. In\n2017, these techniques were extended to sets of strings described by means of\nfinite automata: the theory of Wheeler graphs [Gagie et al., TCS'17] introduced\nautomata whose states can be totally-sorted according to the co-lexicographic\n(co-lex in the following) order of the prefixes of words accepted by the\nautomaton. More recently, in [Cotumaccio, Prezza, SODA'21] it was shown how to\nextend these ideas to arbitrary automata by means of partial co-lex orders.\nThis work showed that a co-lex order of minimum width (thus optimizing search\nquery times) on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) can be computed in $O(m^2\n+ n^{5/2})$ time, $m$ being the number of transitions and $n$ the number of\nstates of the input DFA.\n  In this paper, we exhibit new combinatorial properties of the minimum-width\nco-lex order of DFAs and exploit them to design faster prefix sorting\nalgorithms. In particular, we describe two algorithms sorting arbitrary DFAs in\n$O(mn)$ and $O(n^2\\log n)$ time, respectively, and an algorithm sorting acyclic\nDFAs in $O(m\\log n)$ time. Within these running times, all algorithms compute\nalso a smallest chain partition of the partial order (required to index the\nDFA).

We utilise all the available hard X-ray\n($> 10$ keV) observations taken from different telescopes, $i.e.,$ $BeppoSAX$,\n$Suzaku$, $NuSTAR$ and $AstroSat$, at ten different epochs across $22$ years\nfrom $1998$ to $2020$. The $3.0-79$ keV broadband X-ray spectral modelling\nusing physically-motivated models, namely MYTORUS, BORUS02 and UXCLUMPY, infers\nthe presence of a torus with a low covering factor of $0.28$, an inclination\nangle of $77^{\\circ}$ $-$ $81^{\\circ}$ and Compton-thick line-of-sight column\ndensities ($N_{\\rm H,LOS} = 4.13~-~9.26~\\times~10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) in all the\nepochs. The joint multi-epoch spectral modelling suggests that the overall\nstructure of the torus is likely to remain unchanged. However, we find\ntentative evidence for the variable line-of-sight column density on timescales\nranging from one day to one week to a few years, suggesting a clumpy\ncircumnuclear material located at sub-parsec to tens of parsec scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 14:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Terahertz\ntime-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) was employed to investigate the effect of\nparticle size and concentration on scattering in specially fabricated compacts\nconsisting of borosilicate microspheres in a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)\nmatrix. As expected, increasing particle size leads to an increase in overall\nscattering contribution. At low concentrations, the scattering contribution\nincreases linearly with concentration. Scattering increases linearly at low\nconcentrations, saturates at higher concentrations with a maximum level\ndepending on particle size, and that the onset of saturation is independent of\nparticle size. The effective refractive index becomes sublinear at high\nparticle concentrations and exceeds the linear model at maximum density, which\ncan cause errors in calculations based on it, such as porosity. The observed\nphenomena are attributed to the change in the fraction of photons propagating\nballistically versus being scattered. At low concentrations, photons travel\npredominately ballistically through the PTFE matrix. At high concentrations,\nthe photons again propagate ballistically through adjacent glass microspheres.\nIn the intermediate regime, photons are predominately scattered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 14:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

Deep learning models are vulnerable to\nbackdoor attacks due to the lack of transparency. A poisoned backdoor model may\nperform normally in routine environments, but exhibit malicious behavior when\nthe input contains a trigger. Current research on backdoor attacks focuses on\nimproving the stealthiness of triggers, and most approaches require strong\nattacker capabilities, such as knowledge of the model structure or control over\nthe training process. These attacks are impractical since in most cases the\nattacker's capabilities are limited. Additionally, the issue of model\nrobustness has not received adequate attention. For instance, model\ndistillation is commonly used to streamline model size as the number of\nparameters grows exponentially, and most of previous backdoor attacks failed\nafter model distillation; the image augmentation operations can destroy the\ntrigger and thus disable the backdoor. This study explores the implementation\nof black-box backdoor attacks within capability constraints. An attacker can\ncarry out such attacks by acting as either an image annotator or an image\nprovider, without involvement in the training process or knowledge of the\ntarget model's structure. Through the design of a backdoor trigger, our attack\nremains effective after model distillation and image augmentation, making it\nmore threatening and practical.

Photoluminescence of the\nimplanted MoSe$_2$ reveals an emission line from Cr-related defects that is\npresent only under weak electron doping. Unlike band-to-band transition, the\nCr-introduced emission is characterised by non-zero activation energy, long\nlifetimes, and weak response to the magnetic field. To rationalise the\nexperimental results and get insights into the atomic structure of the defects,\nwe modelled the Cr-ion irradiation process using ab-initio molecular dynamics\nsimulations followed by the electronic structure calculations of the system\nwith defects. The experimental and theoretical results suggest that the\nrecombination of electrons on the acceptors, which could be introduced by the\nCr implantation-induced defects, with the valence band holes is the most likely\norigin of the low energy emission.

Combining the XFEL experiments\nwith simulations provides a complete picture of the structural evolution of\nultra-fast laser-induced instability development, indicating the excitation of\nsurface plasmons and the growth of a new type of filamentation instability.\nThese findings provide new insight into the ultra-fast instability processes in\nsolids under extreme conditions at the nanometer level with important\nimplications for inertial confinement fusion and laboratory astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 14:58:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 04:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

In 1993, Luby, Sinclair and Zuckerman [LSZ93] proved that a\nsimple universal restart strategy can, for any probability distribution $p$,\nprovide an algorithm executing $\\mathcal{A}$ and whose expected running time is\n$O(\\ell^\\star_p\\log\\ell^\\star_p)$, where $\\ell^\\star_p=\\Theta\\left(\\inf_{q\\in\n(0,1]}Q_p(q)/q\\right)$ is the minimum expected running time achievable with\nfull prior knowledge of the probability distribution $p$, and $Q_p(q)$ is the\n$q$-quantile of $p$. Moreover, the authors showed that the logarithmic term\ncould not be removed for universal restart strategies and was, in a certain\nsense, optimal. In this work, we show that, quite surprisingly, the logarithmic\nterm can be replaced by a smaller quantity, thus reducing the expected running\ntime in practical settings of interest.

Additionally, we searched for stellar\nsurface differential rotation (DR) and any centre-to-limb variation (CLV) due\nto convection, but return a null detection of both. This is unsurprising for\nWASP-52, given its relatively cool temperature, high magnetic activity (which\nleads to lower CLV), and projected obliquity near 0 degrees (meaning the\ntransit chord is less likely to cross several stellar latitudes).

A careful treatment of both DR and CLV is\nrequired, especially for systems with high impact factors, due to potential\ndegeneracies between the two.

Here, we propose an analog\nfeedback-controlled memristor programming circuit that makes use of a novel\nlook-up table-based (LUT-based) programming algorithm. With the proposed\nalgorithm, the programming and the verification of a memristor can be performed\nin a single-direction sequential process.

This necessitates a trusted log to establish an\nagreed-upon and non-repudiable timeline of events. The unique properties of\nblockchain facilitate this by providing immutability and availability. For\npower asymmetric environments such as the workplace, permissionless blockchain\nis especially beneficial as no trusted third party is required. Yet, two issues\nremain: (1) In a decentralized environment, no arbiter can facilitate and\nattest to data exchanges. Simple peer-to-peer sharing of data, conversely,\nlacks the required non-repudiation. (2) With data governed by privacy\nlegislation such as the GDPR, the core advantage of immutability becomes a\nliability.

Its one-time pseudonym generation algorithm guarantees\nunlinkability and enables proof of ownership, which allows data subjects to\nexercise their legal rights regarding their personal data.

In gravity and\nfield theories, particular attention has been paid to Weyl (or conformal)\nsymmetry.

Here, we\ninvestigate the implications of pure disformal symmetry in the Universe. We\nderive the form of general disformal invariant tensors from which we build the\nmost general disformal invariant action. We argue that, in cosmology, disformal\nsymmetry amounts to require that the lapse function is fully replaced by a\n(time-like) scalar field at the level of the action. We then show that\ndisformal symmetry is in general an exactly equivalent formulation of general\nmimetic gravity.

Its accuracy critically\ndepends on the employed kinetic energy (KE) density functional, which has to be\nsupplied as an external input. In this work, we use an external harmonic\nperturbation in OF-DFT to compute the density response function. This allows us\nto test whether exact conditions in the limit of uniform densities (i.e. for\nthe uniform electron gas, or UEG) are satisfied. We demonstrate the utility of\nthis direct perturbation approach by considering different non-local and\nLaplacian-level KE functionals. The results illustrate that several functionals\nviolate exact conditions in the UEG limit. Additionally, we also test KE\nfunctional approximations beyond the linear density response regime by\ngradually increasing the density perturbation amplitude and comparing against\nKohn-Sham DFT results which employ the exact non-interacting KE functional. The\nresults show a strong correlation between the accuracy of the KE functionals in\nthe UEG limit and in the strongly inhomogeneous case.

Since the number of\ncoarse-grained \"granular-ball\" is smaller than the number of sample points,\ngranular-ball computing is more efficient; the coarse-grained characteristics\nof granular-balls are less likely to be affected by fine-grained sample points,\nmaking them more robust; the multi-granularity structure of granular-balls can\nproduce topological structures and coarse-grained descriptions, providing\nnatural interpretability.

We propose a novel library in the Python\nframework, called PyLogik, to help alleviate this issue for ultrasound images,\nwhich are particularly challenging because of the frequent inclusion of PHI\ndirectly on the images. PyLogik processes the image volumes through a series of\ntext detection/extraction, filtering, thresholding, morphological and contour\ncomparisons. This methodology de-identifies the images, reduces file sizes, and\nprepares image volumes for applications in deep learning and data sharing. To\nevaluate its effectiveness in processing ultrasound data, a random sample of 50\ncardiac ultrasounds (echocardiograms) were processed through PyLogik, and the\noutputs were compared with the manual segmentations by an expert user. The Dice\ncoefficient of the two approaches achieved an average value of 0.976. Next, an\ninvestigation was conducted to ascertain the degree of information compression\nachieved using the algorithm.

The V-chopper method generates a series of time-delayed images\nbetween excitation pulses and smartphone gating so that the luminescence\nlifetime can be measured at each pixel using a relatively low acquisition frame\nrate (e.g., 30 fps) without the need for excitation synchronization. Europium\n(Eu) complex dyes with different luminescent lifetimes ranging from\nmicroseconds to seconds were used to demonstrate and evaluate the principle of\nV-chopper on a 3D-printed smartphone microscopy platform. A convolutional\nneural network (CNN) model was developed to automatically distinguish the gated\nimages in different decay cycles with an accuracy of >99.5%. The current\nsmartphone V-chopper system can detect lifetime down to ~75 microseconds\nutilizing the default phase shift between the smartphone video rate and\nexcitation pulses and in principle can detect much shorter lifetimes by\naccurately programming the time delay.

As technology improves, new attacks have been developed by\nhackers. Traditional statistical and shallow machine learning techniques can\ndetect superficial anomalies based on shallow data and feature selection,\nhowever, these approaches cannot detect unseen DDoS attacks. In this context,\nwe propose a reconstruction-based anomaly detection model named\nLSTM-Autoencoder (LSTM-AE) which combines two deep learning-based models for\ndetecting DDoS attack anomalies.

Autoencoders\nare used to identify the optimal threshold based on the reconstruction error\nrates evaluated on each sample across all time-series sequences. As such, a\ncombination model LSTM-AE can not only learn delicate sub-pattern differences\nin attacks and benign traffic flows, but also minimize reconstructed benign\ntraffic to obtain a lower range reconstruction error, with attacks presenting a\nlarger reconstruction error. In this research, we trained and evaluated our\nproposed LSTM-AE model on reflection-based DDoS attacks (DNS, LDAP, and SNMP).\nThe results of our experiments demonstrate that our method performs better than\nother state-of-the-art methods, especially for LDAP attacks, with an accuracy\nof over 99.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 03:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

The specificity of an antibody is determined by\nits complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which are located in the\nvariable domains of the antibody chains and form the antigen-binding site.\nPrevious studies have utilized complex techniques to generate CDRs, but they\nsuffer from inadequate geometric modeling. Moreover, the common iterative\nrefinement strategies lead to an inefficient inference. In this paper, we\npropose a \\textit{simple yet effective} model that can co-design 1D sequences\nand 3D structures of CDRs in a one-shot manner. To achieve this, we decouple\nthe antibody CDR design problem into two stages: (i) geometric modeling of\nprotein complex structures and (ii) sequence-structure co-learning. We develop\na novel macromolecular structure invariant embedding, typically for protein\ncomplexes, that captures both intra- and inter-component interactions among the\nbackbone atoms, including C$\\alpha$, N, C, and O atoms, to achieve\ncomprehensive geometric modeling. Then, we introduce a simple cross-gate MLP\nfor sequence-structure co-learning, allowing sequence and structure\nrepresentations to implicitly refine each other. This enables our model to\ndesign desired sequences and structures in a one-shot manner. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted to evaluate our results at both the sequence and\nstructure level, which demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance\ncompared to the state-of-the-art antibody CDR design methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 13:24:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 13:13:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 10:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}
