In case\nof a large discrepancy between the perceived motion signals and the optical\ncues, motion sickness may occur with the typical symptoms of nausea, dizziness,\nheadache and fatigue.

To\nachieve this, deep reinforcement learning (RL) is applied, where an agent\ninteracts with an environment formulated as a Markov decision process~(MDP).\nThis allows the agent to directly control a simulated MSP to obtain feedback on\nits performance in terms of platform workspace usage and the motion acting on\nthe simulator user.

Two\ncategories of inverse problems concerning a physical system are (1) estimate\nparameters in a model of the system from observed input-output pairs and (2)\ngiven a model of the system, reconstruct the input to it that caused some\nobserved output. Applied inverse problems are challenging because a solution\nmay (i) not exist, (ii) not be unique, or (iii) be sensitive to measurement\nnoise contaminating the data.\n  Bayesian statistical inversion (BSI) is an approach to tackle ill-posed\nand/or ill-conditioned inverse problems.

First, we use BSI to infer a parameter in a dynamic model of the\nlime temperature from measurements of the lime temperature over time. Second,\nwe use BSI to reconstruct the initial condition of the lime from a measurement\nof its temperature later in time.

Two of the most representative approaches are\nconnectionist temporal classification (CTC) and attention-based encoder-decoder\n(AED) models. Autoregressive transformers, variants of AED, adopt an\nautoregressive mechanism for token generation and thus are relatively slow\nduring inference. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of a CTC\nAlignment-based Single-Step Non-Autoregressive Transformer (CASS-NAT) for\nend-to-end ASR. In CASS-NAT, word embeddings in the autoregressive transformer\n(AT) are substituted with token-level acoustic embeddings (TAE) that are\nextracted from encoder outputs with the acoustical boundary information offered\nby the CTC alignment. TAE can be obtained in parallel, resulting in a parallel\ngeneration of output tokens. During training, Viterbi-alignment is used for TAE\ngeneration, and multiple training strategies are further explored to improve\nthe word error rate (WER) performance. During inference, an error-based\nalignment sampling method is investigated in depth to reduce the alignment\nmismatch in the training and testing processes. Experimental results show that\nthe CASS-NAT has a WER that is close to AT on various ASR tasks, while\nproviding a ~24x inference speedup. With and without self-supervised learning,\nwe achieve new state-of-the-art results for non-autoregressive models on\nseveral datasets. We also analyze the behavior of the CASS-NAT decoder to\nexplain why it can perform similarly to AT.

Carbon release from substantial permafrost\nstocks vulnerable to near-term warming represents a positive climate feedback\nthat may increase the risk of 1.5 C warming or greater. Methane (CH4) is a\nshort-lived but powerful greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 28.5\ntimes that of carbon dioxide (CO2) over a 100 year time span. Because\npermafrost thaw in the coming centuries is partly determined by the warming in\nthe 21st century, rapid reductions in methane emissions early in the 21st\ncentury could have far reaching effects. We use a reduced complexity carbon\ncycle model and a permafrost feedback module to explore the possibility that\naccelerating reductions in methane emissions could help avoid long-term warming\nby limiting permafrost melt. We simulate 3 extended Representative\nConcentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 6) through\nthe year 2300 and impose methane mitigation strategies where we reduce CH4\nemissions by 1%, 5% or 10% annually until the long-term scenario emission level\nis reached. We find that accelerated rates of methane mitigation do not\nsufficiently alter the global temperature anomaly to prevent or delay a\npermafrost feedback, nor do they result in meaningful long term reductions in\ntemperatures. We find that the long-term magnitude of methane mitigation (i.e.,\nlong-term emission level) and not the rate of reduction, corresponds to\nlong-term temperature change. Therefore, policy and mitigation efforts should\nemphasize durable decreases in methane emissions over rapidity of\nimplementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2023 19:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Here we present this\nframework in the language of string diagrams, interpreted formally using\ncategory theory. A class of string diagrams, called network diagrams, are in\n1-to-1 correspondence with directed acyclic graphs. A causal model is given by\nsuch a diagram with its components interpreted as stochastic maps, functions,\nor general channels in a symmetric monoidal category with a 'copy-discard'\nstructure (cd-category), turning a model into a single mathematical object that\ncan be reasoned with intuitively and yet rigorously. Building on prior works by\nFong and Jacobs, Kissinger and Zanasi, as well as Fritz and Klingler, we\npresent diagrammatic definitions of causal models and functional causal models\nin a cd-category, generalising causal Bayesian networks and structural causal\nmodels, respectively. We formalise general interventions on a model, including\nbut beyond do-interventions, and present the natural notion of an open causal\nmodel with inputs. We also give an approach to conditioning based on a\nnormalisation box, allowing for causal inference calculations to be done fully\ndiagrammatically.

It is known that, under successive\ncancellation decoder, some rows are Pareto-better than the other. For instance,\nwhenever a user sees a substring $01$ in the binary expansion of a row index\nand replaces it with $10$, the user obtains a row index that is always more\nwelcomed. We call this a \"rule\" and denote it by $10 \\succcurlyeq 01$.

However, most methods do not have a uniform expressiveness\nmeasure except for a few that strictly follow the $k$-dimensional\nWeisfeiler-Lehman ($k$-WL) test hierarchy. Their theoretical analyses are often\nlimited to distinguishing certain families of non-isomorphic graphs, leading to\ndifficulties in quantitatively comparing their expressiveness. In contrast to\ntheoretical analysis, another way to measure expressiveness is by evaluating\nmodel performance on certain datasets containing 1-WL-indistinguishable graphs.\nPrevious datasets specifically designed for this purpose, however, face\nproblems with difficulty (any model surpassing 1-WL has nearly 100% accuracy),\ngranularity (models tend to be either 100% correct or near random guess), and\nscale (only a few essentially different graphs in each dataset). To address\nthese limitations, we propose a new expressiveness dataset, $\\textbf{BREC}$,\nwhich includes 400 pairs of non-isomorphic graphs carefully selected from four\nprimary categories (Basic, Regular, Extension, and CFI). These graphs have\nhigher difficulty (up to 4-WL-indistinguishable), finer granularity (able to\ncompare models between 1-WL and 3-WL), and a larger scale (400 pairs). Further,\nwe synthetically test 16 models with higher-than-1-WL expressiveness on our\nBREC dataset. Our experiment gives the first thorough comparison of the\nexpressiveness of those state-of-the-art beyond-1-WL GNN models. We expect this\ndataset to serve as a benchmark for testing the expressiveness of future GNNs.\nOur dataset and evaluation code are released at:\nhttps://github.com/GraphPKU/BREC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 05:53:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 10:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Since only new class samples\nare available for optimization, it often occurs catastrophic forgetting of old\nknowledge. To alleviate this problem, many new methods are proposed such as\nmodel distillation, class augmentation. In this paper, we propose an effective\nnon-exemplar method called RAMF consisting of Random Auxiliary classes\naugmentation and Mixed Feature. On the one hand, we design a novel random\nauxiliary classes augmentation method, where one augmentation is randomly\nselected from three augmentations and applied on the input to generate\naugmented samples and extra class labels. By extending data and label space, it\nallows the model to learn more diverse representations, which can prevent the\nmodel from being biased towards learning task-specific features. When learning\nnew tasks, it will reduce the change of feature space and improve model\ngeneralization. On the other hand, we employ mixed feature to replace the new\nfeatures since only using new feature to optimize the model will affect the\nrepresentation that was previously embedded in the feature space. Instead, by\nmixing new and old features, old knowledge can be retained without increasing\nthe computational complexity.

In the one-dimensional Hermitian Anderson model with\nuncorrelated diagonal disorder, there is a one-to-one correspondence between\ndynamical localization and spectral localization, i.e. the exponential\nlocalization of all the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions. This correspondence can be\nbroken when dealing with disordered dissipative lattices. Recently, it has been\nshown that when the system exchanges particles with the surrounding environment\nand random fluctuations of the dissipation are introduced, spectral\nlocalization is observed but without dynamical localization. Such previous\nstudies considered lattices with mixed conservative (Hamiltonian) and\ndissipative dynamics, and were restricted to a semiclassical analysis. However,\nAnderson localization in purely dissipative lattices, displaying an entirely\nLindbladian dynamics, remains largely unexplored. Here we consider the\npurely-dissipative Anderson model in the framework of a Lindblad master\nequation and show that, akin to the semiclassical models with conservative\nhopping and random dissipation, one observes dynamical delocalization in spite\nof strong spectral localization of all eigenstates of the Liouvillian\nsuperoperator.

However, the question of \\textit{how to perform fusion among\ndifferent modalities in a supervised sensor fusion odometry estimation task?}\nis still one of challenging issues remains. Some simple operations, such as\nelement-wise summation and concatenation, are not capable of assigning adaptive\nattentional weights to incorporate different modalities efficiently, which make\nit difficult to achieve competitive odometry results. Recently, the Transformer\narchitecture has shown potential for multi-modal fusion tasks, particularly in\nthe domains of vision with language.

Additionally, to interpret the learning\nprocess of the Transformer-based multi-modal interactions, a general\nvisualization approach is introduced to illustrate the interactions between\nmodalities. Moreover, exhaustive ablation studies evaluate different\nmulti-modal fusion strategies to verify the performance of the proposed fusion\nstrategy. A synthetic multi-modal dataset is made public to validate the\ngeneralization ability of the proposed fusion strategy, which also works for\nother combinations of different modalities.

This study aims to identify hindering factors that prevent\nindividuals from effectively sharing and managing knowledge and understand how\nto eliminate these factors. Empirical data were collected through\nsemi-structured group interviews from 50 individuals working in an\ninternational large IT organization. This study confirms the existence of a gap\nbetween the perceived importance of knowledge management and how little this\nimportance is reflected in practice. Several hindering factors were identified,\ngrouped into personal social topics, organizational social topics, technical\ntopics, environmental topics, and interrelated social and technical topics. The\npresented recommendations for mitigating these hindering factors are focused on\nimproving employees' actions, such as offering training and guidelines to\nfollow. The findings of this study have implications for organizations in\nknowledge-intensive fields, as they can use this knowledge to create knowledge\nsharing and management strategies to improve their overall performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 09:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Existing ML approaches for automated crater detection\nhave been trained in specific types of data e.g. digital elevation model (DEM),\nimages and associated metadata for orbiters such as the Lunar Reconnaissance\nOrbiter Camera (LROC) etc..

However, it is always hard to understand and retrieve\nknowledge from unstructured text, which is usually in the form of compound and\ncomplex sentences. There are state-of-the-art neural network-based methods to\nsimplify the sentences for improved readability while replacing words with\nplain English substitutes and summarising the sentences and paragraphs. In the\nKnowledge Graph (KG) creation process from unstructured text, summarising long\nsentences and substituting words is undesirable since this may lead to\ninformation loss. However, KG creation from text requires the extraction of all\npossible facts (triples) with the same mentions as in the text. In this work,\nwe propose a controlled simplification based on the factual information in a\nsentence, i.e., triple. We present a classical syntactic dependency-based\napproach to split and rephrase a compound and complex sentence into a set of\nsimplified sentences. This simplification process will retain the original\nwording with a simple structure of possible domain facts in each sentence,\ni.e., triples. The paper also introduces an algorithm to identify and measure a\nsentence's syntactic complexity (SC), followed by reduction through a\ncontrolled syntactic simplification process. Last, an experiment for a dataset\nre-annotation is also conducted through GPT3; we aim to publish this refined\ncorpus as a resource.

However, such\nsemantic consistency from the synchronization is hard to guarantee in\nunconstrained videos, due to the irrelevant modality noise and differentiated\nsemantic correlation. To this end, we first propose a \\textit{Modality Noise\nFilter} (MNF) module to erase the irrelevant noise in teacher modality with\ncross-modal context. After this purification, we then design a\n\\textit{Contrastive Semantic Calibration} (CSC) module to adaptively distill\nuseful knowledge for target modality, by referring to the differentiated\nsample-wise semantic correlation in a contrastive fashion. Extensive\nexperiments show that our method could bring a performance boost compared with\nother distillation methods in both visual action recognition and video\nretrieval task.

Although the\ndigitalization progress of the media brings many advantages, it also increases\nthe risk of spreading disinformation, misinformation, and malformation through\nthe use of fake news. The emergence of this harmful phenomenon has managed to\npolarize society and manipulate public opinion on particular topics, e.g.,\nelections, vaccinations, etc. Such information propagated on social media can\ndistort public perceptions and generate social unrest while lacking the rigor\nof traditional journalism. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning\ntechniques are essential for developing efficient tools that can detect fake\nnews. Models that use the context of textual data are essential for resolving\nthe fake news detection problem, as they manage to encode linguistic features\nwithin the vector representation of words. In this paper, we propose a new\napproach that uses document embeddings to build multiple models that accurately\nlabel news articles as reliable or fake. We also present a benchmark on\ndifferent architectures that detect fake news using binary or multi-labeled\nclassification. We evaluated the models on five large news corpora using\naccuracy, precision, and recall. We obtained better results than more complex\nstate-of-the-art Deep Neural Network models.

EoE is a top cause of chronic dysphagia after GERD. Diagnosis of\nEoE relies on counting eosinophils in histological slides, a manual and\ntime-consuming task that limits the ability to extract complex\npatient-dependent features.

The metastable He line in the near-infrared at $1.083$ $\\mu$m\nis a reliable tracer of atmospheric escape in hot exoplanets, with the\nadvantage of being observable from the ground. However, observing escaping He\nin sub-Jovian planets has remained challenging due to the systematic effects\nand telluric contamination present in ground-based data. With the successful\nlaunch and operations of JWST, we now have access to extremely stable\nhigh-precision near-infrared spectrographs in space. Here we predict the\nobservability of metastable He with JWST in two representative and previously\nwell-studied warm Neptunes, GJ 436 b ($T_{\\rm eq} = 687~{\\rm K}$, $R_{\\rm p} =\n0.37~{\\rm R_J}$) and GJ 1214 b ($T_{\\rm eq} = 588~{\\rm K}$, $R_{\\rm p} =\n0.25~{\\rm R_J}$). Our simulated JWST observations for GJ 436 b demonstrate that\na single transit with NIRSpec/G140H is sensitive to mass loss rates that are\ntwo orders of magnitude lower than what is detectable from the ground. Our\nexercise for GJ 1214 b show that the best configuration to observe the\nrelatively weak outflows of warm Neptunes with JWST is with NIRSpec/G140H, and\nthat NIRSpec/G140M and NIRISS/SOSS are less optimal. Since none of these\ninstrument configurations can spectrally resolve the planetary absorption, we\nconclude that the 1D isothermal Parker-wind approximation may not be sufficient\nfor interpreting such observations.

Velocity disequilibrium\nis closed with the diffusion laws and only one mass weighted velocity is\nretained formally. Thus, the complex wave structure of the original\nBaer-Nunziato model is simplified to a large extent and the obtained model is\nmuch more computationally affordable. Moreover, the capability to deal with\nfinite temperature relaxation is kept. Efficient numerical methods for solving\nthe proposed model are aslo presented. Equipped with the proposed model and\nnumerical methods, we further investigate the impact of the thermal relaxation\non the RT instability development at the inertial confinement fusion (ICF)\ndeceleration stage. On the basis of numerical simulations, we have found that\nfor the RT instability at an interface between the high-density low-temperature\ncomponent and the low-density high-temperature component, the thermal\nrelaxation significantly suppress the development of the instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 14:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

In this contribution, we show how\nthe presence of these poles can be determined from lattice QCD results for the\npropagators and vertices. The crucial observation that allows this\ndetermination is that the Schwinger mechanism poles induce modifications,\ncalled ``displacements'', to the Ward identities (WIs) relating two- and\nthree-point functions. Importantly, the displacement functions correspond\nprecisely to the Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes of the massless bound-states. We\napply this idea to the case of the three-gluon vertex in pure Yang-Mills SU(3).\nUsing lattice results in the corresponding WI, we find an unequivocal\ndisplacement and show that it is consistent with the prediction based on the\nBethe-Salpeter equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2023 14:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

This is due to difficulties in reconciling privacy-preserving\nand Byzantine-resilient algorithms.\n  In this work, we propose a solution to such a two-fold issue. We use our\nversion of differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD)\nalgorithm to preserve privacy and then apply our Byzantine-resilient\nalgorithms. We note that while existing works follow this general approach, an\nin-depth analysis on the interplay between DP and Byzantine resilience has been\nignored, leading to unsatisfactory performance. Specifically, for the random\nnoise introduced by DP, previous works strive to reduce its impact on the\nByzantine aggregation. In contrast, we leverage the random noise to construct\nan aggregation that effectively rejects many existing Byzantine attacks.\n  We provide both theoretical proof and empirical experiments to show our\nprotocol is effective: retaining high accuracy while preserving the DP\nguarantee and Byzantine resilience.

Combining the physical\nprinciples of the imaging system with the advantages of data-driven deep\nlearning networks, physics-embedded deep unrolling networks have recently\nemerged as a promising solution in computational imaging. However, the inherent\nnonlinear and ill-posed properties of EIT image reconstruction still present\nchallenges to existing methods in terms of accuracy and stability. To tackle\nthis challenge, we propose the learned half-quadratic splitting (HQSNet)\nalgorithm for incorporating physics into learning-based EIT imaging.
