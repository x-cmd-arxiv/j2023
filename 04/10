Furthermore,\nostensibly for programmer convenience, their behavior in R is a notable\nextension over the corresponding operations in mathematics, thereby offering\nsome challenges for specification and static verification.\n  We report on progress towards statically typing this aspect of the R\nlanguage. The interesting aspects of typing, in this case, warn programmers\nabout violating bounds, so the types must necessarily be dependent. We explain\nthe ways in which R extends standard mathematical behavior. We then show how\nR's behavior can be specified in LiquidHaskell, a dependently-typed extension\nto Haskell. In the general case, actually verifying library and client code is\ncurrently beyond LiquidHaskell's reach; therefore, this work provides\nchallenges and opportunities both for typing R and for progress in\ndependently-typed programming languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2023 16:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

Of the camera-based sensors\nthat do have all-around, curved sensing surfaces, many cannot provide 3D depth\nmaps; those that do often require optical designs specified to a particular\nsensor geometry.

Most ``fixed order''\nlearning dynamics restrict an agent's underlying state to be its own strategy.\nIn ``higher order'' learning, agent dynamics can include auxiliary states that\ncan capture phenomena such as path dependencies. We introduce higher-order\ngradient play dynamics that resemble projected gradient ascent with auxiliary\nstates. The dynamics are ``payoff based'' in that each agent's dynamics depend\non its own evolving payoff. While these payoffs depend on the strategies of\nother agents in a game setting, agent dynamics do not depend explicitly on the\nnature of the game or the strategies of other agents. In this sense, dynamics\nare ``uncoupled'' since an agent's dynamics do not depend explicitly on the\nutility functions of other agents. We first show that for any specific game\nwith an isolated completely mixed-strategy NE, there exist higher-order\ngradient play dynamics that lead (locally) to that NE, both for the specific\ngame and nearby games with perturbed utility functions. Conversely, we show\nthat for any higher-order gradient play dynamics, there exists a game with a\nunique isolated completely mixed-strategy NE for which the dynamics do not lead\nto NE. These results build on prior work that showed that uncoupled fixed-order\nlearning cannot lead to NE in certain instances, whereas higher-order variants\ncan. Finally, we consider the mixed-strategy equilibrium associated with\ncoordination games. While higher-order gradient play can converge to such\nequilibria, we show such dynamics must be inherently internally unstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2023 17:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 19:24:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 00:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

The\ninvention and development of many kinds of spectrometers have equipped us with\nversatile yet ultra-sensitive diagnostic tools for trace gas detection, isotope\nanalysis, and resolving hyperfine structures of atoms and molecules. With\nproliferating data and information, urgent and demanding requirements have been\nplaced today on spectrum analysis with ever-increasing spectral bandwidth and\nfrequency resolution. These requirements are especially stringent for broadband\nlaser sources that carry massive information, and for dispersive devices used\nin information processing systems.

Here\nwe demonstrate a novel vector spectrum analyzer (VSA) that is capable to\ncharacterize passive devices and active laser sources in one setup.

To verify the contribution of the\ncollapsible wings to the flying fish motion pattern, we have designed a novel\nbio-robot with collapsible wings inspired by the flying fish. The bionic\nprototype has been successfully designed and fabricated, incorporating\ncollapsible wings with soft hydraulic actuators, an innovative application of\nsoft actuators to a micro aquatic-aerial robot. We have analyzed and built a\nprecise model of dynamics for control, and tested both the soft hydraulic\nactuators and detailed aerodynamic coefficients. To further verify the\nfeasibility of collapsible wings, we conducted simulations in different\nsituations such as discharge angles, the area of collapsible wings, and the\nadvantages of using ground effect. The results confirm the control of the\ncollapsible wings and demonstrate the unique multi-modal motion pattern between\nwater and air.

However, the theoretical understanding of when and why\noverparameterized models such as DNNs can generalize well in meta-learning is\nstill limited. As an initial step towards addressing this challenge, this paper\nstudies the generalization performance of overfitted meta-learning under a\nlinear regression model with Gaussian features. In contrast to a few recent\nstudies along the same line, our framework allows the number of model\nparameters to be arbitrarily larger than the number of features in the ground\ntruth signal, and hence naturally captures the overparameterized regime in\npractical deep meta-learning. We show that the overfitted min $\\ell_2$-norm\nsolution of model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) can be beneficial, which is\nsimilar to the recent remarkable findings on ``benign overfitting'' and\n``double descent'' phenomenon in the classical (single-task) linear regression.\nHowever, due to the uniqueness of meta-learning such as task-specific gradient\ndescent inner training and the diversity/fluctuation of the ground-truth\nsignals among training tasks, we find new and interesting properties that do\nnot exist in single-task linear regression. We first provide a high-probability\nupper bound (under reasonable tightness) on the generalization error, where\ncertain terms decrease when the number of features increases. Our analysis\nsuggests that benign overfitting is more significant and easier to observe when\nthe noise and the diversity/fluctuation of the ground truth of each training\ntask are large.

This allows for the use of\nlarge datasets, as well as the ability to train with a wide variety of data\nsources. However, one of the key challenges with decentralized learning is\nheterogeneity in the data distribution across the nodes. In this paper, we\npropose In-Distribution Knowledge Distillation (IDKD) to address the challenge\nof heterogeneous data distribution. The goal of IDKD is to homogenize the data\ndistribution across the nodes. While such data homogenization can be achieved\nby exchanging data among the nodes sacrificing privacy, IDKD achieves the same\nobjective using a common public dataset across nodes without breaking the\nprivacy constraint. This public dataset is different from the training dataset\nand is used to distill the knowledge from each node and communicate it to its\nneighbors through the generated labels. With traditional knowledge\ndistillation, the generalization of the distilled model is reduced because all\nthe public dataset samples are used irrespective of their similarity to the\nlocal dataset. Thus, we introduce an Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detector at each\nnode to label a subset of the public dataset that maps close to the local\ntraining data distribution. Finally, only labels corresponding to these subsets\nare exchanged among the nodes and with appropriate label averaging each node is\nfinetuned on these data subsets along with its local data. Our experiments on\nmultiple image classification datasets and graph topologies show that the\nproposed IDKD scheme is more effective than traditional knowledge distillation\nand achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on heterogeneously\ndistributed data with minimal communication overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2023 23:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

A novel policy is proposed to characterize the optimal regret tail\nprobability for any regret threshold. Concretely, for any given $\\alpha\\in[1/2,\n1)$ and $\\beta\\in[0, \\alpha]$, our policy achieves a worst-case expected regret\nof $\\tilde O(T^\\alpha)$ (we call it $\\alpha$-optimal) and an instance-dependent\nexpected regret of $\\tilde O(T^\\beta)$ (we call it $\\beta$-consistent), while\nenjoys a probability of incurring an $\\tilde O(T^\\delta)$ regret\n($\\delta\\geq\\alpha$ in the worst-case scenario and $\\delta\\geq\\beta$ in the\ninstance-dependent scenario) that decays exponentially with a polynomial $T$\nterm.

These approaches require\nmanual labels and suffer from performance bottlenecks due to error propagation\nacross the multi-stage flow of information. The large size of object detection\nneural networks also makes prior solutions infeasible for real-time deployment\nin resource-constrained devices. We present an end-to-end deep reinforcement\nlearning (RL) solution called Eagle to train a neural network policy that\ndirectly takes images as input to control the PTZ camera. Training\nreinforcement learning is cumbersome in the real world due to labeling effort,\nruntime environment stochasticity, and fragile experimental setups. We\nintroduce a photo-realistic simulation framework for training and evaluation of\nPTZ camera control policies. Eagle achieves superior camera control performance\nby maintaining the object of interest close to the center of captured images at\nhigh resolution and has up to 17% more tracking duration than the\nstate-of-the-art. Eagle policies are lightweight (90x fewer parameters than\nYolo5s) and can run on embedded camera platforms such as Raspberry PI (33 FPS)\nand Jetson Nano (38 FPS), facilitating real-time PTZ tracking for\nresource-constrained environments. With domain randomization, Eagle policies\ntrained in our simulator can be transferred directly to real-world scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 02:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

For\nnonparametric point identification of causal effects, the framework leverages a\npair of so-called treatment and outcome confounding proxy variables, in order\nto identify a bridge function that matches the dependence of potential outcomes\nor treatment variables on the hidden factors to corresponding functions of\nobserved proxies. Unique identification of a causal effect via a bridge\nfunction crucially requires that proxies are sufficiently relevant for hidden\nfactors, a requirement that has previously been formalized as a completeness\ncondition. However, completeness is well-known not to be empirically testable,\nand although a bridge function may be well-defined in a given setting, lack of\ncompleteness, sometimes manifested by availability of a single type of proxy,\nmay severely limit prospects for identification of a bridge function and thus a\ncausal effect; therefore, potentially restricting the application of the\nproximal causal framework. In this paper, we propose partial identification\nmethods that do not require completeness and obviate the need for\nidentification of a bridge function. That is, we establish that proxies of\nunobserved confounders can be leveraged to obtain bounds on the causal effect\nof the treatment on the outcome even if available information does not suffice\nto identify either a bridge function or a corresponding causal effect of\ninterest. We further establish analogous partial identification results in\nrelated settings where identification hinges upon hidden mediators for which\nproxies are available, however such proxies are not sufficiently rich for point\nidentification of a bridge function or a corresponding causal effect of\ninterest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 04:18:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 00:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Deploying the fiber in a\nhelically wound fashion has the promise of being more sensitive to broadside\nwaves (e.g. P-wave reflections) and less sensitive to surface waves than\nstraight fiber. We examine these claims by burying a set of straight fibers\n(SF) and helically wound fibers (HWF) with different wrapping angles, using\nstandard and engineered fibers. These fibers were buried in a 2 m deep trench\nin a farmland in the province of Groningen in the Netherlands. They are linked\nup to two interrogating systems and an electrically driven vibrator was used as\na seismic source. We observe in our field data that using HWF has a destructive\neffect on the surface-wave amplitudes. Our data confirmed the effect of the\nwrapping angle on the polarity of the surface-wave arrival and the dampening\neffect of the helical winding, both behaving in quite a predictable fashion.\nApart from the effect of the wrapping angle, the different design choices, e.g.\ncable filling and material type, did not show a significant effect on the\namplitude of the signals. As for P-wave reflections, we observe that both\nengineered SF and HWF provide reflection images comparable to those obtained\nfrom the geophone data despite the straight fiber's decreased broadside\nsensitivity. A polarity reversal and an amplitude difference between SF and HWF\nfibers are observed. Finally, we show that the combined use of SF and HWF\nproved to be useful since SF showed better sensitivity in the shallower part\nand HWF in the deeper part.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 04:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

To this end, we adopt a 3D\nproposal-based mask prediction network on the sampled volumetric features from\nNeRF, which generates discrete 3D instance masks.

Although significant progress\nhas been achieved by introducing extra information (e.g., human contour\nsketching information, human body keypoints, and 3D human information),\ncloth-changing person ReID is still challenging due to impressionable\npedestrian representations. Moreover, human semantic information and pedestrian\nidentity information are not fully explored. To solve these issues, we propose\na novel identity-guided collaborative learning scheme (IGCL) for cloth-changing\nperson ReID, where the human semantic is fully utilized and the identity is\nunchangeable to guide collaborative learning. First, we design a novel clothing\nattention degradation stream to reasonably reduce the interference caused by\nclothing information where clothing attention and mid-level collaborative\nlearning are employed. Second, we propose a human semantic attention and body\njigsaw stream to highlight the human semantic information and simulate\ndifferent poses of the same identity. In this way, the extraction features not\nonly focus on human semantic information that is unrelated to the background\nbut also are suitable for pedestrian pose variations. Moreover, a pedestrian\nidentity enhancement stream is further proposed to enhance the identity\nimportance and extract more favorable identity robust features. Most\nimportantly, all these streams are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified\nframework, and the identity is utilized to guide the optimization.

Numerous works\nhave introduced Machine Learning (ML) techniques to cost modeling, cardinality\nestimation, and end-to-end learned optimizer, but few of them are proven\npractical due to long training time, lack of interpretability, and integration\ncost. A recent study provides a practical method to optimize queries by\nrecommending per-query hints but it suffers from two inherited problems.

Specifically,\nfor unconditional mean estimation, we leverage the negative correlation between\ntwo frequencies in each dimension and propose the CoCo mechanism, which further\nreduces estimation errors for mean values compared to Collision. Moreover, to\nsurpass the error barrier in local privacy, we examine privacy amplification in\nthe shuffle model for the proposed mechanisms and derive precisely tight\namplification bounds. Our experiments validate and compare our mechanisms with\nexisting approaches, demonstrating significant error reductions for frequency\nestimation and mean estimation on numerical vectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 06:44:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

This can be a\nsignificant limitation for many popular methods based on polytopal meshes in\nthe case of inhomogeneous media, as the discontinuity of electromagnetic\nparameters can lead to quite low regularity of solutions near media interfaces,\nand potentially worsened by geometric singularities, making many popular\nmethods based on broken spaces, non-conforming or polytopal meshes particularly\nchallenging to apply.

However, traditional high-resolution SAR imaging\nalgorithms face several challenges. Firstly, these algorithms tend to focus on\nlocal information, neglecting non-local information between different pixel\npatches. Secondly, speckle is more pronounced and difficult to filter out in\nhigh-resolution SAR images. Thirdly, the process of high-resolution SAR imaging\ngenerally involves high time and computational complexity, making real-time\nimaging difficult to achieve. To address these issues, we propose a Superpixel\nHigh-Resolution SAR Imaging Network (SPHR-SAR-Net) for rapid despeckling in\nhigh-resolution SAR mode. Based on the concept of superpixel techniques, we\ninitially combine non-convex and non-local total variation as compound\nregularization. This approach more effectively despeckles and manages the\nrelationship between pixels while reducing bias effects caused by convex\nconstraints. Subsequently, we solve the compound regularization model using the\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm and unfold it into\na Deep Unfolded Network (DUN). The network's parameters are adaptively learned\nin a data-driven manner, and the learned network significantly increases\nimaging speed.

The accuracy and diversity of segmentation\nmasks are both crucial for providing valuable references to radiologists in\nclinical practice. While existing diffusion models have shown strong capacities\nin various visual generation tasks, it is still challenging to deal with\ndiscrete masks in segmentation. To achieve accurate and diverse medical image\nsegmentation masks, we propose a novel conditional Bernoulli Diffusion model\nfor medical image segmentation (BerDiff). Instead of using the Gaussian noise,\nwe first propose to use the Bernoulli noise as the diffusion kernel to enhance\nthe capacity of the diffusion model for binary segmentation tasks, resulting in\nmore accurate segmentation masks. Second, by leveraging the stochastic nature\nof the diffusion model, our BerDiff randomly samples the initial Bernoulli\nnoise and intermediate latent variables multiple times to produce a range of\ndiverse segmentation masks, which can highlight salient regions of interest\nthat can serve as valuable references for radiologists. In addition, our\nBerDiff can efficiently sample sub-sequences from the overall trajectory of the\nreverse diffusion, thereby speeding up the segmentation process. Extensive\nexperimental results on two medical image segmentation datasets with different\nmodalities demonstrate that our BerDiff outperforms other recently published\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Experiments on our generated Fluid Fall datasets and\nDPI Dam Break dataset are conducted to demonstrate both effectiveness and\ngeneralization ability of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 08:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

Therefore, we seek to\nprobe the target logits to extract the primary knowledge related to face\nidentity, and discard the others, to make the distillation more achievable for\nthe student network.

To exploit the enormous potential of EHR data,\na popular EHR data analysis paradigm in machine learning is EHR representation\nlearning, which first leverages the individual patient's EHR data to learn\ninformative representations by a backbone, and supports diverse health-care\ndownstream tasks grounded on the representations. Unfortunately, such a\nparadigm fails to access the in-depth analysis of patients' relevance, which is\ngenerally known as cohort studies in clinical practice. Specifically, patients\nin the same cohort tend to share similar characteristics, implying their\nresemblance in medical conditions such as symptoms or diseases.

In particular, CORE first develops an explicit patient modeling task\nbased on the prior knowledge of patients' diagnosis codes, which measures the\nlatent relevance among patients to adaptively divide the cohorts for each\npatient. Based on the constructed cohorts, CORE recodes the pre-extracted EHR\ndata representation from intra- and inter-cohort perspectives, yielding\naugmented EHR data representation learning. CORE is readily applicable to\ndiverse backbone models, serving as a universal plug-in framework to infuse\ncohort information into healthcare methods for boosted performance.

Recent\nstudies suggest that test-time training (TTT), which adapts the learned model\nwith test data, might be a promising solution to the problem. Generally, a TTT\nstrategy hinges its performance on two main factors: selecting an appropriate\nauxiliary TTT task for updating and identifying reliable parameters to update\nduring the test phase. Both previous arts and our experiments indicate that TTT\nmay not improve but be detrimental to the learned model if those two factors\nare not properly considered. This work addresses those two factors by proposing\nan Improved Test-Time Adaptation (ITTA) method. First, instead of heuristically\ndefining an auxiliary objective, we propose a learnable consistency loss for\nthe TTT task, which contains learnable parameters that can be adjusted toward\nbetter alignment between our TTT task and the main prediction task. Second, we\nintroduce additional adaptive parameters for the trained model, and we suggest\nonly updating the adaptive parameters during the test phase.

In this paper,\nwe first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as\nwell as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual\nrecognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1\nto 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp).

Second, we test to what\nextent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information\nin the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition\nmodels to images with compression artefacts.

Despite the large neutrino luminosity expected in ULX pulsars,\nthe neutrino energy flux from the Be X-ray transients of our Galaxy, SMC and\nLMC is dominant. However, the neutrino flux from the brightest X-ray transients\nis estimated to be below the isotropic background by two orders of magnitude at\nleast, which makes impossible direct registration of neutrino emission from\naccreting strongly magnetised neutron stars nowadays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 11:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

We consider the age of collection (AoC)\nperformance as a measure of information freshness. Unlike the conventional age\nof information (AoI) metric, the instantaneous AoC decreases only when all\ncooperative packets for a common observation are successfully received. Hence,\neffectively allocating wireless time-frequency resources among IoT devices to\nachieve a low average AoC at the central receiver is paramount. Three multiple\naccess schemes are considered in this paper: time-division multiple access\n(TDMA) without retransmission, TDMA with retransmission, and frequency-division\nmultiple access (FDMA). First, our theoretical analysis indicates that TDMA\nwith retransmission outperforms the other two schemes in terms of average AoC.\nSubsequently, we implement information update systems based on the three\nschemes on software-defined radios.

However, existing\ngenerative models still suffer from the posterior collapse problem or the model\ncollapse problem, thus limiting their applications in sequential\nrecommendation. To tackle the challenges mentioned above, we leverage a new\nparadigm of the generative models, i.e., diffusion models, and present\nsequential recommendation with diffusion models (DiffRec), which can avoid the\nissues of VAE- and GAN-based models and show better performance. While\ndiffusion models are originally proposed to process continuous image data, we\ndesign an additional transition in the forward process together with a\ntransition in the reverse process to enable the processing of the discrete\nrecommendation data.

A canonical\napproach to this problem is to use synthetic data. That is, we replace the\ninput database R with a synthetic database R* that preserves the\ncharacteristics of R, and use R* to answer queries. Existing solutions for\nrelational data synthesis, however, either fail to provide strong privacy\nprotection, or assume that R contains a single relation. In addition, it is\nchallenging to extend the existing single-relation solutions to the case of\nmultiple relations, because they are unable to model the complex correlations\ninduced by the foreign keys. Therefore, multi-relational data synthesis with\nstrong privacy guarantees is an open problem. In this paper, we address the\nabove open problem by proposing PrivLava, the first solution for synthesizing\nrelational data with foreign keys under differential privacy, a rigorous\nprivacy framework widely adopted in both academia and industry. The key idea of\nPrivLava is to model the data distribution in R using graphical models, with\nlatent variables included to capture the inter-relational correlations caused\nby foreign keys.

These\nproperties will allow a test of classical theories of gravity in the\nstrong-field regime with gravitational-wave observation. Since black holes are\nnot in the exact vacuum environment in astrophysical situations, the following\nquestion arises: can the environment affect the tidal response?

In general, a predictive model cannot estimate the causal effect of a\nfeature on the outcome, i.e., how the outcome will change if the feature is\nchanged while keeping the values of other features unchanged. This is because\ncausal effect estimation requires interventional probabilities. However, many\nreal world problems such as personalised decision making, recommendation, and\nfairness computing, need to know the causal effect of any feature on the\noutcome for a given instance. This is different from the traditional causal\neffect estimation problem with a fixed treatment variable. This paper first\ntackles the challenge of estimating the causal effect of any feature (as the\ntreatment) on the outcome w.r.t. a given instance.

Although many deep learning models have been constructed\nfor this task, it remains challenging to train an OD/OC segmentation model that\ncould be deployed successfully to different healthcare centers. The\ndifficulties mainly comes from the domain shift issue, i.e., the fundus images\ncollected at these centers usually vary greatly in the tone, contrast, and\nbrightness. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method called Reconstruction-driven\nDynamic Refinement Network (RDR-Net), where we employ a due-path segmentation\nbackbone for simultaneous edge detection and region prediction and design three\nmodules to alleviate the domain gap. The reconstruction alignment (RA) module\nuses a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to reconstruct the input image and thus\nboosts the image representation ability of the network in a self-supervised\nway. It also uses a style-consistency constraint to force the network to retain\nmore domain-invariant information. The low-level feature refinement (LFR)\nmodule employs input-specific dynamic convolutions to suppress the\ndomain-variant information in the obtained low-level features. The\nprediction-map alignment (PMA) module elaborates the entropy-driven adversarial\nlearning to encourage the network to generate source-like boundaries and\nregions.

Considering\nthe high dimensionality and correlation of HSI, super-resolution (SR) of HSI\nremains a challenge in the absence of auxiliary high-resolution images.\nFurthermore, it is very important to extract the spatial features effectively\nand make full use of the spectral information. This paper proposes a novel HSI\nsuper-resolution algorithm, termed dual-domain network based on hybrid\nconvolution (SRDNet). Specifically, a dual-domain network is designed to fully\nexploit the spatial-spectral and frequency information among the hyper-spectral\ndata. To capture inter-spectral self-similarity, a self-attention learning\nmechanism (HSL) is devised in the spatial domain. Meanwhile the pyramid\nstructure is applied to increase the acceptance field of attention, which\nfurther reinforces the feature representation ability of the network. Moreover,\nto further improve the perceptual quality of HSI, a frequency loss(HFL) is\nintroduced to optimize the model in the frequency domain. The dynamic weighting\nmechanism drives the network to gradually refine the generated frequency and\nexcessive smoothing caused by spatial loss. Finally, In order to better fully\nobtain the mapping relationship between high-resolution space and\nlow-resolution space, a hybrid module of 2D and 3D units with progressive\nupsampling strategy is utilized in our method. Experiments on a widely used\nbenchmark dataset illustrate that the proposed SRDNet method enhances the\ntexture information of HSI and is superior to state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 13:51:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 01:59:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 03:02:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 04:04:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 08:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

Motivated by\nthis, we present a novel architecture for biomedical literature search, namely\nLog-Augmented DEnse Retrieval (LADER), which is a simple plug-in module that\naugments a dense retriever with the click logs retrieved from similar training\nqueries. Specifically, LADER finds both similar documents and queries to the\ngiven query by a dense retriever. Then, LADER scores relevant (clicked)\ndocuments of similar queries weighted by their similarity to the input query.\nThe final document scores by LADER are the average of (1) the document\nsimilarity scores from the dense retriever and (2) the aggregated document\nscores from the click logs of similar queries. Despite its simplicity, LADER\nachieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on TripClick, a recently\nreleased benchmark for biomedical literature retrieval. On the frequent (HEAD)\nqueries, LADER largely outperforms the best retrieval model by 39% relative\nNDCG@10 (0.338 v.s. 0.243).

Two types of rotational scanning are possible:\ntomographic and laminographic. For flat, extended samples, for which the full\n180 degree coverage is not possible, the latter is preferable because it\nprovides better coverage of the 3D spatial frequency domain compared to\nlimited-angle tomography.

In this study, we proposed a Heterogeneous Swin Transformer with\nMulti-Receptive Field (HST-MRF) model based on U-shaped networks for medical\nimage segmentation. The main purpose is to solve the problem of loss of\nstructural information caused by patch segmentation using transformer by fusing\npatch information under different receptive fields. The heterogeneous Swin\nTransformer (HST) is the core module, which achieves the interaction of\nmulti-receptive field patch information through heterogeneous attention and\npasses it to the next stage for progressive learning. We also designed a\ntwo-stage fusion module, multimodal bilinear pooling (MBP), to assist HST in\nfurther fusing multi-receptive field information and combining low-level and\nhigh-level semantic information for accurate localization of lesion regions. In\naddition, we developed adaptive patch embedding (APE) and soft channel\nattention (SCA) modules to retain more valuable information when acquiring\npatch embedding and filtering channel features, respectively, thereby improving\nmodel segmentation quality.

Recent progress\nin neural implicit representation has brought new opportunities to robotic\nmapping.

By regarding the neural feature volume as pose graph nodes and\nthe relative pose between volumes as pose graph edges, the entire neural\nfeature field becomes both locally rigid and globally elastic. Locally, the\nneural feature volume employs a sparse feature Octree and a small MLP to encode\nthe submap SDF with an option of semantics. Learning the map using this\nstructure allows for end-to-end solving of maximum a posteriori (MAP) based\nprobabilistic mapping. Globally, the map is built volume by volume\nindependently, avoiding catastrophic forgetting when mapping incrementally.\nFurthermore, when a loop closure occurs, with the elastic pose graph based\nrepresentation, only updating the origin of neural volumes is required without\nremapping. Finally, these functionalities of NF-Atlas are validated.

Using\nsatellite data, we track nascent, daytime convective clouds and quantify the\nunderlying antecedent (morning) surface heterogeneity. We find that convection\ninitiates preferentially on the dry side of strong SM/LST boundaries with\nspatial scales of tens of kilometers. The strongest alongwind gradients in LST\nanomalies at 30 km length scale underlying the CI location occur during weak\nbackground low-level wind (<2.5m/s), high convective available potential energy\n(>1500J/kg) and low convective inhibition (<250J/kg) over sparse vegetation. At\n100 km scale, strong gradients occur at the CI location during convectively\nunfavorable conditions and strong background flow.

The wind profile\nduring weak background flow inhibits propagation of convection away from the\ndry regions leading to negative SM-PPT feedback whereas strong background flow\nis related to longer lifecycle and rainfall hundreds of kilometers away from\nthe CI location.

However, the properties of spatial\nwaves have received less attention. This paper investigates the spatial waves\nformed by locally coupled oscillators arranged in an $n\\times n$ grid.\nNumerical simulations show that directional waves can form when the system\nexhibits heterogeneity, while spiral waves can arise in a homogeneous system.\nInterestingly, both wave patterns remain stable under minor noise disturbances.\nTo explain the properties of the spatial wave pattern, starting from the\nsimplest case of a $2\\times 2$ grid, we analytically calculate the phase\ndifferences between oscillators to discuss the formation of wave patterns in\nthe system. We then apply this method to compute the stable and saddle points\nand corresponding wave patterns of some $n\\times n$ grid cases and discuss\ntheir stability.

The compositional features that improve interfacial\ninteractions and mechanical properties can often impart electronic conductivity\nand redox activity to these polymers, which are generally seen as beneficial to\ncell performance. Alternatively, it is also possible that the addition of\ncharge-transferring centers to the electrode can accelerate cell degradation.\nHere, we use an aromatic polyimide (~320 mAh/g of reversible capacity) to\nexplore how a redox-active conductive polymer can affect cell performance. We\ndemonstrate that the lithiated polymer is less stable than the traditional\nbinders upon storage, leading to increased rates of calendar aging.\nFurthermore, we show that the adhesion properties of the polymer deteriorate\nupon repeated cycling, to an extent that is proportional to the degree of\ndelithiation of the binder. More critically, we show that progressive\ndegradation of the redox behavior of the polymer leads to the release of extra\nLi+ into the cell, which can give the false perception of good performance even\nunder conditions of poor stability. Our work suggests that redox-active\nconductive binders can sometimes be detrimental to cell performance, and that\nworks evaluating new polymers must include careful experimental validation\nunder realistic conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 15:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

One common\nway is to cast the trade-off problem as a multi-objective optimization problem,\ni.e., the goal is to minimize the utility loss and efficiency reduction while\nconstraining the privacy leakage not exceeding a predefined value.

SLR research\nhas taken advantage of recent advances in pose estimation models to use\nskeleton sequences estimated from videos instead of RGB information to predict\nsigns. This approach can make HAR-related tasks less complex and more robust to\ndiverse backgrounds, lightning conditions, and physical appearances. In this\nwork, we explore the use of a spatio-temporal skeleton representation such as\nTree Structure Skeleton Image (TSSI) as an alternative input to improve the\naccuracy of skeleton-based models for SLR. TSSI converts a skeleton sequence\ninto an RGB image where the columns represent the joints of the skeleton in a\ndepth-first tree traversal order, the rows represent the temporal evolution of\nthe joints, and the three channels represent the (x, y, z) coordinates of the\njoints. We trained a DenseNet-121 using this type of input and compared it with\nother skeleton-based deep learning methods using a large-scale American Sign\nLanguage (ASL) dataset, WLASL. Our model (SL-TSSI-DenseNet) overcomes the\nstate-of-the-art of other skeleton-based models. Moreover, when including data\naugmentation our proposal achieves better results than both skeleton-based and\nRGB-based models. We evaluated the effectiveness of our model on the Ankara\nUniversity Turkish Sign Language (TSL) dataset, AUTSL, and a Mexican Sign\nLanguage (LSM) dataset. On the AUTSL dataset, the model achieves similar\nresults to the state-of-the-art of other skeleton-based models. On the LSM\ndataset, the model achieves higher results than the baseline.

The\nquantification between fairness and privacy-aware models is still unclear and\nthere barely exists any defined sets of metrics for measuring fairness in the\nspatial-temporal context. In this work, we define a set of fairness metrics\ndesigned explicitly for human mobility, based on structural similarity and\nentropy of the trajectories. Under these definitions, we examine the fairness\nof two state-of-the-art privacy-preserving models that rely on GAN and\nrepresentation learning to reduce the re-identification rate of users for data\nsharing. Our results show that while both models guarantee group fairness in\nterms of demographic parity, they violate individual fairness criteria,\nindicating that users with highly similar trajectories receive disparate\nprivacy gain.
