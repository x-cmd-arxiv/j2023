But what are the real outcomes when\nthis trust is violated? Self-defense law provides a framework for analyzing\ntangible failure scenarios that can inform the design of robots and their\nalgorithms. Studying self-defense is particularly important for ground robots\nsince they operate within public human environments, where they can pose a\nlegitimate threat to human safety. Moreover, even if ground robots can\nguarantee human safety, the perception of a threat is enough to warrant human\nself-defense against robots. In this paper, we synthesize works in law,\nengineering, and the social sciences to present four actionable recommendations\nfor how the robotics community can craft robots to mitigate the likelihood of\nself-defense situations arising. We establish how current U.S. self-defense law\ncan justify a human protecting themselves against a robot, discuss the current\nliterature on human attitudes toward robots, and analyze methods that have been\nproduced to allow robots to operate close to humans. Finally, we present\nhypothetical scenarios that underscore how current robot navigation methods can\nfail to sufficiently consider self-defense concerns and the need for the\nrecommendations to guide improvements in the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 16:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

The system cost in\nour problem comprises the energy consumption and delay, and is non-convex with\nrespect to the optimization variables due to fractions in the mathematical\nexpressions. To solve the non-convex optimization, we develop a novel\nfractional programming technique, which contributes to optimization theory and\nhas broad applicability beyond our paper.

As a result, adaptive searching techniques have been proposed to\nefficiently explore and uncover failure trajectories of an autonomous policy in\nsimulation. Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) is one such method that poses the\nproblem of failure search as a Markov decision process and uses reinforcement\nlearning techniques to find high probability failures.

In\norder to successfully deploy autonomous agents, humans should not only be able\nto understand the individual limitations of the agents but also have insight on\nhow they compare against one another. To do so, we need effective methods for\ngenerating human interpretable agent behaviour summaries. Single agent\nbehaviour summarization has been tackled in the past through methods that\ngenerate explanations for why an agent chose to pick a particular action at a\nsingle timestep. However, for complex tasks, a per-action explanation may not\nbe able to convey an agents global strategy. As a result, researchers have\nlooked towards multi-timestep summaries which can better help humans assess an\nagents overall capability. More recently, multi-step summaries have also been\nused for generating contrasting examples to evaluate multiple agents. However,\npast approaches have largely relied on unstructured search methods to generate\nsummaries and require agents to have a discrete action space. In this paper we\npresent an adaptive search method for efficiently generating contrasting\nbehaviour summaries with support for continuous state and action spaces. We\nperform a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of the summaries for helping\nhumans discern the superior autonomous agent for a given task. Our results\nindicate that adaptive search can efficiently identify informative contrasting\nscenarios that enable humans to accurately select the better performing agent\nwith a limited observation time budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 18:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

It has been shown that optimizing quadratic costs subject to state and\ncontrol constraints can be reduced to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs)\nusing Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). One of the main challenges in this\nmethod is that the CBF-based QP could easily become infeasible under tight\ncontrol bounds, especially when the control bounds are time-varying. The\nrecently proposed adaptive CBFs have addressed such infeasibility issues, but\nrequire extensive and non-trivial hyperparameter tuning for the CBF-based QP\nand may introduce overshooting control near the boundaries of safe sets. To\naddress these issues, we propose a new type of adaptive CBFs called Auxiliary\nVariable CBFs (AVCBFs).

Recent APR work has been focused on leveraging modern Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to directly generate patches for APR. Such LLM-based APR\ntools work by first constructing an input prompt built using the original buggy\ncode and then queries the LLM to generate patches. While the LLM-based APR\ntools are able to achieve state-of-the-art results, it still follows the\nclassic Generate and Validate repair paradigm of first generating lots of\npatches and then validating each one afterwards. This not only leads to many\nrepeated patches that are incorrect but also miss the crucial information in\ntest failures as well as in plausible patches.\n  To address these limitations, we propose ChatRepair, the first fully\nautomated conversation-driven APR approach that interleaves patch generation\nwith instant feedback to perform APR in a conversational style. ChatRepair\nfirst feeds the LLM with relevant test failure information to start with, and\nthen learns from both failures and successes of earlier patching attempts of\nthe same bug for more powerful APR. For earlier patches that failed to pass all\ntests, we combine the incorrect patches with their corresponding relevant test\nfailure information to construct a new prompt for the LLM to generate the next\npatch. In this way, we can avoid making the same mistakes. For earlier patches\nthat passed all the tests, we further ask the LLM to generate alternative\nvariations of the original plausible patches. In this way, we can further build\non and learn from earlier successes to generate more plausible patches to\nincrease the chance of having correct patches. While our approach is general,\nwe implement ChatRepair using state-of-the-art dialogue-based LLM -- ChatGPT.\nBy calculating the cost of accessing ChatGPT, we can fix 162 out of 337 bugs\nfor \\$0.42 each!\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 20:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

However, learning such encoders\nwithout labels continues to be a challenging problem. While prior works have\nshown promising results by applying contrastive learning to pose sequences, the\nquality of the learned representations is often observed to be closely tied to\ndata augmentations that are used to craft the positives. However, augmenting\npose sequences is a difficult task as the geometric constraints among the\nskeleton joints need to be enforced to make the augmentations realistic for\nthat action. In this work, we propose a new contrastive learning approach to\ntrain models for skeleton-based action recognition without labels. Our key\ncontribution is a simple module, HaLP - to Hallucinate Latent Positives for\ncontrastive learning. Specifically, HaLP explores the latent space of poses in\nsuitable directions to generate new positives. To this end, we present a novel\noptimization formulation to solve for the synthetic positives with an explicit\ncontrol on their hardness. We propose approximations to the objective, making\nthem solvable in closed form with minimal overhead. We show via experiments\nthat using these generated positives within a standard contrastive learning\nframework leads to consistent improvements across benchmarks such as NTU-60,\nNTU-120, and PKU-II on tasks like linear evaluation, transfer learning, and kNN\nevaluation.

Our\nevaluation with three representative categories of applications (i.e., AI,\nGame, and AR/VR) demonstrate that the carbon emissions of the applications can\nbe reduced by up to 29.1% with the GreenScale. The analysis in this work\nfurther provides a detailed road map for edge-cloud application developers to\nbuild green applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 23:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

This progressive\napproach can not only mitigate semantic distortions by reducing the influence\nof pixels away from the center in the theoretical receptive field, but also\ncreate more effective virtual domains by gradually increasing the style\ndiversity. In addition, we develop a basic random convolution layer into a\nrandom convolution block including deformable offsets and affine transformation\nto support texture and contrast diversification, both of which are also\nrandomly initialized. Without complex generators or adversarial learning, we\ndemonstrate that our simple yet effective augmentation strategy outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on single domain generalization benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 01:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

However, in this work, we find that the CE loss is not\nideal for the base session training as it suffers poor class separation in\nterms of representations, which further degrades generalization to novel\nclasses. One tempting method to mitigate this problem is to apply an additional\nnaive supervised contrastive learning (SCL) in the base session. Unfortunately,\nwe find that although SCL can create a slightly better representation\nseparation among different base classes, it still struggles to separate base\nclasses and new classes. Inspired by the observations made, we propose\nSemantic-Aware Virtual Contrastive model (SAVC), a novel method that\nfacilitates separation between new classes and base classes by introducing\nvirtual classes to SCL. These virtual classes, which are generated via\npre-defined transformations, not only act as placeholders for unseen classes in\nthe representation space, but also provide diverse semantic information.

However, arbitrating the final annotation is not always\neffective because new biases might be produced during the process, especially\nwhen there are significant variations among annotations. This paper proposes a\nnovel Uncertainty-guided Multi-source Annotation Network (UMA-Net) to learn\nmedical image segmentation directly from multiple annotations. UMA-Net consists\nof a UNet with two quality-specific predictors, an Annotation Uncertainty\nEstimation Module (AUEM) and a Quality Assessment Module (QAM). Specifically,\nAUEM estimates pixel-wise uncertainty maps of each annotation and encourages\nthem to reach an agreement on reliable pixels/voxels. The uncertainty maps then\nguide the UNet to learn from the reliable pixels/voxels by weighting the\nsegmentation loss. QAM grades the uncertainty maps into high-quality or\nlow-quality groups based on assessment scores. The UNet is further implemented\nto contain a high-quality learning head (H-head) and a low-quality learning\nhead (L-head). H-head purely learns with high-quality uncertainty maps to avoid\nerror accumulation and keeps strong prediction ability, while L-head leverages\nthe low-quality uncertainty maps to assist the backbone to learn maximum\nrepresentation knowledge. UNet with H-head will be reserved during the\ninference stage, and the rest of the modules can be removed freely for\ncomputational efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on an unsupervised\n3D segmentation task and a supervised 2D segmentation task, respectively. The\nresults show that our proposed UMA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,\ndemonstrating its generality and effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 06:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

A classical submodular set function models the utility of\nselecting homogenous items from a single ground set, and such selections can be\nrepresented by binary variables. In practice, many problem contexts involve\nchoosing heterogenous items from more than one ground set or selecting multiple\ncopies of homogenous items, which call for extensions of submodularity. We\nrefer to the optimization problems associated with such generalized notions of\nsubmodularity as Generalized Submodular Optimization (GSO). GSO is found in\nwide-ranging applications, including infrastructure design, healthcare, online\nmarketing, and machine learning. Due to the often highly nonlinear (even\nnon-convex and non-concave) objective function and the mixed-integer decision\nspace, GSO is a broad subclass of challenging mixed-integer nonlinear\nprogramming problems. In this tutorial, we first provide an overview of\nclassical submodularity. Then we introduce two subclasses of GSO, for which we\npresent polyhedral theory for the mixed-integer set structures that arise from\nthese problem classes.

However, it has been\ndiscovered that there is a tradeoff between the accuracy and fairness of these\ndecision-making tasks. In some cases, these AI systems can be unfair by\nexhibiting bias or discrimination against certain social groups, which can have\nsevere consequences in real life. Inspired by one of the most well-known human\nlearning skills called grouping, we address this issue by proposing a novel\nmachine learning framework where the ML model learns to group a diverse set of\nproblems into distinct subgroups to solve each subgroup using its specific\nsub-model. Our proposed framework involves three stages of learning, which are\nformulated as a three-level optimization problem: (i) learning to group\nproblems into different subgroups; (ii) learning group-specific sub-models for\nproblem-solving; and (iii) updating group assignments of training examples by\nminimizing the validation loss. These three learning stages are performed\nend-to-end in a joint manner using gradient descent. To improve fairness and\naccuracy, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm to solve this\nthree-level optimization problem. To further reduce the risk of overfitting in\nsmall datasets, we incorporate domain adaptation techniques in the second stage\nof training. We further apply our method to neural architecture search.\nExtensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate our method's\neffectiveness and performance improvements in both fairness and accuracy. Our\nproposed Learning by Grouping can reduce overfitting and achieve\nstate-of-the-art performances with fixed human-designed network architectures\nand searchable network architectures on various datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 08:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

The corresponding learning task can be formulated as a\nnoisy partial-label learning problem. However, conventional partial-label\nlearning (PLL) methods are still vulnerable to the high ratio of noisy partial\nlabels, especially in a large labelling space. To learn a more robust model, we\npresent Adversary-Aware Partial Label Learning and introduce the\n$\\textit{rival}$, a set of noisy labels, to the collection of candidate labels\nfor each instance. By introducing the rival label, the predictive distribution\nof PLL is factorised such that a handy predictive label is achieved with less\nuncertainty coming from the transition matrix, assuming the rival generation\nprocess is known. Nonetheless, the predictive accuracy is still insufficient to\nproduce an sufficiently accurate positive sample set to leverage the clustering\neffect of the contrastive loss function. Moreover, the inclusion of rivals also\nbrings an inconsistency issue for the classifier and risk function due to the\nintractability of the transition matrix. Consequently, an adversarial teacher\nwithin momentum (ATM) disambiguation algorithm is proposed to cope with the\nsituation, allowing us to obtain a provably consistent classifier and risk\nfunction. In addition, our method has shown high resiliency to the choice of\nthe label noise transition matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves promising results on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and CUB200 datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 10:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Since\nthese fractional excitations could be utilized for quantum computing, how to\ncreate, observe, and control them through the spin degree of freedom is a\ncentral issue. Here, we study dynamical spin transport in the Kitaev-Heisenberg\nmodel by applying an AC magnetic field to an edge of the system. We find that,\nin the Kitaev QSL phase, spin polarizations at the other edge are resonantly\ninduced in a specific spin component, even though the static spin correlations\nare vanishingly small. This inter-edge spin resonance appears around the input\nfrequency over the broad frequency range. Comparing with the dynamical spin\ncorrelations, we clarify that the resonance is governed by the itinerant\nMajorana fermions with a broad continuum excitation spectrum, which can\npropagate over long distances, although it vanishes for the pure Kitaev model\nbecause of accidental degeneracy and requires weak Heisenberg interactions. We\nalso find that the spin polarizations in the other spin components are weakly\ninduced at an almost constant frequency close to the excitation gap of the\nlocalized fluxes, irrespective of the input frequency. These results\ndemonstrate that the dynamical spin transport is a powerful probe of the\nfractional excitations in the Kitaev QSL.

This result suggests that having children is\nperceived as an opportunity cost for women in this age group. We also observe a\nnegative relationship between education and adolescent fertility, which has\nimplications for the design of public policies. A panel data analysis with\neconometric techniques allowing us to control for unobserved heterogeneity\nconfirms that income is a relevant factor for all groups of women and\nreinforces the crucial role of education in reducing teenage fertility. We also\nidentify a negative correlation between fertility and employment rates for\nwomen aged 30 and above. We outline some possible explanations for these\nfindings in the context of work-life balance issues and argue for the\nimportance of implementing social policies to address them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 13:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Focusing on the hydrodynamics, we employ a linear\nrelationship between wall displacement and hydrodynamic pressure, which has\nbeen shown to be suitable for a leading-order-in-slenderness theory. The\nslenderness assumption also allows the use of lubrication theory, and the flow\nrate is related to the pressure gradient (and the tube/wall deformation) via\nthe classical solutions for oscillatory flow in a channel and in a tube\n(attributed to Womersley). Then, by two-way coupling the oscillatory flow and\nthe wall deformation via the continuity equation, a one-dimensional nonlinear\npartial differential equation (PDE) governing the instantaneous pressure\ndistribution along the conduit, without \\textit{a priori} assumptions on the\nmagnitude of the oscillation frequency (\\textit{i.e.}, at arbitrary Womersley\nnumber).

Recently, Transformer-based models have\nshown promise in comprehending contextual information and capturing item\nrelationships in a list. However, deploying them in real-time industrial\napplications is challenging, mainly because the autoregressive generation\nmechanism used in them is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel\nfast non-autoregressive sequence generation model, namely FANS, to enhance\ninference efficiency and quality for item list continuation. First, we use a\nnon-autoregressive generation mechanism to decode next $K$ items simultaneously\ninstead of one by one in existing models.

This allows it\nto effectively foster gel-like conditions, which are critical for supporting\nand protecting cells in various tissues. As a recognized ligand for multiple\nproteins, understanding its interaction with various amino acids helps\nelucidate its biological functions. This study employs NMR and molecular\ndynamics simulations (MD) to explore a potential general molecular mechanism\nfor hyaluronan-protein interactions. We examine the binding of short arginine,\nlysine, or glycine oligopeptides to hyaluronan polysaccharides, using chemical\nshift perturbation (CSP) to detect changes in hyaluronan's 1H NMR spectra upon\npeptide titration. CSP helps to identify concrete binding regions and offers\ninsights into the relative interaction strength of the peptides.

Various approaches in the literature\nexist for detecting malicious robots, such as message sampling or suspicious\nbehavior analysis.

This paper introduces a method that significantly\ndecreases the detection time for legitimate robots to identify malicious robots\nin a scenario where legitimate robots are randomly moving around the\nenvironment. Our method leverages the concept of ``Dynamic Crowd Vetting\" by\nutilizing observations from random encounters and trusted neighboring robots'\nopinions to quickly improve the accuracy of detecting malicious robots. The key\nintuition is that as long as each legitimate robot accurately estimates the\nlegitimacy of at least some fixed subset of the team, the second-hand\ninformation they receive from trusted neighbors is enough to correct any\nmisclassifications and provide accurate trust estimations of the rest of the\nteam. We show that the size of this fixed subset can be characterized as a\nfunction of fundamental graph and random walk properties. Furthermore, we\nformally show that as the number of robots in the team increases the detection\ntime remains constant. We develop a closed form expression for the critical\nnumber of time-steps required for our algorithm to successfully identify the\ntrue legitimacy of each robot to within a specified failure probability.

However,\nthis approach can also introduce reconstruction artifacts due to insufficient\nsampling. Therefore, it is important to determine the optimal number of\nprojections that minimizes both beam exposure and undersampling artifacts for\naccurate reconstructions of beam-sensitive samples.

Visualization of these datasets require proper\nmethodology that can uncover hidden patterns in the data without affecting the\nlocal and global structures within the data. To this end, however, very few\nsuch methodology exist, which can realise this task. In this work, we have\nintroduced a novel unsupervised deep neural network model, called NeuroDAVIS,\nfor data visualization. NeuroDAVIS is capable of extracting important features\nfrom the data, without assuming any data distribution, and visualize\neffectively in lower dimension. It has been shown theoritically that\nneighbourhood relationship of the data in high dimension remains preserved in\nlower dimension. The performance of NeuroDAVIS has been evaluated on a wide\nvariety of synthetic and real high-dimensional datasets including numeric,\ntextual, image and biological data.

Previous\nworks mostly over-simplify this task as detecting abnormal pair-wise\ninteractions. However, real-world events may contain multi-typed attributed\nentities and complex interactions among them, which forms an Attributed\nHeterogeneous Information Network (AHIN). With the boom of social networks,\nabnormal event detection in AHIN has become an important, but seldom explored\ntask. In this paper, we firstly study the unsupervised abnormal event detection\nproblem in AHIN. The events are considered as star-schema instances of AHIN and\nare further modeled by hypergraphs. A novel hypergraph contrastive learning\nmethod, named AEHCL, is proposed to fully capture abnormal event patterns.\nAEHCL designs the intra-event and inter-event contrastive modules to exploit\nself-supervised AHIN information. The intra-event contrastive module captures\nthe pair-wise and multivariate interaction anomalies within an event, and the\ninter-event module captures the contextual anomalies among events. These two\nmodules collaboratively boost the performance of each other and improve the\ndetection results. During the testing phase, a contrastive learning-based\nabnormal event score function is further proposed to measure the abnormality\ndegree of events. Extensive experiments on three datasets in different\nscenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of AEHCL, and the results improve\nstate-of-the-art baselines up to 12.0% in Average Precision (AP) and 4.6% in\nArea Under Curve (AUC) respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 08:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

However, we\nobserve that the information capacity in SNNs is affected by the number of\ntimesteps, leading to an accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. In this work, we study a\nfine-grained adjustment of the number of timesteps in SNNs.

Starting from the\natomic scale with a discrete distribution of dipoles, we obtain the continuum\nlimit of the electrostatic energy; the continuum energy depends on the\ngeometric parameters that define the nanostructure, such as the pitch and twist\nof the helical nanotubes and the curvature of the thin film. We find that the\nlimiting energy is local in nature. This can be rationalized by noticing that\nthe decay of the dipole kernel is sufficiently fast when the lattice sums run\nover one and two dimensions, and is also consistent with prior work on\ndimension reduction of continuum micromagnetic bodies to the thin film limit.\nHowever, an interesting contrast between the discrete-to-continuum approach and\nthe continuum dimension reduction approaches is that the limit energy in the\nlatter depends only on the normal component of the dipole field, whereas in the\ndiscrete-to-continuum approach, both tangential and normal components of the\ndipole field contribute to the limit energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2023 06:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

The upper\nlimbs in the human body are crucial since different skeletal segments combine\nto make a range of motion that helps us in our trivial daily tasks. Decoding\nEEG-based upper limb movements can be of great help to people with spinal cord\ninjury (SCI) or other neuro-muscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis, and periodic paralysis. This can\nmanifest in a loss of sensory and motor function, which could make a person\nreliant on others to provide care in day-to-day activities. We can detect and\nclassify upper limb movement activities, whether they be executed or imagined\nusing an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). Toward this goal, we focus\nour attention on decoding movement execution (ME) of the upper limb in this\nstudy. For this purpose, we utilize a publicly available EEG dataset that\ncontains EEG signal recordings from fifteen subjects acquired using a\n61-channel EEG device. We propose a method to classify four ME classes for\ndifferent subjects using spectrograms of the EEG data through pre-trained deep\nlearning (DL) models. Our proposed method of using EEG spectrograms for the\nclassification of ME has shown significant results, where the highest average\nclassification accuracy (for four ME classes) obtained is 87.36%, with one\nsubject achieving the best classification accuracy of 97.03%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 16:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

The third level describes statistics of returns that different\nInvestors gain during the \"trading day\". We derive dependence of statistical\nmoments of returns on statistical moments of market sale values, purchased\nvalues and volumes of stocks.

Efficient\nmonitoring of electrolytes imbalance not only can increase the chances of early\ndetection of disease, but also prevents the further deterioration of the health\nby strictly following nutrient controlled diet for balancing the electrolytes\npost disease detection. In this research, a recommender system MATURE Health is\nproposed and implemented, which predicts the imbalance of mandatory\nelectrolytes and other substances presented in blood and recommends the food\nitems with the balanced nutrients to avoid occurrence of the electrolytes\nimbalance. The proposed model takes user most recent laboratory results and\ndaily food intake into account to predict the electrolytes imbalance. MATURE\nHealth relies on MATURE Food algorithm to recommend food items as latter\nrecommends only those food items that satisfy all mandatory nutrient\nrequirements while also considering user past food preferences. To validate the\nproposed method, particularly sodium, potassium, and BUN levels have been\npredicted with prediction algorithm, Random Forest, for dialysis patients using\ntheir laboratory reports history and daily food intake. And, the proposed model\ndemonstrates 99.53 percent, 96.94 percent and 95.35 percent accuracy for\nSodium, Potassium, and BUN respectively. MATURE Health is a novel health\nrecommender system that implements machine learning models to predict the\nimbalance of mandatory electrolytes and other substances in the blood and\nrecommends the food items which contain the required amount of the nutrients\nthat prevent or at least reduce the risk of the electrolytes imbalance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 16:28:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 19:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}
