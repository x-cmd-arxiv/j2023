With the rapid growth in the quantity of high-resolution remote sensing\ndata and the complexity of texture features, a number of quantitative deep\nlearning-based methods have been proposed. Although these methods outperform\ntraditional change detection methods by extracting deep features and combining\nspatial-temporal information, reasonable explanations about how deep features\nwork on improving the detection performance are still lacking. In our\ninvestigations, we find that modern Hopfield network layers achieve\nconsiderable performance in semantic understandings. In this paper, we propose\na Deep Supervision and FEature Retrieval network (Dsfer-Net) for bitemporal\nchange detection. Specifically, the highly representative deep features of\nbitemporal images are jointly extracted through a fully convolutional Siamese\nnetwork. Based on the sequential geo-information of the bitemporal images, we\nthen design a feature retrieval module to retrieve the difference feature and\nleverage discriminative information in a deeply supervised manner. We also note\nthat the deeply supervised feature retrieval module gives explainable proofs\nabout the semantic understandings of the proposed network in its deep layers.\nFinally, this end-to-end network achieves a novel framework by aggregating the\nretrieved features and feature pairs from different layers. Experiments\nconducted on three public datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and CDD) confirm the\nsuperiority of the proposed Dsfer-Net over other state-of-the-art methods.

However, the source (including text, music, and speech)\nin the real world is often statistically ill-defined because of its close\nconnection to human perception, and thus the model-driven approach can be quite\nsuboptimal. This study places careful emphasis on English text and exploits its\nsemantic aspect to enhance the compression efficiency further. The main idea\nstems from the puzzle crossword, observing that the hidden words can still be\nprecisely reconstructed so long as some key letters are provided. The proposed\nmasking-based strategy resembles the above game. In a nutshell, the encoder\nevaluates the semantic importance of each word according to the semantic loss\nand then masks the minor ones, while the decoder aims to recover the masked\nwords from the semantic context by means of the Transformer.

The forward model consists of a multi-phase\nthermo-mechanical model of porous materials governed by coupled partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs). The design parameter (material porosity) is an\nuncertain and space-dependent field, resulting in a high-dimensional\nPDE-constrained optimization under uncertainty problem after finite element\ndiscretization. The robust design framework uses a risk-averse formulation\nconsisting of the mean and variance of the design objective to achieve target\nthermal and mechanical performances and mitigate uncertainty. To ensure the\nefficiency and scalability of the solution, a second-order Taylor approximation\nof the mean and variance and the low-rank structure of the preconditioned\nHessian of the design objective are leveraged, which uncovers the low effective\ndimension of the high-dimensional uncertain parameter space. Moreover, a\ngradient-based optimization method is implemented using the Lagrangian\nformalism to derive expressions for the gradient and Hessian with respect to\nthe design and uncertain parameters. Finally, approximated $\\ell_0$\nregularization functions are utilized via a continuation numerical scheme to\npromote sparsity in the designed porosity. The framework's accuracy,\nefficiency, and scalability are demonstrated with numerical examples of a\nbuilding envelope insulation scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 17:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

This study aims to help shed light on the impact of turbulent\nmixing, driven by core collapse supernovae (cc-SNe), on the r-process abundance\ndispersal in galactic disks. To this end, we conduct a series of simulations of\nsmall-scale galaxy patches which resolve metal mixing mechanisms at parsec\nscales. Our set-up includes cc-SNe feedback and enrichment from r-process\nsources. We find that the relative rate of the r-process events to cc-SNe is\ndirectly imprinted on the shape of the r-process distribution in the ISM with\nmore frequent events causing more centrally peaked distributions. We consider\nalso the fraction of metals that is lost on galactic winds and find that cc-SNe\nare able to efficiently launch highly enriched winds, especially in smaller\ngalaxy models.

Conventional\nCVR methods typically suffer from the data sparsity problem as they rely only\non samples where the user has clicked. To address this problem, researchers\nhave introduced the method of multi-task learning, which utilizes non-clicked\nsamples and shares feature representations of the Click-Through Rate (CTR) task\nwith the CVR task. However, it should be noted that the CVR and CTR tasks are\nfundamentally different and may even be contradictory. Therefore, introducing a\nlarge amount of CTR information without distinction may drown out valuable\ninformation related to CVR. This phenomenon is called the curse of knowledge\nproblem in this paper. To tackle this issue, we argue that a trade-off should\nbe achieved between the introduction of large amounts of auxiliary information\nand the protection of valuable information related to CVR. Hence, we propose a\nClick-aware Structure Transfer model with sample Weight Assignment, abbreviated\nas CSTWA. It pays more attention to the latent structure information, which can\nfilter the input information that is related to CVR, instead of directly\nsharing feature representations. Meanwhile, to capture the representation\nconflict between CTR and CVR, we calibrate the representation layer and\nreweight the discriminant layer to excavate the click bias information from the\nCTR tower. Moreover, it incorporates a sample weight assignment algorithm\nbiased towards CVR modeling, to make the knowledge from CTR would not mislead\nthe CVR. Extensive experiments on industrial and public datasets have\ndemonstrated that CSTWA significantly outperforms widely used and competitive\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 17:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

First we show that if $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ with\n$|A+A| \\le (1-\\epsilon) 2^d |A|$ is non-degenerate then $A$ is covered by\n$O(2^d)$ translates of a $d$-dimensional generalised arithmetic progression\n($d$-GAP) $P$ with $|P| \\le O_{d,\\epsilon}(|A|)$; thus we obtain one of the\npolynomial bounds required by PFR, under the non-degeneracy assumption that $A$\nis not efficiently covered by $O_{d,\\epsilon}(1)$ translates of a $(d-1)$-GAP.\nWe also prove a stability result showing for any $\\epsilon,\\alpha>0$ that if $A\n\\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \\le (2-\\epsilon)2^d|A|$ is non-degenerate then\nsome $A' \\subset A$ with $|A'|>(1-\\alpha)|A|$ is efficiently covered by either\na $(d+1)$-GAP or $O_{\\alpha}(1)$ translates of a $d$-GAP. This `dimension-free'\nbound for approximate covering makes for a stark contrast with exact covering,\nwhere the required number of translates grows exponentially with $d$. We\nfurther show that if $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ is non-degenerate with $|A+A| \\le\n(2^d + \\ell)|A|$ and $\\ell \\le 0.1 \\cdot 2^d$ then $A$ is covered by $\\ell+1$\ntranslates of a $d$-GAP $P$ with $|P| \\le O_d(|A|)$; this is tight, in that\n$\\ell+1$ cannot be replaced by any smaller number. The above results also hold\nfor $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, replacing GAPs by a suitable common\ngeneralisation of GAPs and convex bodies. In this setting the non-degeneracy\ncondition holds automatically, so we obtain essentially optimal bounds with no\nadditional assumption on $A$.

The challenge is to properly align the successive image shots and\nmerge their complimentary information to achieve high-quality outputs. Towards\nthis direction, we propose Burstormer: a novel transformer-based architecture\nfor burst image restoration and enhancement. In comparison to existing works,\nour approach exploits multi-scale local and non-local features to achieve\nimproved alignment and feature fusion. Our key idea is to enable inter-frame\ncommunication in the burst neighborhoods for information aggregation and\nprogressive fusion while modeling the burst-wide context. However, the input\nburst frames need to be properly aligned before fusing their information.\nTherefore, we propose an enhanced deformable alignment module for aligning\nburst features with regards to the reference frame. Unlike existing methods,\nthe proposed alignment module not only aligns burst features but also exchanges\nfeature information and maintains focused communication with the reference\nframe through the proposed reference-based feature enrichment mechanism, which\nfacilitates handling complex motions. After multi-level alignment and\nenrichment, we re-emphasize on inter-frame communication within burst using a\ncyclic burst sampling module. Finally, the inter-frame information is\naggregated using the proposed burst feature fusion module followed by\nprogressive upsampling.

Furthermore, GDP is\nstrength at optimizing the parameters of degradation model during the denoising\nprocess, achieving blind image restoration.

Experimentally, we demonstrate GDP's versatility on\nseveral image datasets for linear problems, such as super-resolution,\ndeblurring, inpainting, and colorization, as well as non-linear and blind\nissues, such as low-light enhancement and HDR image recovery.

Here, solving a system of ten elliptic partial differential\nequations, we close this program and compute the spectrum of the most unstable\nmodes of a massive spin-2 field for generic black-hole spin and boson mass,\nbeyond the hydrogenic approximation and including the unique dipole mode that\ndominates the instability in the spin-2 case. We find that the instability\ntimescale for this mode is orders of magnitude shorter than for any other\nsuperradiant mode, yielding much stronger constraints on massive spin-2 fields.\nThese results pave the way for phenomenological studies aimed at constraining\nbeyond Standard Model scenarios, ultralight dark matter candidates, and\nextensions to General Relativity using gravitational-wave and electromagnetic\nobservations, and have implications for the phase diagram of vacuum solutions\nof higher-dimensional gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 18:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Finally, we propose a methodology based on the\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test to verify whether the observed microlensing amplitudes\nin our data are compatible with the most standard scenario, whereby galaxies\nare composed of stars as compact bodies and smoothly distributed DM. Given our\ncurrent sample, we show that the standard scenario cannot be rejected, in\ncontrast with previous results by Hawkins (2020a), claiming that a population\nof stellar mass primordial black holes (PBHs) is necessary to explain the\namplitude of the microlensing signals in lensed quasar light curves. We further\nestimate the number of microlensing light curves needed to distinguish between\nthe standard scenario with stellar microlensing and a scenario that describes\nall the DM contained in galaxies in the form of compact objects such as PBHs,\nwith a mean mass of $0.2M_{\\odot}$. We find that about 900 microlensing curves\nfrom the Rubin Observatory will be sufficient to discriminate between the two\nextreme scenarios at a 95\\% confidence level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 19:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

For tracking applications, the data\ncollection involves drawing bounding boxes around the classes of interest on\neach frame, and associate detections of the same \"instance\" over frames. In a\nsemi-automated data collection pipeline, this can be achieved by running a\nbaseline detection and tracking algorithm, and relying on manual correction to\nadd/remove/change bounding boxes on each frame, as well as resolving errors in\nthe associations over frames (track switches). In this paper, we propose a data\ncorrection pipeline to generate ground-truth data more efficiently in this\nsemi-automated scenario. Our method simplifies the trajectories from the\ntracking systems and let the annotator verify and correct the objects in the\nsampled keyframes.

In this paper we present the\nalgorithm to answer three main questions regarding the star formation rate\ndensity (SFR) (i) when did the formation terminate?, (ii) at what redshift does\nthe SFR peak?, and finally (iii) what is the functional form of SFR at high\nredshift? for a given population. We present an algorithm to infer the\nfunctional form of SFR for different populations of compact binaries\noriginating in stars from Population (Pop) I+II and Pop III, using ET as a\nsingle instrument. We show that the reconstruction of SFR is essentially\nindependent of the time delay distributions up to $z \\sim 14$ and the accuracy\nof the reconstruction strongly depends on the time delay distribution only at\nhigh redshifts of $z\\gtrsim 14$. We define the termination redshift as the\nredshift where the SFR drops to 1\\% of its peak value. In this analysis we\nconstrain the peak of the SFR as a function of redshift and show that ET as a\nsingle instrument can distinguish the termination redshifts of different SFRs.\nThe accurate estimate of the termination redshift depends on correctly\nmodelling the tail of the time delay distribution representing delay time\n$\\gtrsim 8$ Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 20:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

We aim to model the process of stellar collapse in the scenario of a\nself-gravitating collapsing star. We account for the changes in Kerr metric\ninduced by the growth of the black hole, accretion of angular momentum, as well\nas the self-gravity effect due to a large mass of the collapsing stellar core\nfalling onto black hole in a very short time. We also investigate the existence\nof accretion shocks in the collapsar, and role of magnetic field in their\npropagation. We compute the time-dependent axially-symmetric General\nRelativistic magnetohydrodynamic model of a collapsing stellar core in the\ndynamical Kerr metric. We explore the influence of self-gravity in such star,\nwhere the newly formed black hole is increasing the mass, and changing its\nspin. The Kerr metric evolves according to the mass and angular momentum\nchanges during the collapse. We parameterize the rotation inside the star, and\naccount for the presence of large-scale poloidal magnetic field. For the set of\nthe global parameters, such as the initial black hole spin, and initial content\nof specific angular momentum in the stellar envelope, we determine the\nevolution of black hole parameters (mass and spin) and we quantify the strength\nof the gravitational instability, variability timescales and amplitudes. We\nfind that the role of the gravitational instability measured by the value of\nthe Toomre parameter is relatively important in the innermost regions of the\ncollapsing star. The character of accretion rate variability strongly depends\non the assumption of self-gravity in the model, and is also affected by the\nmagnetic field.

We provide public access to 154 checkpoints for each one of the 16\nmodels, alongside tools to download and reconstruct their exact training\ndataloaders for further study. We intend \\textit{Pythia} to facilitate research\nin many areas, and we present several case studies including novel results in\nmemorization, term frequency effects on few-shot performance, and reducing\ngender bias. We demonstrate that this highly controlled setup can be used to\nyield novel insights toward LLMs and their training dynamics.

To\napply distribution testing to these problems, we introduce distribution testing\nunder the parity trace, where the algorithm receives an ordered sample $S$ that\nreveals only the least significant bit of each element. This abstraction\nreveals connections between the following three problems of interest, allowing\nnew upper and lower bounds:\n  1. In distribution testing with a confused collector, the collector of the\nsample may be incapable of distinguishing between nearby elements of a domain\n(e.g. a machine learning classifier). We prove bounds for distribution testing\nwith a confused collector on domains structured as a cycle or a path.\n  2. Recent work on the fundamental testing vs. learning question established\ntight lower bounds on distribution-free sample-based property testing by\nreduction from distribution testing, but the tightness is limited to symmetric\nproperties. The parity trace allows a broader family of equivalences to\nnon-symmetric properties, while recovering and strengthening many of the\nprevious results with a different technique.\n  3. We give the first results for property testing in the well-studied trace\nreconstruction model, where the goal is to test whether an unknown string $x$\nsatisfies some property or is far from satisfying that property, given only\nindependent random traces of $x$.\n  Our main technical result is a tight bound of $\\widetilde\n\\Theta\\left((n/\\epsilon)^{4/5} + \\sqrt n/\\epsilon^2\\right)$ for testing\nuniformity of distributions over $[n]$ under the parity trace, leading also to\nresults for the problems above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 20:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

To ensure a reliable transmission, and to meet service level\nagreements, PON systems have to be monitored constantly in order to quickly\nidentify and localize networks faults. Typically, a service disruption in a PON\nsystem is mainly due to fiber cuts and optical network unit (ONU)\ntransmitter/receiver failures. When the ONUs are located at different distances\nfrom the optical line terminal (OLT), the faulty ONU or branch can be\nidentified by analyzing the recorded optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR)\ntraces. However, faulty branch isolation becomes very challenging when the\nreflections originating from two or more branches with similar length overlap,\nwhich makes it very hard to discriminate the faulty branches given the global\nbackscattered signal. Recently, machine learning (ML) based approaches have\nshown great potential for managing optical faults in PON systems. Such\ntechniques perform well when trained and tested with data derived from the same\nPON system. But their performance may severely degrade, if the PON system\n(adopted for the generation of the training data) has changed, e.g. by adding\nmore branches or varying the length difference between two neighboring\nbranches. etc. A re-training of the ML models has to be conducted for each\nnetwork change, which can be time consuming. In this paper, to overcome the\naforementioned issues, we propose a generic ML approach trained independently\nof the network architecture for identifying the faulty branch in PON systems\ngiven OTDR signals for the cases of branches with close lengths. Such an\napproach can be applied to an arbitrary PON system without requiring to be\nre-trained for each change of the network. The proposed approach is validated\nusing experimental data derived from PON system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 20:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Previous methods have heavily relied on feature\nmatching with great success. However, these methods are often inefficient and\nlimited by their reliance on pre-trained models that have not be designed\nspecifically for pose estimation. In this paper we propose PoseMatcher, an\naccurate model free one-shot object pose estimator that overcomes these\nlimitations. We create a new training pipeline for object to image matching\nbased on a three-view system: a query with a positive and negative templates.\nThis simple yet effective approach emulates test time scenarios by cheaply\nconstructing an approximation of the full object point cloud during training.\nTo enable PoseMatcher to attend to distinct input modalities, an image and a\npointcloud, we introduce IO-Layer, a new attention layer that efficiently\naccommodates self and cross attention between the inputs. Moreover, we propose\na pruning strategy where we iteratively remove redundant regions of the target\nobject to further reduce the complexity and noise of the network while\nmaintaining accuracy. Finally we redesign commonly used pose refinement\nstrategies, zoom and 2D offset refinements, and adapt them to the one-shot\nparadigm.

To\nfacilitate the development of this promising direction, in this survey, we\ncategorize and comprehensively review papers on graph counterfactual learning.\nWe divide existing methods into four categories based on research problems\nstudied. For each category, we provide background and motivating examples, a\ngeneral framework summarizing existing works and a detailed review of these\nworks. We point out promising future research directions at the intersection of\ngraph-structured data, counterfactual learning, and real-world applications. To\noffer a comprehensive view of resources for future studies, we compile a\ncollection of open-source implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used\nevaluation metrics. This survey aims to serve as a ``one-stop-shop'' for\nbuilding a unified understanding of graph counterfactual learning categories\nand current resources. We also maintain a repository for papers and resources\nand will keep updating the repository\nhttps://github.com/TimeLovercc/Awesome-Graph-Causal-Learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 21:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

U-Net can extract the detailed local\nsemantic and texture information and Transformer can learn the long-rang\ndependencies among pixels in the input image. However, directly adapting the\nTransformer for segmentation has ``token-flatten\" problem (flattens the local\npatches into 1D tokens which losses the interaction among pixels within local\npatches) and ``scale-sensitivity\" problem (uses a fixed scale to split the\ninput image into local patches). Compared to directly combining U-Net and\nTransformer, we propose a new global-local fashion combination of U-Net and\nTransformer, named U-Netmer, to solve the two problems. The proposed U-Netmer\nsplits an input image into local patches. The global-context information among\nlocal patches is learnt by the self-attention mechanism in Transformer and\nU-Net segments each local patch instead of flattening into tokens to solve the\n`token-flatten\" problem. The U-Netmer can segment the input image with\ndifferent patch sizes with the identical structure and the same parameter.\nThus, the U-Netmer can be trained with different patch sizes to solve the\n``scale-sensitivity\" problem. We conduct extensive experiments in 7 public\ndatasets on 7 organs (brain, heart, breast, lung, polyp, pancreas and prostate)\nand 4 imaging modalities (MRI, CT, ultrasound, and endoscopy) to show that the\nproposed U-Netmer can be generally applied to improve accuracy of medical image\nsegmentation. These experimental results show that U-Netmer provides\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to baselines and other models. In\naddition, the discrepancy among the outputs of U-Netmer with different scales\nis linearly correlated to the segmentation accuracy which can be considered as\na confidence score to rank test images by difficulty without ground-truth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2023 22:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

A CAV typically adapts its speed based on information from\nthe vehicle it follows. CAVs can also use information from vehicles further\nahead within their communication range, and this results in improved traffic\nsafety and efficiency. In mixed traffic scenarios, however, this may not always\nbe possible due to the presence of human-driven vehicles that do not have\ncommunication capabilities. Furthermore, as wireless vehicular networks are\nunreliable, information from other vehicles can be delayed or lost, which\nbrings more challenges for CAVs in utilizing information from multiple leading\nvehicles. A few studies have investigated the impact of CAVs where they use\ninformation from multiple leading vehicles on traffic safety and efficiency,\nbut only in very limited scenarios (i.e., with a very small number of\nvehicles).\n  In contrast, this paper investigates the impact of CAV car-following control\nbased on multiple leading vehicles information on both mixed traffic safety and\nefficiency in realistic scenarios in terms of imperfect communication, vehicle\nmodelling, and traffic scenario.

This design frees the representation from having to\nencode complex nuisance variability in the image due to, for instance,\nillumination and reflectance properties of the scene. Since customary\nautoencoding based on minimizing the reconstruction error does not preclude the\nentire flow from being encoded into a single slot, we modify the loss to an\nadversarial criterion based on Contextual Information Separation. The resulting\nmin-max optimization fosters the separation of objects and their assignment to\ndifferent attention slots, leading to Divided Attention, or DivA. DivA\noutperforms recent unsupervised multi-object motion segmentation methods while\ntripling run-time speed up to 104FPS and reducing the performance gap from\nsupervised methods to 12% or less. DivA can handle different numbers of objects\nand different image sizes at training and test time, is invariant to\npermutation of object labels, and does not require explicit regularization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 00:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

However, the current irrigation systems used in the field are not\nefficient. They rely mainly on soil moisture sensors and the experience of\ngrowers, but do not account for future soil moisture loss. Predicting soil\nmoisture loss is challenging because it is influenced by numerous factors,\nincluding soil texture, weather conditions, and plant characteristics. This\npaper proposes a solution to improve irrigation efficiency, which is called\nDRLIC. DRLIC is a sophisticated irrigation system that uses deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) to optimize its performance. The system employs a neural\nnetwork, known as the DRL control agent, which learns an optimal control policy\nthat considers both the current soil moisture measurement and the future soil\nmoisture loss. We introduce an irrigation reward function that enables our\ncontrol agent to learn from previous experiences. However, there may be\ninstances where the output of our DRL control agent is unsafe, such as\nirrigating too much or too little water. To avoid damaging the health of the\nplants, we implement a safety mechanism that employs a soil moisture predictor\nto estimate the performance of each action. If the predicted outcome is deemed\nunsafe, we perform a relatively-conservative action instead. To demonstrate the\nreal-world application of our approach, we developed an irrigation system that\ncomprises sprinklers, sensing and control nodes, and a wireless network. We\nevaluate the performance of DRLIC by deploying it in a testbed consisting of\nsix almond trees. During a 15-day in-field experiment, we compared the water\nconsumption of DRLIC with a widely-used irrigation scheme. Our results indicate\nthat DRLIC outperformed the traditional irrigation method by achieving a water\nsavings of up to 9.52%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 01:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

However, such 3D annotations are\noften expensive and time-consuming, which may not be practical for real\napplications. A natural remedy is to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL) by\nleveraging a limited amount of labeled samples and abundant unlabeled samples.\nCurrent pseudolabeling-based SSL object detection methods mainly adopt a\nteacher-student framework, with a single fixed threshold strategy to generate\nsupervision signals, which inevitably brings confused supervision when guiding\nthe student network training. Besides, the data augmentation of the point cloud\nin the typical teacher-student framework is too weak, and only contains basic\ndown sampling and flip-and-shift (i.e., rotate and scaling), which hinders the\neffective learning of feature information. Hence, we address these issues by\nintroducing a novel approach of Hierarchical Supervision and Shuffle Data\nAugmentation (HSSDA), which is a simple yet effective teacher-student\nframework. The teacher network generates more reasonable supervision for the\nstudent network by designing a dynamic dual-threshold strategy. Besides, the\nshuffle data augmentation strategy is designed to strengthen the feature\nrepresentation ability of the student network.

Motivated by the success of prompt\nlearning (PL) in natural language processing, we propose an approach to\nunsupervised brain tumor segmentation by designing image-based prompts that\nallow indication of brain tumors, and this approach is dubbed as PL-based Brain\nTumor Segmentation (PL-BTS). Specifically, instead of directly training a model\nfor brain tumor segmentation with a large amount of annotated data, we seek to\ntrain a model that can answer the question: is a voxel in the input image\nassociated with tumor-like hyper-/hypo-intensity? Such a model can be trained\nby artificially generating tumor-like hyper-/hypo-intensity on images without\ntumors with hand-crafted designs. Since the hand-crafted designs may be too\nsimplistic to represent all kinds of real tumors, the trained model may overfit\nthe simplistic hand-crafted task rather than actually answer the question of\nabnormality. To address this problem, we propose the use of a validation task,\nwhere we generate a different hand-crafted task to monitor overfitting.

With\nthe availability of such large databases, researchers can now develop\nsophisticated models and algorithms that leverage the increased availability of\ndata to address the track association challenge effectively.

The core for this to be successful is to learn the\ndiscriminative inlier/outlier feature representations. In this paper, we\ndevelop a novel variational non-local network-based outlier rejection framework\nfor robust alignment. By reformulating the non-local feature learning with\nvariational Bayesian inference, the Bayesian-driven long-range dependencies can\nbe modeled to aggregate discriminative geometric context information for\ninlier/outlier distinction. Specifically, to achieve such Bayesian-driven\ncontextual dependencies, each query/key/value component in our non-local\nnetwork predicts a prior feature distribution and a posterior one. Embedded\nwith the inlier/outlier label, the posterior feature distribution is\nlabel-dependent and discriminative. Thus, pushing the prior to be close to the\ndiscriminative posterior in the training step enables the features sampled from\nthis prior at test time to model high-quality long-range dependencies. Notably,\nto achieve effective posterior feature guidance, a specific probabilistic\ngraphical model is designed over our non-local model, which lets us derive a\nvariational low bound as our optimization objective for model training.\nFinally, we propose a voting-based inlier searching strategy to cluster the\nhigh-quality hypothetical inliers for transformation estimation.

We find that in the case of open\nboundary conditions, the transition from a topologically trivial regime to a\nnon-trivial topological regime takes place at a different value of the momentum\nthan that of the periodic boundary spectra. This discrepancy is solved by\nconsidering the non-Bloch case and the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ).\nFinally, we present the Hall conductance evaluated over the GBZ and connect it\nto the separation between the Weyl nodes, within the non-Bloch theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 04:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Consequently, a fundamental 3D vision task is the removal of\nnoise, known as point cloud filtering or denoising. State-of-the-art learning\nbased methods focus on training neural networks to infer filtered displacements\nand directly shift noisy points onto the underlying clean surfaces. In high\nnoise conditions, they iterate the filtering process. However, this iterative\nfiltering is only done at test time and is less effective at ensuring points\nconverge quickly onto the clean surfaces.

It uses multi-view camera data to learn a\ntransformer model that directly projects the perception of the road environment\nonto the BEV perspective. However, training a transformer model often requires\na large amount of data, and as camera data for road traffic is often private,\nit is typically not shared. Federated learning offers a solution that enables\nclients to collaborate and train models without exchanging data. In this paper,\nwe propose FedBEVT, a federated transformer learning approach for BEV\nperception.

In such chiral phases, photons in the\nsubrings triangle flow in the same or opposite directions by comparing to the\ncurrent in the hexagonal ring, which depend on the signs of the induced\nmagnetic flux in the subrings. Interestingly, the critical exponents of the\nexcitation energy in two chiral phases are the same as that of the subring\ntriangle, exhibiting subring-size dependent critical exponents.

The Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU (KIDS) functional has\nbeen then developed to satisfy the NS observations and applied to homogeneous\nnuclear matter and spherical nuclei. Purpose: We examine the performance of the\nKIDS functional by calculating the masses and charge radii of even-even nuclei\ntowards the drip lines. Method: The Kohn-Sham-Bogoliubov equation is solved by\ntaking into account the axial deformation. Results: The root-mean-square\ndeviation of the binding energy and the charge radius for the KIDS functional\nis 4.5--5.1 MeV and 0.03--0.04 fm, which is comparable to that for existing\nEDFs.

Constructive and efficient control of such underactuated\nsystems is a nontrivial open problem, which has been solved recently for the\nlinear case.

Though promising, those NLP-based PTMs fall short of\nencoding geographic knowledge in the delivery address, which considerably trims\ndown the performance of delivery-related tasks in logistic systems such as\nCainiao.

In the\nlast decade,s great progress has been done in this field by developing quantum\nwalk-based algorithms that can outperform classical ones. However, current\nquantum computers work based on the quantum circuit model of computation, and\nthe general mapping from one model to the other is still an open problem. In\nthis work we provide a matrix analysis of the unitary evolution operator of\nUC-DTQW, which is composed at the time of two unitary operators: the shift and\ncoin operators. We conceive the shift operator of the system as the unitary\nmatrix form of the adjacency matrix associated to the graph on which the\nUC-DTQW takes place, and provide a set of equations to transform the latter\ninto the former and vice-versa. However, this mapping modifies the structure of\nthe original graph into a directed multigraph, by splitting single edges or\narcs of the original graph into multiple arcs. Thus, the fact that any unitary\noperator has a quantum circuit representation means that any adjacency matrix\nthat complies with the transformation equations will be automatically\nassociated to a quantum circuit, and any quantum circuit acting on a bipartite\nsystem will be always associated to a multigraph. Finally, we extend the\ndefinition of the coin operator to a superposition of coins in such a way that\neach coin acts on different vertices of the multigraph on which the quantum\nwalk takes place, and provide a description of how this can be implemented in\ncircuit form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 07:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

We studied the importance of this\neffect in different thermodynamic conditions relevant to the inner crust of the\nproto-neutron star, both at beta equilibrium and in the fixed-proton-fraction\nregime. To this aim, we solved the hydrodynamic equations for an ion moving in\nan incompressible, irrotational, and non-viscous fluid, with different boundary\nconditions, thus leading to different prescriptions for the ion effective mass.\nWe then employed a compressible liquid-drop approach in the one-component\nplasma approximation, including the renormalisation of the ion mass to account\nfor the influence of the surrounding medium.

However, it is\ndifficult to guarantee the performance of OOD detectors as it is difficult to\ncharacterize the OOD aspect of an instance, especially in high-dimensional\nunstructured data.\n  To distinguish between OOD data and data known to the learning component\nthrough the training process, an emerging technique is to incorporate\nvariational autoencoders (VAE) within systems and apply classification or\nanomaly detection techniques on their latent spaces. The rationale for doing so\nis the reduction of the data domain size through the encoding process, which\nbenefits real-time systems through decreased processing requirements,\nfacilitates feature analysis for unstructured data and allows more explainable\ntechniques to be implemented.\n  This study places probably approximately correct (PAC) based guarantees on\nOOD detection using the encoding process within VAEs to quantify image features\nand apply conformal constraints over them.

Different to conventional STVQA models which take the\nlinguistic semantics and visual semantics in scene text as two separate\nfeatures, in this paper, we propose a paradigm of \"Locate Then Generate\" (LTG),\nwhich explicitly unifies this two semantics with the spatial bounding box as a\nbridge connecting them. Specifically, at first, LTG locates the region in an\nimage that may contain the answer words with an answer location module (ALM)\nconsisting of a region proposal network and a language refinement network, both\nof which can transform to each other with one-to-one mapping via the scene text\nbounding box. Next, given the answer words selected by ALM, LTG generates a\nreadable answer sequence with an answer generation module (AGM) based on a\npre-trained language model. As a benefit of the explicit alignment of the\nvisual and linguistic semantics, even without any scene text based pre-training\ntasks, LTG can boost the absolute accuracy by +6.06% and +6.92% on the TextVQA\ndataset and the ST-VQA dataset respectively, compared with a non-pre-training\nbaseline.

In its final\nform, the metric has only power law fall-offs and fits into the recently\nintroduced Special Double Null (SDN) gauge, with finite surface charges. One\nremarkable feature of SDN gauge is that spherical symmetry and vacuum Einstein\nequations allow an infinite number of asymptotic integration constants in the\nmetric, on top of the mass.

The questions\nto a medical image include two categories: close-end (such as Yes/No question)\nand open-end. To obtain answers, the majority of the existing medical VQA\nmethods relies on classification approaches, while a few works attempt to use\ngeneration approaches or a mixture of the two. The classification approaches\nare relatively simple but perform poorly on long open-end questions. To bridge\nthis gap, in this paper, we propose a new Transformer based framework for\nmedical VQA (named as Q2ATransformer), which integrates the advantages of both\nthe classification and the generation approaches and provides a unified\ntreatment for the close-end and open-end questions. Specifically, we introduce\nan additional Transformer decoder with a set of learnable candidate answer\nembeddings to query the existence of each answer class to a given\nimage-question pair. Through the Transformer attention, the candidate answer\nembeddings interact with the fused features of the image-question pair to make\nthe decision. In this way, despite being a classification-based approach, our\nmethod provides a mechanism to interact with the answer information for\nprediction like the generation-based approaches. On the other hand, by\nclassification, we mitigate the task difficulty by reducing the search space of\nanswers. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two medical\nVQA benchmarks. Especially, for the open-end questions, we achieve 79.19% on\nVQA-RAD and 54.85% on PathVQA, with 16.09% and 41.45% absolute improvements,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 08:06:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 05:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

However, in the traditional NHQC scheme, the state of the calculation\nsubspace has always leaked to the non-computation subspace, resulting in less\nrobustness than anticipated. To address this problem, by imposing the\nsuper-robust condition, a super-robust nonadiabatic holonomic quantum\ncomputation (SR-NHQC) scheme was proposed with an experimental demonstration of\nits effectiveness. While SR-NHQC has better robust performance, its excessively\nlong gate time leads to poor decoherence, making it quite unfavorable in\npractical applications.

In this paper, we propose a novel\ndual convolutional blind denoising network with skip connection (DCBDNet),\nwhich is able to achieve a desirable balance between the denoising effect and\nnetwork complexity. The proposed DCBDNet consists of a noise estimation network\nand a dual convolutional neural network (CNN). The noise estimation network is\nused to estimate the noise level map, which improves the flexibility of the\nproposed model. The dual CNN contains two branches: a u-shaped sub-network is\ndesigned for the upper branch, and the lower branch is composed of the dilated\nconvolution layers.

The use of biometric data permits an individuation so exact that\nthe data is utilized effectively in identification and authentication systems.\nBut for this same reason, privacy protections become indispensably necessary.\n  Privacy protection is extensively afforded by the technique of anonymization.\nAnonymization techniques obfuscate or remove the sensitive personal data to\nachieve high levels of anonymity. However, the effectiveness of anonymization\nrelies, in equal parts, on the effectiveness of the methods employed to\nevaluate anonymization performance.\n  In this paper, we assess the state-of-the-art methods used to evaluate the\nperformance of anonymization techniques for facial images and gait patterns. We\ndemonstrate that the state-of-the-art evaluation methods have serious and\nfrequent shortcomings. In particular, we find that the underlying assumptions\nof the state-of-the-art are quite unwarranted. When a method evaluating the\nperformance of anonymization assumes a weak adversary or a weak recognition\nscenario, then the resulting evaluation will very likely be a gross\noverestimation of the anonymization performance.

Unlike MPC with distance constraints (MPC-DC), this approach\nfacilitates early obstacle avoidance without the need to increase prediction\nhorizons. However, the existing MPC-CBF method is deterministic and fails to\naccount for perception uncertainties. This paper proposes a generalized MPC-CBF\napproach for stochastic scenarios, which maintains the advantages of the\ndeterministic method for addressing the MOCA problem. Specifically, the\nchance-constrained MPC-CBF (CC-MPC-CBF) technique is introduced to ensure that\na user-defined collision avoidance probability is met by utilizing\nprobabilistic CBFs. However, due to the potential empty intersection between\nthe reachable set and the safe region confined by CBF constraints, the\nCC-MPC-CBF problem can pose challenges in achieving feasibility.

In this scenario,\nthere is a fundamental incompatibility between notions of fairness (such as\nenvy-freeness and proportionality) and economic efficiency (such as\nPareto-optimality). However, in the real world, items are not always allocated\nonce and for all, but often repeatedly. For example, the items may be recurring\nchores to distribute in a household. Motivated by this, we initiate the study\nof the repeated fair division of indivisible goods and chores and propose a\nformal model for this scenario. In this paper, we show that, if the number of\nrepetitions is a multiple of the number of agents, we can always find (i) a\nsequence of allocations that is envy-free and complete (in polynomial time),\nand (ii) a sequence of allocations that is proportional and Pareto-optimal (in\nexponential time).

For the case of two agents, we show that if the number of repetitions is\neven, it is always possible to find a sequence of allocations that is overall\nenvy-free and Pareto-optimal.

A subsequence anomaly refers to successive\npoints in time that are collectively abnormal, although each point is not\nnecessarily an outlier. Among a large number of approaches to discovering\nsubsequence anomalies, the discord concept is considered one of the best. A\ntime series discord is intuitively defined as a subsequence of a given length\nthat is maximally far away from its non-overlapping nearest neighbor. Recently\nintroduced the MERLIN algorithm discovers time series discords of every\npossible length in a specified range, thereby eliminating the need to set even\nthat sole parameter to discover discords in a time series.

Following Einstein's thought experiments, one could\nask: What would it look like to sit inside a photon or to be a photon? And what\ntype of observer could represent this more global perspective of the photon's\ninterior? To address these questions, we introduce the concepts of internal and\nexternal observers with a focus on their relationship in quantum theory and\nrelativity theory. The internal observer, associated with the internal\nobservables super-algebra, glues the external interactions.\n  Drawing inspiration from the advancements in abstract algebraic topology, we\npropose mathematical representation of the internal observer. We also outline\nprinciples for ensuring the consistency of observers in terms of information\ntheory. It becomes evident, through the analysis of the introduced hierarchy of\nobservers, that entanglement is a primitive of space-time causal relationships.\nWhile external observers must abide by the relativistic causality linked with\nthe no-signaling principle in quantum mechanics, the internal observer is\ninherently non-local and may be acausal. However, its consistency is maintained\nthrough the formulation of the self-consistency principle.\n  One of the goals of this paper is to construct the representation of the\ninternal observer from the local external algebra of observables, which can be\nassociated with external observers.

However, the phenomenon of\ndata silos and the problem of privacy leakage have seriously hindered the\ndevelopment of DNA motif discovery. On the one hand, the phenomenon of data\nsilos makes data collection difficult. On the other hand, the collection and\nuse of DNA data become complicated and difficult because DNA is sensitive\nprivate information. In this context, how discovering DNA motifs under the\npremise of ensuring privacy and security and alleviating data silos has become\na very important issue. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method, namely\nDP-FLMD, to address this problem. Note that this is the first application of\nfederated learning to the field of genetics research. The federated learning\ntechnique is used to solve the problem of data silos. It has the advantage of\nenabling multiple participants to train models together and providing privacy\nprotection services. To address the challenges of federated learning in terms\nof communication costs, this paper applies a sampling method and a strategy for\nreducing communication costs to DP-FLMD. In addition, differential privacy, a\nprivacy protection technique with rigorous mathematical proof, is also applied\nto DP-FLMD. Experiments on the DNA datasets show that DP-FLMD has high mining\naccuracy and runtime efficiency, and the performance of the algorithm is\naffected by some parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 10:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

For linear systems, inverse Kalman filter (I-KF) has\nbeen recently shown to be effective in these counter-adversarial applications.\nIn the paper, contrary to prior works, we focus on non-linear system dynamics\nand formulate the inverse unscented KF (I-UKF) to estimate the defender's state\nwith reduced linearization errors. We then generalize this framework to an\nunknown system model by proposing reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based UKF\n(RKHS-UKF) to learn the system dynamics and estimate the state based on its\nobservations. Our theoretical analyses to guarantee the stochastic stability of\nI-UKF and RKHS-UKF in the mean-squared sense shows that, provided the forward\nfilters are stable, the inverse filters are also stable under mild system-level\nconditions. Our numerical experiments for several different applications\ndemonstrate the state estimation performance of the proposed filters using\nrecursive Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bound as a benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 10:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Plasmas are\nalso unique amongst accelerator technologies in that they respond differently\nto beams of opposite charge. The asymmetric response of a plasma to\nhighly-relativistic electron and positron beams arises from the fact that\nplasmas are composed of light, mobile electrons and heavy, stationary ions.\nHollow channel plasma acceleration is a technique for symmetrizing the response\nof the plasma, such that it works equally well for high-energy electron and\npositron beams. In the experiment described here, we demonstrate the generation\nof a positron beam-driven wake in an extended, annular plasma channel, and\nacceleration of a second trailing witness positron bunch by the wake. The\nleading bunch excites the plasma wakefield and loses energy to the plasma,\nwhile the witness bunch experiences an accelerating field and gains energy,\nthus providing a proof-of-concept for hollow channel acceleration of positron\nbeams.

Due to the limited\nbandwidth of the channel, a delay may appear while receiving the measurements.\nThis delay can be arbitrary step random, and packets are sometimes dropped\nduring transmission as it exceeds a certain permissible number. In this paper,\nsuch measurements are modeled with the Poisson distribution, which allows the\nuser to determine the maximum delay the system might suffer. When the\nmeasurement delay exceeds the permissible number, the packet dropout happens.\nBased on the proposed model, we solve the problem by assuming that the prior\nand posterior densities of states are Gaussian and derive the expression of the\nestimated state and the error covariance. Later, relaxing the Gaussian\nassumption for densities, we propose a solution with the help of the sequential\nMonte Carlo (SMC) approach. The proposed SMC method divides the set of\nparticles into several groups, where each group supports the possibility that\nthe received measurement is delayed by a certain number of steps. The strength\nof an individual group is determined by the probability of a measurement being\ndelayed with the same number of steps that the group represents. This approach\nestimates the states and also assesses the amount of delay from the received\nmeasurements. Finally, the developed estimators are implemented on two\nnonlinear estimation problems, and the simulation results are compared. The\nproposed SMC approach shows better results compared to the designed Gaussian\ndelay filters and existing particle filters with delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 11:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Existing methods usually require pre-processed 2D\noptical flow and depth maps by additional methods to supervise the network,\nmaking them suffer from the inaccuracy of the pre-processed supervision and the\nambiguity when lifting the 2D information to 3D. In this paper, we tackle this\nchallenge in an unsupervised fashion. Specifically, we decouple the motion of\nthe dynamic objects into object motion and camera motion, respectively\nregularized by proposed unsupervised surface consistency and patch-based\nmulti-view constraints. The former enforces the 3D geometric surfaces of moving\nobjects to be consistent over time, while the latter regularizes their\nappearances to be consistent across different viewpoints.

Protostellar cores have higher gas\nmasses, surface densities, column densities, and volume densities than\nprestellar cores, indicating core mass growth from the prestellar to the\nprotostellar phase. We find that ~80% of cores with virial parameter ($\\alpha$)\nmeasurements are gravitationally bound ($\\alpha$< 2). We also find an\nanti-correlation between the mass and the virial parameter of cores, with\nmassive cores having on average lower virial parameters. Protostellar cores are\nmore gravitationally bound than prestellar cores, with an average virial\nparameter of 1.2 and 1.5, respectively. The observed non-thermal velocity\ndispersion (from N$_{2}$D$^{+}$ or DCO$^{+}$) is consistent with simulations in\nwhich turbulence is continuously injected, whereas the core-to-core velocity\ndispersion is neither in agreement with driven nor decaying turbulence\nsimulations. We find no significant increment in the line velocity dispersion\nfrom prestellar to protostellar cores, suggesting that dense gas within the\ncore traced by these deuterated molecules is not yet severely affected by\nturbulence injected from outflow activity at the early evolutionary stages\ntraced in ASHES. The most massive cores are strongly self-gravitating and have\ngreater surface density, Mach number, and velocity dispersion than cores with\nlower masses. Dense cores have not significant velocity shifts relative to\ntheir low-density envelopes, suggesting that dense cores are co-moving with\ntheir envelopes. We conclude that the observed core properties are more in line\nwith predictions of ``clump-fed\" scenarios rather than with ``core-fed\"\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 11:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

To this end, we here simulate the execution of\nthree quantum algorithms on noisy quantum computers using matrix product states\nas a special class of tensor networks.

This raises the\nnatural question of how many simultaneous storage spaces, or \"running buffers\",\nare required so that certain classes of tabletop rearrangement problems are\nfeasible. In this work, we examine the problem for both labeled and unlabeled\nsettings. On the structural side, we observe that finding the minimum number of\nrunning buffers (MRB) can be carried out on a dependency graph abstracted from\na problem instance, and show that computing MRB is NP-hard. We then prove that\nunder both labeled and unlabeled settings, even for uniform cylindrical\nobjects, the number of required running buffers may grow unbounded as the\nnumber of objects to be rearranged increases. We further show that the bound\nfor the unlabeled case is tight. On the algorithmic side, we develop effective\nexact algorithms for finding MRB for both labeled and unlabeled tabletop\nrearrangement problems, scalable to over a hundred objects under very high\nobject density. More importantly, our algorithms also compute a sequence\nwitnessing the computed MRB that can be used for solving object rearrangement\ntasks. Employing these algorithms, empirical evaluations reveal that random\nlabeled and unlabeled instances, which more closely mimics real-world setups,\ngenerally have fairly small MRBs. Using real robot experiments, we demonstrate\nthat the running buffer abstraction leads to state-of-the-art solutions for\nin-place rearrangement of many objects in tight, bounded workspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 12:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Even in crowded scenarios, they allow\nfinding a feasible solution that brings each agent to its target, preventing\ndeadlock situations. However, generally, rule-based algorithms provide\nsolutions that are much longer than the optimal one. The main contribution of\nthis paper is the introduction of an iterative local search procedure in MAPF.\nWe start from a feasible suboptimal solution and we perform a local search in a\nneighborhood of this solution, to find a shorter one. Iteratively, we repeat\nthis procedure until the solution cannot be shortened any longer. At the end,\nwe obtain a solution, that is still sub-optimal, but, in general, of much\nbetter quality than the initial one. We use dynamic programming for the local\nsearch procedure. Under this respect, the fact that our search is local is\nfundamental to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm. Indeed, if we apply\na standard dynamic programming the number of explored states grows\nexponentially with the number of agents. As we will see, the introduction of a\nlocality constraint allows solving the (local) dynamic programming problem in a\ntime that grows only polynomially with respect to the number of agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 12:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

This type of encounters can be\ndivided into two classes depending on whether the final outcome includes BBHs.\nThis outcome is primarily determined by which two objects meet at the first\nclosest approach. BBHs are more likely to form when the star and the incoming\nBH encounter first with an impact parameter smaller than the binary's semimajor\naxis. In this case, the star is frequently disrupted.

For the parameters chosen in\nthis study, BBH formation, accompanied by stellar disruption, happens in\nroughly 1 out of 4 encounters. The close correlation between BBH formation and\nstellar disruption has possible implications for EM counterparts at the\nbinary's merger. The BH that disrupts the star is promptly surrounded by an\noptically and geometrically thick disk with accretion rates exceeding the\nEddington limit. If the debris disk cools fast enough to become long-lived, EM\ncounterparts can be produced at the time of the BBH merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 13:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

We initially consider 1D spline spaces of arbitrary degree\nspanned over uniform and non-uniform knot sequences, and then the generated\noptimal rules are used for integration over higher-dimensional spaces using\ntensor product sense. The quadrature rule search is posed as an optimization\nproblem and solved by a machine learning strategy based on gradient-descent.\nHowever, since the optimization space is highly non-convex, the success of the\nsearch strongly depends on the number of quadrature points and the parameter\ninitialization. Thus, we use a dynamic programming strategy that initializes\nthe parameters from the optimal solution over the spline space with a lower\nnumber of knots. With this method, we found optimal quadrature rules for spline\nspaces when using IGA discretizations with up to 50 uniform elements and\npolynomial degrees up to 8, showing the generality of the approach in this\nscenario. For non-uniform partitions, the method also finds an optimal rule in\na reasonable number of test cases.

In recent work,\nwe have shown that such systems relax locally to a maximum entropy ensemble\nthat we have dubbed the PT-symmetric generalized Gibbs ensemble (PTGGE), in\nanalogy to the generalized Gibbs ensemble that describes the steady state of\nisolated integrable quantum many-body systems after a quench. Here, using\ndriven-dissipative versions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the\nKitaev chain as paradigmatic model systems, we corroborate and substantially\nexpand upon our previous results. In particular, we confirm the validity of a\ndissipative quasiparticle picture at finite dissipation by demonstrating light\ncone spreading of correlations and the linear growth and saturation to the\nPTGGE prediction of the quasiparticle-pair contribution to the subsystem\nentropy in the PT-symmetric phase. Further, we introduce the concept of\ndirectional pumping phases, which is related to the non-Hermitian topology of\nthe Liouvillian and based upon qualitatively different dynamics of the dual\nstring order parameter and the subsystem fermion parity in the SSH model and\nthe Kitaev chain, respectively: Depending on the postquench parameters, there\ncan be pumping of string order and fermion parity through both ends of a\nsubsystem corresponding to a finite segment of the one-dimensional lattice,\nthrough only one end, or there can be no pumping at all. We show that\ntransitions between dynamical pumping phases give rise to a new and independent\ntype of dynamical critical behavior of the rates of directional pumping, which\nare determined by the soft modes of the PTGGE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 14:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

The differences\nbetween these probabilities should not be interpreted as a measure of the\nisospin violation. Due to the short range of the strong interaction where the\nisospin is manifested, the isospin nature is provided by the couplings of the\nstate found to the $D^0 D^{*+}$, $D^+ D^{*0}$ components, and our results for\nthese couplings indicate that we have an $I=0$ state with a very small isospin\nbreaking. We also find that the potential obtained provides a repulsive\ninteraction in $I=1$, preventing the formation of an $I=1$ state, in agreement\nwith what is observed in the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 15:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Our algorithm is based on iterated information projections, and, in\ncontrast to general convex body chasing algorithms, is entirely memoryless.\n  We also show how to round our solution dynamically to obtain the first fully\ndynamic algorithms with competitive recourse for all the stated problems above;\ni.e. their recourse is less than the recourse of every other algorithm on every\nupdate sequence, up to polylogarithmic factors. This is a significantly\nstronger notion than the notion of absolute recourse in the dynamic algorithms\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 15:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

This allows complex interaction and migration\nbehaviours that are dependent on competition. For migration, we assume that the\nresponse of individuals to competition is governed by tolerance to their group\nmembers, such that less tolerant individuals are more likely to move away due\nto competition. We looked at the success of a mutant in the rare mutation limit\nfor the complete, cycle and star networks.

The estimator has the\nfollowing notable advantages: first, no controlled experiment or data is\nrequired to conduct the practical identifiability analysis; second, different\nforms of uncertainties, such as model form, parameter, or measurement can be\ntaken into account; third, the identifiability analysis is global, rather than\nbeing dependent on a realization of parameters. If an individual parameter has\nlow identifiability, it can belong to an identifiable subset such that\nparameters within the subset have a functional relationship and thus have a\ncombined effect on the statistical model. The practical identifiability\nframework is extended to highlight the dependencies between parameter pairs\nthat emerge a posteriori to find identifiable parameter subsets. Examining the\npractical identifiability of an individual parameter along with its\ndependencies with other parameters is informative for an estimation-centric\nparameterization and model selection.
