However, corresponding class labels\nare noisy when provided by error-prone annotators, e.g., crowd workers.\nTraining standard deep neural networks leads to subpar performances in such\nmulti-annotator supervised learning settings. We address this issue by\npresenting a probabilistic training framework named multi-annotator deep\nlearning (MaDL). A ground truth and an annotator performance model are jointly\ntrained in an end-to-end learning approach. The ground truth model learns to\npredict instances' true class labels, while the annotator performance model\ninfers probabilistic estimates of annotators' performances. A modular network\narchitecture enables us to make varying assumptions regarding annotators'\nperformances, e.g., an optional class or instance dependency. Further, we learn\nannotator embeddings to estimate annotators' densities within a latent space as\nproxies of their potentially correlated annotations. Together with a weighted\nloss function, we improve the learning from correlated annotation patterns. In\na comprehensive evaluation, we examine three research questions about\nmulti-annotator supervised learning. Our findings indicate MaDL's\nstate-of-the-art performance and robustness against many correlated, spamming\nannotators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 16:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

With precise proper motion surveys such as Gaia, it is\npossible to trace back the motion of stars in the vicinity of young remnants to\nsearch for ejected companions. Establishing the fraction of remnants with an\nejected companion, and the photometric and kinematic properties of these stars,\noffers unique insight into supernova progenitor systems. In this paper, we\nemploy binary population synthesis to produce kinematic and photometric\npredictions for ejected secondary stars. We demonstrate that the unbound\nneutron star velocity distribution from supernovae in binaries closely traces\nthe input kicks. Therefore, the observed distribution of neutron star\nvelocities should be representative of their natal kicks. We evaluate the\nprobability for any given filter, magnitude limit, minimum measurable proper\nmotion (as a function of magnitude), temporal baseline, distance and extinction\nthat an unbound companion can be associated with a remnant.

Strong magnetic concentrations are associated with stronger\nF10.7 cm gyroresonance emission. Considering that as the solar cycle moves from\nminimum to maximum, the size of sunspots and their field strength increase with\ngyroresonance component, the distinctly different tendencies of radio emission\nand coronal abundances in the vicinity of sunspots is the likely cause of\nsaturation of Sun-as-a-star coronal abundances during solar maximum, while the\nF10.7 index remains well correlated with the sunspot number and other magnetic\nfield proxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 16:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

To find\nsimilar savings figures we need to go back to 1999. With consumption reduced to\na bare minimum, the Portuguese were forced to save. Households reduced spending\nmore because of a lack of alternatives to consumption than for any other\nreason. The relationship between consumption, savings, and income has occupied\nan important role in economic thought [(Keynes, 1936; 1937); (Friedman, 1957)].\nTraditionally, high levels of savings have been associated with benefits to the\neconomy, since financing capacity is enhanced (Singh, 2010). However, the\neffects here can be twofold. On the one hand, it seems that Portugal faced the\nso-called Savings Paradox (Keynes, 1936). If consumers decide to save a\nconsiderable part of their income, there will be less demand for the goods\nproduced. Lower demand will lead to lower supply, production, income, and,\nparadoxically, fewer savings. On the other hand, after having accumulated\nsavings at the peak of the pandemic, the Portuguese are now using them to carry\nout postponed consumption and, hopefully, to better resist the escalating\ninflation. This study aims to examine Portuguese households' savings evolution\nduring the most critical period of the pandemic, between March 2020 and April\n2022. The methodology analyses the correlation between savings, consumption,\nand GDP as well as GDP's decomposition into its various components and\nconcluded that these suddenly forced savings do not fit traditional economic\ntheories of savings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 16:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Our proofs rely upon (1) a multiscale construction\ninspired by work on the Kakeya conjecture in harmonic analysis, and (2) a novel\nreduction that demonstrates that block Krylov algorithms are optimal for this\nproblem, as well as connections to lower bound techniques based on Wishart\nmatrices developed in the matrix-vector query literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 17:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

The typical approach for WSSS involves\ntraining an image classification network using global average pooling (GAP) on\nconvolutional feature maps. This enables the estimation of object locations\nbased on class activation maps (CAMs), which identify the importance of image\nregions. The CAMs are then used to generate pseudo-labels, in the form of\nsegmentation masks, to supervise a segmentation model in the absence of\npixel-level ground truth. In case of the SEAM baseline, a previous work\nproposed to improve CAM learning in two ways: (1) Importance sampling, which is\na substitute for GAP, and (2) the feature similarity loss, which utilizes a\nheuristic that object contours almost exclusively align with color edges in\nimages. In this work, we propose a different probabilistic interpretation of\nCAMs for these techniques, rendering the likelihood more appropriate than the\nmultinomial posterior. As a result, we propose an add-on method that can boost\nessentially any previous WSSS method, improving both the region similarity and\ncontour quality of all implemented state-of-the-art baselines. This is\ndemonstrated on a wide variety of baselines on the PASCAL VOC dataset.\nExperiments on the MS COCO dataset show that performance gains can also be\nachieved in a large-scale setting.

The operator dynamics arise from the\ncompetition between noisy and static couplings, leading to diffusion regardless\nof ballistic transport or Stark localization in the clean limit. The universal\ndiffusive behavior is attributed to a noise-induced bound state arising in the\noperator equations of motion at small momentum. By mapping the noise-averaged\noperator equation of motion to a one-dimensional non-hermitian hopping model,\nwe analytically solve for the diffusion constant, which scales\nnon-monotonically with noise strength, revealing regions of enhanced and\nsuppressed diffusion from the interplay between onsite and bond dephasing\nnoise, and a linear potential. For large onsite dephasing, the diffusion\nconstant vanishes, indicating an emergent localization. On the other hand, the\noperator equation becomes the diffusion equation for strong bond dephasing and\nis unaffected by additional arbitrarily strong static terms that commute with\nthe local charge, including density-density interactions. The bound state\nenters a continuum of scattering states at finite noise and vanishes.

Hence, an early stopped\nmodel is more robust (hence, a better surrogate) than fully trained models.

Recent work has significantly\nimproved semi-supervised medical image segmentation in long-tailed scenarios by\nequipping them with unsupervised contrastive criteria. However, it remains\nunclear how well they will perform in the labeled portion of data where class\ndistribution is also highly imbalanced. In this work, we present ACTION++, an\nimproved contrastive learning framework with adaptive anatomical contrast for\nsemi-supervised medical segmentation. Specifically, we propose an adaptive\nsupervised contrastive loss, where we first compute the optimal locations of\nclass centers uniformly distributed on the embedding space (i.e., off-line),\nand then perform online contrastive matching training by encouraging different\nclass features to adaptively match these distinct and uniformly distributed\nclass centers.

We propose a novel B-frame coding architecture\nbased on two-layer Conditional Augmented Normalization Flows (CANF). It has the\nstriking feature of not transmitting any motion information. Our proposed idea\nof video compression without motion coding offers a new direction for learned\nvideo coding. Our base layer is a low-resolution image compressor that replaces\nthe full-resolution motion compressor. The low-resolution coded image is merged\nwith the warped high-resolution images to generate a high-quality image as a\nconditioning signal for the enhancement-layer image coding in full resolution.\nOne advantage of this architecture is significantly reduced computational\ncomplexity due to eliminating the motion information compressor. In addition,\nwe adopt a skip-mode coding technique to reduce the transmitted latent samples.\nThe rate-distortion performance of our scheme is slightly lower than that of\nthe state-of-the-art learned B-frame coding scheme, B-CANF, but outperforms\nother learned B-frame coding schemes. However, compared to B-CANF, our scheme\nsaves 45% of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) for encoding and 27% of MACs\nfor decoding.

Recent studies show that modern image segmentation models are\nvulnerable to adversarial perturbations, while existing attack methods mainly\nfollow the idea of attacking image classification models. We argue that image\nsegmentation and classification have inherent differences, and design an attack\nframework specially for image segmentation models. Our attack framework is\ninspired by certified radius, which was originally used by defenders to defend\nagainst adversarial perturbations to classification models. We are the first,\nfrom the attacker perspective, to leverage the properties of certified radius\nand propose a certified radius guided attack framework against image\nsegmentation models. Specifically, we first adapt randomized smoothing, the\nstate-of-the-art certification method for classification models, to derive the\npixel's certified radius. We then focus more on disrupting pixels with\nrelatively smaller certified radii and design a pixel-wise certified radius\nguided loss, when plugged into any existing white-box attack, yields our\ncertified radius-guided white-box attack. Next, we propose the first black-box\nattack to image segmentation models via bandit. We design a novel gradient\nestimator, based on bandit feedback, which is query-efficient and provably\nunbiased and stable. We use this gradient estimator to design a projected\nbandit gradient descent (PBGD) attack, as well as a certified radius-guided\nPBGD (CR-PBGD) attack. We prove our PBGD and CR-PBGD attacks can achieve\nasymptotically optimal attack performance with an optimal rate.

In\nthis work, we aim to quantitatively define the inner edge of the Hycean\nhabitable zone using a 1D radiative-convective model. As a limiting case, we\nmodel a dry hydrogen-helium envelope above a surface ocean. We find that 10 to\n20 bars of atmosphere produces enough greenhouse effect to drive a liquid\nsurface ocean supercritical when forced with current Earth-like instellation.\nIntroducing water vapour into the atmosphere, we show the runaway greenhouse\ninstellation limit is greatly reduced due to the presence of superadiabatic\nlayers where convection is inhibited.

Recently, a deep learning-based method\ndemonstrated superior performance in extracting whistles under varying noise\nconditions.

As space exploration and economy expanding at an\nunprecedented pace, the aforementioned applications that potentially deployable\nin space call for the understanding of thermal bubble phenomena in a\nmicrogravity setting. In this work, we investigate the nucleation and growth of\nsurface bubble in space, where the gravity effect is negligible compared to the\nearth. We observe much faster bubble nucleation, and the growth rate can be ~30\ntimes higher than that on the earth. Our finite element thermofluidic\nsimulations show that the thermal convective flow due to gravity around the\nnucleation site is the key factor that effectively dissipates the heat from\nheating substrate to the bulk liquid and slows down the bubble nucleation and\ngrowth processes. Due to the microgravity field in space, the thermal\nconvective flow is negligible compared to the terrestrial environment, leading\nto the localization of heat around the nucleation site, and thus enables faster\nbubble nucleation and growth in space. We also find that bubble nucleation can\nbe influenced by the characteristic length of the microstructures on the\nheating surface.

Rather than allow one central actor to control this\nrevenue source, recent research has studied mechanisms for decentralizing the\nprocess of computing an ordering among multiple, distributed replicas. This\nproblem is akin to the classic problem from social choice theory of aggregating\nordinal votes, applied to a streaming setting. Prior work proposes a\n``$\\gamma$-batch-order-fairness'' requirement on the aggregate ordering. Under\nthis requirement, the ordering should be divisible into contiguous batches, and\nwhen a $\\gamma$ fraction of replicas receive $tx$ before $tx^\\prime$, then\n$tx^\\prime$ cannot be in an earlier batch than $tx$.\n  We extend this definition to formalize the notion that these batches should\nhave minimal size, thereby giving the first notion of order fairness that\ncannot be vacuously satisfied (by arbitrarily large batches) and that can be\nsatisfied in the presence of faulty replicas. We then show that the Ranked\nPairs aggregation method produces an ordering that satisfies our fairness\ndefinition for every choice of parameter $\\gamma$ simultaneously and for any\nnumber of faulty replicas (where fairness guarantees linearly degrade as the\nfraction of faulty replicas increases).\n  We then instantiate our protocol in the streaming setting. Careful analysis\nof the interactions between ordering dependencies enables our protocol to\nsimulate Ranked Pairs voting in this setting, and adjustments to ordering\nalgorithm give a protocol that (under synchronous network assumptions) always\nappends a transaction to the output ordering after a bounded amount of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 20:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

In\norder for users with physical limitations to operate these robots, their\ninterfaces must be accessible and cater to the specific needs of all users. As\nphysical limitations vary amongst users, it is difficult to make a single\ninterface that will accommodate all users. Instead, such interfaces should be\ncustomizable to each individual user.

Notably, we show that this phenomenon\narises for light waves even in the simple case of isotropic and homogeneous\ndisorder, and can be controlled by tuning the turbidity of the system.

Recently, this question has been\nconsidered from the perspective of large deviation theory, for different types\nof MCMC methods, including, e.g., non-reversible Metropolis-Hastings on a\nfinite state space, non-reversible Langevin samplers, the zig-zag sampler, and\nparallell tempering.

K2-136c is now the smallest planet to have a measured mass in\nan open cluster and one of the youngest planets ever with a mass measurement.\nK2-136c has $\\sim$75% the radius of Neptune but is similar in mass, yielding a\ndensity of $3.69^{+0.67}_{-0.56}$ g cm$^{-3}$ ($\\sim$2-3 times denser than\nNeptune). Mass estimates for K2-136b (and possibly d) may be feasible with more\nRV observations, and insights into all three planets' atmospheres through\ntransmission spectroscopy would be challenging but potentially fruitful. This\nresearch and future mass measurements of young planets are critical for\ninvestigating the compositions and characteristics of small exoplanets at very\nearly stages of their lives and providing insights into how exoplanets evolve\nwith time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 22:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

There are two main challenges in liver transplant: finding the\nbest matching patient for a donor and ensuring transplant equity among\ndifferent subpopulations. The current MELD scoring system evaluates a patient's\nmortality risk if not receiving an organ within 90 days. However, the\ndonor-patient matching should also take into consideration post-transplant risk\nfactors, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic rejection, etc., which are all\ncommon complications after transplant. Accurate prediction of these risk scores\nremains a significant challenge. In this study, we will use predictive models\nto solve the above challenge. We propose a deep learning framework model to\npredict multiple risk factors after a liver transplant. By formulating it as a\nmulti-task learning problem, the proposed deep neural network was trained on\nthis data to simultaneously predict the five post-transplant risks and achieve\nequally good performance by leveraging task balancing techniques. We also\npropose a novel fairness achieving algorithm and to ensure prediction fairness\nacross different subpopulations. We used electronic health records of 160,360\nliver transplant patients, including demographic information, clinical\nvariables, and laboratory values, collected from the liver transplant records\nof the United States from 1987 to 2018. The performance of the model was\nevaluated using various performance metrics such as AUROC, AURPC, and accuracy.\nThe results of our experiments demonstrate that the proposed multitask\nprediction model achieved high accuracy and good balance in predicting all five\npost-transplant risk factors, with a maximum accuracy discrepancy of only 2.7%.\nThe fairness-achieving algorithm significantly reduced the fairness disparity\ncompared to the baseline model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 22:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

To prevent the face images from being misused, one straightforward\napproach is to modify the raw face images before sharing them, which inevitably\ndestroys the semantic information, increases the difficulty of retroactivity,\nand is still prone to adaptive attacks. Therefore, an auditing method that does\nnot interfere with the facial recognition model's utility and cannot be quickly\nbypassed is urgently needed.\n  In this paper, we formulate the auditing process as a user-level membership\ninference problem and propose a complete toolkit FACE-AUDITOR that can\ncarefully choose the probing set to query the few-shot-based facial recognition\nmodel and determine whether any of a user's face images is used in training the\nmodel.

While over the past decade several\ndemonstrations of such ground-state cooled systems have been achieved, in\nparticular in sideband-resolved cavity optomechanics, for many systems\novercoming the heating rate from the thermal bath remains a major challenge. In\ncontrast, optomechanical systems in the sideband-unresolved limit are much\neasier to realize due to the relaxed requirements on the optical properties of\nthe system. For such a system, a measurement based real-time control scheme can\nbe implemented to reduce its motional energy, and the achievable energy is\nultimately limited by the correlation between the measurement precision and the\nback-action due to the measurement.

Yet, real-world graphs commonly exhibit diverse graph structures and\ncontain heterogeneous nodes and edges. Moreover, to enhance the generalization\nability of GNNs, it has become common practice to further increase the\ndiversity of training graph structures by incorporating graph augmentations\nand/or performing large-scale pre-training on more graphs. Therefore, it\nbecomes essential for a GNN to simultaneously model diverse graph structures.\nYet, naively increasing the GNN model capacity will suffer from both higher\ninference costs and the notorious trainability issue of GNNs. This paper\nintroduces the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) idea to GNNs, aiming to enhance their\nability to accommodate the diversity of training graph structures, without\nincurring computational overheads. Our new Graph Mixture of Expert (GMoE) model\nenables each node in the graph to dynamically select its own optimal\n\\textit{information aggregation experts}.

The traditional hypercube queue model is\nconstrained to light-traffic operations, where officers are either ``busy'' or\n``not busy''. However, contemporary service operations often experience\nsaturation, necessitating the inclusion of heavy-traffic operations with queue\nlengths greater than one. The motivation to address the heavy-traffic regime\nstems from the increased workload and staff shortages prevalent in modern\nservice systems. The design of overlapping regions is inspired by boundary\neffects in crime incidents, which require overlapping patrol regions for\nefficient resource allocation.

The quantum versions of\nthese models allow the processors instead to communicate and compute with\nquantum bits under the same bandwidth limitations. This leads to the following\nnatural research question: What problems can be solved more efficiently in\nthese quantum models than in the classical ones? Building on existing work, we\ncontribute to this question in two ways. Firstly, we present two algorithms in\nthe Quantum CONGEST-CLIQUE model of distributed computation that succeed with\nhigh probability; one for producing an approximately optimal Steiner Tree, and\none for producing an exact directed minimum spanning tree, each of which uses\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ rounds of communication and $\\tilde{O}(n^{9/4})$ messages,\nwhere $n$ is the number of nodes in the network.

At a high level, we achieve these results by\ncombining classical algorithmic frameworks with quantum subroutines. An\nexisting framework for using distributed version of Grover's search algorithm\nto accelerate triangle finding lies at the core of the asymptotic speedup.\nSecondly, we carefully characterize the constants and logarithmic factors\ninvolved in our algorithms as well as related algorithms, otherwise commonly\nobscured by $\\tilde{O}$ notation.

Grover's quantum search algorithm is a\ntypical quantum algorithm that proves the superiority of quantum computing over\nclassical computing. It has a quadratic reduction in the query complexity of\ndatabase search, and is known to be optimal when no a priori information about\nthe elements of the database is provided. In this work, we consider a\nprobabilistic Grover's search algorithm allowing nonzero probability of failure\nfor a database with general a priori probability distribution of the elements,\nand minimize the number of oracle calls by optimizing the initial state of the\nquantum system and the reflection axis of the diffusion operator. The initial\nstate and the reflection axis are allowed not to coincide, and thus the quantum\nsearch algorithm rotates the quantum system in a three-dimensional subspace\nspanned by the initial state, the reflection axis and the search target state.\nThe number of oracle calls is minimized by a variational method, and formal\nanalytical results are obtained with the assumption of low failure probability.\nThe results show that for nonuniform a priori distribution of the oracle\nelements, the number of oracle calls can be significantly reduced given a small\ndecrease in the success probability of the quantum search algorithm, leading to\na lower average number of oracle calls to find the solution of the search\nproblem. The result is applied to a simple but nontrivial database model which\nhas $N$ elements with nonuniform two-valued a priori probabilities to show the\neffect of the optimized search algorithm. The paper is concluded with a\ndiscussion about the generalization to higher-order results that allows a\nlarger failure probability for the quantum search algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 04:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

The key question of our interest is whether the front-end resizer\naffects the performance of deep vision models? In this paper, we present an\nextremely lightweight multilayer Laplacian resizer with only a handful of\ntrainable parameters, dubbed MULLER resizer. MULLER has a bandpass nature in\nthat it learns to boost details in certain frequency subbands that benefit the\ndownstream recognition models.

Without a Haldane flux, band engineering makes the band touching\npoints (the so-called Dirac points) move towards each other and eventually\nmerge into one at an intermediate $\\mathbf{M}$ point in the Brillouin zone.\nHere the dispersion is linear along one direction and quadratic along the\nother. In the presence of a Haldane flux, the system acquires topological\nproperties, and finite Chern numbers can be associated with the pairs of the\nconduction and the valence bands. The valence band closer to the Fermi level\n($E_F$) possesses Chern numbers equal to $\\pm2$ and $\\pm1$, while the one\nfurther away from $E_F$ corresponds to Chern numbers $\\pm1$. The conduction\nbands are associated with similar properties, except their signs are reversed.\nThe Chern lobes shrink in the band-engineered model, and we find evidence of\nmultiple topological phase transitions, where the Chern numbers discontinuously\njump from $\\pm2$ to $\\mp2$, $\\pm1$ to $\\mp1$, $\\pm1$ to $0$ to $\\pm2$ and\n$\\pm2$ to $\\pm1$. These transitions are supported by the presence or absence of\nthe chiral edge modes in a nanoribbon bilayer geometry and the vanishing of the\nplateau in the anomalous Hall conductivity. Different phases are further\ncomputed for different hopping amplitudes across the layers, which shows the\nshrinking of the Chern lobes for large interlayer tunneling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 06:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

DSRC V2X technology has been planned at traffic signal\nin Tennessee, e.g., 152 Roadside Units (RSUs) were planned by TDOT using DSRC\nV2X and Bluetooth combination units in the I-24 smart corridor. Similarly, many\npilot programs and testbeds around the nation have deployed DSRC V2X technology\nand are now impacted by the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) ruling on\nopening safety band. The implication is that DSRC V2X deployments (and future\ndeployments) should migrate to C-V2X. Notably, dual-mode RSUs are available\nalong with LTE C-V2X. The transition can be done by working with vendors, but\nsurely this involves more than swapping DSRC V2X devices with LTE C-V2X\ndevices. Complicating the migration to C-V2X is TDOT's role in traffic signal\noperations and maintenance, which is limited to funding and\ndesigning/construction of traffic signals, but local agencies operate and\nmaintain signals.

Considering the abovementioned point, we developed\na novel methodology for efficient HEA production using a low ball-to-powder\nratio (BPR). Using different milling times, we manufactured four HEA powder\nprecursors using a BPR of 5:1, which were later sintered via the Spark Plasma\nSintering technique and heat treated. Microstructural characterization was\nperformed by optical microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy equipped with EDS\nand EBSD detectors, and X-ray diffraction. Mechanical properties were measured\nusing nano and microhardness techniques. In this work, we follow the structural\nevolution of the material and connect it with the strengthening effect as a\nfunction of milling time. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of different\nsintering and annealing conditions, proving that HEAs characterized by high\nmechanical properties may be manufactured using low BPR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 06:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

Further, we propose specific sensing\nmethodologies such that the memory array can support RAM-only or ROM-only mode\n(context-switching (CS) mode) or RAM and ROM mode simultaneously (dual-context\n(DC) mode). Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations have verified the robustness of\nour proposed ROM-augmented CS/DC memory on the Globalfoundries 22nm-FDX\ntechnology node.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 07:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

Recent insights from random matrix theory, specifically those\nconcerning the spectral analysis of weight matrices in deep neural networks,\noffer valuable clues to address this issue. A key finding indicates that the\ngeneralization performance of a neural network is associated with the degree of\nheavy tails in the spectrum of its weight matrices. To capitalize on this\ndiscovery, we introduce a novel regularization technique, termed Heavy-Tailed\nRegularization, which explicitly promotes a more heavy-tailed spectrum in the\nweight matrix through regularization. Firstly, we employ the Weighted Alpha and\nStable Rank as penalty terms, both of which are differentiable, enabling the\ndirect calculation of their gradients. To circumvent over-regularization, we\nintroduce two variations of the penalty function. Then, adopting a Bayesian\nstatistics perspective and leveraging knowledge from random matrices, we\ndevelop two novel heavy-tailed regularization methods, utilizing Powerlaw\ndistribution and Frechet distribution as priors for the global spectrum and\nmaximum eigenvalues, respectively. We empirically show that heavytailed\nregularization outperforms conventional regularization techniques in terms of\ngeneralization performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 07:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 04:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

In lab-on-a-chip applications, constrictions are\ncommonly used for cell sorting and plasma separation based on the formation of\na cell-free layer (CFL) at the channel boundary.

For angles of attack corresponding to the onset\nof separation, the pressure fluctuations are characterized by bi-stability in\nboth space and time: for each spanwise location, large excursions of the local\nwall pressure between two different levels can be observed in time (jumps), and\nthese excursions are highly anti-correlated between the two spanwise locations\n(spatial switches). The characteristic time scale for the switches is found to\nbe well correlated with the pressure variance. Application of Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition (POD) analysis to each row of sensors confirms that the flow\nseparation is an inherently local, three-dimensional and unsteady process that\noccurs in a continuous manner when the angle of attack increases. The\ncorrelation between the dominant POD mode amplitudes is found to be a good\nindicator of bi-stability. Moreover, most of the fluctuations can be captured\nwith the two most energetic POD modes. This suggests that force fluctuations\nnear the maximal lift could be modelled by a low-order approach, for monitoring\nand control purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 08:34:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 16:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

However, answers to\nopen-ended questions are text data which are harder to analyze. Traditionally,\nanswers were manually classified as specified in the coding manual. Most of the\neffort to automate coding has gone into the easier problem of single label\nprediction, where answers are classified into a single code. However, open-ends\nthat require multi-label classification, i.e., that are assigned multiple\ncodes, occur frequently. This paper focuses on multi-label classification of\ntext answers to open-ended survey questions in social science surveys. We\nevaluate the performance of the transformer-based architecture BERT for the\nGerman language in comparison to traditional multi-label algorithms (Binary\nRelevance, Label Powerset, ECC) in a German social science survey, the GLES\nPanel (N=17,584, 55 labels). We find that classification with BERT (forcing at\nleast one label) has the smallest 0/1 loss (13.1%) among methods considered\n(18.9%-21.6%). As expected, it is much easier to correctly predict answer texts\nthat correspond to a single label (7.1% loss) than those that correspond to\nmultiple labels ($\\sim$50% loss). Because BERT predicts zero labels for only\n1.5% of the answers, forcing at least one label, while recommended, ultimately\ndoes not lower the 0/1 loss by much. Our work has important implications for\nsocial scientists: 1) We have shown multi-label classification with BERT works\nin the German language for open-ends. 2) For mildly multi-label classification\ntasks, the loss now appears small enough to allow for fully automatic\nclassification (as compared to semi-automatic approaches). 3) Multi-label\nclassification with BERT requires only a single model. The leading competitor,\nECC, iterates through individual single label predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 09:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

To alleviate the influence of domain shift, plenty of previous\nwork try to decouple and learn the domain-invariant (common) features from\nsource domains via domain adversarial learning (DAL). However, inspired by\ncausal mechanisms, we find that previous methods ignore the implicit\ninsignificant non-causal factors hidden in the common features.

In this work, we present an idea to\nremove non-causal factors from common features by multi-view adversarial\ntraining on source domains, because we observe that such insignificant\nnon-causal factors may still be significant in other latent spaces (views) due\nto the multi-mode structure of data.

Among them, hyperbolic GCN\ncombines the advantages of GCN and hyperbolic space and achieves a surprising\nperformance. However, these methods only partially exploit the nature of\nhyperbolic space in their designs due to completely random embedding\ninitialization and an inaccurate tangent space aggregation. In addition, the\ndata used in these works mainly focus on user-item interaction data only, which\nfurther limits the performance of the models. In this paper, we propose a\nhyperbolic GCN collaborative filtering model, HGCC, which improves the existing\nhyperbolic GCN structure for collaborative filtering and incorporates side\ninformation. It keeps the long-tailed nature of the collaborative graph by\nadding power law prior to node embedding initialization; then, it aggregates\nneighbors directly in multiple hyperbolic spaces through the gyromidpoint\nmethod to obtain more accurate computation results; finally, the gate fusion\nwith prior is used to fuse multiple embeddings of one node from different\nhyperbolic space automatically. Experimental results on four real datasets show\nthat our model is highly competitive and outperforms leading baselines,\nincluding hyperbolic GCNs. Further experiments validate the efficacy of our\nproposed approach and give a further explanation by the learned embedding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 09:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

The entanglement is a nonlinear observable that is\nsensitive to so-called measurement-induced phase transitions, namely,\ntransitions from a critical and system-size dependent phase to a quantum Zeno\nphase with area-law entanglement. Intriguingly, the mixed steady-state\ndescription of these systems is insensitive to this phase transition. Together\nwith the difficulty of quantifying the mixed state entanglement, this favors\nquantum trajectories for the description of the quantum measurement process.\nHere, we study the entanglement of a single particle under continuous\nmeasurements (using the newly developed configuration coherence) in both the\nmixed state and the quantum trajectories descriptions.

Due to the\nappeal of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), synthetic face images\ngenerated with GANs models are difficult to differentiate from genuine human\nfaces and may be used to create counterfeit identities. Additionally, since\nGANs models do not account for physiological constraints for generating human\nfaces and their impact on human IRISes, distinguishing genuine from synthetic\nIRISes in the PS scenario becomes extremely difficult.

We\npresent the first electromagnetic relativistic particle-in-cell (PIC)\nsimulations of the electron-positron cyclotron maser for cyclotron frequency\nsmaller than the plasma frequency. In four distinct simulation cycles, we\nfocused on the effects of varying plasma parameters on the instability growth\nrate and saturation energy. In contrast to the results obtained from\nelectron-proton plasma simulations, we found that the pulsar electron-positron\nmaser instability does not generate distinguishable X and Z modes. On the\ncontrary, a singular electromagnetic XZ mode is generated close to or above the\nplasma frequency. Highest instability growth rates were obtained for the\nsimulations with integer plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratios.

For decades, statistical models of the\nEarth's radiation belts have quantified the impact of Alfv\\'enic waves in terms\nof quasi-linear diffusive models. However, quasi-linear models are inadequate\nto quantify Alfv\\'enic radial transport occurring on timescales comparable to\nthe azimuthal drift period of $0.1- 10$ MeV electrons. With recent advances in\nobservational methodologies offering spatial and temporal coverage of the\nEarth's radiation belts on fast timescales, a theoretical framework that\ndistinguishes between fast and diffusive radial transport can also be tested\nfor the first time with in situ measurements. In this report, we present a\ndrift kinetic description of radial transport for planetary radiation belts.

In this study, we conduct a three-dimensional radiative\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulation that encompasses the upper convective layer and\nextends into the corona, with a view to investigating how magnetic tornadoes\nare generated and efficiently transfer energy into the corona.

The Poynting flux\ntransferred into the corona is found to be four times greater in the presence\nof the magnetic tornado, as compared to its absence. This increase is\nattributed to a reduction in energy loss in the chromosphere, resulting from\nthe weakened magnetic energy cascade. Based on an evaluation of the fraction of\nthe merging events, our results suggest that magnetic tornadoes contribute\napproximately 50% of the Poynting flux into the corona in regions where the\ncoronal magnetic field strength is 10 G.

Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks.\nIn this work, we propose TagGPT, a fully automated system capable of tag\nextraction and multimodal tagging in a completely zero-shot fashion. Our core\ninsight is that, through elaborate prompt engineering, LLMs are able to extract\nand reason about proper tags given textual clues of multimodal data, e.g., OCR,\nASR, title, etc. Specifically, to automatically build a high-quality tag set\nthat reflects user intent and interests for a specific application, TagGPT\npredicts large-scale candidate tags from a series of raw data via prompting\nLLMs, filtered with frequency and semantics. Given a new entity that needs\ntagging for distribution, TagGPT introduces two alternative options for\nzero-shot tagging, i.e., a generative method with late semantic matching with\nthe tag set, and another selective method with early matching in prompts. It is\nwell noticed that TagGPT provides a system-level solution based on a modular\nframework equipped with a pre-trained LLM (GPT-3.5 used here) and a sentence\nembedding model (SimCSE used here), which can be seamlessly replaced with any\nmore advanced one you want. TagGPT is applicable for various modalities of data\nin modern social media and showcases strong generalization ability to a wide\nrange of applications.

In this paper, we propose to\naddress a more practical yet challenging counterpart setting - vision-language\nnavigation in continuous environments (VLN-CE). To develop a robust VLN-CE\nagent, we propose a new navigation framework, ETPNav, which focuses on two\ncritical skills: 1) the capability to abstract environments and generate\nlong-range navigation plans, and 2) the ability of obstacle-avoiding control in\ncontinuous environments. ETPNav performs online topological mapping of\nenvironments by self-organizing predicted waypoints along a traversed path,\nwithout prior environmental experience. It privileges the agent to break down\nthe navigation procedure into high-level planning and low-level control.\nConcurrently, ETPNav utilizes a transformer-based cross-modal planner to\ngenerate navigation plans based on topological maps and instructions. The plan\nis then performed through an obstacle-avoiding controller that leverages a\ntrial-and-error heuristic to prevent navigation from getting stuck in\nobstacles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod. ETPNav yields more than 10% and 20% improvements over prior\nstate-of-the-art on R2R-CE and RxR-CE datasets, respectively.

Recent research in sensor-based multi-robot\ncontrol has given rise to multiple modalities of mutual relative localization\nsystems. In particular, vision-based relative localization has reached the\nstage where it can be carried onboard lightweight UAVs in order to retrieve the\nrelative positions and relative orientations of cooperating units. A separate\nstream of development spawned distributed formation-enforcing control which can\nlead individual robots into a desired formation using relative localization of\ntheir neighbors. These two fields naturally complement each other by achieving\nreal-world flights of UAVs in formation without the need for absolute\nlocalization in the world. However, real relative localization systems are,\nwithout exception, burdened by non-negligible sensory noise, which is typically\nnot fully taken into account in formation-enforcing control algorithms. Such\nnoise can lead to rapid changes in velocity, which further interferes with\nvisual localization. Our approach provides a solution to these challenges,\nenabling practical deployment of FEC under realistic conditions, as we\ndemonstrated in real-world experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 13:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

In this work, we extend previous studies of the\nSU(2)-symmetric disordered Heisenberg model to larger systems, using the\ntime-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) method. We simulate\nquench dynamics from weakly entangled initial states up to long times, finding\nrobust subthermal behavior at stronger disorder.

At weaker disorder, we observe signatures of\nthermalization, however, entanglement entropy exhibits slow sublinear growth,\nin contrast to conventional thermalizing systems. Furthermore, we study\ndynamics of the SU(3)-symmetric disordered Heisenberg model. Similarly, strong\ndisorder drives the system into subthermal regime, albeit thermalizing phase is\nbroader compared to the SU(2) case. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of\nthe subthermal regime in spin chains with non-Abelian continuous symmetry, and\nare consistent with eventual thermalization at large system sizes and long time\nscales, suggested by previous works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 14:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

Here ``autonomous'' means that the demon operates\nwithout any external measurement or driving, making it possible to model their\nentire thermodynamic behaviour using Schr\\\"odinger's equation. My main aim is\nto review why cracks in the laws of thermodynamics, sometimes glimpsed in such\nsystems, have turned out to be illusory.\n  For this, I work by example, introducing the methods of quantum\nthermodynamics via an old thought experiment that appears to break the second\nlaw. This thought experiment is usually known as Smoluchowski's trapdoor,\nalthough it was first proposed by Maxwell. Smoluchowski showed that the\ntrapdoor's thermal motion complicates its dynamics, but I argue that he did not\nshow that it must obey the second law. This question is now of practical\nrelevance, because a nanoelectronic version of the trapdoor can be made with\nquantum dots. The methods presented here show that such a quantum trapdoor\nobeys the laws of thermodynamics.\n  This reviews then addresses other types of autonomous demon that\nsuperficially appear to break the laws of thermodynamics, but which do not.\nThese include an experimental demonstration of a Maxwell demon, and a kind of\ndemon that exploit non-equilibrium resources (the N-demon). It discusses a way\nof classifying different kinds of autonomous demon. It concludes by briefly\nreviewing how fluctuations affect nanoelectronics, and how their role in\nstochastic thermodynamics changes our view of entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 14:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

In particular, this enables us to\ngeneralize the vanishing theorems of Dixmier and Barnes for nilpotent and\n(super)solvable Lie algebras to Leibniz algebras. Moreover, we compute the\ncohomology of the one-dimensional Lie algebra with values in an arbitrary\nLeibniz bimodule and show that it is periodic with period two. As a\nconsequence, we prove the Leibniz analogue of a non-vanishing theorem of\nDixmier. Although not needed in full for the aforementioned results, we prove a\nFitting lemma for Leibniz bimodules that might be useful elsewhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 14:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

However, existing\nmethods still have some limitations in the quality of generated images and may\nsuffer from the mode collapse issue. A key reason is that a fixed adaptation\ndirection is applied for all cross-domain image pairs, which leads to identical\nsupervision signals. To address this issue, we propose an Image-specific Prompt\nLearning (IPL) method, which learns specific prompt vectors for each\nsource-domain image. This produces a more precise adaptation direction for\nevery cross-domain image pair, endowing the target-domain generator with\ngreatly enhanced flexibility. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on\nvarious domains demonstrate that IPL effectively improves the quality and\ndiversity of synthesized images and alleviates the mode collapse.

Firstly, we propose a self-supervised Vision-Language Semantic\n(VLS) segmentation method, which learns both fully-supervised pedestrian\ndetection and contextual segmentation via self-generated explicit labels of\nsemantic classes by vision-language models. Furthermore, a self-supervised\nPrototypical Semantic Contrastive (PSC) learning method is proposed to better\ndiscriminate pedestrians and other classes, based on more explicit and semantic\ncontexts obtained from VLS. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show\nthat our proposed VLPD achieves superior performances over the previous\nstate-of-the-arts, particularly under challenging circumstances like small\nscale and heavy occlusion.

FSKD requires the semantically meaningful relations for keypoint\nsimilarity learning to overcome the ubiquitous noise and ambiguous local\npatterns. One rescue comes with vision transformer (ViT) as it captures\nlong-range relations well. However, ViT may model irrelevant features outside\nof the region of interest due to the global attention matrix, thus degrading\nsimilarity learning between support and query features. In this paper, we\npresent a novel saliency-guided vision transformer, dubbed SalViT, for few-shot\nkeypoint detection. Our SalViT enjoys a uniquely designed masked self-attention\nand a morphology learner, where the former introduces saliency map as a soft\nmask to constrain the self-attention on foregrounds, while the latter leverages\nthe so-called power normalization to adjust morphology of saliency map,\nrealizing ``dynamically changing receptive field''. Moreover, as salinecy\ndetectors add computations, we show that attentive masks of DINO transformer\ncan replace saliency. On top of SalViT, we also investigate i) transductive\nFSKD that enhances keypoint representations with unlabelled data and ii) FSKD\nunder occlusions.

Despite their success, no\nresearch has yet explored the potential of LLMs to perform next-item\nrecommendations in the zero-shot setting. We have identified two major\nchallenges that must be addressed to enable LLMs to act effectively as\nrecommenders. First, the recommendation space can be extremely large for LLMs,\nand LLMs do not know about the target user's past interacted items and\npreferences. To address this gap, we propose a prompting strategy called\nZero-Shot Next-Item Recommendation (NIR) prompting that directs LLMs to make\nnext-item recommendations. Specifically, the NIR-based strategy involves using\nan external module to generate candidate items based on user-filtering or\nitem-filtering. Our strategy incorporates a 3-step prompting that guides GPT-3\nto carry subtasks that capture the user's preferences, select representative\npreviously watched movies, and recommend a ranked list of 10 movies. We\nevaluate the proposed approach using GPT-3 on MovieLens 100K dataset and show\nthat it achieves strong zero-shot performance, even outperforming some strong\nsequential recommendation models trained on the entire training dataset. These\npromising results highlight the ample research opportunities to use LLMs as\nrecommenders.

Two distinct La NMR signals were observed due to the two\ncrystallographically inequivalent La sites in La2Ni7 (La1 and La2 in the La2Ni4\nand the LaNi5 sub-units of the La2Ni7 unit cell, respectively). From the 139La\nNQR spectrum in the AFM state below $T_{N3}$, the AFM state was revealed to be\na commensurate state where Ni ordered moments align along the crystalline c\naxis. Owing to the two different La sites, we were able to estimate the average\nvalues of the Ni ordered moments ($\\sim$0.07-0.08 $\\mu_{B}$/Ni and\n$\\sim$0.17$\\mu_{B}$/Ni around La1 and La2, respectively) from 139La NMR\nspectrum measurements in the AFM state below $T_{N3}$, suggesting a non-uniform\ndistribution of the Ni-ordered moments in the AFM state. In contrast, a more\nuniform distribution of the Ni-ordered moments in the saturated paramagnetic\nstate induced by the application of high magnetic fields is observed. The\ntemperature dependence of the sublattice magnetization measured by the internal\nfield at the La2 site in the AFM state was reproduced by a local moment model\nbetter than the self-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory for weak itinerant\nantiferromagnets.

As\na popular topic in natural language processing tasks, extractive question\nanswering task (extractive QA) has gained extensive attention in the past few\nyears. With the continuous evolvement of the world, generalized cross-lingual\ntransfer (G-XLT), where question and answer context are in different languages,\nposes some unique challenges over cross-lingual transfer (XLT), where question\nand answer context are in the same language. With the boost of corresponding\ndevelopment of related benchmarks, many works have been done to improve the\nperformance of various language QA tasks.

What\nconnects these analyses is that both of them need to model at least two\ndifferent worlds with constrained mutual interaction. Though linearity and\ndependency analyses address similar problems, the analyses are carried out by\nemploying different methods. For linearity analysis, type systems employ the\ncomonadic exponential modality from Girard's linear logic. For dependency\nanalysis, type systems employ the monadic modality from Moggi's computational\nmetalanguage. Owing to this methodical difference, a unification of the two\nanalyses, though theoretically and practically desirable, is not\nstraightforward.\n  Fortunately, with recent advances in graded-context type systems, it has been\nrealized that linearity and dependency analyses can be viewed through the same\nlens. However, existing graded-context type systems fall short of a unification\nof linearity and dependency analyses. The problem with existing graded-context\ntype systems is that though their linearity analysis is general, their\ndependency analysis is limited, primarily because the graded modality they\nemploy is comonadic and not monadic. In this paper, we address this limitation\nby systematically extending existing graded-context type systems so that the\ngraded modality is both comonadic and monadic. This extension enables us to\nunify linearity analysis with a general dependency analysis. We present a\nunified Linear Dependency Calculus, LDC, which analyses linearity and\ndependency using the same mechanism in an arbitrary Pure Type System.

In SS-Shapelets, we propose two techniques to discover representative\nshapelets for the effective clustering of time series. 1) A \\textit{salient\nsubsequence chain} ($SSC$) that can extract salient subsequences (as candidate\nshapelets) of a labeled/pseudo-labeled time series, which helps remove massive\nuninformative subsequences from the pool. 2) A \\textit{linear discriminant\nselection} ($LDS$) algorithm to identify shapelets that can capture\nrepresentative local features of time series in different classes, for\nconvenient clustering.

At the same time, the momentum and energy exchanges between\ngas-particle phases will be included under the GKS-UGKWP framework. For each\ndisperse solid particle phase, the decomposition of deterministic wave and\nstatistic particle in UGKWP is based on the local cell's Knudsen number. This\nis very significant for simulating dispersed particle phases at different\nKnudsen numbers due to the variation of physical properties in individual\nparticle phase, such as the particle diameter, material density, and the\ncorresponding mass fraction inside each control volume. For the gas phase, the\nGKS is basically an Eulerian approach for the NS solution. Therefore, the\nGKS-UGKWP method for the gas-particle flow unifies the Eulerian-Eulerian (EE)\nand Eulerian-Lagrangian (EL) methods. An optimal strategy can be obtained for\nthe solid particle phase with the consideration of physical accuracy and\nnumerical efficiency.

However, the majority of these models\nuse concepts to index questions, which means the predefined skill tags for each\nquestion are required in advance to indicate the KCs needed to answer that\nquestion correctly. This makes it pretty hard to apply on large-scale online\neducation platforms where questions are often not well-organized by skill tags.\nIn this paper, we propose Q-matrix-based Attentive Knowledge Tracing (QAKT), an\nend-to-end style model that is able to apply the attentive method to scenes\nwhere no predefined skill tags are available without sacrificing its\nperformance. With a novel hybrid embedding method based on the q-matrix and\nRasch model, QAKT is capable of modeling problems hierarchically and learning\nthe q-matrix efficiently based on students' sequences. Meanwhile, the\narchitecture of QAKT ensures that it is friendly to questions associated with\nmultiple skills and has outstanding interpretability. After conducting\nexperiments on a variety of open datasets, we empirically validated that our\nmodel shows similar or even better performance than state-of-the-art KT\nmethods. Results of further experiments suggest that the q-matrix learned by\nQAKT is highly model-agnostic and more information-sufficient than the one\nlabeled by human experts, which could help with the data mining tasks in\nexisting ITSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 12:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 07:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Agent-based modeling seeks to understand the\nbehaviour of complex systems by situating agents in an environment and studying\nthe emergent outcomes of agent-agent and agent-environment interactions. In\ncomparison with compartmental models, agent-based models offer simpler, more\nscalable and flexible representation of heterogeneity, the ability to capture\ndynamic and static network and spatial context, and the ability to consider\nhistory of individuals within the model. In contrast, compartmental models\noffer faster development time with less programming required, lower\ncomputational requirements that do not scale with population, and the option\nfor concise mathematical formulation with ordinary, delay or stochastic\ndifferential equations supporting derivation of properties of the system\nbehaviour. In this chapter, basic characteristics of agent-based models are\nintroduced, advantages and disadvantages of agent-based models, as compared\nwith compartmental models, are discussed, and two example agent-based\ninfectious disease models are reviewed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 15:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

Proxy-based methods have attracted\nextensive attention due to the lower training complexity and fast network\nconvergence. However, these methods have limitations as the poxy optimization\nis done by network, which makes it challenging for the proxy to accurately\nrepresent the feature distrubtion of the real class of data. In this paper, we\npropose a Calibrate Proxy (CP) structure, which uses the real sample\ninformation to improve the similarity calculation in proxy-based loss and\nintroduces a calibration loss to constraint the proxy optimization towards the\ncenter of the class features. At the same time, we set a small number of\nproxies for each class to alleviate the impact of intra-class differences on\nretrieval performance. The effectiveness of our method is evaluated by\nextensive experiments on three public datasets and multiple synthetic\nlabel-noise datasets.

We develop a unified active learning framework, specializing in\nsoftware performance prediction, to address this task.
