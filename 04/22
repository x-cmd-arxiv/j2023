To explore these crystalline phases for application\nand fundamental materials investigations, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a\nwell-suited thin film growth technique. In this study, we investigate the\nreaction kinetics of GeO2 during plasma-assisted MBE using elemental Ge and\nplasma-activated oxygen fluxes. The growth rate as a function of oxygen flux is\nmeasured in-situ by laser reflectometry at different growth temperatures. A\nflux of the suboxide GeO desorbing off the growth surface is identified and\nquantified in-situ by the line-of-sight quadrupole mass spectrometry. Our\nmeasurements reveal that the suboxide formation and desorption limits the\ngrowth rate under metal-rich or high temperature growth conditions, and leads\nto etching of the grown GeO2 layer under Ge flux in the absence of oxygen. The\nquantitative results fit the sub-compound mediated reaction model, indicating\nthe intermediate formation of the suboxide at the growth front. This model is\nfurther utilized to delineate the GeO2-growth window in terms of oxygen-flux\nand substrate temperature.

To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first approach that uses the reverse diffusion\nprocess to model full-body tracking as a conditional sequence generation task.\nWe conduct experiments on the large-scale motion-capture dataset AMASS and show\nthat our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a significant\nmargin in terms of full-body motion realism and joint reconstruction error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 16:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

The visibility of the tumor in kV images is limited since\nthe patient's 3D anatomy is projected onto a 2D plane, especially when the\ntumor is behind high-density structures such as bones. This can lead to large\npatient setup errors. A solution is to reconstruct the 3D CT image from the kV\nimages obtained at the treatment isocenter in the treatment position.\n  Methods: An asymmetric autoencoder-like network built with vision-transformer\nblocks was developed. The data was collected from 1 head and neck patient: 2\northogonal kV images (1024x1024 voxels), 1 3D CT with padding (512x512x512)\nacquired from the in-room CT-on-rails before kVs were taken and 2\ndigitally-reconstructed-radiograph (DRR) images (512x512) based on the CT. We\nresampled kV images every 8 voxels and DRR and CT every 4 voxels, thus formed a\ndataset consisting of 262,144 samples, in which the images have a dimension of\n128 for each direction. In training, both kV and DRR images were utilized, and\nthe encoder was encouraged to learn the jointed feature map from both kV and\nDRR images. In testing, only independent kV images were used.

The CDVH\nshowed that <5% of the voxels had a per-voxel-absolute-CT-number-difference\nlarger than 185 HU.\n  Conclusion: A patient-specific vision-transformer-based network was developed\nand shown to be accurate and efficient to reconstruct 3D CT images from kV\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 17:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

This dynamical\nscenario is grounded on recent studies of quantum field theory (QFT) in curved\nspacetime and also on string theory. It turns out that what we call the\n`cosmological constant', $\\Lambda$, is no longer a rigid parameter but the\nnearly sustained value of $8\\pi G(H)\\rho_{\\rm vac}(H)$ around (any) given epoch\n$H(t)$, where $G(H)$ is the gravitational coupling, which can also be very\nmildly running (logarithmically). Of particular interest is the possibility\nsuggested in past works that such a running may help to cure the cosmological\ntensions afflicting the $\\Lambda$CDM. In the current study, we reanalyze it in\nfull and we find it becomes further buttressed. Using the modern cosmological\ndata, namely a compilation of the latest $SNIa+BAO+$H(z)$+LSS+CMB$\nobservations, we probe to which extent the RVM provides a quality fit better\nthan the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model, paying particular emphasis on its\nimpact on the $\\sigma_8$ and $H_0$ tensions.

Such parameters are related to intrinsic galaxy\nproperties such as metallicity, star formation rate, and stellar age. Due to\nthe lack of observational constraints at high redshift, dust empirical curves\nmeasured in the local Universe (e.g. Calzetti and SMC curves) have been\nemployed to describe the dust attenuation at early epochs. We exploit the high\nsensitivity and spectral resolution of the JWST to constrain the dust\nattenuation curves in high-z galaxies. Our goals are to check whether dust\nattenuation curves evolve with redshift and quantify the dependence of the\ninferred galaxy properties on the assumed dust attenuation law. We develop a\nmodified version of the SED fitting code BAGPIPES by including a detailed dust\nattenuation curve parametrization. Dust parameters are derived, along with\ngalaxy properties, from the fit to the data from FUV to mm bands.

Many distinct new-physics models predict overlapping\nsignatures and phenomenology in these experiments. In this work, we advocate\nfor the adoption of simplified frameworks when studying these types of\nnew-physics signatures, which are characterized by a small number of primary\nvariables, including particle masses, lifetimes, and production and decay\nmodes/rates that most directly control signal event rates and kinematics. In\nparticular, taking the example of long-lived particles that decay inside a\nneutrino detector as a test case, we study formulate and study simplified\nframeworks in the context of light scalars/fermions produced in kaon decays\nwhich then decay into final states containing an electron-positron pair. We\nshow that using these simplified frameworks can allow for individual\nexperimental analyses to be applicable to a wide variety of specific model\nscenarios. As a side benefit, we demonstrate that using this approach can allow\nfor the T2K collaboration, by reinterpreting its search for Heavy Neutral\nLeptons, to be capable of setting world-leading limits on the Higgs-Portal\nScalar model. Furthermore, we argue the simplified framework interpretation can\nserve as a bridge to model identification in the hopeful detection of a\nnew-physics signal. As an illustration, we perform a first determination of the\nlikelihood that, in the presence of a new-physics signal in a detector like the\nDUNE ND-GAr, multiple different new-physics hypotheses (such as the\nHiggs-Portal Scalar and Heavy Neutral Lepton ones) can be disentangled. We\ndemonstrate that this model discrimination is favorable for some portions of\ndetectable new-physics parameter space but for others, it is more challenging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 18:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

We compare two models: gradual\nreionisation driven by numerous UV-faint galaxies versus more rapid\nreionisation by rarer brighter galaxies, producing larger bubbles at fixed\nneutral fraction.

Recently, a\nBayesian uncertainty quantification by optimization (BUQO) has been proposed to\nformulate hypothesis testing as a minimization problem. The objective is to\ndetermine whether a structure appearing in a maximum a posteriori estimate is\ntrue or is a reconstruction artifact due to the ill-posedness or\nill-conditioness of the problem. In this context, the mathematical definition\nof having a ``fake structure\" is crucial, and highly depends on the type of\nstructure of interest. This definition can be interpreted as an inpainting of a\nneighborhood of the structure, but only simple techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature so far, due to the complexity of the problem. In this work, we\npropose a data-driven method using a simple convolutional neural network to\nperform the inpainting task, leading to a novel plug-and-play BUQO algorithm.\nCompared to previous works, the proposed approach has the advantage that it can\nbe used for a wide class of structures, without needing to adapt the inpainting\noperator to the area of interest.

The LOT framework utilizes divergence to\nsteer the generations away from the unsafe subspace and towards the safe\nsubspace while sustaining the flow of conversation.

The proposed scheme adapts\nthe model to each setting by scaling the CNN features and the regularization\nparameter with appropriate weights. The scaling weights and regularization\nparameter are derived using a multi-layer perceptron model from conditional\nvectors, which represents the specific acquisition setting. The perceptron\nparameters and the CNN weights are jointly trained using data from multiple\nacquisition settings, including differences in field strengths, acceleration,\nand contrasts. The conditional network is validated using datasets acquired\nwith different acquisition settings.\n  Results: The comparison of the adaptive framework, which trains a single\nmodel using the data from all the settings, shows that it can offer\nconsistently improved performance for each acquisition condition.

The literature proposes two traditional ways to solve\nthis integrated problem: hierarchical and monolithic. The monolithic approach\nignores the control level's objective and incorporates it as a constraint into\nthe upper level at the cost of suboptimality. The hierarchical approach\nrequires solving a mathematically complex bilevel problem with the scheduling\nacting as the leader and control as the follower. The linking variables between\nboth levels belong to a small subset of scheduling and control decision\nvariables. For this subset of variables, data-driven surrogate models have been\nused to learn follower responses to different leader decisions. In this work,\nwe propose to use ReLU neural networks for the control level. Consequently, the\nbilevel problem is collapsed into a single-level MILP that is still able to\naccount for the control level's objective. This single-level MILP reformulation\nis compared with the monolithic approach and benchmarked against embedding a\nnonlinear expression of the neural networks into the optimisation. Moreover, a\nneural network is used to predict control level feasibility. The case studies\ninvolve batch reactor and sequential batch process scheduling problems. The\nproposed methodology finds optimal solutions while largely outperforming both\napproaches in terms of computational time. Additionally, due to well-developed\nMILP solvers, adding ReLU neural networks in a MILP form marginally impacts the\ncomputational time. The solution's error due to prediction accuracy is\ncorrelated with the neural network training error. Overall, we expose how - by\nusing an existing big-M reformulation and being careful about integrating\nmachine learning and optimisation pipelines - we can more efficiently solve the\nbilevel scheduling-control problem with high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 20:43:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 21:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

This\nstudy combined two methods for understanding challenges and opportunities in\nrural credit ecosystem in Brazil: (1) a study that took place in a community of\nfarmers in Brazil and it was based on participatory observations of their work\nprocesses and interactions of 20 informants (bank employees and farmers); (2)\ndesign thinking workshops with teams from 3 banks, counting on 15-20\nparticipants each. The results show that key user experience challenges are\ntightly connected to the heterogeneity of farmer profiles and contexts of use\ninvolving technology available, domain skills, level of education, and\nconnectivity, among others. In addition to presenting data collected from\ninteraction with informants and experiences resulting from active participant\nobservation, we discuss a holistic view of how recommender systems could be\nused to promote better bank-farmer interactions, improve farmer experience in\nthe whole process, and promote equitable access to loans beyond microcredit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 21:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

The key to deal with such problem is to mine the associations between\nimage contents and labels, and further obtain the correct assignments between\nimages and their labels. In this paper, we treat each image as a bag of\ninstances, and formulate the task of multi-label image recognition as an\ninstance-label matching selection problem. To model such problem, we propose an\ninnovative Semantic-aware Graph Matching framework for Multi-Label image\nrecognition (ML-SGM), in which Graph Matching mechanism is introduced owing to\nits good performance of excavating the instance and label relationship. The\nframework explicitly establishes category correlations and instance-label\ncorrespondences by modeling the relation among content-aware (instance) and\nsemantic-aware (label) category representations, to facilitate multi-label\nimage understanding and reduce the dependency of large amounts of training\nsamples for each category. Specifically, we first construct an instance spatial\ngraph and a label semantic graph respectively and then incorporate them into a\nconstructed assignment graph by connecting each instance to all labels.\nSubsequently, the graph network block is adopted to aggregate and update all\nnodes and edges state on the assignment graph to form structured\nrepresentations for each instance and label. Our network finally derives a\nprediction score for each instance-label correspondence and optimizes such\ncorrespondence with a weighted cross-entropy loss. Empirical results conducted\non generic multi-label image recognition demonstrate the superiority of our\nproposed method. Moreover, the proposed method also shows advantages in\nmulti-label recognition with partial labels and multi-label few-shot learning,\nas well as outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a clear margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 23:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

The flourishing\nmachine learning technologies and evolving UE-centric 5G network architecture\nhave prompted the emergence of new TS technologies. In this paper, we propose a\nknowledge transfer and federated learning-enabled UE-centric (KT-FLUC) TS\nframework for highly dynamic 5G radio access networks (RAN).

It\nenables intelligent UEs to make TS decisions autonomously using local models\nand observations, and a global model is defined to coordinate local TS\ndecisions and share experiences among UEs. Secondly, considering the individual\nUE's limited computation and energy resources, a growing and pruning-based\nmodel compression method is introduced, mitigating the computation burden of\nUEs and reducing the communication overhead of federated learning.

Approach: We formulated the proton\ntreatment planning problem as a convex optimization problem with a cost\nfunction consisting of a dosimetric plan quality term plus a weighted $l_1$\nregularization term. We iteratively solved this problem and adaptively updated\nthe regularization weights to promote the sparsity of both the spots and energy\nlayers. The proposed algorithm was tested on four head-and-neck patients, and\nits performance, in terms of reducing the number of spots and energy layers,\nwas compared with existing standard $l_1$ and group $l_2$ regularization\nmethods. We also compared the effectiveness of the three methods ($l_1$, group\n$l_2$, and reweighted $l_1$) at improving plan delivery efficiency without\ncompromising dosimetric plan quality by constructing each of their Pareto\nsurfaces charting the trade-off between plan delivery and plan quality. Main\nresults: The reweighted $l_1$ regularization method reduced the number of spots\nand layers by an average of 40% and 35%, respectively, with an insignificant\ncost to dosimetric plan quality. From the Pareto surfaces, it is clear that\nreweighted $l_1$ provided a better trade-off between plan delivery efficiency\nand dosimetric plan quality than standard $l_1$ or group $l_2$ regularization,\nrequiring the lowest cost to quality to achieve any given level of delivery\nefficiency. Significance: Reweighted $l_1$ regularization is a powerful method\nfor simultaneously promoting the sparsity of spots and energy layers at a small\ncost to dosimetric plan quality. This sparsity reduces the time required for\nspot scanning and energy layer switching, thereby improving the delivery\nefficiency of proton plans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 01:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Additionally,\ncorrelation analysis between the width and other parameters of SADs was further\nconducted and revealed that: (1) SADs with different initial widths show no\nsignificant differences in their temperature and density evolution\ncharacteristics; (2) SADs with small initial widths usually appear in lower\nheights, where more frequent collisions between SADs could lead to their\nintermittent acceleration, width increment, and curved trajectories. These\nresults indicate that SADs with different initial widths are produced the same\nway while different environments (magnetic field or plasma) could affect their\nsubsequent width evolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 03:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

We propose a\nmethod termed multi-focus averaging (MFA) to suppress the multiple-scattering\nsignals and improve the image contrast of OCT in deep regions. The MFA method\ncaptures multiple OCT volumes with various focal positions and averages them in\ncomplex form after correcting the varying defocus through computational\nrefocusing. Because the multiple-scattering takes different trajectories among\nthe different focal position configurations, this averaging suppresses the\nmultiple-scattering signal. Meanwhile, the single-scattering takes a consistent\ntrajectory regardless of the focal position configuration and is not\nsuppressed. Hence, the MFA method improves the signal ratio between the single-\nand multiple-scattering signals and improves the image contrast. A scattering\nphantom and a postmortem zebrafish were measured for validation of the proposed\nmethod. The results showed that the contrast of intensity images of both the\nphantom and zebrafish were improved using the MFA method, such that they were\nbetter than the contrast provided by the standard complex averaging method.

Since the\nscale range increases as some power of the flow Reynolds number, a faithful\nsimulation of the entire scale range is prohibitively expensive at high\nReynolds numbers. The most expensive aspect concerns the small scale motions;\nthus, major emphasis is placed on understanding and modeling them, taking\nadvantage of their putative universality. In this work, using physics-informed\ndeep learning methods, we present a modeling framework to capture and predict\nthe small scale dynamics of turbulence, via the velocity gradient tensor. The\nmodel is based on obtaining functional closures for the pressure Hessian and\nviscous Laplacian contributions as functions of velocity gradient tensor. This\ntask is accomplished using deep neural networks that are consistent with\nphysical constraints and incorporate Reynolds number dependence explicitly to\naccount for small-scale intermittency.

The model learns from\nlow to moderate Reynolds numbers, and successfully predicts velocity gradient\nstatistics at both seen and higher (unseen) Reynolds numbers.

However,\nseveral recent studies challenged this explanation and found that deep networks\nmay have already learned sufficiently good features for OOD generalization. The\ndebate extends to the in-distribution and OOD performance correlations along\nwith training or fine-tuning neural nets across a variety of OOD generalization\ntasks. To understand these seemingly contradicting phenomena, we conduct a\ntheoretical investigation and find that ERM essentially learns both spurious\nfeatures and invariant features. On the other hand, the quality of learned\nfeatures during ERM pre-training significantly affects the final OOD\nperformance, as OOD objectives rarely learn new features. Failing to capture\nall the underlying useful features during pre-training will further limit the\nfinal OOD performance. To remedy the issue, we propose Feature Augmented\nTraining (FAT ), to enforce the model to learn all useful features by retaining\nthe already learned features and augmenting new ones by multiple rounds. In\neach round, the retention and augmentation operations are performed on\ndifferent subsets of the training data that capture distinct features.\nExtensive experiments show that FAT effectively learns richer features and\nconsistently improves the OOD performance when applied to various objectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 05:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Furthermore, from the physical parameters extracted with the KMC model,\nthe 2D materials have a lower diffusion activation energy from the vertical\ndirection, where a smaller bias voltage and a shorter switching time can be\nachieved.

Field inversion and machine learning\n(FIML) techniques have improved RANS models' predictive capabilities for\nseparated flows. However, FIML-generated models often lack interpretability,\nlimiting physical understanding and manual improvements based on prior\nknowledge. Additionally, these models may struggle with generalization in flow\nfields distinct from the training set. This study addresses these issues by\nemploying symbolic regression (SR) to derive an analytical relationship between\nthe correction factor of the baseline turbulence model and local flow\nvariables, enhancing the baseline model's ability to predict separated flow\nacross diverse test cases. The shear-stress-transport (SST) model undergoes\nfield inversion on a curved backward-facing step (CBFS) case to obtain the\ncorrective factor field beta, and SR is used to derive a symbolic map between\nlocal flow features and beata. The SR-derived analytical function is integrated\ninto the original SST model, resulting in the SST-SR model. The SST-SR model's\ngeneralization capabilities are demonstrated by its successful predictions of\nseparated flow on various test cases, including 2D-bump cases with varying\nheights, periodic hill case where separation is dominated by geometric\nfeatures, and the three-dimensional Ahmed-body case. In these tests, the model\naccurately predicts flow fields, showing its effectiveness in cases completely\ndifferent from the training set. The Ahmed-body case, in particular, highlights\nthe model's ability to predict the three-dimensional massively separated flows.\nWhen applied to a turbulent boundary layer with Re_L=1.0E7, the SST-SR model\npredicts wall friction coefficient and log layer comparably to the original SST\nmodel, maintaining the attached boundary layer prediction performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 08:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

A weakly non linear theory\nbased on the method of multiple scales and the potential flow limit, is\npresented for a modal (single mode) initial condition representing the solution\nto the primary Cauchy Poisson problem. A pair of novel, coupled, amplitude\nequations are derived governing the modulation of the primary mode. For\nmoderate values of the perturbation parameter epsilon (a measure of the initial\nperturbation amplitude), our second order theory captures the overshoot\n(incipient jet) at the axis of symmetry quite well, demonstrating good\nagreement with numerical simulation of the incompressible, Euler's equation\nwith gravity (Popinet 2014) and no surface tension. Expectedly, our theory\nbecomes inaccurate as epsilon approaches unity. In this strongly nonlinear\nregime, slender jets form with surface accelerations exceeding gravity by three\norders of magnitude. In this inertial regime, the jets observed in our\nsimulations show excellent agreement with the inertial, self-similar,\nanalytical solution by Longuet-Higgins (1983). The physical mechanism of\naxisymmetric jet formation is explained based on mass conservation arguments.\nWe demonstrate that the underlying wave focussing mechanism, may be understood\nin terms of radially inward motion of nodal points of a linearised,\naxisymmetric, standing wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 10:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Despite the success that\npre-training has achieved in ad-hoc retrieval tasks, effective pre-training\nstrategies for legal case retrieval remain to be explored. Compared with\ngeneral documents, legal case documents are typically long text sequences with\nintrinsic logical structures. However, most existing language models have\ndifficulty understanding the long-distance dependencies between different\nstructures. Moreover, in contrast to the general retrieval, the relevance in\nthe legal domain is sensitive to key legal elements. Even subtle differences in\nkey legal elements can significantly affect the judgement of relevance.\nHowever, existing pre-trained language models designed for general purposes\nhave not been equipped to handle legal elements.\n  To address these issues, in this paper, we propose SAILER, a new\nStructure-Aware pre-traIned language model for LEgal case Retrieval.

This paper first provides a\ncomprehensive comparison on methodologies of existing RT-based simulators.

WiThRay implements its own RT\nmethodology, the bypassing on edge (BE) algorithm, that follows the Fermat's\nprinciple and has low computational complexity.

Reduced Collatz Conjecture is easier to explore\nbecause certain structures must be presented in reduced dynamics, rather than\nin original dynamics (as original dynamics is a mixture of original dynamics).\nReduced dynamics is a computation sequence from starting integer to the first\ninteger less than it, in terms of ``I'' that represents (3*x+1)/2 and ``O''\nthat represents x/2. We formally prove that all positive integers are\npartitioned into two halves and either presents ``I'' or ``O'' in next ongoing\ncomputation. More specifically, (1) if any positive integer x that is i module\n$2^t$ (i is an odd integer) is given, then the first t computations (each one\nis either ``I'' or ``O'' corresponding to whether current integer is odd or\neven) will be identical with that of i. (2) If current integer after t\ncomputations (in terms of ``I'' or ``O'') is less than x, then reduced dynamics\nof x is available. Otherwise, the residue class of x (namely, i module $2^t$)\ncan be partitioned into two halves (namely, i module $2^{t+1}$ and $i+2^t$\nmodule $2^{t+1}$), and either half presents ``I'' or ``O'' in intermediately\nforthcoming (t+1)-th computation. This discovery will be helpful to the final\nproof of Collatz conjecture - if the union of residue classes who present\nreduced dynamics that become larger with the growth of residue module, equals\nall positive integers asymptotically, then Reduced Collatz Conjecture (or\nequivalently, Collatz Conjecture) will be true.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 12:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

The current work aims to consolidate these findings by\nevaluating surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language model variants\nthat vary systematically in the amount of training data and model capacity on\ntheir ability to predict human reading times. The results show that surprisal\nestimates from most variants with contemporary model capacities provide the\nbest fit after seeing about two billion training tokens, after which they begin\nto diverge from humanlike expectations. Additionally, newly-trained smaller\nmodel variants reveal a 'tipping point' at convergence, after which the\ndecrease in language model perplexity begins to result in poorer fits to human\nreading times. These results suggest that the massive amount of training data\nis mainly responsible for the poorer fit achieved by surprisal from larger\npre-trained language models, and that a certain degree of model capacity is\nnecessary for Transformer-based language models to capture humanlike\nexpectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 12:50:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

One of the first and most important steps of\nautomated log analysis is log abstraction, which parses the raw logs into a\nstructured format. Prior log abstraction techniques aim to identify and\nabstract all the dynamic variables in logs and output a static log template for\nautomated log analysis. However, these abstracted dynamic variables may also\ncontain important information that is useful to different tasks in log\nanalysis. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of dynamic\nvariables and their importance in practice, and explore the potential of a\nvariable-aware log abstraction technique. Through manual investigations and\nsurveys with practitioners, we find that different categories of dynamic\nvariables record various information that can be important depending on the\ngiven tasks, the distinction of dynamic variables in log abstraction can\nfurther assist in log analysis.

Recently, numerous Deep-Learning methods have been proposed for MRI\nreconstruction, however, they usually fail to reconstruct sharp details from\nthe subsampled k-space data. To solve this problem, we propose a lightweight\nand accurate Edge Attention MRI Reconstruction Network (EAMRI) to reconstruct\nimages with edge guidance. Specifically, we design an efficient Edge Prediction\nNetwork to directly predict accurate edges from the blurred image. Meanwhile,\nwe propose a novel Edge Attention Module (EAM) to guide the image\nreconstruction utilizing the extracted edge priors, as inspired by the popular\nself-attention mechanism. EAM first projects the input image and edges into\nQ_image, K_edge, and V_image, respectively. Then EAM pairs the Q_image with\nK_edge along the channel dimension, such that 1) it can search globally for the\nhigh-frequency image features that are activated by the edge priors; 2) the\noverall computation burdens are largely reduced compared with the traditional\nspatial-wise attention. With the help of EAM, the predicted edge priors can\neffectively guide the model to reconstruct high-quality MR images with accurate\nedges. Extensive experiments show that our proposed EAMRI outperforms other\nmethods with fewer parameters and can recover more accurate edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 13:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

However,\nthe extent to which dependency length minimization is applied in human language\nsystems is not yet fully understood. Preverbally, the placement of\nlong-before-short constituents and postverbally, short-before-long constituents\nare known to minimize overall dependency length of a sentence. In this study,\nwe test the hypothesis that placing only the shortest preverbal constituent\nnext to the main-verb explains word order preferences in Hindi (a SOV language)\nas opposed to the global minimization of dependency length. We characterize\nthis approach as a least-effort strategy because it is a cost-effective way to\nshorten all dependencies between the verb and its preverbal dependencies. As\nsuch, this approach is consistent with the bounded-rationality perspective\naccording to which decision making is governed by \"fast but frugal\" heuristics\nrather than by a search for optimal solutions. Consistent with this idea, our\nresults indicate that actual corpus sentences in the Hindi-Urdu Treebank corpus\nare better explained by the least effort strategy than by global minimization\nof dependency lengths.

Here, we indeed adopt a very\ndifferent point of view, and analyze moves in chess games from a statistical\npoint of view. We first focus on spatial properties and the location of pieces\nand show that the number of possible moves during a game is positively\ncorrelated with its outcome. We then study heatmaps of pieces and show that the\nspatial distribution of pieces varies less between human players than with\nengines (such as Stockfish): engines seem to use pieces in a very different way\nas human did for centuries. These heatmaps also allow us to construct a\ndistance between players that characterizes how they use their pieces. In a\nsecond part, we focus on the best move and the second best move found by\nStockfish and study the difference $\\Delta$ of their evaluation. We found\ndifferent regimes during a chess game. In a `quiet' regime, $\\Delta$ is small,\nindicating that many paths are possible for both players. In contrast, there\nare also `volatile' regimes characterized by a `tipping point', for which\n$\\Delta$ becomes large. At these tipping points, the outcome could then switch\ncompletely depending on the move chosen. We also found that for a large number\nof games, the distribution of $\\Delta$ can be fitted by a power law\n$P(\\Delta)\\sim \\Delta^{-\\beta}$ with an exponent that seems to be universal\n(for human players and engines) and around $\\beta\\approx 1.8$. The probability\nto encounter a tipping point in a game is therefore far from being negligible.\nFinally, we conclude by mentioning possible directions of research for a\nquantitative understanding of chess games such as the structure of the pawn\nchain, the interaction graph between pieces, or a quantitative definition of\ncritical points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 14:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 06:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

I. Cot\\u aescu, Eur. Phys. J. C (2022) 82:1073]. This\nmethod is generalized here associating to any integral operator in\nconfiguration representation a pair of integral operators acting on particle\nand antiparticle wave spinors in momentum representation instead on the mode\nspinors. It results thus an effective quantization procedure giving rise to a\ncoherent quantum theory in which the principal observables are one-particle\noperators without oscillating therms as those producing zitterbewegung in the\ntraditional interpretation. In this approach the spin operator is conserved\nwhile the position one, proposed initially by Pryce as mass-center operator,\nbecomes after quantization the dipole operator evolving linearly in time with a\nconserved velocity. The rich algebra of observables including the isometry\ngenerators and various position operators is carefully studied. The propagation\nof one-particle wave-packets is considered for the first time in this framework\nfinding that these move uniformly spreading in time normally as any other\nscalar or non-relativistic wave-packet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 17:25:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 19:18:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2023 19:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

One approach to progress in this\ndirection, which is deeply rooted in the tradition of physics, is the\ndevelopment of new models for physical systems otherwise treated by QM. One\nsuch model is presented here, which concerns the interaction of a spin system\nwith sequences of two Stern-Gerlach detectors that may be independently\nrotated. Rather than employing the traditional formalism of QM, the proposed\nmodel is supported by tools from discrete mathematics, such as finite groups,\nset theory, and combinatorics. Equipped with this novel toolkit, an analog of\nWigner's d-matrix formula is derived and shown to deviate slightly from QM.\nWith these results, the proposed model is extended to an optical system\ninvolving photon number states passing through a beam splitter. Leveraging\nrecent advancements in high precision experiments on these systems, we then\npropose a means of testing the new model using a tabletop experiment.
