The main finding is that testing contributed more to\nthe containment of the pandemic in this phase than vaccination or contact\nrestrictions. The analysis is based on a new epidemiological cohort model that\nrepresents testing, vaccination and contact restrictions by time-varying rates\nof detection, vaccination and contacts, respectively.\n  Only the effectiveness of different vaccines is taken from the literature.\nAll other parameters are automatically identified in such a way that the\nsimulated and the published incidences and death rates match. Among these\nparameters are incubation time, mean duration of the infectious phase,\nmortality rate, as well as two contact rates and one detection rate per week.\n  Note that we can reconstruct such a high number of parameters only because we\nassume that the weekly wave patterns in new infections follow real infection\ndynamics, periodically driven by high contact rates on weekdays and lower ones\non weekends. Usually, people assume that the weekly wave patterns are just\nreporting artefacts and that weekly mean values are the finest usable data.\n  One focus of the paper is to quantify the increase in detection rate due to\nthe introduction of rapid testing in schools. For this purpose, we compare\nfederal states that differ in the start of school tests and Easter holidays.\nThere is a clear temporal correlation with the identified detection rates.\n  Finally, we compare the effect of the individual non-pharmaceutical measures\nby replacing one by one the fitted rates of detection, vaccination and contacts\nby neutral ones. The increase in the simulated number of actually infected\npersons measures the effect of the measure ignored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 16:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

Often when examining and constraining the scalar non-Gaussianity\narising from inflation, certain templates are adopted for the scalar\nnon-Gaussianity parameter $f_{_{\\rm NL}}$, in classifying their behaviors in\nterms of wavenumbers. The current constraints from cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) on such templates of $f_{_{\\rm NL}}$ are weak and provide rather large\nbounds on their amplitudes. In this work, we explore a different method of\nconstraining $f_{_{\\rm NL}}$ through their effect on the scalar power. We\ncompute the correction to the scalar power due to $f_{_{\\rm NL}}$ while\naccounting for its generic scale dependence. We then compute the angular power\nspectrum of CMB arising from such non-Gaussian corrections to explore possible\nimprints. We initially illustrate this method using the conventional templates\nof $f_{_{\\rm NL}}$ such as local, equilateral and orthogonal types, with and\nwithout the running of the parameter. We further employ this method to an\noscillatory form of $f_{_{\\rm NL}}$ and lastly on a realistic model of\ninflation proposed by Starobinsky. Though this method does not improve much on\nthe constraints on the first three templates of $f_{_{\\rm NL}}$, it provides\ninteresting insights on models that do not conform to these templates. We infer\nthat the non-Gaussian correction to the spectrum can be sensitive to model\nparameters that are degenerate at the level of the original power spectrum.\nHence, this method of computing indirect imprints of $f_{_{\\rm NL}}$ on angular\npower spectrum of CMB provides a new avenue to explore primordial scalar\nnon-Gaussianity and possibly constrain them effectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 16:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-17"}

Localization algorithms compute the camera pose of a\nquery image w.r.t. a scene representation, which is typically built from\nimages. This often requires capturing and storing large amounts of data,\nfollowed by running Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms. An interesting, and\nunderexplored, source of data for building scene representations are 3D models\nthat are readily available on the Internet, e.g., hand-drawn CAD models, 3D\nmodels generated from building footprints, or from aerial images. These models\nallow to perform visual localization right away without the time-consuming\nscene capturing and model building steps.

HSIs\ncontain hundreds of continuous bands, which are characterized by high dimension\nand high correlation between adjacent bands. The high dimension and redundancy\nof HSI data bring great difficulties to HSI classification. In recent years, a\nlarge number of HSI feature extraction and classification methods based on deep\nlearning have been proposed. However, their ability to model the global\nrelationships among samples in both spatial and spectral domains is still\nlimited. In order to solve this problem, an HSI classification method with\nspectral-spatial diffusion models is proposed. The proposed method realizes the\nreconstruction of spectral-spatial distribution of the training samples with\nthe forward and reverse spectral-spatial diffusion process, thus modeling the\nglobal spatial-spectral relationship between samples. Then, we use the\nspectral-spatial denoising network of the reverse process to extract the\nunsupervised diffusion features. Features extracted by the spectral-spatial\ndiffusion models can achieve cross-sample perception from the reconstructed\ndistribution of the training samples, thus obtaining better classification\nperformance.

To address this issue, we propose\nGPr-Net (Geometric Prototypical Network), a lightweight and computationally\nefficient geometric prototypical network that captures the intrinsic topology\nof point clouds and achieves superior performance.

In this work,\nwe revisit the classic stereo setup for training data collection -- capturing\ntwo images of the same scene with one UDC and one standard camera. The key idea\nis to \"copy\" details from a high-quality reference image and \"paste\" them on\nthe UDC image. While being able to generate real training pairs, this setting\nis susceptible to spatial misalignment due to perspective and depth of field\nchanges. The problem is further compounded by the large domain discrepancy\nbetween the UDC and normal images, which is unique to UDC restoration. In this\npaper, we mitigate the non-trivial domain discrepancy and spatial misalignment\nthrough a novel Transformer-based framework that generates well-aligned yet\nhigh-quality target data for the corresponding UDC input. This is made possible\nthrough two carefully designed components, namely, the Domain Alignment Module\n(DAM) and Geometric Alignment Module (GAM), which encourage robust and accurate\ndiscovery of correspondence between the UDC and normal views.

The four point\namplitudes factorize into primary and descendent amplitudes, where descendants\nare primaries multiplied by Mandelstam variables.

Assuming geometric parameters for the birth ring of planetesimals,\nour model provides the positions of millions of particles of different sizes to\ncompute scattered light images. We demonstrate that if the grain size\ndistribution is truncated or strongly peaks at a size larger than the radiation\npressure blow-out size we are able to produce an arc quite similar to the\nobserved one. If the birth ring is radially narrow, given that particles of a\ngiven size have similar eccentricities, they will have their apocenters at the\nsame distance from the star. Since this is where the particles will spend most\nof their time, this results in a \"apocenter pile-up\" that can look like a ring.\nDue to more efficient forward scattering this arc only appears in total\nintensity observations and remains undetected in polarimetric data.

Alternative possibilities such as\na wavy size distribution and a size-dependent phase function are interesting\ncandidates to strengthen the apocenter pile-up.

Although the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ index vanishes, these systems enable a concentration-dependent\ntopological crossover with band gap closure when graphene is stacked on a\ncomposite or alloyed TMDC layer. This is due to a nonzero Berry curvature at\nthe individual valleys and a change of the valley Chern index at a critical\ncomposition ratio.

In this work, we propose Person Aware Tuning (PAT) of Mask-Aware\nTransformer (MAT) for face inpainting, which addresses this issue. Our proposed\nmethod, PATMAT, effectively preserves identity by incorporating reference\nimages of a subject and fine-tuning a MAT architecture trained on faces. By\nusing ~40 reference images, PATMAT creates anchor points in MAT's style module,\nand tunes the model using the fixed anchors to adapt the model to a new face\nidentity. Moreover, PATMAT's use of multiple images per anchor during training\nallows the model to use fewer reference images than competing methods. We\ndemonstrate that PATMAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of image\nquality, the preservation of person-specific details, and the identity of the\nsubject.

XPS data\nwere recorded with conventional spectrometers using an AlK(alpha) X-ray source\nfor spectra collected up to 600 C, and an MgK(Alpha) X-rays source for\ntemperatures above 600 C. The effect of the thickness, composition, and thermal\nstability of that oxide layer is relevant to understanding the functional\nproperties of superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities used in particle\naccelerators. There is a consensus that oxide plays a role in surface\nresistance (Rs). The focus of this study is Nb3Sn, which is a promising\nmaterial that is used in the manufacturing of superconducting radiofrequency\n(SRF) cavities as well as in quantum sensing, and pure Nb, which was included\nin the study for comparison. The thermal evolution of the oxide layer in these\ntwo materials is found to be quite different, which is ascribed to the\ninfluence of the Sn atom on the reactivity of the Nb atom in Nb3Sn films. Nb\nand Sn atoms in this intermetallic solid have different electronegativity, and\nthe Sn atom can reduce electron density around neighbouring Nb atoms in the\nsolid, thus reducing their reactivity for oxygen.

First, a structure detection method is\ndeveloped to estimate switch times in the activation and deactivation of\nstate-variable inequality path constraints. Second, using the detected\nstructure, the domain is partitioned into multiple-domains where each domain\ncorresponds to either a constrained or an unconstrained segment. Furthermore,\nadditional decision variables are introduced in the multiple-domain\nformulation, where these additional decision variables represent the switch\ntimes of the detected active state-variable inequality path constraints.

In analogy with GANs, those noise\nmaps could be considered as the latent code associated with the generated\nimage. However, this native noise space does not possess a convenient\nstructure, and is thus challenging to work with in editing tasks. Here, we\npropose an alternative latent noise space for DDPM that enables a wide range of\nediting operations via simple means, and present an inversion method for\nextracting these edit-friendly noise maps for any given image (real or\nsynthetically generated). As opposed to the native DDPM noise space, the\nedit-friendly noise maps do not have a standard normal distribution and are not\nstatistically independent across timesteps. However, they allow perfect\nreconstruction of any desired image, and simple transformations on them\ntranslate into meaningful manipulations of the output image (e.g., shifting,\ncolor edits). Moreover, in text-conditional models, fixing those noise maps\nwhile changing the text prompt, modifies semantics while retaining structure.\nWe illustrate how this property enables text-based editing of real images via\nthe diverse DDPM sampling scheme (in contrast to the popular non-diverse DDIM\ninversion).

The different material domains are\ndiscretized independently thus avoiding time-consuming, conformal meshing. In\nthis approach, the superposition of foreground (inclusion) and background\n(matrix) domain integration smoothing cells are corrected by a quasi-conforming\nquadtree subdivision on the background integration smoothing cells. Due to the\nnon-conforming nature of the background integration smoothing cells near the\nmaterial interfaces, a variationally consistent (VC) correction for domain\nintegration is introduced to restore integration constraints and thus optimal\nconvergence rates at a minor computational cost. Additional interface\nintegration smoothing cells with area (volume) correction, while\nnon-conforming, can be easily introduced to further enhance the accuracy and\nstability of the Galerkin solution using VC integration on non-conforming\ncells. To properly approximate the weak discontinuity across the material\ninterface by a penalty-free Nitsche's method with enhanced coercivity, the\ninterface nodes on the surface of the foreground discretization are also shared\nwith the background discretization. As such, there are no tunable parameters,\nsuch as those involved in the penalty type method, to enforce interface\ncompatibility in this approach.

The domination rule is defined as a partial order that\nvaries along different systems and tasks. For example, we may state that a\ntuple is dominated by tuples which extend it by assigning additional\nattributes, or assigning larger intervals. The result of filtering the relation\nwould then be the skyline according to this partial order. As this filtering\nmay remove most of the extracted tuples, we study whether we can improve the\nperformance of the extraction by compiling the domination rule into the\nextractor.\n  To this aim, we introduce the skyline operator for declarative information\nextraction tasks expressed as document spanners. We show that this operator can\nbe expressed via regular operations when the domination partial order can\nitself be expressed as a regular spanner, which covers several natural\ndomination rules. Yet, we show that the skyline operator incurs a computational\ncost (under combined complexity). First, there are cases where the operator\nrequires an exponential blowup on the number of states needed to represent the\nspanner as a sequential variable-set automaton.

Here, we introduce u-Unwrap3D, a framework to remap\narbitrarily complex 3D cell surfaces and membrane-associated signals into\nequivalent lower dimensional representations. The mappings are bidirectional,\nallowing the application of image processing operations in the data\nrepresentation best suited for the task and to subsequently present the results\nin any of the other representations, including the original 3D cell surface.\nLeveraging this surface-guided computing paradigm, we track segmented surface\nmotifs in 2D to quantify the recruitment of Septin polymers by blebbing events;\nwe quantify actin enrichment in peripheral ruffles; and we measure the speed of\nruffle movement along topographically complex cell surfaces. Thus, u-Unwrap3D\nprovides access to spatiotemporal analyses of cell biological parameters on\nunconstrained 3D surface geometries and signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 22:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

Humans show a remarkable aptitude for this, and\ncan solve many different types of tasks, given definitions in the form of\ntextual instructions and a small set of examples. Recent work with pre-trained\nlanguage models mimics this learning style: users can define and exemplify a\ntask for the model to attempt as a series of natural language prompts or\ninstructions. While prompting approaches have led to higher cross-task\ngeneralization compared to traditional supervised learning, analyzing 'bias' in\nthe task instructions given to the model is a difficult problem, and has thus\nbeen relatively unexplored. For instance, are we truly modeling a task, or are\nwe modeling a user's instructions?

There is yet no resolution of\nbasic questions such as what the constituent particles are. We work here with\nblack hole thermodynamics (BHT), and the metric geometry of thermodynamics,\nwhich connects to interparticle interactions via the invariant thermodynamic\nRicci scalar curvature $R$. $R$ may be calculated with BHT. In ordinary\nthermodynamics (OT), $R$ is positive/negative for interparticle interactions\nrepulsive/attractive. Its magnitude is the correlation length. The basic\nuniversality of thermodynamics leads us to expect similar relations for BHT.\nOur contribution here is motivated by a physical simplification that frequently\noccurs at low temperatures $T$ in OT: complicated interactions tend to freeze\nout, leaving only basic quantum statistical interactions, those of ideal Fermi\nor Bose gasses. Our hope is that similar simplification happens in black holes\nin the extremal limit, where the BHT temperature $T \\to 0$.

This occurs because rhetorical citing redistributes some citations\nfrom a stable set of elite-quality papers to a more dynamic set with\nhigh-to-moderate quality and high rhetorical value. Increasing the size of\nreference lists, often seen as an undesirable trend, amplifies the effects.

Here, we\nuse five years of data from a validated survey administered to non-majors\nduring their first year, physics majors throughout their undergraduate\neducation, and first-year physics Ph.D. students at a large research university\nin the US. We find that physics majors in the first-year responded to the\nsurvey prompts more positively than their non-physics major peers who were in\nthe same introductory courses, with the largest differences in perceived\nrecognition, interest, and physics identity and somewhat smaller differences in\nself-efficacy, perception of peer interaction, and sense of belonging. Further,\nthe average survey responses of physics majors for each belief remain largely\nconstant over time from their first-year of the undergraduate curriculum\nthrough the last year and comparable to the Ph.D. students. This suggests that\nstudents are adjusting their interpretation of the survey items to match the\ncurrent level of expertise expected of them. One exception occurs in the second\nyear, when peer interaction and sense of belonging reach a minimum. Moreover,\nphysics identity dips to the lowest value in the fourth year when many students\nare contemplating continuing in physics beyond their undergraduate years or\nswitching fields. We also find that perceived recognition is the best predictor\nof physics identity for physics majors throughout their entire physics\neducation, pointing to the importance of instructors making a concerted effort\nto recognize and affirm their students throughout their education.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 23:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

The parameterization is based\non a nonlinear version of the Youla parameterization and the recently proposed\nRecurrent Equilibrium Network (REN) class of models. We prove that the\nresulting Youla-REN parameterization automatically satisfies stability\n(contraction) and user-tunable robustness (Lipschitz) conditions on the\nclosed-loop system. This means it can be used for safe learning-based control\nwith no additional constraints or projections required to enforce stability or\nrobustness. We test the new policy class in simulation on two reinforcement\nlearning tasks: 1) magnetic suspension, and 2) inverting a rotary-arm pendulum.\nWe find that the Youla-REN performs similarly to existing learning-based and\noptimal control methods while also ensuring stability and exhibiting improved\nrobustness to adversarial disturbances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 23:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

On inspection however,\nthe results are difficult to interpret; recent learning-based methods employ a\nvast diversity of experimental setups and design choices: empirical results are\noften reported using different backbones, protocols, datasets, types of\nsupervisions or tasks. Since these differences are often coupled together, it\nraises a natural question on what makes a good learned keypoint detector. In\nthis work, we revisit the design of existing keypoint detectors by\ndeconstructing their methodologies and identifying the key components. We\nre-design each component from first-principle and propose Simple Learned\nKeypoints (SiLK) that is fully-differentiable, lightweight, and flexible.\nDespite its simplicity, SiLK advances new state-of-the-art on Detection\nRepeatability and Homography Estimation tasks on HPatches and 3D Point-Cloud\nRegistration task on ScanNet, and achieves competitive performance to\nstate-of-the-art on camera pose estimation in 2022 Image Matching Challenge and\nScanNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 23:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

We introduce SURFSUP, a framework that represents objects\nimplicitly using signed distance functions (SDFs), rather than an explicit\nrepresentation of meshes or particles. This continuous representation of\ngeometry enables more accurate simulation of fluid-object interactions over\nlong time periods while simultaneously making computation more efficient.\nMoreover, SURFSUP trained on simple shape primitives generalizes considerably\nout-of-distribution, even to complex real-world scenes and objects.

For\nthese datasets, conventional estimation methods can hardly be used immediately\nbecause practitioners often suffer from limited computational resources. In\nmost cases, they do not have powerful computational resources (e.g., Hadoop or\nSpark). How to practically analyze large datasets with limited computational\nresources then becomes a problem of great importance. To solve this problem, we\npropose here a novel subsampling-based method with jackknifing. The key idea is\nto treat the whole sample data as if they were the population. Then, multiple\nsubsamples with greatly reduced sizes are obtained by the method of simple\nrandom sampling with replacement. It is remarkable that we do not recommend\nsampling methods without replacement because this would incur a significant\ncost for data processing on the hard drive. Such cost does not exist if the\ndata are processed in memory. Because subsampled data have relatively small\nsizes, they can be comfortably read into computer memory as a whole and then\nprocessed easily. Based on subsampled datasets, jackknife-debiased estimators\ncan be obtained for the target parameter. The resulting estimators are\nstatistically consistent, with an extremely small bias.

In this work, we propose a novel structure-aware GLM, fully\nunleashing the power of syntactic knowledge for UIE. A heterogeneous structure\ninductor is explored to unsupervisedly induce rich heterogeneous structural\nrepresentations by post-training an existing GLM. In particular, a structural\nbroadcaster is devised to compact various latent trees into explicit high-order\nforests, helping to guide a better generation during decoding.

We\nargue that the two crucial issues in SFR, the face quality and burstiness, are\nboth identity-irrelevant and variance-relevant. The quality and burstiness\nassessment are interfered with by the entanglement of identity, and the face\nrecognition is interfered with by the entanglement of variance. Thus we propose\nto separate the identity features with the variance features in a\nlight-weighted set-based disentanglement framework. Beyond disentanglement, the\nvariance features are fully utilized to indicate face quality and burstiness in\na set, rather than being discarded after training. To suppress face burstiness\nin the sets, we propose a vocabulary-based burst suppression (VBS) method which\nquantizes faces with a reference vocabulary. With interword and intra-word\nnormalization operations on the assignment scores, the face burtisness degrees\nare appropriately estimated. The extensive illustrations and experiments\ndemonstrate the effect of the disentanglement framework with VBS, which gets\nnew state-of-the-art on the SFR benchmarks.

Graphene's binding affinity for long-chain polyselenides\n(Se-Se-Se = -2.82 eV and Se-Se = -2.646 eV) and ability to induce reactivity\nbetween Se and K are investigated. Furthermore, intercalation voltage for\ngraphene enclosed KxSe cathode reaction intermediates are calculated with K2Se\nas the final discharged product. Our results indicate a single-step reaction\nnear a voltage of 1.55 V between K and Se cathode. Our findings suggest that\noperating at higher voltages (~2V) could result in the formation of reaction\nintermediates where intercalation/deintercalation of K could be a challenge,\nand therefore cause irreversible capacity losses in the battery. Primary issues\nare the high binding energy of long-chain polyselenides with graphene that\ndiscourage K storage and Se-Se bond dissociation at low K concentrations. A\ncomparison with graphene-free cathode highlights the substantial changes a van\nder Waals (vdW) graphene interface can bring in atomic-structure and\nelectrochemistry of the KxSe cathode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 04:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

A\ncontinuous-time Markov Chain (CTMC) model is proposed to characterize the\nstatus change of drivers under joint movement of passengers and parcels over\nthe transportation network with limited vehicle capacity, where the service\nquality of ride-sourcing services, on-demand delivery services, and flexible\ndelivery services are rigorously quantified. Building on the CTMC model,\nincentives for ride-sourcing passengers, delivery customers, drivers, and the\nplatform are captured through an economic equilibrium model, and the optimal\noperational decisions of the platform are derived by solving a non-convex\nprofit-maximizing problem.

We\ndiscuss that the lowest order partial spectrum is insufficient to discriminate\nthe magnetic structures with different magnetic anisotropy, and a higher order\npartial spectrum is required in general to characterize detailed magnetic\nstructures on the same atomic configuration. We then introduce the fourth-order\npartial spectrum and evaluate the discrimination performance for different\nmagnetic structures, mainly focusing on the difference in magnetic symmetry.\nThe modified partial spectra that are defined not to reflect the difference of\nmagnetic anisotropy are also useful in evaluating magnetic structures obtained\nfrom first-principles calculations without spin-orbit coupling. We apply the\npresent method to the symmetry-classified magnetic structures for the crystals\nof Mn$_3$Ir and Mn$_3$Sn, which are known to exhibit anomalous transport under\nthe antiferromagnetic order, and examine the discrimination performance of the\ndescriptor for different magnetic structures on the same crystal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 06:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

The 154 microns emission and the\npolarization signal is coincident with a region of cold dust observed in the\nsoutheastern shell and in the unshocked central ejecta. The highly polarized\nfar-IR emission implies the grains are large (greater than 0.14 microns) and\nsilicate-dominated. The polarization level varies across the SNR, with an\ninverse correlation between the polarization degree and the intensity and\nsmaller polarization angle dispersion for brighter SNR emission. Stronger\npolarization is detected between the bright structures.

Unfortunately, the former solution is infeasible for\nedge devices that lack on-device backpropagation capabilities, while the latter\noften struggles with limited generalization ability, especially for\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data.

VFMs\nare based on models, and these models require calibration. The calibration is\nhighly dependent on the application, both due to the great diversity of the\nmodels, and in the available measurements.

This\npaper presents a calibration method based on the measurement provided by the\nproduction separator, and the assumption that the observed flow should be equal\nto the sum of flow rates from each individual well. This allows us to jointly\ncalibrate the VFMs continuously. The method applies Sequential Monte Carlo\n(SMC) to infer a tuning factor and the flow composition for each well. The\nmethod is tested on a case with ten wells, using both synthetic and real data.\nThe results are promising and the method is able to provide reasonable\nestimates of the parameters without relying on well tests.

Questions on the\nexistence of universally optimal algorithms were first raised by Garay, Kutten,\nand Peleg in FOCS '93. This research direction reemerged recently through a\nseries of works, including the influential work of Haeupler, Wajc, and Zuzic in\nSTOC '21, which resolves some of these decades-old questions in the supported\nCONGEST model.\n  We work in the HYBRID distributed model, which analyzes networks combining\nboth global and local communication. Much attention has recently been devoted\nto solving distance related problems, such as All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP)\nin HYBRID, culminating in a $\\tilde \\Theta(n^{1/2})$ round algorithm for exact\nAPSP. However, by definition, every problem in HYBRID is solvable in $D$\n(diameter) rounds, showing that it is far from universally optimal.\n  We show the first universally optimal algorithms in HYBRID, by presenting a\nfundamental tool that solves any broadcasting problem in a universally optimal\nnumber of rounds, deterministically. Specifically, we consider the problem in a\ngraph $G$ where a set of $k$ messages $M$ distributed arbitrarily across $G$,\nrequires every node to learn all of $M$. We show a universal lower bound and a\nmatching, deterministic upper bound, for any graph $G$, any value $k$, and any\ndistribution of $M$ across $G$.\n  This broadcasting tool opens a new exciting direction of research into\nshowing universally optimal algorithms in HYBRID.

The existing SRP methods have successfully considered many\ncommonly used architectures, such as normalizations, pooling methods,\nmulti-branch convolution.

This paper presents\nnew high-resolution MeerKAT observations of three atomic gas clouds and studies\nthe relationship between the atomic and molecular phases at $\\sim 1$ pc scales.\nThe clouds' atomic hydrogen column densities, $N_{\\mathrm{HI}}$, are less than\na $\\mbox{few}\\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, but the two clouds closest to the\nGalactic Centre nonetheless have detectable CO emission. This implies the\npresence of H$_{2}$ at levels of $N_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ at least a factor of ten\nlower than in the typical Galactic interstellar medium. For the cloud closest\nto the Galactic Centre, there is little correlation between the\n$N_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ and the probability that it will harbour detectable CO\nemissions. In contrast, for the intermediate cloud, detectable CO is heavily\nbiased toward the highest values of $N_{\\mathrm{HI}}$. The cloud most distant\nfrom the Galactic Centre has no detectable CO at similar $N_{\\mathrm{HI}}$\nvalues. Moreover, we find that the two clouds with detectable CO are too\nmolecule-rich to be in chemical equilibrium, given the depths of their atomic\nshielding layers, which suggests a scenario whereby these clouds consist of\npre-existing molecular gas from the disc that the Galactic wind has swept up,\nand that is dissociating into atomic hydrogen as it flows away from the Galaxy.\nWe estimate that entrained molecular material of this type has a $\\sim\n\\mathrm{few}-10$ Myr lifetime before photodissociating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 09:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

This peculiar feature characterizes them as out-of-equilibrium systems\nthat break microscopic reversibility. The problem of finding a specific target\nin a complex environment is essential for these agents since it is employed for\na variety of purposes, from foraging nourishment to escaping potential threats.\nHere, we provide a detailed study of the target search process for\nmicroswimmers exploring complex environments. To this end, we generalize\nTransition Path Theory, the rigorous statistical mechanics description of\ntransition processes, to the target-search problem. One of the main results of\nthis thesis is the generalization to non-equilibrium systems of the Transition\nPath Sampling (TPS) algorithm, which was originally designed to simulate rare\ntransitions in passive systems. The TPS algorithm relies on microscopic\nreversibility for its functioning, therefore its generalization to\nout-of-equilibrium systems lacking detailed balance and microscopic\nreversibility has remained a major challenge. Within this work, we generalize\nthe TPS algorithm to the case of an active Brownian particle, i.e. a\nparadigmatic model for microswimmers, and we obtain a first insight into the\ncounterintuitive target-search pathways explored by these agents. The second\nresult of this thesis is a systematic characterization of the target-search\npath ensemble for an active particle exploring an energy landscape. The third\nand final original contribution of this Ph.D. thesis is the generalization of\nthe concept of the committor function to target-search problems, with a\nvalidation of our theory against experiments of a camphor self-propelled disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 09:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

The asymmetric HD 142527 disk\nprovides another good opportunity to investigate the role of dust traps in\nsetting the disk's chemical composition. In this work, we use archival ALMA\nobservations of the HD 142527 disk to obtain an as large as possible molecular\ninventory, which allows us to investigate the possible influence of the\nasymmetric dust trap on the disk's chemistry.

We think it well imitates human visual recognition, i.e.,\nhumans may use the ancestor class as a prompt to draw focus on the subtle\ndifferences among descendant classes. We model this prompting mechanism into a\nTransformer with Hierarchical Prompting (TransHP). TransHP consists of three\nsteps: 1) learning a set of prompt tokens to represent the coarse (ancestor)\nclasses, 2) on-the-fly predicting the coarse class of the input image at an\nintermediate block, and 3) injecting the prompt token of the predicted coarse\nclass into the intermediate feature.

A well-resolved Large Eddy Simulation (LES)\ndeveloped in-house is used for the purpose. Flow separation has been induced by\nimposing an adverse pressure gradient on the upper boundary of a Cartesian\ndomain. Isotropic perturbations are introduced at the inlet to mimic grid\nturbulence. With an increase of fst, an upstream shift in the mean reattachment\npoint has been observed while the onset of separation remains almost invariant,\nshrinking the bubble length significantly. The transition of the shear layer is\ntriggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability for fst of less than 3.3%,\nwhile Klebanoff modes (Kmodes) dictate the flow transition at fst greater than\n6.5%. Further, a mixed mode, i.e., both K-H and K-modes, contribute to the flow\ntransition at a moderate level of fst, lying between 3.3% and 6.5%. Thus, the\nroll-up of the shear layer appears in the second half of the bubble shedding\nlarge-scale vortices that keep their identity far downstream at low fst levels.\nOn the contrary, the streamwise streaks via K-modes prior to the separation are\nfound to interact with the LSB, resulting in an earlier breakdown of the shear\nlayer with abundant small-scale vortices downstream at the moderate to high fst\nlevels. However, higher surface-normal heat flux is associated with large-scale\nenergetic coherent vortices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 10:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

Confirming\nthis hypothesis, several studies concluded that the simultaneous use of optical\nand thermal images leads to better predictions in crowd counting.

Since the use of multimodal data usually increases the\ncomplexity, inference time, and memory requirements of the models, it is\nrelevant to examine the differences and advantages of multimodal compared to\nmonomodal models. In this work, all available multimodal datasets for crowd\ncounting are used to investigate the differences between monomodal and\nmultimodal models. To do so, we designed a monomodal architecture that\nconsiders the current state of research on monomodal crowd counting. In\naddition, several multimodal architectures have been developed using different\nmultimodal learning strategies. The key components of the monomodal\narchitecture are also used in the multimodal architectures to be able to answer\nwhether multimodal models perform better in crowd counting in general.\nSurprisingly, no general answer to this question can be derived from the\nexisting datasets.

The sequencing of MIK2 in chicory\nand endive accessions revealed two contrasting scenarios. In C. endivia, MIK2\nwas fully conserved even comparing different botanical varieties (smooth and\ncurly). In C. intybus, 387 SNPs and 3 INDELs were identified when comparing\naccessions of different biotypes from the same botanical variety (radicchio).\nThe SNP distribution throughout the gene was uneven, with hypervariable domains\npreferentially localized in the LRR-rich extracellular region, putatively\nidentified as the receptor domain. The gene was hypothesized to be under\npositive selection, as the nonsynonymous mutations were more than double the\nsynonymous ones (dN / dS = 2.17). An analogous situation was observed analyzing\nthe first 500 bp of the MIK2 promoter: no SNPs were observed among the endive\nsamples, whereas 44 SNPs and 6 INDELs were detected among the chicory samples.\nFurther analyses are needed to confirm the role of MIK2 in SSI and to\ndemonstrate whether the 23 species-specific nonsynonymous SNPs in the CDS\nand/or the species-specific 10 bp INDEL found in a CCAAT box region of the\npromoter are responsible for the contrasting sexual behaviors of the two\nspecies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 11:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

However, the communication systems of PV plants\nintroduce delays of a stochastic nature that degrade the performance of\ncentralised control algorithms. Therefore, controllers for oscillation damping\nmay not operate correctly unless the communication channel characteristics are\nnot considered and compensated. In this paper, a centralised controller is\nproposed for the oscillation damping that uses a PV plant with all the\nrealistic effects of communication channels taken into consideration. The\ncommunication channels are modelled based on measurements taken in a laboratory\nenvironment. The controller is designed to damp several modes of oscillation by\nusing the open-loop phase shift compensation. Theoretical developments were\nvalidated in a laboratory using four converters acting as two PV inverters, a\nbattery and a STATCOM.

To shed new light on the complex\nrelationships between plant characteristics and fire regimes, we developed a\nnew conceptual, mechanistic model that includes plant competition, stochastic\nfires, and fire-vegetation feedback. Considering a single standing plant\nfunctional type, we observed that highly flammable and slowly colonizing plants\ncan persist only when they have a strong fire response, while fast colonizing\nand less flammable plants can display a larger range of fire responses. At the\ncommunity level, the fire response of the strongest competitor determines the\nexistence of alternative ecological states, i.e. different plant communities,\nunder the same environmental conditions. Specifically, when the strongest\ncompetitor had a very strong fire response, such as in Mediterranean forests,\nonly one ecological state could be achieved. Conversely, when the strongest\ncompetitor was poorly fire-adapted, alternative ecological states emerged, for\nexample between tropical humid savannas and forests, or between different types\nof boreal forests. These findings underline the importance of including the\nplant fire response when modeling fire ecosystems, e.g. to predict the\nvegetation response to invasive species or to climate change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 12:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

To reduce the computational and memory\ncost, current methods first split the large input into local patches and then\nmerge the SR patches into the output. These methods adaptively allocate a\nsubnet for each patch. Quantization is a very important technique for network\nacceleration and has been used to design the subnets. Current methods train an\nMLP bit selector to determine the propoer bit for each layer. However, they\nuniformly sample subnets for training, making simple subnets overfitted and\ncomplicated subnets underfitted. Therefore, the trained bit selector fails to\ndetermine the optimal bit. Apart from this, the introduced bit selector brings\nadditional cost to each layer of the SR network. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method named Content-Aware Bit Mapping (CABM), which can remove the bit\nselector without any performance loss. CABM also learns a bit selector for each\nlayer during training. After training, we analyze the relation between the edge\ninformation of an input patch and the bit of each layer. We observe that the\nedge information can be an effective metric for the selected bit. Therefore, we\ndesign a strategy to build an Edge-to-Bit lookup table that maps the edge score\nof a patch to the bit of each layer during inference. The bit configuration of\nSR network can be determined by the lookup tables of all layers. Our strategy\ncan find better bit configuration, resulting in more efficient mixed precision\nnetworks. We conduct detailed experiments to demonstrate the generalization\nability of our method.

Some studies combine SSL with knowledge distillation\n(SSL-KD) to boost the representation learning performance of small models. In\nthis study, we propose a Multi-mode Online Knowledge Distillation method (MOKD)\nto boost self-supervised visual representation learning. Different from\nexisting SSL-KD methods that transfer knowledge from a static pre-trained\nteacher to a student, in MOKD, two different models learn collaboratively in a\nself-supervised manner. Specifically, MOKD consists of two distillation modes:\nself-distillation and cross-distillation modes. Among them, self-distillation\nperforms self-supervised learning for each model independently, while\ncross-distillation realizes knowledge interaction between different models. In\ncross-distillation, a cross-attention feature search strategy is proposed to\nenhance the semantic feature alignment between different models. As a result,\nthe two models can absorb knowledge from each other to boost their\nrepresentation learning performance. Extensive experimental results on\ndifferent backbones and datasets demonstrate that two heterogeneous models can\nbenefit from MOKD and outperform their independently trained baseline. In\naddition, MOKD also outperforms existing SSL-KD methods for both the student\nand teacher models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 12:55:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 06:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

In this study, we applied the statisticians' concept of signal\ndetection of physics data with small-size samples and high dimensions without\nmodeling the signals. Most of the data in nature, whether noises or signals,\nare assumed to be generated by dynamical systems; thus, there is essentially no\ndistinction between these generating processes. We propose that the correlation\nlength of a dynamical system and the number of samples are crucial for the\npractical definition of noise variables among the signal variables generated by\nsuch a system. Since variables with short-term correlations reach normal\ndistributions faster as the number of samples decreases, they are regarded to\nbe ``noise-like'' variables, whereas variables with opposite properties are\n``signal-like'' variables. Normality tests are not effective for data of\nsmall-size samples with high dimensions. Therefore, we modeled noises on the\nbasis of the property of a noise variable, that is, the uniformity of the\nhistogram of the probability that a variable is a noise.

Due to the difference between the imbalanced training\ndistribution and balanced test distribution, existing calibration methods such\nas temperature scaling can not generalize well to this problem. Specific\ncalibration methods for domain adaptation are also not applicable because they\nrely on unlabeled target domain instances which are not available.

This results in non-local correlated quenched disorder\nwhich unfortunately is typically hard to handle. To overcome this difficulty,\nwe divide the dynamical process into two sets of variables: a set of stochastic\nindependent variables (representing the infection delays), plus a set of\ncorrelated variables (the infection times) that depend deterministically on the\nfirst.

Federated Learning, an emerging\ndistributed machine learning approach, is an excellent solution to address\nthese issues.

Even though a few such\nthrusters are currently undergoing their late-stage development campaigns, many\nunanswered questions yet exist concerning the behavior and evolution of the\nplasma in these large-size thrusters that feature an unconventional magnetic\nfield topology. Noting the complex, multi-dimensional nature of plasma\nprocesses in Hall thrusters, high-fidelity particle-in-cell simulations are\noptimal tools to study the intricate plasma behavior. Nonetheless, the\nsignificant computational cost of traditional PIC schemes renders simulating\nhigh-power thrusters without any physics-altering speed-up factors unfeasible.\nThus, in this article, we demonstrate the applicability of the novel\nreduced-order PIC scheme for a cost-efficient, self-consistent study of the\nhigh-power Hall thrusters by performing simulations of a 20 kW magnetically\nshielded Hall thruster along the axial-azimuthal and radial-azimuthal\ncoordinates. The axial-azimuthal simulations are performed for three operating\nconditions in a rather simplified representation of the thruster's inherently\n3D configuration. Nevertheless, we resolved self-consistently an unprecedented\n650 us of the discharge evolution without any ad-hoc electron mobility model,\ncapturing several breathing cycles and approximating the experimental\nperformance parameters with an accuracy of 70 to 80 % across the operating\nconditions. The radial-azimuthal simulations casted further light on the\nevolution of the azimuthal instabilities and the resulting variations in the\nelectrons' cross-field mobility and the plasma-wall interactions. Particularly,\nwe observed the development of a long-wavelength, relatively low-frequency wave\nmode near the exit plane of the thruster's channel that induces a notable\nelectron transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 14:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

For convenience, we refer\nto the fixed partitions as fixed mini-batches. Then for each computation\niteration, the gradients are sequentially calculated on each fixed mini-batch.\nBecause the size of fixed mini-batches is typically much smaller than the whole\nsample size, it can be easily computed. This leads to much reduced computation\ncost for each computational iteration. It makes FMGD computationally efficient\nand practically more feasible. To demonstrate the theoretical properties of\nFMGD, we start with a linear regression model with a constant learning rate. We\nstudy its numerical convergence and statistical efficiency properties.

We are given a list of elements and requests for these\nelements that arrive over time. Our goal is to serve these requests, at a cost\nequivalent to their position in the list, with the option of moving them\ntowards the head of the list. Sleator and Tarjan introduced the famous \"Move to\nFront\" algorithm (wherein any requested element is immediately moved to the\nhead of the list) and showed that it is 2-competitive. While this bound is\nexcellent, the absolute cost of the algorithm's solution may be very large\n(e.g., requesting the last half elements of the list would result in a solution\ncost that is quadratic in the length of the list). Thus, we consider the more\ngeneral problem wherein every request arrives with a deadline and must be\nserved, not immediately, but rather before the deadline. We further allow the\nalgorithm to serve multiple requests simultaneously. We denote this problem as\nList Update with Time Windows. While this generalization benefits from lower\nsolution costs, it requires new types of algorithms. In particular, for the\nsimple example of requesting the last half elements of the list with\noverlapping time windows, Move-to-Front fails. We show an O(1) competitive\nalgorithm. The algorithm is natural but the analysis is a bit complicated and a\nnovel potential function is required.

This problem includes as a special case the prize\ncollecting version in which a request might not be served (up to some deadline)\nand instead suffers an arbitrary given penalty. Here we also establish an O(1)\ncompetitive algorithm for general delays. The algorithm for the delay version\nis more complex and its analysis is significantly more involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 14:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

Current ways to calibrate this rate do not\nusually employ observational methods accounting for the low-mass end of stellar\npopulations as their signatures are too weak. Accessing the bulk of\nprotostellar activity within galactic star-forming regions can be achieved by\ntracing signposts of ongoing star formation. One such signpost is molecular\noutflows, which are bright in molecular emission. We propose to utilize the\nprotostellar outflow emission as a tracer of the SFR. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel version of the galaxy-in-a-box model, which can be used to\nrelate molecular emission from star formation in galaxies with the SFR. We\nmeasured the predicted para-H2O emission at 988 GHz and corresponding SFRs for\ngalaxies with LFIR = $10^8$ - $10^{11}$ L$_\\odot$ in a distance-independent\nmanner, and compared them with expectations from observations. We evaluated the\nderived results by varying the star formation efficiency, the free-fall time\nscaling factor, and the initial mass function. For the chosen H2O transition,\nrelying on the current Galactic observations and star formation properties, we\nare underestimating the total galactic emission, while overestimating the SFRs,\nparticularly for more starburst-like configurations. The current version of the\ngalaxy-in-a-box model accounts for a limited number of processes and\nconfigurations, that is, it focuses on ongoing star formation in massive young\nclusters in a spiral galaxy. Therefore, the inferred results, which\nunderestimate the emission and overestimate the SFR, are not surprising: known\nsources of emission are not included in the model. To improve the results, the\nnext version of the model needs to include a more detailed treatment of the\nentire galactic ecosystem and other processes that would contribute to the\nemission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 14:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

The\napproximation is constructed by partitioning the reaction network into a fast\nand slow subgroup of fast and slow reactions, respectively. This enables the\nmodeling of the dynamics using a Langevin equation for the fast group, while a\nMarkov jump process model is kept for the dynamics of the slow group.

A better understanding of\nhuman interactive behaviour could help address this challenge. Such\nunderstanding could be obtained through modelling human behaviour. However,\nexisting modelling approaches predominantly neglect communication between\ndrivers and assume that some drivers in the interaction only respond to others,\nbut do not actively influence them. Here we argue that addressing these two\nlimitations is crucial for accurate modelling of interactions. We propose a new\ncomputational framework addressing these limitations. Similar to game-theoretic\napproaches, we model the interaction in an integral way rather than modelling\nan isolated driver who only responds to their environment. Contrary to game\ntheory, our framework explicitly incorporates communication and bounded\nrationality. We demonstrate the model in a simplified merging scenario,\nillustrating that it generates plausible interactive behaviour (e.g.,\naggressive and conservative merging). Furthermore, human-like gap-keeping\nbehaviour emerged in a car-following scenario directly from risk perception\nwithout the explicit implementation of time or distance gaps in the model's\ndecision-making.

Therefore, it is crucial to\ndevelop techniques to protect against model theft. Model ownership resolution\n(MOR) is a class of techniques that can deter model theft. A MOR scheme enables\nan accuser to assert an ownership claim for a suspect model by presenting\nevidence, such as a watermark or fingerprint, to show that the suspect model\nwas stolen or derived from a source model owned by the accuser. Most of the\nexisting MOR schemes prioritize robustness against malicious suspects, ensuring\nthat the accuser will win if the suspect model is indeed a stolen model.\n  In this paper, we show that common MOR schemes in the literature are\nvulnerable to a different, equally important but insufficiently explored,\nrobustness concern: a malicious accuser. We show how malicious accusers can\nsuccessfully make false claims against independent suspect models that were not\nstolen. Our core idea is that a malicious accuser can deviate (without\ndetection) from the specified MOR process by finding (transferable) adversarial\nexamples that successfully serve as evidence against independent suspect\nmodels. To this end, we first generalize the procedures of common MOR schemes\nand show that, under this generalization, defending against false claims is as\nchallenging as preventing (transferable) adversarial examples.

After\nnormalising to quasi-static mechanical properties to account for material\nlosses during hirtisation (34-37% reduction in strut diameter), the fatigue\nproperties show a marked improvement due to the reduction in surface roughness.\nNormalised high cycle fatigue strength ($\\sigma_{f,10^{6}}/\\sigma_{y}$)\nincreased from around 0.1 to 0.16-0.21 after hirtisation, an average increase\nof 80%.

Therefore, building a\ndeeper understanding of these viruses is essential to devise prevention and\nmitigation mechanisms. In the Coronavirus genome, an essential structural\nregion is the spike region, and it's responsible for attaching the virus to the\nhost cell membrane. Therefore, the usage of only the spike protein, instead of\nthe full genome, provides most of the essential information for performing\nanalyses such as host classification.

The framework is very general and does not\neven assume the existence of a background spacetime. As a result, it is an open\nquestion how the framework should be interpreted physically and how and even if\ncomposition can be defined. On the other hand, so-called causal boxes define a\nframework that allows for arbitrary composition. In this work, we treat quantum\ncircuits with quantum control of causal order (QC-QC), a subset of process\nmatrices, which can be interpreted as generalized quantum circuits, and process\nbox, a subset of causal boxes, which can be interpreted as processes. We\nanalyze their state spaces and define a notion of operational equivalence\nbetween QC-QCs and process boxes based on this analysis. We then explicitly\nconstruct for each QC-QC an operationally equivalent process box. This allows\nus to define composition of QC-QCs in terms of composition of causal boxes\nwhich is well-defined. We further show that process boxes admit a unitary\nextension and conjecture that the background spacetime can be assumed to have a\nspecific simple form. Based on this conjecture, we construct an operationally\nequivalent QC-QC for each process box. Our results indicate that the only class\nof processes that can be physically implemented in a fixed background spacetime\nare those that can be interpreted as quantum circuits with quantum controlled\nsuperpositions of orders. Further, they also reveal that the composability\nissue can be resolved by embedding processes in a spacetime structure.

To leverage the\ninput of a road network across these different applications, it is necessary to\nlearn the representations of the roads in the form of vectors, which is named\n\\emph{road network representation learning} (RNRL). While several models have\nbeen proposed for RNRL, they capture the pairwise relationships/connections\namong roads only (i.e., as a simple graph), and fail to capture among roads the\nhigh-order relationships (e.g., those roads that jointly form a local region\nusually have similar features such as speed limit) and long-range relationships\n(e.g., some roads that are far apart may have similar semantics such as being\nroads in residential areas).

With its affordability and\napplicability to both computer scientists and biochemical laboratories, our\nsolution offers a wide range of benefits that make it an ideal choice for the\ncommunity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 09:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

To date, gratifying breakthroughs have been recorded in 3D object\ndetection research, attributed to deep learning. However, deep learning\nalgorithms are data-driven and require large amounts of annotated point cloud\ndata for training and evaluation. Unlike 2D image labels, annotating point\ncloud data is difficult due to the limitations of sparsity, irregularity, and\nlow resolution, which requires more manual work, and the annotation efficiency\nis much lower than 2D image.Therefore, we propose an annotation algorithm for\npoint cloud data, which is pre-annotation and camera-LiDAR late fusion\nalgorithm to easily and accurately annotate. The contributions of this study\nare as follows. We propose (1) a pre-annotation algorithm that employs 3D\nobject detection and auto fitting for the easy annotation of point clouds, (2)\na camera-LiDAR late fusion algorithm using 2D and 3D results for easily error\nchecking, which helps annotators easily identify missing objects, and (3) a\npoint cloud annotation evaluation pipeline to evaluate our experiments. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the annotating\nspeed by 6.5 times and the annotation quality in terms of the 3D Intersection\nover Union and precision by 8.2 points and 5.6 points, respectively;\nadditionally, the miss rate is reduced by 31.9 points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 01:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

The underlying\nassociation between $k$-square-root-type SEPs, which arise concurrently with\nreal (imaginary) gap closing in the complex spectrum, mimicking\nfirst-order-phase-transition criticalities, and complex conformal field\ntheories (cCFTs) is addressed through the calculation of complex central\ncharges.
