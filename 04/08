Reconfigurable Intelligent\nSurface (RIS) technology is gaining attention for its advantages of low power\nconsumption, cost-effectiveness, and ease of deployment. However, existing\nchannel models for RIS often ignore important properties, such as the\nimpairment in the RIS's switch component and the polarization efficiency among\nantennas, limiting their practical use. In this paper, we propose a new channel\nmodel for RIS that considers these ignored properties, including the reflected\nfield, scattered field, and antenna resonant mode. We verify the proposed model\nthrough the practical implementation of a 4 x 4 RIS array with patch antennas\nin the 3.5 GHz band, using a phase shifter as the switch component of a RIS\nelement. The equivalent model of the phase shifter is also formulated and\nincorporated into the channel model. We propose a blind controlling algorithm\nto discuss the properties of our channel model and emphasize the importance of\nconsidering polarization and tracking mechanisms for the controlling algorithm.\nOur channel model is an improvement over existing models and can be used in the\npractical design of RIS technology. The proposed algorithm provides a practical\napproach to controlling the wireless environment, suitable for various wireless\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 16:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-10"}

This problem lies at the heart of numerous\napplications, including specification testing and litmus tests, stateless model\nchecking, and dynamic analyses. As such, it has been explored extensively and\nits complexity is well-understood for traditional models like SC and TSO.\nHowever, less is known for the numerous model variants of C/C++, for which the\nproblem becomes challenging due to the intricacies of their concurrency\nprimitives. In this work we study the problem of consistency checking for\npopular variants of the C11 memory model, in particular, the RC20 model, its\nrelease-acquire (RA) fragment, the strong and weak variants of RA (SRA and\nWRA), as well as the Relaxed fragment of RC20. Motivated by applications in\ntesting and model checking, we focus on reads-from consistency checking. The\ninput is an execution X specifying a set of events, their program order and\ntheir reads-from relation, and the task is to decide the existence of a\nmodification order on the writes of X that makes X consistent in a memory\nmodel. We draw a rich complexity landscape for this problem; our results\ninclude (i)~nearly-linear-time algorithms for certain variants, which improve\nover prior results, (ii)~fine-grained optimality results, as well as\n(iii)~matching upper and lower bounds (NP-hardness) for other variants. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to characterize the complexity of consistency\nchecking for C11 memory models. We have implemented our algorithms inside the\nTruSt model checker and the C11Tester testing tool. Experiments on standard\nbenchmarks show that our new algorithms improve consistency checking, often by\na significant margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 16:09:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 03:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

There exist\nnumerous efforts in literature where one-loop off-shell vertex is calculated by\nemploying the standard first order Feynman rules in different covariant gauges\nand space-time dimensions of interest. The tensor structure which decomposes\nthis three-point vertex into the components transverse and longitudinal to the\nphoton momentum gets intertwined in this first order formalism. The\nWard-Takahashi identity is explicitly invoked to untangle the two pieces and\nthe results are expressed in a preferred basis of twelve spin-amplitudes. We\npropose a novel approach based upon an efficient combination of the first and\nsecond order formalisms of quantum electrodynamics to compute this one-loop\nvertex. Among some conspicuous advantages is the fact that this less known\nsecond order formalism separates the spin and scalar degrees of freedom of an\nelectron interacting electromagnetically. More noticeably, the longitudinal and\ntransverse contributions naturally disentangle from the onset in our approach.\nMoreover, this decomposition leads to identities between one-loop scalar\nFeynman integrals with higher powers in the propagators and shifted space-time\ndimensions that can be used to prove the Ward-Takahashi identity at one-loop\norder without the need to evaluate any Feynman integral. Additionally, this\nnatural decomposition allows us to establish the gauge-independence of the\nPauli form factor through explicit cancellations of scalar Feynman integrals\nthat depend on the gauge parameter. These cancellations naturally lead to a\ncompact expression for the Pauli form factor in arbitrary dimensions.

In ML applications, unfairness is\ntriggered due to bias in the data, curation process, erroneous assumptions, and\nimplicit bias rendered within the algorithmic development process. As ML\napplications come into broader use developing fair ML applications is critical.\nLiterature suggests multiple views on how fairness in ML is described from the\nusers perspective and students as future developers. In particular, ML\ndevelopers have not been the focus of research relating to perceived fairness.\nThis paper reports on a pilot investigation of ML developers perception of\nfairness. In describing the perception of fairness, the paper performs an\nexploratory pilot study to assess the attributes of this construct using a\nsystematic focus group of developers. In the focus group, we asked participants\nto discuss three questions- 1) What are the characteristics of fairness in ML?\n2) What factors influence developers belief about the fairness of ML? and 3)\nWhat practices and tools are utilized for fairness in ML development? The\nfindings of this exploratory work from the focus group show that to assess\nfairness developers generally focus on the overall ML application design and\ndevelopment, i.e., business-specific requirements, data collection,\npre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. Thus, we conclude that the\nprocedural aspects of organizational justice theory can explain developers\nperception of fairness.

However, this assumption has only been precisely\ntested at $z \\lesssim 3$.

Such a\nscenario can potentially resolve tensions between inferences of the current\ncosmic expansion rate (the Hubble constant, $H_0$). We consider an explicit\nmodel in which a metastable sub-component of dark matter (DM) decays to\nStandard Model photons, whose spectral energy distribution is assumed to be\nclose to that of the CMB blackbody. A fit to Planck CMB anisotropy, COBE/FIRAS\nCMB monopole, and SH0ES distance-ladder measurements yields $H_0 = 71.2 \\pm\n1.1$ km/s/Mpc, matter fluctuation amplitude $S_8 = 0.774 \\pm 0.018$, and CMB\ntemperature increase $\\delta T_{\\rm CMB} = 0.109^{+0.033}_{-0.044}$ K, which is\nsourced by DM decay at $z \\gtrsim 10$.

A learning algorithm\nis replicable if it typically produces the same output when applied on two\ni.i.d. inputs using the same internal randomness. We study a variant of\nreplicability that does not involve fixing the randomness. An algorithm\nsatisfies this form of replicability if it typically produces the same output\nwhen applied on two i.i.d. inputs (without fixing the internal randomness).\nThis variant is called global stability and was introduced by Bun, Livni and\nMoran ('20) in the context of differential privacy.\n  Impagliazzo et al. showed how to boost any replicable algorithm so that it\nproduces the same output with probability arbitrarily close to 1. In contrast,\nwe demonstrate that for numerous learning tasks, global stability can only be\naccomplished weakly, where the same output is produced only with probability\nbounded away from 1. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of\nlist replicability, which is equivalent to global stability. Moreover, we prove\nthat list replicability can be boosted so that it is achieved with probability\narbitrarily close to 1. We also describe basic relations between standard\nlearning-theoretic complexity measures and list replicable numbers. Our\nresults, in addition, imply that besides trivial cases, replicable algorithms\n(in the sense of Impagliazzo et al.) must be randomized.\n  The proof of the impossibility result is based on a topological fixed-point\ntheorem.

To mimic such capability, we propose Embodied Concept Learner\n(ECL) in an interactive 3D environment. Specifically, a robot agent can ground\nvisual concepts, build semantic maps and plan actions to complete tasks by\nlearning purely from human demonstrations and language instructions, without\naccess to ground-truth semantic and depth supervisions from simulations. ECL\nconsists of: (i) an instruction parser that translates the natural languages\ninto executable programs; (ii) an embodied concept learner that grounds visual\nconcepts based on language descriptions; (iii) a map constructor that estimates\ndepth and constructs semantic maps by leveraging the learned concepts; and (iv)\na program executor with deterministic policies to execute each program. ECL has\nseveral appealing benefits thanks to its modularized design. Firstly, it\nenables the robotic agent to learn semantics and depth unsupervisedly acting\nlike babies, e.g., ground concepts through active interaction and perceive\ndepth by disparities when moving forward. Secondly, ECL is fully transparent\nand step-by-step interpretable in long-term planning. Thirdly, ECL could be\nbeneficial for the embodied instruction following (EIF), outperforming previous\nworks on the ALFRED benchmark when the semantic label is not provided.

In this paper, we\nchallenge this dense paradigm and present a new method, coined SparseFormer, to\nimitate human's sparse visual recognition in an end-to-end manner. SparseFormer\nlearns to represent images using a highly limited number of tokens (down to 49)\nin the latent space with sparse feature sampling procedure instead of\nprocessing dense units in the original pixel space. Therefore, SparseFormer\ncircumvents most of dense operations on the image space and has much lower\ncomputational costs.

In order to model the interaction between equal mass\ncircular binaries and their locally isothermal circumbinary discs, we enforce\nhyper-Lagrangian resolution inside the cavity. We find that fixing the binary\norbit ultimately leads to an overestimate of the gravitational torque that the\ngas exerts on the binary, and in an underestimate of the torque due to the\naccretion of material onto the binary components. Furthermore, we find that the\nmodulation of the accretion rate on the binary orbital period is strongly\nsuppressed in the fixed orbit simulation, while it is clearly present in the\nlive binary simulations.

We find that the CGM is both multiphase and highly dynamic.\nInvestigating the dynamics, we identify seven patterns of evolution.

In\nour cosmological simulations, the perturbations are mainly seeded by orbiting\nsubstructures. We find that condensations can form even when the median\n$t_\\mathrm{cool} / t_\\mathrm{ff}$ of the X-ray emitting gas is above the\ncanonical threshold of 10 or 20. Strong amplitude perturbations can provoke\nrunaway cooling regardless of the state of the background gas.

The \"ABC-GAN\" framework introduced is a novel generative\nmodeling paradigm, which combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and\nApproximate Bayesian Computation (ABC).

When it comes to models directly trained on human\nfaces, a sensitive confounder is that of human identities. Many face-related\ntasks should ideally be identity-independent, and perform uniformly across\ndifferent individuals (i.e. be fair). One way to measure and enforce such\nrobustness and performance uniformity is through enforcing it during training,\nassuming identity-related information is available at scale. However, due to\nprivacy concerns and also the cost of collecting such information, this is\noften not the case, and most face datasets simply contain input images and\ntheir corresponding task-related labels. Thus, improving identity-related\nrobustness without the need for such annotations is of great importance. Here,\nwe explore using face-recognition embedding vectors, as proxies for identities,\nto enforce such robustness. We propose to use the structure in the\nface-recognition embedding space, to implicitly emphasize rare samples within\neach class. We do so by weighting samples according to their conditional\ninverse density (CID) in the proxy embedding space. Our experiments suggest\nthat such a simple sample weighting scheme, not only improves the training\nrobustness, it often improves the overall performance as a result of such\nrobustness.

We used a spherically symmetric 1D\nhydrodynamic model coupled with a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium model.\nComparing synthetic absorption spectra with observations, we constrained the\nmain parameters of the upper atmosphere of these planets and classify them\naccording to their hydrodynamic regime. Our results show that HAT-P-32 b\nphoto-evaporates at (130$\\pm$70)$\\times$10$^{11}$ gs$^{-1}$ with a hot (12\n400$\\pm$2900 K) upper atmosphere; WASP-69 b loses its atmosphere at\n(0.9$\\pm$0.5)$\\times$10$^{11}$ gs$^{-1}$ and 5250$\\pm$750 K; and GJ 1214 b,\nwith a relatively cold outflow of 3750$\\pm$750 K, photo-evaporates at\n(1.3$\\pm$1.1)$\\times$10$^{11}$ gs$^{-1}$. For WASP-76 b, its weak absorption\nprevents us from constraining its temperature and mass-loss rate significantly;\nwe obtained ranges of 6000-17 000\\,K and 23.5$\\pm$21.5$\\times$10$^{11}$\ngs$^{-1}$. Our reanalysis of GJ 3470 b yields colder temperatures, 3400$\\pm$350\nK, but practically the same mass-loss rate as in our previous results. Our\nreanalysis of HD 189733 b yields a slightly higher mass-loss rate,\n(1.4$\\pm$0.5)$\\times$10$^{11}$ gs$^{-1}$, and temperature, 12 700$\\pm$900 K\ncompared to previous estimates. Our results support that photo-evaporated\noutflows tend to be very light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 20:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

This is\ndone by distributing the model to clients to perform training on their local\ndata and computing the final model at a central server. To prevent any data\nleakage from the local model updates, various works with focus on secure\naggregation for privacy preserving federated learning have been proposed.\nDespite their merits, most of the existing protocols still incur high\ncommunication and computation overhead on the participating entities and might\nnot be optimized to efficiently handle the large update vectors for ML models.\nIn this paper, we present E-seaML, a novel secure aggregation protocol with\nhigh communication and computation efficiency. E-seaML only requires one round\nof communication in the aggregation phase and it is up to 318x and 1224x faster\nfor the user and the server (respectively) as compared to its most efficient\ncounterpart. E-seaML also allows for efficiently verifying the integrity of the\nfinal model by allowing the aggregation server to generate a proof of honest\naggregation for the participating users. This high efficiency and versatility\nis achieved by extending (and weakening) the assumption of the existing works\non the set of honest parties (i.e., users) to a set of assisting nodes.\nTherefore, we assume a set of assisting nodes which assist the aggregation\nserver in the aggregation process. We also discuss, given the minimal\ncomputation and communication overhead on the assisting nodes, how one could\nassume a set of rotating users to as assisting nodes in each iteration. We\nprovide the open-sourced implementation of E-seaML for public verifiability and\ntesting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 20:44:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 20:48:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 17:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

By working through\na series of purely mental steps, we can make inferences we would not be capable\nof making directly -- despite the fact that we get no additional data from the\nworld. Similarly, when large language models generate a series of intermediate\nsteps (a chain of thought) before answering a question, they often produce\nbetter answers than they otherwise would. We investigate why and how\nchain-of-thought reasoning is useful in language models, testing the hypothesis\nthat reasoning is effective when training data consists of local clusters of\nvariables that influence each other strongly. These training conditions enable\nthe chaining of accurate local inferences in order to estimate relationships\nbetween variables that were not seen together in training. We prove that there\nwill exist a \"reasoning gap\", where reasoning through intermediate variables\nimproves inference, for the simple case of an autoregressive density estimator\ntrained on local samples from a chain-structured probabilistic model. We then\ntest our hypothesis empirically in more complex models, training an\nautoregressive language model on samples from Bayes nets but only including a\nsubset of variables in each sample. We test language models' ability to match\nconditional probabilities with and without intermediate reasoning steps,\nfinding that intermediate steps are only helpful when the training data is\nlocally structured with respect to dependencies between variables and that the\ncombination of locally-structured observations and reasoning is much more\ndata-efficient than training on all variables.

These states are needed for calculating parton distribution functions\nand other types of distribution amplitudes that are used to understand the\nstructure of hadrons. Light-front boosts are kinematic transformations so the\nstrongly interacting states can be computed in any frame. This is useful for\ncomputing current matrix elements involving electroweak probes where the\ninitial and final hadronic states are in different frames related by the\nmomentum transferred by the probe.

At nanometer scales, thermal\nfluctuations are comparable to surface energy densities. Consequently, at these\nscales, thermal fluctuations play a significant role in the dynamics of the\ninstability. These microscopic effects have previously been investigated\nnumerically using particle-based simulations, such as molecular dynamics, and\nstochastic partial differential equation based hydrodynamic models, such as\nstochastic lubrication theory. In this paper we present an incompressible\nfluctuating hydrodynamics model with a diffuse-interface formulation for binary\nfluid mixtures designed for the study of stochastic interfacial phenomena. An\nefficient numerical algorithm is outlined and validated in numerical\nsimulations of stable equilibrium interfaces. We present results from\nsimulations of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability for long cylinders pinching\ninto droplets for Ohnesorge numbers of Oh = 0.5 and 5.0. Both stochastic and\nperturbed deterministic simulations are analyzed and ensemble results show\nsignificant differences in the temporal evolution of the minimum radius near\npinching. Short cylinders, with lengths less than their circumference, were\nalso investigated. As previously observed in molecular dynamics simulations, we\nfind that thermal fluctuations cause these to pinch in cases where a perturbed\ncylinder would be stable deterministically. Finally we show that the\nfluctuating hydrodynamics model can be applied to study a broader range of\nsurface-tension driven phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 22:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

The\nsystem's time evolution is described by the direct product of two independent\nHilbert spaces: one that is defined by an effective Hamiltonian, which\nrepresents a damped simple harmonic oscillator with its potential well divided\ninto two, based on the spin and the other that represents the effect of the\nbath, i.e., the Brownian motion.

For KMT-2021-BLG-1968, on the other hand, we\nfind that the anomaly can be explained either by a planetary or a binary-source\ninterpretation, making it difficult to firmly identify the nature of the\nanomaly.

Another requirement is to support increasing connected\nusers in (over)crowded machine-type communication (mMTC). In such scenarios,\npilot assignment (PA) becomes paramount to reduce pilot contamination and\nconsequently improve spectral efficiency (SE). We propose a novel quasi-optimal\nlow-complexity iterative pilot assignment strategy for XL-MIMO systems based on\na genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed GA-based PA procedure turns the quality\nof service more uniform, taking into account the normalized mean-square error\n(NMSE) of channel estimation from each candidate of the population. The\nsimulations reveal that the proposed iterative procedure minimizes the channel\nestimation NMSE averaged over the UEs. The second procedure is the subarray\n(SA) selection. In XL-MIMO systems, commonly, a UE is close to a SA antenna\nsubset such that a sufficient data rate can be achieved if only a specific SA\nserves that UE. Thus, a SA selection procedure is investigated to make the\nsystem scalable by defining the maximum number of UEs each SA can help. Hence,\nthe SA clusters are formatted based on the PA decision. Furthermore, we\nintroduce an appropriate channel model for XL-MIMO, which considers a\ndeterministic LoS component with a distance-dependent probability of existence\ncombined with a stochastic spatially correlated Rayleigh NLoS fading component.\nThe developed simulations and analyses rely on this suitable channel model\nunder realistic assumptions of pilot contamination and correlated channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 00:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

To address this issue, prior research simply applies the\noff-the-shelf fix-rate lossy compressors in the MPI collectives, leading to\nsuboptimal performance, limited generalizability, and unbounded errors.

However,\nrelation modeling in traditional Knowledge tracing models only considers the\nstatic question-knowledge relationship and knowledge-knowledge relationship and\ntreats these relationships with equal importance. This kind of relation\nmodeling is difficult to avoid the influence of subjective labeling and\nconsiders the relationship between exercises and KCs, or KCs and KCs\nseparately. In this work, a novel knowledge tracing model, named Knowledge\nRelation Rank Enhanced Heterogeneous Learning Interaction Modeling for Neural\nGraph Forgetting Knowledge Tracing(NGFKT), is proposed to reduce the impact of\nthe subjective labeling by calibrating the skill relation matrix and the\nQ-matrix and apply the Graph Convolutional Network(GCN) to model the\nheterogeneous interactions between students, exercises, and skills.\nSpecifically, the skill relation matrix and Q-matrix are generated by the\nKnowledge Relation Importance Rank Calibration method(KRIRC). Then the\ncalibrated skill relation matrix, Q-matrix, and the heterogeneous interactions\nare treated as the input of the GCN to generate the exercise embedding and\nskill embedding. Next, the exercise embedding, skill embedding, item\ndifficulty, and contingency table are incorporated to generate an exercise\nrelation matrix as the inputs of the Position-Relation-Forgetting attention\nmechanism. Finally, the Position-Relation-Forgetting attention mechanism is\napplied to make the predictions.

Recently, sparsely-gated\nMixture-of-Experts (MoEs) are becoming more popular and have demonstrated\nimpressive pretraining scalability in various downstream tasks.

Currently, most POI recommenders\nare based on the conventional centralized paradigm that heavily relies on the\ncloud to train the recommendation models with large volumes of collected users'\nsensitive check-in data. Although a few recent works have explored on-device\nframeworks for resilient and privacy-preserving POI recommendations, they\ninvariably hold the assumption of model homogeneity for parameters/gradients\naggregation and collaboration.

In light\nof this, We propose a novel on-device POI recommendation framework, namely\nModel-Agnostic Collaborative learning for on-device POI recommendation (MAC),\nallowing users to customize their own model structures (e.g., dimension \\&\nnumber of hidden layers). To counteract the sparsity of on-device user data, we\npropose to pre-select neighbors for collaboration based on physical distances,\ncategory-level preferences, and social networks. To assimilate knowledge from\nthe above-selected neighbors in an efficient and secure way, we adopt the\nknowledge distillation framework with mutual information maximization. Instead\nof sharing sensitive models/gradients, clients in MAC only share their soft\ndecisions on a preloaded reference dataset. To filter out low-quality\nneighbors, we propose two sampling strategies, performance-triggered sampling\nand similarity-based sampling, to speed up the training process and obtain\noptimal recommenders. In addition, we design two novel approaches to generate\nmore effective reference datasets while protecting users' privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 07:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

To address this issue, we combined\nmolecular dynamics simulation with thermodynamic and diffusion theories. Our\nstudy systematically examined the equilibrium distribution of hydrogen-methane\nmixtures in gravity fields. We demonstrated that partial pressures of both\ngases decrease with altitude, with hydrogen showing slower decrease due to its\nsmaller molar mass. As a result, the volume fraction of hydrogen is maximized\nat the top end of pipes. The stratification is more favorable at low\ntemperature and large altitude drops, with notable gas stratification only\noccurring at extremely large drops in altitude, being generally negligible even\nat a drop of 1500 m. Furthermore, we showed that the diffusion time required to\nachieve the equilibrium distribution is proportional to gas pressure and the\nsquare of pipeline height. This requires approximately 300 years for a 1500 m\npipeline at 1 bar. Therefore, temporary interruptions in pipeline gas\ntransportation will not cause visible stratification.

The\nconstraints only depend on the number of quadruples obtained by reshuffling the\ndata in the four data sets without changing the values of the correlations.\nThese new inequalities reduce to model-free versions of the well-known\nBell-type inequalities if the maximum fraction of quadruples is equal to one.\nBeing model-free, a violation of the latter by experimental data implies that\nnot all the data in the four data sets can be reshuffled to form quadruples.\nFurthermore, being model-free inequalities, a violation of the latter by\nexperimental data only implies that any mathematical model assumed to produce\nthis data does not apply.

In this paper, we initiate\nthe study of this problem bounding the rank of the trees given at the input\n(defined by Ehrenfeucht and Haussler (1989) in the context of decision trees).\nWe define the rank-bounded rotation distance between two given binary trees\n$T_1$ and $T_2$ (with $n$ internal nodes) of rank at most $r$, denoted by\n$d_r(T_1,T_2)$, as the length of the shortest sequence of rotations that\ntransforms $T_1$ to $T_2$ with the restriction that the intermediate trees must\nbe of rank at most $r$. We show that the rotation distance problem reduces in\npolynomial time to the rank bounded rotation distance problem. This motivates\nthe study of the problem in the combinatorial and algorithmic frontiers.\nObserving that trees with rank $1$ coincide exactly with skew trees (binary\ntrees where every internal node has at least one leaf as a child), we show the\nfollowing results in this frontier :\n  We present an $O(n^2)$ time algorithm for computing $d_1(T_1,T_2)$.

Due to its high computation complexity, single-source SimRank\ncomputation for large graphs is notoriously challenging, and hence recent\nstudies resort to distributed processing. To our surprise, although SimRank has\nbeen widely adopted for two decades, theoretical aspects of distributed\nSimRanks with provable results have rarely been studied.\n  In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study on single-source SimRank\ncomputation in the Massive Parallel Computation (MPC) model, which is the\nstandard theoretical framework modeling distributed systems such as MapReduce,\nHadoop, or Spark.

Particularly, given a graph\nof $n$ nodes, for any query node $v$ and constant error $\\epsilon>\\frac{3}{n}$,\nwe show that using $O(\\log^2 \\log n)$ rounds of communication among machines is\nalmost enough to compute single-source SimRank values with at most $\\epsilon$\nabsolute errors, while each machine only needs a space sub-linear to $n$. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first single-source SimRank algorithm in\nMPC that can overcome the $\\Theta(\\log n)$ round complexity barrier with\nprovable result accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 14:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

To achieve these positive and\nnegative pairs, existing weak/strong data augmentation methods have to randomly\nchange the appearance of skeletons for indirectly pursuing semantic\nperturbations. However, such approaches have two limitations: 1) solely\nperturbing appearance cannot well capture the intrinsic semantic information of\nskeletons, and 2) randomly perturbation may change the original\npositive/negative pairs to soft positive/negative ones. To address the above\ndilemma, we start the first attempt to explore an attack-based augmentation\nscheme that additionally brings in direct semantic perturbation, for\nconstructing hard positive pairs and further assisting in constructing hard\nnegative pairs. In particular, we propose a novel Attack-Augmentation\nMixing-Contrastive learning (A$^2$MC) to contrast hard positive features and\nhard negative features for learning more robust skeleton representations. In\nA$^2$MC, Attack-Augmentation (Att-Aug) is designed to collaboratively perform\ntargeted and untargeted perturbations of skeletons via attack and augmentation\nrespectively, for generating high-quality hard positive features. Meanwhile,\nPositive-Negative Mixer (PNM) is presented to mix hard positive features and\nnegative features for generating hard negative features, which are adopted for\nupdating the mixed memory banks.

The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the\nexpected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a\nprophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the\ngambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.\n  The model, in which the gambler selects the arrival order first, and then\nobserves the values, is known as Order Selection. Recently it has been shown\nthat in this model a ratio of $0.7251$ can be attained for any instance.

Our results show that, for all explored Rayleigh number, solute\ntransport first enhances unexpectedly with decreasing porosity, and then\ndecreases when porosity is smaller than a Rayleigh number-dependent value. On\nthe other hand, while the flow strength decreases significantly as porosity\ndecreases at low Rayleigh number, it varies weakly with decreasing porosity at\nhigh Rayleigh number and even increases counterintuitively for some porosities\nat moderate Rayleigh number. Detailed analysis of the salinity and velocity\nfields reveals that the fingered structures are blocked by the porous structure\nand can even be destroyed when their widths are larger than the pore scale, but\nbecome more ordered and coherent with the presence of porous media. This\ncombination of opposing effects explains the complex porosity-dependencies of\nsolute transport and flow strength.

This paper aims to address this gap by conducting a\ndetailed comparison between the encoder-decoder architecture and the\ndecoder-only language model framework through the analysis of a regularized\nencoder-decoder structure. This structure is designed to replicate all\nbehaviors in the classical decoder-only language model but has an encoder and a\ndecoder making it easier to be compared with the classical encoder-decoder\nstructure. Based on the analysis, we unveil the attention degeneration problem\nin the language model, namely, as the generation step number grows, less and\nless attention is focused on the source sequence. To give a quantitative\nunderstanding of this problem, we conduct a theoretical sensitivity analysis of\nthe attention output with respect to the source input. Grounded on our\nanalysis, we propose a novel partial attention language model to solve the\nattention degeneration problem. Experimental results on machine translation,\nsummarization, and data-to-text generation tasks support our analysis and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 15:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}

The fluid flow is propelled by\nperistaltic deformation of the microchannels which is induced due to locally\ncontrollable piezoelectric segments actuated by propagating voltage waves. The\nhomogenization method is employed to derive the limit macroscopic model of a\nporoelastic medium with the effective parameters modified due the piezoelectric\nproperties of the skeleton. To capture the peristaltic pumping effect, the\nnonlinearity associated with the deforming configuration must be respected. In\nthe homogenized linear model, this nonlinearity is introduced by\ndeformation-dependent homogenized coefficients of the macroscopic equations.\nFor this, a linear expansions based on the sensitivity analysis of the\nhomogenized coefficients with respect to the deformation induced by the\nmacroscopic quantities is employed. This enables to avoid the two-scale tight\ncoupling of the macro- and microproblems otherwise needed when nonlinear\nproblems are considered. The derived model is implemented and verified using\ndirect numerical simulations of the periodic heterogeneous medium. Numerical\nresults demonstrate the peristaltic driven fluid propulsion in response to the\nelectric actuation and the efficiency of the proposed treatment of the\nnonlinearity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 15:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

It's supposed to be personalized\nfrom the perspective of both users and shows. Furthermore, the pursue of both\ninstant (click) and long-time (view time) rewards, and the cold-start problem\nfor new shows bring additional challenges. Such a problem is suitable for\nprocessing by heterogeneous graph models, because of the natural graph\nstructure of data. But real-world networks usually have billions of nodes and\nvarious types of edges. Few existing methods focus on handling large-scale data\nand exploiting different types of edges, especially the latter. In this paper,\nwe propose a two-stage audience expansion scheme based on an edge-prompted\nheterogeneous graph network which can take different double-sided interactions\nand features into account. In the offline stage, to construct the graph, user\nIDs and specific side information combinations of the shows are chosen to be\nthe nodes, and click/co-click relations and view time are used to build the\nedges. Embeddings and clustered user groups are then calculated. When new shows\narrive, their embeddings and subsequent matching users can be produced within a\nconsistent space. In the online stage, posterior data including click/view\nusers are employed as seeds to look for similar users. The results on the\npublic datasets and our billion-scale data demonstrate the accuracy and\nefficiency of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 15:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-13"}

In this work, we take a historical perspective on pathos and\nweigh the pros and cons of applying this rhetorical concept to the field of\ndata visualizations. To better understand data, connecting it to the human way\nof thinking is imperative - appealing to emotions is one building block. The\ntheoretical and empirical basis originates from different scientific fields,\nlike social sciences, economics, and humanities. Tangible techniques to target\nempathetic emotions in data visualizations are introduced, as well as other\nrhetorical devices, such as interactivity and contextual framing, are\nhighlighted. Researching these different approaches can provide new insights\nregarding the creation and influence of empathetic emotions in data\nvisualizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2023 05:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

Though many\nassociative memory models were easy to handle and still quite effective to\nexplain the basic memory retrieval processes in the brain, they were not\nsatisfactory under the biological point of view. It became clear to scientists\nthat a biologically realistic neural network should have respected typical\nfeatures that were observed in experiments of neurophysiology. This aspect has\nled to the introduction of Balanced Networks, systems where excitatory and\ninhibitory neurons balance their effect on each other as an emergent property\nof the network dynamics. One of such models is the exhibition of a mean level\nof neuronal activity (i.e. the average spiking rate of neurons) that is\nunivocally defined by a linear equation in the external input. This aspect\nmight help to reproduce what is measured in particular areas devoted to memory\nstorage, i.e. a persistent activity during the memory retrieval performance.\nEven though progresses in the matter of balanced networks where achieved in the\nlast two decades, there is still no complete theory that conciliates memory\nretrieval and balance in a network of neurons. The aim of this work is to\ndevelop a biologically plausible model that presents both balance and memory\nretrieval, building on a framework of mean field equations that can predict the\ntheoretical behaviour of the network under the choice of a set of control\nparameters. We will thus measure the critical capacity of the system as a\nfunction of these parameters, comparing the theoretical results with the\nnumerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2023 20:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}
