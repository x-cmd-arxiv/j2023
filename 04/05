This has\nmotivated the design of parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods which\nfine-tune only a fraction of the Transformer's parameters.

In this work, we explore vector similarity search in\nthe context of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Motivated by the tasks of finding\nrelated KG queries and entities for past KG query workloads, we focus on hybrid\nvector similarity search (hybrid queries for short) where part of the query\ncorresponds to vector similarity search and part of the query corresponds to\npredicates over relational attributes associated with the underlying data\nvectors. For example, given past KG queries for a song entity, we want to\nconstruct new queries for new song entities whose vector representations are\nclose to the vector representation of the entity in the past KG query. But\nentities in a KG also have non-vector attributes such as a song associated with\nan artist, a genre, and a release date. Therefore, suggested entities must also\nsatisfy query predicates over non-vector attributes beyond a vector-based\nsimilarity predicate. While these tasks are central to KGs, our contributions\nare generally applicable to hybrid queries. In contrast to prior works that\noptimize online queries, we focus on enabling efficient batch processing of\npast hybrid query workloads.

We investigate the intercalation of\nphosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) molecules directly from the vapor phase and confirm\nthe formation of confined P2O5 at the graphene heterointerface using various\ntechniques. Density functional theory (DFT) corroborate the experimental\nresults and reveal the intercalation mechanism, whereby P2O5 dissociates into\nsmall fragments catalyzed by defects in the graphene that then permeates\nthrough lattice defects and reacts at the heterointerface to form P2O5. This\nprocess can also be used to form new confined metal phosphates (e.g., 2D\nInPO4). While the focus of this study is on P2O5 intercalation, the possibility\nof intercalation from pre-dissociated molecules catalyzed by defects in\ngraphene may exist for other types of molecules as well.

Certain methods seek to address this problem by\nsolely relying on the surface text of class names to serve as extremely weak\nsupervision. However, existing methods fail to account for single-class\ndocuments discussing multiple topics. Both topic diversity and vague sentences\nmay introduce noise into the document's underlying representation and\nconsequently the precision of the predicted class. Furthermore, current work\nfocuses on text granularities (documents, sentences, or words) independently,\nwhich limits the degree of coarse- or fine-grained context that we can jointly\nextract from all three to identify significant subtext for classification. In\norder to address this problem, we propose MEGClass, an extremely\nweakly-supervised text classification method to exploit Mutually-Enhancing Text\nGranularities. Specifically, MEGClass constructs class-oriented sentence and\nclass representations based on keywords for performing a sentence-level\nconfidence-weighted label ensemble in order to estimate a document's initial\nclass distribution. This serves as the target distribution for a multi-head\nattention network with a class-weighted contrastive loss. This network learns\ncontextualized sentence representations and weights to form document\nrepresentations that reflect its original document and sentence-level topic\ndiversity. Retaining this heterogeneity allows MEGClass to select the most\nclass-indicative documents to serve as iterative feedback for enhancing the\nclass representations.

To this end, we devise a new scheme\napproximating thermal effects to supplement any cold, barotropic hybrid\nequation of state (EoS) model, i.e. two-phase EoS constructions with a hadronic\nregime and a phase of deconfined quark matter. The consideration of\ntemperature-dependent phase boundaries turns out to be critical for a\nquantitative description of quark matter effects in NS mergers, since the\ncoexistence phase can introduce a strong softening of the EoS at finite\ntemperature, which is even more significant than the change of the EoS by the\nphase transition at T=0. We validate our approach by comparing to existing\nfully temperature-dependent EoS models and find a very good quantitative\nagreement of postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) features. Simulations with the\ncommonly-used thermal ideal-gas approach exhibit sizable differences compared\nto full hybrid models implying that its use in NS merger simulations with quark\nmatter is problematic. Our new scheme provides the means to isolate thermal\neffects of quark matter from the properties of the cold hybrid EoS and thus\nallows an assessment of the thermal behavior alone. We show that different\nshapes of the phase boundaries at finite temperature can have a large impact on\nthe postmerger dynamics and GW signal for the same cold hybrid model. This\nfinding demonstrates that postmerger GW emission contains important\ncomplementary information compared to properties extracted from cold stars.

We identify several key candidate\ntechniques to further improve ERM performance, such as better utilization of\ntraining data, model parameter selection, and weight-space regularization. We\ncall the resulting method ERM++, and show it significantly improves the\nperformance of DG on five multi-source datasets by over 5% compared to standard\nERM, and beats state-of-the-art despite being less computationally expensive.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of ERM++ on the WILDS-FMOW dataset, a\nchallenging DG benchmark. We hope that ERM++ becomes a strong baseline for\nfuture DG research.

As history-taking is extremely varied, machine learning models\nrequire a significant amount of data to train. To overcome this challenge,\nexisting systems are developed using indirect data or expert knowledge. This\nleads to a training-inference gap as models are trained on different kinds of\ndata than what they observe at inference time. In this work, we present a\ntwo-stage re-ranking approach that helps close the training-inference gap by\nre-ranking the first-stage question candidates using a dialogue-contextualized\nmodel. For this, we propose a new model, global re-ranker, which cross-encodes\nthe dialogue with all questions simultaneously, and compare it with several\nexisting neural baselines. We test both transformer and S4-based language model\nbackbones. We find that relative to the expert system, the best performance is\nachieved by our proposed global re-ranker with a transformer backbone,\nresulting in a 30% higher normalized discount cumulative gain (nDCG) and a 77%\nhigher mean average precision (mAP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 17:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

The\nliterature lacks mathematical models for key parameter estimates of TB\ntransmission dynamics in Burundi. In this paper, the\nsupectible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model is used to investigate the\ntransmission dynamics of tuberculosis in Burundi. Using the next generation\nmethod, we calculated the basic reproduction number, R0. The model is\ndemonstrated to have a disease-free equilibrium (DEF) that is locally and\nglobally asymptotically stable. When the corresponding reproduction threshold\nquantity approaches unity, the model enters an endemic equilibrium (EE). That\nmeans, the disease can be controlled through different interventions in\nBurundi. A sensitivity analysis of the model parameters was also investigated.\nIt shows that the progression rate from latent to becoming infectious had the\nhighest positive sensitivity, which means that R0 increases and decreases\nproportionally with an increase and a decrease of that progression rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 17:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

We\nconsider the scenario with multi-stage tasks, such as 'pick and place', whose\narrival times are not known a priori. In such a scenario, a coordinating\narchitecture is expected to be reactive to newly arrived tasks and the\nresulting rerouting of agents should be dependent on the stage of completion of\ntheir current multi-stage tasks. In the novel architecture proposed in this\narticle, a central auctioning system gathers bids (cost-estimates for\ncompleting currently available tasks) from all agents, and solves a\ncombinatorial problem to optimally assign tasks to agents. For every agent,\nit's participation in the auctioning system and execution of an assigned\nmulti-stage task is managed using behavior trees, which switch among several\nwell-defined behaviors in response to changing scenarios. The auctioning system\nis run at a fixed rate, allowing for newly added tasks to be incorporated into\nthe auctioning system, which makes the solution reactive and allows for the\nrerouting of some agents (subject to the states of the behavior trees). We\ndemonstrate that the proposed architecture is especially well-suited for\nmulti-stage tasks, where high costs are incurred when rerouting agents who have\ncompleted one or more stages of their current tasks. The scalability analysis\nof the proposed architecture reveals that it scales well with the number of\nagents and number of tasks. The proposed framework is experimentally validated\nin multiple scenarios in a lab environment.

More precisely, we define two subsystems: a reduced order\nsystem, representing the dynamics of the full system in the limit $\\varepsilon\n= 0$, and a boundary-layer system, which represents the dynamics of the PDE in\nthe fast time scale. Our main result shows that, if both the reduced order and\nthe boundary-layer systems are exponentially stable, then the full system is\nalso exponentially stable for $\\varepsilon$ small enough, and our strategy is\nbased on a spectral analysis of the systems under consideration.

Using four\nexisting samples of spectroscopically measured dust extinction curves, we\nconsistently measure the R(V) dependent extinction relationship\nspectroscopically from the far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared for the first time.\nLinear fits of A(lambda)/A(V) dependent on R(V) are done using a method that\nfully accounts for their significant and correlated uncertainties.

We evaluate the method on localization and\nclassification tasks using one of the established state-of-the-art\narchitectures showing performance on par with the benchmark. In contrast to\nprevious approaches, our method accelerates the data generation process by a\nfactor of 750 while using 33 times less memory and scales well to typical\ntransmission electron microscope detector sizes. It utilizes GPU acceleration\nand parallel processing. It can be used as a stand-alone method to adapt a\ntraining data set or as a data augmentation technique.

Generating valid input programs for\nfuzzing DL libraries is challenging due to the need for satisfying both\nlanguage syntax/semantics and constraints for constructing valid computational\ngraphs. Recently, the TitanFuzz work demonstrates that modern Large Language\nModels (LLMs) can be directly leveraged to implicitly learn all the constraints\nto generate valid DL programs for fuzzing. However, LLMs tend to generate\nordinary programs following similar patterns seen in their massive training\ncorpora, while fuzzing favors unusual inputs that cover edge cases or are\nunlikely to be manually produced.\n  To fill this gap, this paper proposes FuzzGPT, the first technique to prime\nLLMs to synthesize unusual programs for fuzzing. FuzzGPT is built on the\nwell-known hypothesis that historical bug-triggering programs may include\nrare/valuable code ingredients important for bug finding. Traditional\ntechniques leveraging such historical information require intensive human\nefforts to design dedicated generators and ensure the validity of generated\nprograms. FuzzGPT demonstrates that this process can be fully automated via the\nintrinsic capabilities of LLMs (including fine-tuning and in-context learning),\nwhile being generalizable and applicable to challenging domains. While FuzzGPT\ncan be applied with different LLMs, this paper focuses on the powerful\nGPT-style models: Codex and CodeGen. Moreover, FuzzGPT also shows the potential\nof directly leveraging the instruct-following capability of the recent ChatGPT\nfor effective fuzzing.

By obtaining ~2 hr deep NIRCam/grism observations\nwith the F444W filter, FRESCO yields unprecedented spectra at R~1600 covering\n3.8 to 5.0 $\\mu$m for most galaxies in the NIRCam field-of-view.

We study the super-extended HI disk of M83 (${\\sim}$50 kpc in radius), in\nparticular disc kinematics, rotation and the turbulent nature of the atomic\ninterstellar medium. We define distinct regions in the outer disk ($r_{\\rm\ngal}>$central optical disk), including ring, southern area, and southern and\nnorthern arm. We examine HI gas surface density, velocity dispersion and\nnon-circular motions in the outskirts, which we compare to the inner optical\ndisk. We find an increase of velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_v$) towards the\npronounced HI ring, indicative of more turbulent HI gas. Additionally, we\nreport over a large galactocentric radius range (until $r_{\\rm gal}{\\sim}$50\nkpc) that $\\sigma_v$ is slightly larger than thermal (i.e. $>8$km s$^{-1}$ ).\nWe find that a higher star formation rate (as traced by FUV emission) is not\nalways necessarily associated with a higher HI velocity dispersion, suggesting\nthat radial transport could be a dominant driver for the enhanced velocity\ndispersion. We further find a possible branch that connects the extended HI\ndisk to the dwarf irregular galaxy UGCA365, that deviates from the general\ndirection of the northern arm. Lastly, we compare mass flow rate profiles\n(based on 2D and 3D tilted ring models) and find evidence for outflowing gas at\nr$_{\\rm gal}$ $\\sim$2 kpc, inflowing gas at r$_{\\rm gal}$ $\\sim$5.5 kpc and\noutflowing gas at r$_{\\rm gal}$ $\\sim$14 kpc. We caution that mass flow rates\nare highly sensitive to the assumed kinematic disk parameters, in particular,\nto the inclination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

In\nthe past decade, this pebble accretion has been studied extensively for\naerodynamically small pebbles (Stokes number St < 1). However, accretion can\nalso operate in the St > 1 mode, e.g., when planetesimals collisionally\nfragment to smaller bodies or when the primordial gas disc disperses. This work\naims to extend the study of pebble accretion to these aerodynamically loosely\ncoupled particles. We integrate the pebble's equation of motion, accounting for\ngas drag, stellar and planetary gravity, in the midplane of a laminar disc. The\naccretion probability ($\\epsilon$) is calculated as function of Stokes number,\ndisc pressure gradient index, planet mass and eccentricity. We find that for\nStokes number above unity $\\epsilon$(St) first rises, due to lower drift and\naided by a large atmospheric capture radius, until it reaches a plateau where\nthe efficiency approaches 100 per cent. At high St the plateau region\nterminates as particles become trapped in resonance. These results are well\ndescribed by a semi-analytical \"kick-and-drift\" model and we also provide fully\nanalytical prescriptions for $\\epsilon$.

Observations, however, show that the presence of outer CJs ( >1 au\nand >0.3 Jupiter masses) correlates with the presence of inner Super Earths (at\n<1 au). This observation may simply be a result of an enhanced initial\nreservoir of solids in the nebula required to form a CJ or a\nyet-to-be-determined mechanism assisted by the presence of the CJ. In this\nwork, we focus on the latter alternative and study the orbital transport of\nplanetesimals interior to a CJ subject to the gravity and drag from a\nviscously-evolving gaseous disk. We find that a secular resonance sweeping\ninwards through the disk gradually transports rings of planetesimals when their\ndrag-assisted orbital decay is faster than the speed of the resonance scanning.\nThis snowplow-like process leads to large concentration (boosted by a factor of\n~10-100) of size-segregated planetesimal rings with aligned apsidal lines,\nmaking their expected collisions less destructive due to their reduced velocity\ndispersion. This process is efficient for a wide range of alpha-disk models and\nJovian masses, peaking for ~1-5 Jupiter masses, typical of observed CJs in\nradial velocity surveys. Overall, our work highlights the major role that the\ndisk's gravity may have on the orbital redistribution of planetesimals,\ndepicting a novel avenue by which CJs may enhance the formation of inner\nplanetary systems, including super-Earths and perhaps even warm and hot\nJupiters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 18:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Following its initial bright 2012 outburst,\nwe find that the source displayed a series of at least 7 quasi-periodic, high\namplitude (~3 mags) optical reflares in 2013, with a recurrence time increasing\nfrom ~42 days to ~49 days. In 2014, the source experienced a mini-outburst with\ntwo peaks in the optical. We also study the recent 2022 outburst of the source\nat optical wavelengths, and perform a comparative analysis with the earlier\nrebrightenings. A single X-ray detection and only two radio detections were\nobtained during the 2013 reflaring period, and only optical detections were\nacquired in 2014. During the reflaring in both 2013 and 2014, the source showed\nbluer-when-brighter behavior, having optical colors consistent with a blackbody\nheating and cooling between 4500 and 9500 K, i.e. the temperature range in\nwhich hydrogen starts to ionize. Finally, we compare the flaring behavior of\nthe source to re-brightening events in other X-ray binaries. We show that the\nrepeated reflarings of Swift J1910.2-0546 are highly unusual, and propose that\nthey arise from a sequence of repetitive heating and cooling front reflections\ntravelling through the accretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 18:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Due to the complexity of modeling the\ncontact dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques can provide a solution\nin this continuous space subject to highly parameterized physical models.\nHowever, these techniques impose a trade-off in adaptability and data\nefficiency.

A universal algorithm a priori maps each element $u \\in \\mathcal{U}$\nto a set $S(u)$ such that if $U \\subseteq \\mathcal{U}$ is formed by drawing $n$\ntimes from distribution $D$, then the algorithm commits to outputting $S(U)$.\nGrandoni et al. gave an $O(\\log mN)$-competitive universal algorithm for this\nstochastic set cover problem.\n  We improve unilaterally upon this result by giving a simple, polynomial time\n$O(\\log mn)$-competitive universal algorithm for the more general prophet\nversion, in which $U$ is formed by drawing from $n$ different distributions\n$D_1, \\ldots, D_n$. Furthermore, we show that we do not need full foreknowledge\nof the distributions: in fact, a single sample from each distribution suffices.\nWe show similar results for the 2-stage prophet setting and for the\nonline-with-a-sample setting.\n  We obtain our results via a generic reduction from the single-sample prophet\nsetting to the random-order setting; this reduction holds for a broad class of\nminimization problems that includes all covering problems. We take advantage of\nthis framework by giving random-order algorithms for non-metric facility\nlocation and set multicover; using our framework, these automatically translate\nto universal prophet algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 18:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Dynamical heating as gas falls into the deepest part of the\npotential well, and heating and stirring by supernova blastwaves, generate a\nturbulent multi-phase interstellar medium, with a gas velocity dispersion\nexceeding 100 km s$^{-1}$.

In order to get this\nresult, Planck proposed his radiation law in a two-fold way: 1) by an\n\\textit{ad hoc} modification of the assumed connection between energy and\nentropy for thermal radiation; 2) by assuming that the calculation of the\nentropy of an oscillator in thermal equilibrium with radiation is carried out\nby discrete units of energy. As a consequence, the energy quantization, linear\nin frequency, was thus introduced into physics. However, the energy\nquantization of the simple harmonic oscillator was originally postulated by\nPlanck in an incomplete way, i.e., the ground state energy was not assumed to\nbe null. Of course, this issue has been solved in different ways over time.\nDespite of this, we propose an alternative way to fix this issue by describing\nharmonic oscillators at noncommutative(NC) framework, where the non-null ground\nstate energy naturally arises as a NC contribution. With this approach, the\nPlanck's quantum theory is updated and, consequently, becomes compatible with\nthe quantum mechanics inaugurated in 1925.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 18:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

At the beginning of\nthe game, the budgets of the agents and the values of the battlefields are\nspecified. In the first stage, the players are allowed to perform a battlefield\ntransfer in which one player offloads a number of its battlefields onto the\nother player. In the second stage, the adversary observes this transfer and\ndetermines how to allocate their budget accordingly. Finally, in the third\nstage, the players and the adversary allocate their budgets to their\nbattlefields, the game is played, and their payoffs are realized. We provide\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a battlefield transfer\nthat strictly increases the payoff of each player.

To accurately account for the\ninfluence of anisotropy on wavefronts, it is essential to have a solid grasp of\nthe underlying physics.

To address this issue, we utilize paraxial-ray\ntheory in a ray-centered coordinate system to study the wavefront phenomenon.\nThis approach allows us to develop explicit expressions that describe the\nphysics of the problem. Using this theoretical framework, we can accurately\ngeneralize the relationship between time-migration rays and Dix velocity by\nincorporating the velocity-spreading factor for general anisotropic media. This\nfactor lets us determine the type of anisotropy present in the medium.\nMoreover, the velocity-spreading factor provides valuable information for\nvarious applications, including model building, time-imaging, and time-to-depth\nconversion.

The heart of the proof is, following the approach of\nBeceanu [Beceanu, 2011], the derivation of Strichartz dispersive estimates for\nmatrix operators with a deformed Laplacian $\\Delta_b = \\Delta + ib\\left(\\frac\nd2 + x\\cdot\\nabla\\right)$ in homogeneous Sobolev spaces. The deformed Laplacian\n$\\Delta_b$ arises from the renormalization and its operator group\n$e^{it\\Delta_b}$ exhibits an \"enhanced dispersion\" phenomenon, which not only\nrecovers the free Strichartz but also enables an extension of resolvent\nfamilies. Compared with Strichartz estimates based on $\\Delta$, this one has a\nlarger admissible region, works for arbitrarily small polynomial decaying\npotential, and requires no spectral assumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 19:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

One\ncritical aspect affecting the raw on-sky contrast are polarization aberrations\narising from the reflection from the telescope's mirror surfaces and instrument\noptics. We simulate the polarization aberrations and estimate their effect on\nthe achievable contrast for three next-generation ground-based large segmented\nmirror telescopes. We performed ray-tracing in Zemax and computed the\npolarization aberrations and Jones pupil maps using the polarization\nray-tracing algorithm. The impact of these aberrations on the contrast is\nestimated by propagating the Jones pupil maps through a set of idealized\ncoronagraphs using hcipy, a physical optics-based simulation framework. The\noptical modeling of the giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs) shows that\npolarization aberrations create significant leakage through a coronagraphic\nsystem. The dominant aberration is retardance defocus, which originates from\nthe steep angles on the primary and secondary mirrors. The retardance defocus\nlimits the contrast to $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-4}$ at 1 $\\lambda/D$ at visible\nwavelengths, and $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-6}$ at infrared wavelengths. The\nsimulations also show that the coating plays a major role in determining the\nstrength of the aberrations. Polarization aberrations will need to be\nconsidered during the design of high-contrast imaging instruments for the next\ngeneration of extremely large telescopes. This can be achieved either through\ncompensation optics, robust coronagraphs, specialized coatings, calibration,\nand data analysis approaches or by incorporating polarimetry with high-contrast\nimaging to measure these effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 19:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

CAMELS-ASTRID employs the galaxy formation model\nfollowing the ASTRID simulation and contains 2,124 hydrodynamic simulation runs\nthat vary 3 cosmological parameters ($\\Omega_m$, $\\sigma_8$, $\\Omega_b$) and 4\nparameters controlling stellar and AGN feedback. Compared to the existing TNG\nand SIMBA simulation suites in CAMELS, the fiducial model of ASTRID features\nthe mildest AGN feedback and predicts the least baryonic effect on the matter\npower spectrum. The training set of ASTRID covers a broader variation in the\ngalaxy populations and the baryonic impact on the matter power spectrum\ncompared to its TNG and SIMBA counterparts, which can make machine-learning\nmodels trained on the ASTRID suite exhibit better extrapolation performance\nwhen tested on other hydrodynamic simulation sets. We also introduce extension\nsimulation sets in CAMELS that widely explore 28 parameters in the TNG and\nSIMBA models, demonstrating the enormity of the overall galaxy formation model\nparameter space and the complex non-linear interplay between cosmology and\nastrophysical processes. With the new simulation suites, we show that building\nrobust machine-learning models favors training and testing on the largest\npossible diversity of galaxy formation models.

However, interpreters are notoriously difficult to fuzz\neffectively, as they expect highly structured inputs, which are rarely produced\nby most fuzzing mutations. For this class of programs, grammar-based fuzzing\nhas been shown to be effective. Tools based on this approach can find bugs in\nthe code that is executed after parsing the interpreter inputs, by following\nlanguage-specific rules when generating and mutating test cases. Unfortunately,\ngrammar-based fuzzing is often unable to discover subtle bugs associated with\nthe parsing and handling of the language syntax. Additionally, if the grammar\nprovided to the fuzzer is incomplete, or does not match the implementation\ncompletely, the fuzzer will fail to exercise important parts of the available\nfunctionality. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzing technique, called\nToken-Level Fuzzing. Instead of applying mutations either at the byte level or\nat the grammar level, Token-Level Fuzzing applies mutations at the token level.\nEvolutionary fuzzers can leverage this technique to both generate inputs that\nare parsed successfully and generate inputs that do not conform strictly to the\ngrammar. As a result, the proposed approach can find bugs that neither\nbyte-level fuzzing nor grammar-based fuzzing can find. We evaluated Token-Level\nFuzzing by modifying AFL and fuzzing four popular JavaScript engines, finding\n29 previously unknown bugs, several of which could not be found with\nstate-of-the-art byte-level and grammar-based fuzzers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 20:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

While high resolution\nsimulations or reanalysis data are available, they cannot be directly used as\ntraining datasets to machine learn a correction for the coarse-scale climate\nmodel outputs, since chaotic divergence, inherent in the climate dynamics,\nmakes datasets from different resolutions incompatible. To overcome this\nfundamental limitation we employ coarse-resolution model simulations nudged\ntowards high quality climate realizations, here in the form of ERA5 reanalysis\ndata. The nudging term is sufficiently small to not pollute the coarse-scale\ndynamics over short time scales, but also sufficiently large to keep the\ncoarse-scale simulations close to the ERA5 trajectory over larger time scales.\nThe result is a compatible pair of the ERA5 trajectory and the weakly nudged\ncoarse-resolution E3SM output that is used as input training data to machine\nlearn a correction operator.

Motivated by this\nprospect, we have compared the observed properties of luminous red galaxies\n(LRGs) inside and outside of voids in the cosmic large scale structure. We used\narchival measurements of line widths, luminosities, redshifts, colors, and\npositions of galaxies in conjunction with recent void catalogs to construct\ncomparison LRG samples inside and outside of voids.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nFairness Domain Adaptation (FREDOM) approach to semantic scene segmentation. In\nparticular, from the proposed formulated fairness objective, a new adaptation\nframework will be introduced based on the fair treatment of class\ndistributions. Moreover, to generally model the context of structural\ndependency, a new conditional structural constraint is introduced to impose the\nconsistency of predicted segmentation.

To tackle\nthis challenge, organisations tend to be organised into small teams working\nwith components that can be developed separately. Here, organisations must\ndesign their architecture and organisational structures in a way that enables\ncommunication and minimises dependencies, and helps teams reduce code and\narchitectural degradation. Ensuring that each small independent team is\nresponsible for components they primarily contribute is one approach to\nachieving this goal. This study aims at understanding the impact of ownership\nand contribution alignment on accumulation of code technical debt and how\nabrupt changes in team constellation affect teams' effectiveness in managing\nTD. We conducted an embedded case study in a company developing a very large\nsoftware system, analysing ten components belonging to 1 team.

With high degrees of contribution\nalignment, we noticed a negative correlation between contribution alignment and\nTD Density before the team split. In 4 components, this correlation is\nstatistically significant. This means a higher contribution alignment degree\nimplies a lower TD Density. After the split, we observe a negative correlation\nin 3 components. The positive correlation observed in the other 5 components\ncould be attributed to low contribution alignment, leading to difficulties in\nmanaging TD. Our findings suggest that contribution alignment can be important\nin controlling TD in software development organisations. Making teams\nresponsible for the quality of components they have more expertise over and\nminimising dependencies between teams can help organisations mitigate the\ngrowth of TD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 21:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

In this paper, we propose a self-supervised\nlearning framework for music source separation inspired by the HuBERT speech\nrepresentation model. We first investigate the potential impact of the original\nHuBERT model by inserting an adapted version of it into the well-known Demucs\nV2 time-domain separation model architecture.

Pac-HuBERT uses primitive auditory features of music as\nunsupervised clustering labels to initialize the self-supervised pretraining\nprocess using the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset. The resulting framework\nachieves better source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) performance on the MusDB18\ntest set than the original Demucs V2 and Res-U-Net models.

Our HALO\nmethod, designed as a hierarchical autoregressive model, generates a\nprobability density function of medical codes, clinical visits, and patient\nrecords, allowing for the generation of realistic EHR data in its original,\nunaggregated form without the need for variable selection or aggregation.\nAdditionally, our model also produces high-quality continuous variables in a\nlongitudinal and probabilistic manner. We conducted extensive experiments and\ndemonstrate that HALO can generate high-fidelity EHR data with high-dimensional\ndisease code probabilities (d > 10,000), disease co-occurrence probabilities\nwithin visits (d > 1,000,000), and conditional probabilities across consecutive\nvisits (d > 5,000,000) and achieve above 0.9 R2 correlation in comparison to\nreal EHR data. This performance then enables downstream ML models trained on\nits synthetic data to achieve comparable accuracy to models trained on real\ndata (0.938 AUROC with HALO data vs. 0.943 with real data). Finally, using a\ncombination of real and synthetic data enhances the accuracy of ML models\nbeyond that achieved by using only real EHR data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2023 23:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

However, subsequent analyses of such\ncontrol systems are now also interpreted to indicate QGP formation, calling\ninto question proper interpretation of NMFs. An additional complication is the\nnature of the so-called ``Cronin effect'' contribution to NMF structure that is\nnot well understood. In the present study a two-component model of hadron\nproduction (TCM) is applied to identified-hadron (PID) $p_t$ spectra from 5 GeV\n$p$-Pb collisions extending up to 20 GeV/c. Hard components (jet fragment\ndistributions) are accurately isolated and their evolution with collision\ncentrality parametrized. The TCM is then applied to NMFs without rescaling by\n$N_{bin}$, allowing direct comparisons between NMF evolution and hard-component\nevolution with centrality. To address the Cronin effect the TCM is applied to\nfixed-target $p$-A spectra from the Chicago-Princeton (C-P) collaboration, the\norigin of the Cronin effect. Inferred C-P spectrum hard components are\nquantitatively consistent with extrapolation of jet-related structure from\nhigher energies.

The engagement is\nformulated as a discrete-time dynamic game, where the two teams reallocate\ntheir robots in sequence and each robot can move at most one hop at each time\nstep. The game terminates with the attacker's victory if any node has more\nattacker robots than defender robots.

A conceptual model is a way of thinking about and making sense of\nthe real world s complexities.

In the first approach, inconsistencies arise among\nmodels that require a great deal of painstaking discipline and coordination\nbetween them. The multiple-model notion is based on the claim that it is not\npossible to present all application views in a single representation, so\ndiverse models are used, with each model representing a different view. This\narticle advocates a second approach that utilizes a single model with\nmultilevel (static/dynamic and behavioral) specification. To substantiate this\napproach s feasibility, we embrace the occurrence-only model, which comprises\n(a) Stoic ontology, (b) thinging machine (TM) language and (c) Lupascian logic.\nIn this paper, we focus on TM modeling as the mechanism of single-model\nbuilding.

A shortcut set is the analogous concept for reachability. These\nobjects have been studied since the early '90s due to applications in parallel,\ndistributed, dynamic, and streaming graph algorithms.\n  For most of their history, the state-of-the-art construction for either\nobject was a simple folklore algorithm, based on randomly sampling nodes to hit\nlong paths in the graph.

Inspired by the way developers\ninteract with code when debugging, we propose Automated Scientific Debugging\n(AutoSD), a technique that given buggy code and a bug-revealing test, prompts\nlarge language models to automatically generate hypotheses, uses debuggers to\nactively interact with buggy code, and thus automatically reach conclusions\nprior to patch generation. By aligning the reasoning of automated debugging\nmore closely with that of human developers, we aim to produce intelligible\nexplanations of how a specific patch has been generated, with the hope that the\nexplanation will lead to more efficient and accurate developer decisions. Our\nempirical analysis on three program repair benchmarks shows that AutoSD\nperforms competitively with other program repair baselines, and that it can\nindicate when it is confident in its results. Furthermore, we perform a human\nstudy with 20 participants, including six professional developers, to evaluate\nthe utility of explanations from AutoSD.

We present an\nefficient outlier detection technique, termed PIKS (Pruned iterative-k means\nsearchlight), which combines an iterative k-means algorithm with a pruned\nsearchlight based scan. We apply this technique to identify outliers in two\npublicly available healthcare datasets from the New York Statewide Planning and\nResearch Cooperative System, and California's Office of Statewide Health\nPlanning and Development. We provide a comparison of our technique with three\nother existing outlier detection techniques, consisting of auto-encoders,\nisolation forests and feature bagging.

We demonstrate that the\nPIKS technique produces results consistent with other techniques such as the\nauto-encoder. However, the auto-encoder needs to be trained, which requires\nseveral parameters to be tuned. In comparison, the PIKS technique has far fewer\nparameters to tune. This makes it advantageous for fast, \"out-of-the-box\" data\nexploration. The PIKS technique is scalable and can readily ingest new\ndatasets. Hence, it can provide valuable, up-to-date insights to citizens,\npatients and policy-makers.

This inspires us to\nexplore a \"multi-expert joint diagnosis\" mechanism to upgrade the existing\n\"single expert\" framework commonly seen in the current literature. To this end,\nwe propose METransformer, a method to realize this idea with a\ntransformer-based backbone. The key design of our method is the introduction of\nmultiple learnable \"expert\" tokens into both the transformer encoder and\ndecoder. In the encoder, each expert token interacts with both vision tokens\nand other expert tokens to learn to attend different image regions for image\nrepresentation. These expert tokens are encouraged to capture complementary\ninformation by an orthogonal loss that minimizes their overlap. In the decoder,\neach attended expert token guides the cross-attention between input words and\nvisual tokens, thus influencing the generated report. A metrics-based expert\nvoting strategy is further developed to generate the final report. By the\nmulti-experts concept, our model enjoys the merits of an ensemble-based\napproach but through a manner that is computationally more efficient and\nsupports more sophisticated interactions among experts. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the promising performance of our proposed model on two widely used\nbenchmarks.

In this paper, to bridge this gap, we propose the\nAero-engine Blade Anomaly Detection (AeBAD) dataset, consisting of two\nsub-datasets: the single-blade dataset and the video anomaly detection dataset\nof blades. Compared to existing datasets, AeBAD has the following two\ncharacteristics: 1.) The target samples are not aligned and at different\nscales. 2.) There is a domain shift between the distribution of normal samples\nin the test set and the training set, where the domain shifts are mainly caused\nby the changes in illumination and view.

In practical\nsituations, SSAD methods suffer adapting to domain shifts, since anomalous data\nare unlikely to be available for the target domain in the training phase. To\nsolve this problem, we propose a domain adaptation method for SSAD where no\nanomalous data are available for the target domain. First, we introduce a\ndomain-adversarial network to a variational auto-encoder-based SSAD model to\nobtain domain-invariant latent variables. Since the decoder cannot reconstruct\nthe original data solely from domain-invariant latent variables, we conditioned\nthe decoder on the domain label. To compensate for the missing anomalous data\nof the target domain, we introduce an importance sampling-based weighted loss\nfunction that approximates the ideal loss function.

This model, which we call a matrix GLM,\ncovers many widely studied problems in statistical learning, including mixed\nlinear regression, max-affine regression, and mixture-of-experts. In mixed\nlinear regression, each observation comes from one of $L$ signal vectors\n(regressors), but we do not know which one; in max-affine regression, each\nobservation comes from the maximum of $L$ affine functions, each defined via a\ndifferent signal vector. The goal in all these problems is to estimate the\nsignals, and possibly some of the latent variables, from the observations. We\npropose a novel approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimation in a\nmatrix GLM and rigorously characterize its performance in the high-dimensional\nlimit. This characterization is in terms of a state evolution recursion, which\nallows us to precisely compute performance measures such as the asymptotic\nmean-squared error. The state evolution characterization can be used to tailor\nthe AMP algorithm to take advantage of any structural information known about\nthe signals. Using state evolution, we derive an optimal choice of AMP\n`denoising' functions that minimizes the estimation error in each iteration.\n  The theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations for mixed\nlinear regression, max-affine regression, and mixture-of-experts.

We\nformulate a cost minimization problem for an EV charging station to optimize\nthe V2V schedule together with vehicle-to-grid (V2G), grid-to-vehicle (G2V)\ncharging, as well as the use of renewable energy. When EVs perform V2V to\ntransfer energy to charge EVs, the traditional cost-minimizing approach may\noveruse some EVs with lower costs to perform V2V.

However, the variable nature of wind generation can undermine\nsystem reliability and lead to wind curtailment, causing substantial economic\nlosses to wind power producers. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) that\nserve as onsite backup sources are among the solutions to mitigate wind\ncurtailment. However, such an auxiliary role of the BESS might severely weaken\nits economic viability. This paper addresses the issue by proposing joint wind\ncurtailment reduction and energy arbitrage for the BESS. We decouple the market\nparticipation of the co-located wind-battery system and develop a joint-bidding\nframework for the wind farm and BESS. It is challenging to optimize the\njoint-bidding because of the stochasticity of energy prices and wind\ngeneration. Therefore, we leverage deep reinforcement learning to maximize the\noverall revenue from the spot market while unlocking the BESS's potential in\nconcurrently reducing wind curtailment and conducting energy arbitrage. We\nvalidate the proposed strategy using realistic wind farm data and demonstrate\nthat our joint-bidding strategy responds better to wind curtailment and\ngenerates higher revenues than the optimization-based benchmark. Our\nsimulations also reveal that the extra wind generation used to be curtailed can\nbe an effective power source to charge the BESS, resulting in additional\nfinancial returns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 06:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Recently, experiments show that some material with\nlow-symmetric crystalline or magnetic structures can generate anomalous SOT\nthat has an out-of-plane component, which is crucial in switching perpendicular\nmagnetization of adjacent ferromagnetic (FM) layer in the field-free condition.\nIn this work, we analytically derive the threshold current of field-free\nperpendicular magnetization switching using the anomalous SOT. And we\nnumerically calculate the track of the magnetic moment in a FM free layer when\nan applied current is smaller and greater than the threshold current. After\nthat, we study the applied current dependence of the switching time and the\nswitching energy consumption, which shows the minimum energy consumption\ndecreases as out-of-plane torque proportion increases. Then we study the\ndependences of the threshold current on anisotropy strength, out-of-plane\ntorque proportion, FM free layer thickness and Gilbert damping constant, and\nthe threshold current shows negative correlation with the out-of-plane torque\nproportion and positive correlation with the other three parameters.

However, in practice,\ndownstream scenarios may only support a small model due to the limited\ncomputational resources or efficiency considerations. Moreover, the data used\nfor pretraining foundation models are usually invisible and very different from\nthe target data of downstream tasks. This brings a critical challenge for the\nreal-world application of foundation models: one has to transfer the knowledge\nof a foundation model to the downstream task that has a quite different\narchitecture with only downstream target data. Existing transfer learning or\nknowledge distillation methods depend on either the same model structure or\nfinetuning of the foundation model. Thus, naively introducing these methods can\nbe either infeasible or very inefficient. To address this, we propose a\nTask-Driven Model Reprogramming (TDMR) framework. Specifically, we reprogram\nthe foundation model to project the knowledge into a proxy space, which\nalleviates the adverse effect of task mismatch and domain inconsistency. Then,\nwe reprogram the target model via progressive distillation from the proxy space\nto efficiently learn the knowledge from the reprogrammed foundation model. TDMR\nis compatible with different pre-trained model types (CNN, transformer or their\nmix) and limited target data, and promotes the wide applications of vision\nfoundation models to downstream tasks in a cost-effective manner.

This ambiguity motivates the creation of\nmetrics for specific contexts. This work explores the ability of deep\nperceptual similarity (DPS) metrics to adapt to a given context. DPS metrics\nuse the deep features of neural networks for comparing images. These metrics\nhave been successful on datasets that leverage the average human perception in\nlimited settings. But the question remains if they could be adapted to specific\nsimilarity contexts. No single metric can suit all similarity contexts, and\nprevious rule-based metrics are labor-intensive to rewrite for new contexts. On\nthe other hand, DPS metrics use neural networks that might be retrained for\neach context. However, retraining networks takes resources and might ruin\nperformance on previous tasks. This work examines the adaptability of DPS\nmetrics by training ImageNet pretrained CNNs to measure similarity according to\ngiven contexts. Contexts are created by randomly ranking six image distortions.\nDistortions later in the ranking are considered more disruptive to similarity\nwhen applied to an image for that context. This also gives insight into whether\nthe pretrained features capture different similarity contexts. The adapted\nmetrics are evaluated on a perceptual similarity dataset to evaluate if\nadapting to a ranking affects their prior performance. The findings show that\nDPS metrics can be adapted with high performance. While the adapted metrics\nhave difficulties with the same contexts as baselines, performance is improved\nin 99% of cases. Finally, it is shown that the adaption is not significantly\ndetrimental to prior performance on perceptual similarity.

For cross-modal\nTBPS task, it is critical to obtain well-distributed representation in the\ncommon embedding space to reduce the inter-modal gap. Furthermore, it is also\nessential to learn detailed image-text correspondence efficiently to\ndiscriminate similar targets and enable fine-grained target search. To address\nthese challenges, we present a simple yet effective method that calibrates\ncross-modal features from these two perspectives. Our method consists of two\nnovel losses to provide fine-grained cross-modal features. The Sew calibration\nloss takes the quality of textual captions as guidance and aligns features\nbetween image and text modalities. On the other hand, the Masking Caption\nModeling (MCM) loss leverages a masked captions prediction task to establish\ndetailed and generic relationships between textual and visual parts. The\nproposed method is cost-effective and can easily retrieve specific persons with\ntextual captions. The architecture has only a dual-encoder without multi-level\nbranches or extra interaction modules, making a high-speed inference. Our\nmethod achieves top results on three popular benchmarks with 73.81%, 74.25% and\n57.35% Rank1 accuracy on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReID,\nrespectively.

Based on this discovery, we propose a\nnew de-bias method based on gradient attention, called Gradient Attention\nBalance Network (GABN).

In addition, we also use masks to erase the Top-N sensitive facial\nregions, forcing the network to allocate its attention to a larger facial\nregion. This method expands the sensitive region of darker-skinned people and\nfurther reduces the gap between GAM of darker-skinned people and GAM of\nCaucasians.

In recent years, light traps have been increasingly used\nto lure and photograph pests for pest counting. However, pest images have a\nwide range of variability in pest appearance owing to severe occlusion, wide\npose variation, and even scale variation. This makes pest counting more\nchallenging. To address these issues, this study proposes a new pest counting\nmodel referred to as multiscale and deformable attention CenterNet\n(Mada-CenterNet) for internal low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR)\njoint feature learning. Compared with the conventional CenterNet, the proposed\nMada-CenterNet adopts a multiscale heatmap generation approach in a two-step\nfashion to predict LR and HR heatmaps adaptively learned to scale variations,\nthat is, changes in the number of pests. In addition, to overcome the pose and\nocclusion problems, a new between-hourglass skip connection based on deformable\nand multiscale attention is designed to ensure internal LR and HR joint feature\nlearning and incorporate geometric deformation, thereby resulting in an\nimproved pest counting accuracy. Through experiments, the proposed\nMada-CenterNet is verified to generate the HR heatmap more accurately and\nimprove pest counting accuracy owing to multiscale heatmap generation, joint\ninternal feature learning, and deformable and multiscale attention. In\naddition, the proposed model is confirmed to be effective in overcoming severe\nocclusions and variations in pose and scale. The experimental results show that\nthe proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art crowd counting and object\ndetection models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 08:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Such simultaneous selection of knots\nand model is not trivial, but our strategy can make it possible by employing a\nnonconvex regularization on the least square method that is usually applied.\nMore specifically, motivated by the constraint that directly designates (the\nupper bound of) the number of knots to be used, we present an (unconstrained)\nregularized least square reformulation, which is later shown to be equivalent\nto the motivating cardinality-constrained formulation.

Motivated by the\nsuccess of deep learning, the semantic-aware and task-oriented communications\nwith deep joint source and channel coding (JSCC) have emerged as new paradigm\nshifts in 6G from the conventional data-oriented communications with separate\nsource and channel coding (SSCC). However, most existing works focused on the\ndeep JSCC designs for one task of data recovery or AI task execution\nindependently, which cannot be transferred to other unintended tasks.\nDifferently, this paper investigates the JSCC semantic communications to\nsupport multi-task services, by performing the image data recovery and\nclassification task execution simultaneously. First, we propose a new\nend-to-end deep JSCC framework by unifying the coding rate reduction\nmaximization and the mean square error (MSE) minimization in the loss function.\nHere, the coding rate reduction maximization facilitates the learning of\ndiscriminative features for enabling to perform classification tasks directly\nin the feature space, and the MSE minimization helps the learning of\ninformative features for high-quality image data recovery. Next, to further\nimprove the robustness against variational wireless channels, we propose a new\ngated deep JSCC design, in which a gated net is incorporated for adaptively\npruning the output features to adjust their dimensions based on channel\nconditions. Finally, we present extensive numerical experiments to validate the\nperformance of our proposed deep JSCC designs as compared to various benchmark\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 09:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

However, CNNs are resource-hungry due to their\nrequirement of high computational complexity and memory storage. Recent efforts\ntoward achieving computational efficiency in CNNs involve filter pruning\nmethods that eliminate some of the filters in CNNs based on the\n\\enquote{importance} of the filters. The majority of existing filter pruning\nmethods are either \"active\", which use a dataset and generate feature maps to\nquantify filter importance, or \"passive\", which compute filter importance using\nentry-wise norm of the filters without involving data. Under a high pruning\nratio where large number of filters are to be pruned from the network, the\nentry-wise norm methods eliminate relatively smaller norm filters without\nconsidering the significance of the filters in producing the node output,\nresulting in degradation in the performance. To address this, we present a\npassive filter pruning method where the filters are pruned based on their\ncontribution in producing output by considering the operator norm of the\nfilters. The proposed pruning method generalizes better across various CNNs\ncompared to that of the entry-wise norm-based pruning methods. In comparison to\nthe existing active filter pruning methods, the proposed pruning method is at\nleast 4.5 times faster in computing filter importance and is able to achieve\nsimilar performance compared to that of the active filter pruning methods.

The problem addressed by this paper is the\nfollowing: Suppose we obtain an optimal trajectory by solving a control problem\nin the training environment, how do we ensure that the real-world system\ntrajectory tracks this optimal trajectory with minimal amount of error in a\ndeployment environment. In other words, we want to learn how we can adapt an\noptimal trained policy to distribution shifts in the environment.

For example, the real space trajectories\ncorresponding to electron-electron scattering can have three reversal points,\nreversal points at non-zero radial momentum and other unusual features.

As a case study, the\nrovibrational polaritons and related thermodynamic properties of H$_2$O in an\nIR microcavity are computed for varying cavity parameters and applying various\napproximations to describe the molecular degrees of freedom. The self-dipole\ninteraction is found to be significant for nearly all light-matter coupling\nstrengths investigated, and the molecular polarizability proved to be important\nfor the correct qualitative behavior of the energy level shifts induced by the\ncavity. On the other hand, the magnitude of polarization remains small,\njustifying the perturbative approach for the cavity-induced changes in\nelectronic structure. Comparing results obtained using a high-accuracy\nvariational molecular model with those obtained utilizing the rigid rotor and\nharmonic oscillator approximations revealed that as long as the rovibrational\nmodel is appropriate for describing the field-free molecule, the computed\nrovibropolaritonic properties can be expected to be accurate as well.

However, controlling RBC, for example by modulating\nthe spatial distribution of the bottom-plate heating in the canonical RBC\nconfiguration, remains a challenging topic for classical control-theory\nmethods. In the present work, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for\ncontrolling RBC. We show that effective RBC control can be obtained by\nleveraging invariant multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which takes\nadvantage of the locality and translational invariance inherent to RBC flows\ninside wide channels. The MARL framework applied to RBC allows for an increase\nin the number of control segments without encountering the curse of\ndimensionality that would result from a naive increase in the DRL action-size\ndimension. This is made possible by the MARL ability for re-using the knowledge\ngenerated in different parts of the RBC domain. We show in a case study that\nMARL DRL is able to discover an advanced control strategy that destabilizes the\nspontaneous RBC double-cell pattern, changes the topology of RBC by coalescing\nadjacent convection cells, and actively controls the resulting coalesced cell\nto bring it to a new stable configuration. This modified flow configuration\nresults in reduced convective heat transfer, which is beneficial in several\nindustrial processes. Therefore, our work both shows the potential of MARL DRL\nfor controlling large RBC systems, as well as demonstrates the possibility for\nDRL to discover strategies that move the RBC configuration between different\ntopological configurations, yielding desirable heat-transfer characteristics.\nThese results are useful for both gaining further understanding of the\nintrinsic properties of RBC, as well as for developing industrial applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 11:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

We ran three speculative design\nworkshops (n=12), with XR and memory researchers creating 48 XRMM scenarios.\nThrough thematic analysis, we define XRMMs, present a framework of their core\ncomponents and reveal three classes (at encoding, pre-retrieval, at retrieval).\nEach class differs in terms of technology (AR, VR) and impact on memory\n(influencing quality of memories, inducing forgetting, distorting memories). We\nraise ethical concerns and discuss opportunities of perceptual and memory\nmanipulations in XR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 12:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Then, as various quizzes\ntend to focus on different knowledge concepts, we respectively measure the\ninter-quiz knowledge substitution by the gated recurrent unit and the\ninter-quiz knowledge complementarity by the self-attentive encoder with a novel\nrecency-aware attention mechanism. Finally, we integrate the inter-quiz\nlong-term knowledge substitution and complementarity across different quizzes\nto output students' evolving knowledge states. Extensive experimental results\non three public real-world datasets demonstrate that QKT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Further analyses\nconfirm that QKT is promising in designing more effective quizzes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 12:48:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2023 12:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

SfM consists of three main steps; feature detection and\nmatching, camera motion estimation, and recovery of 3D structure from estimated\nintrinsic and extrinsic parameters and features.\n  A problem encountered in SfM is that scenes lacking texture or with\nrepetitive features can cause erroneous feature matching between frames.\nSemantic segmentation offers a route to validate and correct SfM models by\nlabelling pixels in the input images with the use of a deep convolutional\nneural network. The semantic and geometric properties associated with classes\nin the scene can be taken advantage of to apply prior constraints to each class\nof object. The SfM pipeline COLMAP and semantic segmentation pipeline DeepLab\nwere used. This, along with planar reconstruction of the dense model, were used\nto determine erroneous points that may be occluded from the calculated camera\nposition, given the semantic label, and thus prior constraint of the\nreconstructed plane.

A few\nefforts have been made to solve decentralized nonconvex strongly-concave (NCSC)\nminimax-structured optimization; however, all of them focus on smooth problems\nwith at most a constraint on the maximization variable. In this paper, we make\nthe first attempt on solving composite NCSC minimax problems that can have\nconvex nonsmooth terms on both minimization and maximization variables. Our\nalgorithm is designed based on a novel reformulation of the decentralized\nminimax problem that introduces a multiplier to absorb the dual consensus\nconstraint. The removal of dual consensus constraint enables the most\naggressive (i.e., local maximization instead of a gradient ascent step) dual\nupdate that leads to the benefit of taking a larger primal stepsize and better\ncomplexity results. In addition, the decoupling of the nonsmoothness and\nconsensus on the dual variable eases the analysis of a decentralized algorithm;\nthus our reformulation creates a new way for interested researchers to design\nnew (and possibly more efficient) decentralized methods on solving NCSC minimax\nproblems. We show a global convergence result of the proposed algorithm and an\niteration complexity result to produce a (near) stationary point of the\nreformulation. Moreover, a relation is established between the (near)\nstationarities of the reformulation and the original formulation. With this\nrelation, we show that when the dual regularizer is smooth, our algorithm can\nhave lower complexity results (with reduced dependence on a condition number)\nthan existing ones to produce a near-stationary point of the original\nformulation.

AdDA works by\nallowing the network to adaptively adjust the augmentation compositions\naccording to the real-time feedback. This online adjustment helps maintain the\ndynamic optimal composition and enables the network to acquire more\ngeneralizable representations with minimal computational overhead.

The\ncavity collapse is a capillary-driven process, with a dependency on viscosity\nand gravity affecting, respectively, precursory capillary waves on the cavity\nboundary, and the static bubble shape. The collapse is characterised by\ntangential and normal velocities of the kink, formed by the intersection of the\nconcave cavity opening after the top thin film rupture, with the convex bubble\ncavity boundary. The tangential velocity $U_t$ is constant during the collapse\nand is shown to be $U_t=4.5~U_c{\\mathcal{W}}_R$, where $U_c$ is the capillary\nvelocity and ${\\mathcal{W}}_R(Oh,Bo)={(1-\\sqrt{Oh {\\mathscr{L}}} )^{-1/2}}$ is\nthe wave resistance factor due to the precursory capillary waves, with\n$\\mathscr{L}(Bo)$ being the path correction of the kink motion.

Our results suggest that PICAR-Z provides accurate predictions while\nremaining computationally efficient. An important goal of our work is to allow\nresearchers who are not experts in computation to easily build computationally\nefficient extensions to zero-inflated spatial models; this also allows for a\nmore thorough exploration of modeling choices in two-part models than was\npreviously possible. We show that PICAR-Z is easy to implement and extend in\npopular probabilistic programming languages such as nimble and stan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 14:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Here\nwe propose two novel approaches that focus on the mutual impact of features in\nrandom forests. Mutual forest impact (MFI) is a relation parameter that\nevaluates the mutual association of the featurs to the outcome and, hence, goes\nbeyond the analysis of correlation coefficients. Mutual impurity reduction\n(MIR) is an importance measure that combines this relation parameter with the\nimportance of the individual features. MIR and MFI are implemented together\nwith testing procedures that generate p-values for the selection of related and\nimportant features. Applications to various simulated data sets and the\ncomparison to other methods for feature selection and relation analysis show\nthat MFI and MIR are very promising to shed light on the complex relationships\nbetween features and outcome.

However, it is unclear whether this asymmetry is a result of complexity\nin the visual structure of categories in the world to which language refers,\nthe structure of language itself, or the interplay between the two sources of\ninformation. We quantitatively test these three hypotheses regarding early verb\nlearning by employing visual and linguistic representations of words sourced\nfrom large-scale pre-trained artificial neural networks. Examining the\nstructure of both visual and linguistic embedding spaces, we find, first, that\nthe representation of verbs is generally more variable and less discriminable\nwithin domain than the representation of nouns. Second, we find that if only\none learning instance per category is available, visual and linguistic\nrepresentations are less well aligned in the verb system than in the noun\nsystem. However, in parallel with the course of human language development, if\nmultiple learning instances per category are available, visual and linguistic\nrepresentations become almost as well aligned in the verb system as in the noun\nsystem. Third, we compare the relative contributions of factors that may\npredict learning difficulty for individual words. A regression analysis reveals\nthat visual variability is the strongest factor that internally drives verb\nlearning, followed by visual-linguistic alignment and linguistic variability.\nBased on these results, we conclude that verb acquisition is influenced by all\nthree sources of complexity, but that the variability of visual structure poses\nthe most significant challenge for verb learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 15:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

To\nstrengthen this foundation, one must reckon with bounded rationality in human\ndecision-making processes, such as the lack of accurate information, limited\ncomputing power, and sub-optimal choices. This retreat from behavioral\nperfectionism in the literature, however, was typically accompanied by a\nconceptual modification of WE. Here we show that giving up perfect rationality\nneed not force a departure from WE. On the contrary, WE can be reached with\nglobal stability in a routing game played by boundedly rational travelers. We\nachieve this result by developing a day-to-day (DTD) dynamical model that\nmimics how travelers gradually adjust their route valuations, hence choice\nprobabilities, based on past experiences. Our model, called cumulative logit\n(CULO), resembles the classical DTD models but makes a crucial change: whereas\nthe classical models assume routes are valued based on the cost averaged over\nhistorical data, ours values the routes based on the cost accumulated. To\ndescribe route choice behaviors, the CULO model only uses two parameters, one\naccounting for the rate at which the future route cost is discounted in the\nvaluation relative to the past ones and the other describing the sensitivity of\nroute choice probabilities to valuation differences. We prove that the CULO\nmodel always converges to WE, regardless of the initial point, as long as the\nbehavioral parameters satisfy certain mild conditions. Our theory thus upholds\nWE's role as a benchmark in transportation systems analysis. It also resolves\nthe theoretical challenge posed by Harsanyi's instability problem by explaining\nwhy equally good routes at WE are selected with different probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 15:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Using the\nfully compressible time-implicit code MUSIC, we study IGWs in two-dimensional\nsimulations of a zero-age-main-sequence 5 solar mass star model up to 91\\% of\nthe stellar radius with different luminosity and radiative diffusivity\nenhancements.

Major progress was made towards\na proof over the last decades; using combinatorial weight enumerator bounds, a\nbreakthrough on the erasure channel from sharp thresholds, hypercontractivity\narguments, and polarization theory. Another major progress recently established\nthat the bit error probability vanishes slowly below capacity. However, when\nchannels allow for errors, the results of Bourgain-Kalai do not apply for\nconverting a vanishing bit to a vanishing block error probability, neither do\nthe known weight enumerator bounds. The conjecture that RM codes achieve\nShannon capacity on symmetric channels, with high probability of recovering the\ncodewords, has thus remained open.\n  This paper closes the conjecture's proof. It uses a new recursive boosting\nframework, which aggregates the decoding of codeword restrictions on\n`subspace-sunflowers', handling their dependencies via an $L_p$ Boolean Fourier\nanalysis, and using a list-decoding argument with a weight enumerator bound\nfrom Sberlo-Shpilka. The proof does not require a vanishing bit error\nprobability for the base case, but only a non-trivial probability, obtained\nhere for general symmetric codes. This gives in particular a shortened and\ntightened argument for the vanishing bit error probability result of\nReeves-Pfister, and with prior works, it implies the strong wire-tap secrecy of\nRM codes on pure-state classical-quantum channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 15:31:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Our aim is not to contribute new\nresults to the general discussion of the quantum/classical connection (which we\ndo not) but rather to slightly illuminate the specific case of axion\nexperiments. From the classical perspective one expects a signal oscillating\nwith a frequency equal to the axion mass whose amplitude is slowly rising due\nto the tiny interaction of the axions with ordinary matter. In the quantum\npicture the latter, slow time-scale arises from the small splitting in the\nenergy levels induced by the interaction between the axions and the experiment,\nand it is always present in suitable, sensitive experiments. Signals that\noscillate with a frequency equal to the axion mass, however, arise from\nprocesses changing the axion number.

However, we show by example that, using an appropriate experimental\nprocedure, these special states can be modified by the experiment in such a way\nthat a signal oscillating with the axion mass re-appears. In addition, we\ndiscuss the measurement of suitable correlators that feature an oscillation\nwith the axion mass. We also comment on the connection to the classical\ntreatment.

We illustrate how these constraints depend on redshift and\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and on different possible priors. We show that in any\ncase it is possible to constrain the scalar charge precisely, so that some\nscalarized NS solutions known in the literature can be excluded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 15:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Explicable planning was previously introduced as a novel planning\napproach to reconciling human expectations and the optimal robot behavior for\nmore interpretable robot decision-making. One critical issue that remains\nunaddressed is safety during explicable decision-making which can lead to\nexplicable behaviors that are unsafe. We propose Safe Explicable Planning\n(SEP), which extends explicable planning to support the specification of a\nsafety bound. The objective of SEP is to find a policy that generates a\nbehavior close to human expectations while satisfying the safety constraints\nintroduced by the bound, which is a special case of multi-objective\noptimization where the solution to SEP lies on the Pareto frontier. Under such\na formulation, we propose a novel and efficient method that returns the safe\nexplicable policy and an approximate solution.

A good model of these dynamics\nshould be able to infer the activity of unobserved neurons within the same\npopulation and of the observed neurons at future times. Accordingly,\nPandarinath and colleagues have introduced a benchmark to evaluate models on\nthese two (and related) criteria: four data sets, each consisting of firing\nrates from a population of neurons, recorded from macaque cortex during\nmovement-related tasks. Here we show that simple, general-purpose architectures\nbased on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) outperform more \"bespoke\" models, and\nindeed outperform all published models on all four data sets in the benchmark.\nPerformance can be improved further still with a novel, hybrid architecture\nthat augments the RNN with self-attention, as in transformer networks. But pure\ntransformer models fail to achieve this level of performance, either in our\nwork or that of other groups. We argue that the autoregressive bias imposed by\nRNNs is critical for achieving the highest levels of performance. We conclude,\nhowever, by proposing that the benchmark be augmented with an alternative\nevaluation of latent dynamics that favors generative over discriminative models\nlike the ones we propose in this report.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2023 14:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}
