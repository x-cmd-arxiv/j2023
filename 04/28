Pre-straining and relaxing the membranes introduces a\npopulation of cracks into the rGO film. Subsequent straining opens these\ncracks, inducing piezoresistivity. Reduction for 30 s forms an array of\nparallel cracks that do not individually span the membrane and results in a\nstrain gauge with a usable strain range > 0.2 and gauge factor of 20 - 100 at\nlow strain levels that increases with increasing pre-strain. In all cases the\ngauge facto decreases with increasing applied strain and asymptotes to a value\nof about 3, as it approaches the pre-strain value. If the rGO is reduced for 60\ns, the cracks fully span the width of the membrane, leading to an increased\ngauge resistance but a much more sensitive strain gauge with GF ranging from\n1000 - 16000. However, the usable strain range reduces to < 0.01. A simple\nequivalent resistor model is proposed to describe the behaviour of both gauge\ntypes. The gauges show a repeatable and stable response with loading\nfrequencies up to 1 kHz and have been used to detect human body motion in a\nsimple e-skin demonstration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 16:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

In this work, we take a deep look at instance\nsegmentation in the dark and introduce several techniques that substantially\nboost the low-light inference accuracy. The proposed method is motivated by the\nobservation that noise in low-light images introduces high-frequency\ndisturbances to the feature maps of neural networks, thereby significantly\ndegrading performance. To suppress this ``feature noise\", we propose a novel\nlearning method that relies on an adaptive weighted downsampling layer, a\nsmooth-oriented convolutional block, and disturbance suppression learning.\nThese components effectively reduce feature noise during downsampling and\nconvolution operations, enabling the model to learn disturbance-invariant\nfeatures. Furthermore, we discover that high-bit-depth RAW images can better\npreserve richer scene information in low-light conditions compared to typical\ncamera sRGB outputs, thus supporting the use of RAW-input algorithms. Our\nanalysis indicates that high bit-depth can be critical for low-light instance\nsegmentation. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated RAW datasets, we leverage a\nlow-light RAW synthetic pipeline to generate realistic low-light data. In\naddition, to facilitate further research in this direction, we capture a\nreal-world low-light instance segmentation dataset comprising over two thousand\npaired low/normal-light images with instance-level pixel-wise annotations.\nRemarkably, without any image preprocessing, we achieve satisfactory\nperformance on instance segmentation in very low light (4~\\% AP higher than\nstate-of-the-art competitors), meanwhile opening new opportunities for future\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 16:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

To overcome these issues, we propose a novel probabilistic model to\nachieve the robustness of model-based approaches and reduced dependence on the\nmodel's parameter space of model-free approaches. The proposed probabilistic\nmodel incorporates a model-based network as a prior-net to estimate the prior\nprobability distribution of joints and vertices.

Diffusion is typically modeled using gradients in chemical\npotential. However, chemical potential is derived for uniform pressure and\ntemperature conditions and therefore cannot be used to model diffusion when\nthere are gradients in stress. Internal stress variations in minerals create\ngradients in strain energy which will drive diffusion. Consequently, it is\nnecessary to have a method that incorporates stress variations into diffusion\nmodels. We derive a flux expression that allows diffusion to be modeled in\nionic, crystalline solids under arbitrary stress states. Our derivation\nutilizes gradients in a thermodynamic potential called relative chemical\npotential which quantifies changes in free energy due to the exchanges of\nconstituents on lattice sites under arbitrary stress conditions. We apply our\nderivation to the common quaternary garnet solid solution\nalmandine-pyrope-grossular-spessartine.

Both the forward-shock emission, that dominates\nthe optical and X-ray flux, and the reverse-shock emission, that produces the\nradio afterglow, require a jet with a narrow core ($\\theta_c\\approx0.021$) and\na shallow angular structure ($a\\approx0.8$) expanding into a stellar wind\n($k\\approx2$). Moreover, these data appear to favor a small fraction\n($\\xi_e\\approx10^{-2}$) of shock-heated electrons forming a power-law energy\ndistribution in both shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 17:04:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 17:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

However, given that objects occupy only\na small part of a scene, finding dense candidates and generating dense\nrepresentations is noisy and inefficient. We propose SparseFusion, a novel\nmulti-sensor 3D detection method that exclusively uses sparse candidates and\nsparse representations. Specifically, SparseFusion utilizes the outputs of\nparallel detectors in the LiDAR and camera modalities as sparse candidates for\nfusion. We transform the camera candidates into the LiDAR coordinate space by\ndisentangling the object representations. Then, we can fuse the multi-modality\ncandidates in a unified 3D space by a lightweight self-attention module. To\nmitigate negative transfer between modalities, we propose novel semantic and\ngeometric cross-modality transfer modules that are applied prior to the\nmodality-specific detectors. SparseFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance\non the nuScenes benchmark while also running at the fastest speed, even\noutperforming methods with stronger backbones.

But to our knowledge, there have\nnot been any estimates of these requirements in terms of more familiar economic\nresources like money or electricity. We demonstrate that the electrical energy\nrequired to break one cryptographic public key can be decomposed into the\nproduct of two factors. There is an extensive literature of previous estimates\nfor one factor, the spacetime volume, that range over about six orders of\nmagnitude; we discuss some interesting patterns in these estimates. We could\nnot find any quantitative estimates at all for the other factor, the average\npower consumption per qubit. By combining several data points from existing\nsuperconducting-transmon quantum computers and extrapolating them to enormously\nlarger scales, we make an extremely rough estimate of a plausible value of\nabout six watts/qubit consumed by an eventual superconducting-transmon CRQC. By\ncombining this estimate with a plausible spacetime volume estimate of $5.9\n\\times 10^6$ qubit-days from the prior literature, we estimate that - even\nafter expending the enormous costs to build a CRQC - running it would require\nabout 125 MW of electrical power, and using it to break one public key would\ncost about \\$64,000 for electricity alone at current prices.

We argue that the governing PDEs are often well-known and\nshould be explicitly enforced rather than learned. Instead, constitutive models\nare particularly suitable for learning due to their data-fitting nature. To\nthis end, we introduce a new framework termed \"Neural Constitutive Laws\"\n(NCLaw), which utilizes a network architecture that strictly guarantees\nstandard constitutive priors, including rotation equivariance and undeformed\nstate equilibrium.

Using entangled quantum states makes it possible to scale the\nprecision with $N$ better than when resources would be used independently.\nConsequently, the optimal use of all resources involves accumulating them in a\nsingle execution of the experiment. Unfortunately, that implies that the most\ncommon theoretical tool used to analyze metrological protocols - quantum Fisher\ninformation (QFI) - does not allow for a reliable description of this problem,\nas it becomes operationally meaningful only with multiple repetitions of the\nexperiment. In this thesis, using the formalism of Bayesian estimation and the\nminimax estimator, I derive asymptotically saturable bounds on the precision of\nthe estimation for the case of noiseless unitary evolution. For the case where\nthe number of resources $N$ is strictly constrained, I show that the final\nmeasurement uncertainty is $\\pi$ times larger than would be implied by a naive\nuse of QFI. I also analyze the case where a constraint is imposed only on the\naverage amount of resources, the exact value of which may fluctuate (in which\ncase QFI does not provide any universal bound for precision). In both cases, I\nstudy the asymptotic saturability and the rate of convergence of these bounds.\nIn the following part, I analyze the problem of the Heisenberg limit when\nmultiple parameters are measured simultaneously on the same physical system. In\nparticular, I investigate the existence of a gain from measuring all parameters\nsimultaneously compared to distributing the same amount of resources to measure\nthem independently.

However, while the algebraic manipulation of\npolynomials is simple (e.g., compositions and products), the QSP/QSVT circuits\nrealizing analogous manipulations of their embedded polynomials are\nnon-obvious. This work constructs and characterizes the runtime and\nexpressivity of QSP/QSVT protocols where circuit manipulation maps naturally to\nthe algebraic manipulation of functional transforms (termed semantic\nembedding). In this way, QSP/QSVT can be treated and combined modularly, purely\nin terms of the functional transforms they embed, with key guarantees on the\ncomputability and modularity of the realizing circuits. We also identify\nexisting quantum algorithms whose use of semantic embedding is implicit,\nspanning from distributed search to proofs of soundness in quantum\ncryptography. The methods used, based in category theory, establish a theory of\nsemantically embeddable quantum algorithms, and provide a new role for QSP/QSVT\nin reducing sophisticated algorithmic problems to simpler algebraic ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 17:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

Furthermore, models often\nencounter shifts in domain as process parameters change and new categories of\nfaults emerge. Traditional supervised learning may struggle to learn compact,\ndiscriminative representations that generalize to these unseen target domains\nsince it depends on having plentiful classes to partition the feature space\nwith decision boundaries.

Here we\nshow that if the luminous emission from a TDE is directly coupled to the rate\nof return of tidally destroyed debris to the SMBH, then the TDE luminosity\nfunction is in good agreement with observations and scales as $\\propto\nL^{-2.5}$ for high luminosities, provided that the SMBH mass function\n$dN_{\\bullet}/dM_{\\bullet}$ -- the number of SMBHs ($N_{\\bullet}$) per SMBH\nmass ($M_{\\bullet}$) -- is approximately flat in the mass range over which we\nobserve TDEs. We also show that there is a cutoff in the luminosity function at\nlow luminosities that is a result of direct captures, and this cutoff has been\ntentatively observed. If $dN_{\\bullet}/dM_{\\bullet}$ is flat, which is in\nagreement with some observational campaigns, these results suggest that the\nfallback rate feeds the accretion rate in TDEs.

On the nuScenes dataset,\nwe observe a significant improvement of 1.6% in AP BEV in 0-80m range at\nIoU=0.25 and an improvement of 1.7% in AP BEV in 0-80m range at IoU=0.5 while\nonly using one-fifth of the training time in the original approach by MODEST.\nOn the Lyft dataset, we also observe an improvement over the baseline during\nthe first round of iterative self-training. We explore the trade-off between\nhigh precision and high recall in the early stage of the self-training process\nby comparing our proposed method with two other score filtering methods:\nconfidence score filtering for pseudo-labels with and without static label\nretention.

Given a legal\nquestion in natural language, the goal is to extract all the segments that\ncontain the needed information to answer the question. We introduce a deep\nmodel that solves the task in three stages. First, our model leverages recent\nadvanced autoencoding language models to produce contextual word embeddings,\nwhich are then combined with character-level and POS-tag information to form\nword representations. Next, bidirectional long short-term memory networks are\nemployed to capture the relations among words and generate sentence-level\nrepresentations. At the third stage, borrowing ideas from graph-based\ndependency parsing methods which provide a global view on the input sentence,\nwe use biaffine classifiers to estimate the probability of each pair of\nstart-end words to be an important segment. Experimental results on a public\nVietnamese legal dataset show that our model outperforms the previous work by a\nlarge margin, achieving 94.79% in the F1 score.

In this work, we report the\nresults of the largest high-resolution spectroscopic H$\\alpha$ emission survey\nto date spanning this transition region, including 480 M dwarfs observed using\nthe CHIRON spectrograph at CTIO/SMARTS 1.5-m. We find that M dwarfs with\nH$\\alpha$ in emission are almost entirely found 0 to 0.5 magnitude above the\ntop edge of the gap in the HRD, whereas effectively no stars in and below the\ngap show emission. Thus, the top edge of the gap marks a relatively sharp\nactivity transition and there is no anomalous H$\\alpha$ activity for stars in\nthe gap. We also identify a new region at 10.3 $<M_{G}<$ 10.8 on the main\nsequence where fewer M dwarfs exhibit H$\\alpha$ emission compared to M dwarfs\nabove and below this magnitude range.

The Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) distribution in terms of the sparsity\ndegree of the stochastic signal is utilized for modeling the sparsity of\nsignals. Several detectors with improved detection performance are proposed by\nincorporating the estimated attack parameters into the detection process.\nFirst, we propose the generalized likelihood ratio test with reference sensors\n(GLRTRS) and the locally most powerful test with reference sensors (LMPTRS)\ndetectors with adaptive thresholds, given that the sparsity degree and the\nattack parameters are unknown.

To\ncharacterize the orbit pole distribution of dynamical groups of small bodies it\nhelps to have a functional form for a model of the distribution function.\nPrevious studies have used the small-inclination approximation and adopted\nvariations of the normal distribution to model orbital inclination dispersions.\nBecause the orbital pole is a directional variable, its distribution can be\nmore appropriately modeled with directional statistics. We describe the von\nMises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on the surface of the unit sphere for\napplication to small bodies' orbital poles. We apply it to the orbit pole\ndistribution of the observed Plutinos. We find a mean pole located at\ninclination of 3.57 degrees and a longitude of ascending node of 124.38 degrees\n(in the J2000 reference frame), with a 99.7 per cent confidence cone of\nhalf-angle 1.68 degrees.

The vMF concentration\nparameter of Plutino inclinations (relative to either mean pole estimate) is\n31.6. This resembles a Rayleigh distribution function with a width parameter of\n10.2 degrees. Unlike previous models, the vMF model naturally accommodates all\nphysical inclinations (and no others), whereas Rayleigh or Gaussian models must\nbe truncated to the physical inclination range 0-180 degrees.

While\nfor small impurity-boson couplings this process can be described within the\nFroehlich model as generation, emission and binding of Bogoliubov phonons, this\nis no longer adequate if the coupling becomes strong. To treat this regime we\nconsider a mean-field approach beyond the Froehlich model which accounts for\nthe backaction to the condensate, complemented with Truncated Wigner\nsimulations to include quantum fluctuation. For the stationary polaron we find\nan energy-momentum relation that displays a smooth crossover from a convex to a\nconcave dependence associated with a non-monotonous relation between impurity\nvelocity and polaron momentum. For larger momenta the energy is a periodic\nfunction including regions of negative impurity velocity. Studying the polaron\nformation after turning on the impurity-boson coupling quasi adiabatically and\nin a sudden quench, we find a very rich scenario of dynamical regimes. Due to\nthe build-up of an effective mass, the impurity is slowed down even if its\ninitial velocity is below the Landau critical value. For larger initial\nvelocities we find deceleration and even backscattering caused by emission of\ndensity waves or grey solitons and subsequent formation of stationary polaron\nstates in different momentum sectors.

Among their desirable properties, compositionality has been the\nmain focus in the context of referential games and variants, as it promises to\nenable greater systematicity to the agents which would wield it. The concept of\ndisentanglement has been shown to be of paramount importance to learned\nrepresentations that generalise well in deep learning, and is thought to be a\nnecessary condition to enable systematicity. Thus, this paper investigates how\ndo compositionality at the level of the emerging languages, disentanglement at\nthe level of the learned representations, and systematicity relate to each\nother in the context of visual referential games. Firstly, we find that visual\nreferential games that are based on the Obverter architecture outperforms\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised learning approach in terms of many major\ndisentanglement metrics. Secondly, we expand the previously proposed Positional\nDisentanglement (PosDis) metric for compositionality to (re-)incorporate some\nconcerns pertaining to informativeness and completeness features found in the\nMutual Information Gap (MIG) disentanglement metric it stems from. This\nextension allows for further discrimination between the different kind of\ncompositional languages that emerge in the context of Obverter-based\nreferential games, in a way that neither the referential game accuracy nor\nprevious metrics were able to capture. Finally we investigate whether the\nresulting (emergent) systematicity, as measured by zero-shot compositional\nlearning tests, correlates with any of the disentanglement and compositionality\nmetrics proposed so far.

The numerical simulations of the thermocapillary motion in\nthe drops are used to study the onset of the stationary regime.

Compared to direct bandgap systems, this\nrenders silicon less attractive material for a wide range of optoelectronic\napplications. In this work, we introduce an alternative mechanism to fulfill\nthe momentum-matching criterion for optical excitations in indirect\nsemiconductors. We experimentally demonstrate that, when confined to scales\njust below ~3 nm, photons acquire sufficient momentum to allow electronic\ntransitions without the assistance of a phonon. In such arrangement, both\nenergy and momentum can be conserved with two particles only, a photon and an\nelectron, converting previously indirect transitions into direct. This\npreviously overlooked aspect of light-matter interaction manifests itself in a\nmarked increase of optical transition probability. The new strategy presented\nhere provides opportunities for more efficient use of indirect semiconducting\nmaterials in the areas of photovoltaics, energy conversion, light detection and\nemission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 20:25:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

First, HCHC combines global structure with local structure in one\nobjective function for deep clustering, improving the labels as relative\nprobabilities, to mine the similarities between different clusters while\nkeeping the local structure in each cluster. Then, the anchors of different\nclusters are sorted on the optimal Hamiltonian cycle generated by the cluster\nsimilarities and mapped on the circumference of a circle.

In this way, our framework allows us to appreciate three\naspects visually and simultaneously - clusters (formed by samples with high\nprobabilities), cluster similarities (represented as circular distances), and\noutliers (recognized as dots far away from all clusters).

Data augmentation can\nprovide a performance boost to RL agents by mitigating the effect of\noverfitting. However, such data augmentation is a form of prior knowledge, and\nnaively applying them in environments might worsen an agent's performance. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel RL algorithm to mitigate the above issue and\nimprove the efficiency of the learned policy. Our approach consists of a\nmax-min game theoretic objective where a perturber network modifies the state\nto maximize the agent's probability of taking a different action while\nminimizing the distortion in the state.

To securely manage cloud resources, customers are required to\nconfigure IAM to specify the access control rules for their cloud\norganizations. However, IAM misconfiguration may be exploited to perform\nprivilege escalation attacks, which can cause severe economic loss. To detect\nprivilege escalations due to IAM misconfigurations, existing third-party cloud\nsecurity services apply whitebox penetration testing techniques, which require\nthe access of complete IAM configurations. This requirement might cause\nproblems such as information disclosure and anonymization.\n  To mitigate the limitation, we propose a greybox penetration testing approach\ncalled TAC for third-party services to detect IAM privilege escalations,\nwithout requiring the access of complete IAM configurations. The idea is to\nintelligently query a limited amount of information that is only related to IAM\nprivilege escalation detection.

Existing\nstate-of-the-art methods for unsupervised clustering use different similarity\nand distance functions but focus on either spatial or temporal features of the\ndata. Concentrating on joint deep representation learning of spatial and\ntemporal features, we propose Deep Spatiotemporal Clustering (DSC), a novel\nalgorithm for the temporal clustering of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data\nusing an unsupervised deep learning method. Inspired by the U-net architecture,\nDSC utilizes an autoencoder integrating CNN-RNN layers to learn latent\nrepresentations of the spatiotemporal data. DSC also includes a unique layer\nfor cluster assignment on latent representations that uses the Student's\nt-distribution. By optimizing the clustering loss and data reconstruction loss\nsimultaneously, the algorithm gradually improves clustering assignments and the\nnonlinear mapping between low-dimensional latent feature space and\nhigh-dimensional original data space. A multivariate spatiotemporal climate\ndataset is used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method.

For example, in the aftermath of\nnatural disasters or power outages, users may not have Internet access for a\nwhile. Thus, in this paper, we propose LNMesh which enables offline LN payments\non top of wireless mesh networks. Users of a neighborhood or a community can\nestablish a wireless mesh network to use it as an infrastructure to enable\noffline LN payments when they do not have any Internet connection. As such, we\nfirst present proof-of-concept implementations where we successfully perform\noffline LN payments utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy and WiFi. For larger\nnetworks with more users where users can also move around, channel assignments\nin the network need to be made strategically and thus, we propose 1) minimum\nconnected dominating set; and 2) uniform spanning tree based channel assignment\napproaches. Finally, to test these approaches, we implemented a simulator in\nPython along with the support of BonnMotion mobility tool. We then extensively\ntested the performance metrics of large-scale realistic offline LN payments on\nmobile wireless mesh networks. Our simulation results show that, success rates\nup to %95 are achievable with the proposed channel assignment approaches when\nchannels have enough liquidity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 23:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

It is\ndiscovered that previously observed stable and unstable equilibrium altitudes\nare generated by a balance between positive wake-induced lift and negative\nquasi-steady lift while the added mass lift doesn't play a role. Using both\nsimulations and experiments, detailed analyses of each lift component's\nnear-ground behavior provide further physical insights. When applied to\nthree-dimensional pitching hydrofoils the lift decomposition reveals that the\ndisappearance of equilibrium altitudes for AR < 1.5 occurs due to the magnitude\nof the quasi-steady lift outweighing the magnitude of the wake-induced lift at\nall ground distances. Scaling laws for the quasi-steady lift, wake-induced lift\nand the stable equilibrium altitude are discovered. A simple scaling law for\nthe lift of a steady foil in ground effect is derived. This scaling shows that\nboth circulation enhancement and the velocity induced at a foil's leading edge\nby the bound vortex of its ground image foil are the essential physics to\nunderstand steady ground effect. The scaling laws for unsteady pitching foils\ncan predict the equilibrium altitude to within 20% of its value when St < 0.45.\nFor St equal to or greater than 0.45 there is a wake instability effect, not\naccounted for in the scaling relations, that significantly alters the\nwake-induced lift. These results not only provide key physical insights and\nscaling laws for steady and unsteady ground effect, but also for two schooling\nhydrofoils in a side-by-side formation with an out-of-phase synchronization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 23:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

However, its computational cost grows\nwith the number of uncertainty scenarios, prolonging the treatment planning\nprocess. We developed a fast and scalable distributed optimization platform\nthat parallelizes this computation over the scenarios. Methods: We modeled the\nrobust proton treatment planning problem as a weighted least-squares problem.\nTo solve it, we employed an optimization technique called the Alternating\nDirection Method of Multipliers with Barzilai-Borwein step size (ADMM-BB). We\nreformulated the problem in such a way as to split the main problem into\nsmaller subproblems, one for each proton therapy uncertainty scenario. The\nsubproblems can be solved in parallel, allowing the computational load to be\ndistributed across multiple processors (e.g., CPU threads/cores). We evaluated\nADMM-BB on four head-and-neck proton therapy patients, each with 13 scenarios\naccounting for 3 mm setup and 3:5% range uncertainties. We then compared the\nperformance of ADMM-BB with projected gradient descent (PGD) applied to the\nsame problem. Results: For each patient, ADMM-BB generated a robust proton\ntreatment plan that satisfied all clinical criteria with comparable or better\ndosimetric quality than the plan generated by PGD. However, ADMM-BB's total\nruntime averaged about 6 to 7 times faster. This speedup increased with the\nnumber of scenarios. Conclusion: ADMM-BB is a powerful distributed optimization\nmethod that leverages parallel processing platforms, such as multi-core CPUs,\nGPUs, and cloud servers, to accelerate the computationally intensive work of\nrobust proton treatment planning. This results in 1) a shorter treatment\nplanning process and 2) the ability to consider more uncertainty scenarios,\nwhich improves plan quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 23:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

The number of neighbor nodes\naround key nodes is often large, and the surrounding channel environment and\ninterference are often more complex. Thus, the key nodes can hardly get enough\nchannel access opportunities, resulting in poor end-to-end performance.\nTherefore, we propose an adaptive channel reservation MAC protocol based on\nforwarding traffic of key nodes, which is aimed at alleviating the congestion\nfor key nodes. Nodes initiate reservations for future transmission time\naccording to the buffer status before sending packets and then calculate the\nWeight of Reservation Ability (WRA).

Intractable epilepsy is a severe neurological illness that ripples\nacross the globe and impacts millions of individuals. It is extremely difficult\nto control intractable epilepsy, which is defined as the lack of response to\ntwo or more standard antiepileptic medication treatments. In recent years, the\nuse of programmable electrical stimulation of the brain has shown promise as a\ndigital treatment strategy for lowering seizure frequency in individuals with\nintractable epilepsy. In this research, the use of Amenable Neurostimulation\n(ANS) as part of a digital treatment strategy to intractable epilepsy is\ninvestigated.

The rationale behind fusion is to capitalize on the\nstrengths of each modality while mitigating their limitations. The exceptional\nand leading performance of fusion models has been demonstrated by advanced deep\nneural network (DNN)-based fusion techniques. Fusion models are also perceived\nas more robust to attacks compared to single-modal ones due to the redundant\ninformation in multiple modalities. In this work, we challenge this perspective\nwith single-modal attacks that targets the camera modality, which is considered\nless significant in fusion but more affordable for attackers. We argue that the\nweakest link of fusion models depends on their most vulnerable modality, and\npropose an attack framework that targets advanced camera-LiDAR fusion models\nwith adversarial patches. Our approach employs a two-stage optimization-based\nstrategy that first comprehensively assesses vulnerable image areas under\nadversarial attacks, and then applies customized attack strategies to different\nfusion models, generating deployable patches. Evaluations with five\nstate-of-the-art camera-LiDAR fusion models on a real-world dataset show that\nour attacks successfully compromise all models. Our approach can either reduce\nthe mean average precision (mAP) of detection performance from 0.824 to 0.353\nor degrade the detection score of the target object from 0.727 to 0.151 on\naverage, demonstrating the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed\nattack framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 03:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

It has attracted much attention because of its\nnon-perturbative nature and potential for future attosecond laser pulse\nsources. On the theory side, a semi-classical picture based on tunneling\nionization of electrons is successfully used in explaining key characteristics\nof the HHG. This model assumes that electric fields non-perturbatively excite\nelectrons beyond the ionization potential or band gap. Thus, intuitively, a\nlarger gap should lead to an exponentially smaller HHG emission. Despite this\nintuition, the HHG in the Mott insulator Ca2RuO4 has shown an unconventional\nexponential increase with respect to the gap width. This experiment implies\neffects beyond the semi-classical theory. However, most theoretical works have\nfocused on the dependence of the HHG on external control parameters, and the\ngap dependence of the HHG is poorly understood even in non interacting systems.\nThus, it is essential to clarify the gap dependence of the HHG in a fully\nquantum mechanical approach. Here, we analyze numerically exactly the gap\ndependence of the HHG in two-level systems. We find an increase in the strength\nof the HHG when the Rabi frequency is large compared to the gap width.\nFurthermore, the relaxation and scattering of electrons increase the visibility\nof this gap dependence. Finally, we find that the enhancement rate follows a\nuniversal scaling law regardless of the driving frequency. The existence of\nthis gap dependence in two-level systems suggests that this unconventional gap\ndependence is a universal behavior that can be found not only in Mott\ninsulators but also in atomic gasses and semiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 03:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

One common approach is the \"scrubbing\" of fMRI volumes that are\nthought to contain high levels of noise. However, existing scrubbing techniques\nare based on ad hoc measures of signal change. We consider scrubbing via\noutlier detection, where volumes containing artifacts are considered\nmultidimensional outliers. Robust multivariate outlier detection methods are\nproposed using robust distances (RDs), which are related to the Mahalanobis\ndistance. These RDs have a known distribution when the data are i.i.d. normal,\nand that distribution can be used to determine a threshold for outliers where\nfMRI data violate these assumptions. Here, we develop a robust multivariate\noutlier detection method that is applicable to non-normal data. The objective\nis to obtain threshold values to flag outlying volumes based on their RDs. We\npropose two threshold candidates that embark on the same two steps, but the\nchoice of which depends on a researcher's purpose. Our main steps are dimension\nreduction and selection, robust univariate outlier imputation to get rid of the\neffect of outliers on the distribution, and estimating an outlier threshold\nbased on the upper quantile of the RD distribution without outliers. The first\nthreshold candidate is an upper quantile of the empirical distribution of RDs\nobtained from the imputed data. The second threshold candidate calculates the\nupper quantile of the RD distribution that a nonparametric bootstrap uses to\naccount for uncertainty in the empirical quantile.

Various imbalanced node classification methods have been proposed\nrecently which construct synthetic nodes and edges w.r.t. minority classes to\nbalance the label and topology distribution. However, they are all based on the\nhomophilic assumption that nodes of the same label tend to connect despite the\nwide existence of heterophilic edges in real-world graphs. Thus, they uniformly\naggregate features from both homophilic and heterophilic neighbors and rely on\nfeature similarity to generate synthetic edges, which cannot be applied to\nimbalanced graphs in high heterophily. To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel GraphSANN for imbalanced node classification on both homophilic and\nheterophilic graphs. Firstly, we propose a unified feature mixer to generate\nsynthetic nodes with both homophilic and heterophilic interpolation in a\nunified way. Next, by randomly sampling edges between synthetic nodes and\nexisting nodes as candidate edges, we design an adaptive subgraph extractor to\nadaptively extract the contextual subgraphs of candidate edges with flexible\nranges. Finally, we develop a multi-filter subgraph encoder that constructs\ndifferent filter channels to discriminatively aggregate neighbor's information\nalong the homophilic and heterophilic edges.

Data aggregation aids in reducing the number of messages\ntransmitted within the network, which in turn lowers total network energy\nconsumption. Additionally, when decrypting the aggregated data, the base\nstation can distinguish between encrypted and consolidated analysis based on\ntop of the cryptographic keys.

A\nDS can be described by non-linear PP ranges, i.e., the range of one PP\nconditioned on specific values of another. However, independent PP ranges\n(linear combinations) are often preferred in biopharmaceutical manufacturing\ndue to their operation simplicity. While some statistical software supports the\ncalculation of a DS comprised of linear combinations, such methods are\ngenerally based on discretizing the parameter space - an approach that scales\npoorly as the number of PPs increases.

Compared to stateof-the-art,\ngrid-based approaches, the optimizer-based procedure is more accurate,\ngenerally yields a larger DS and enables the calculation in higher dimensions.\nFurthermore, a proposed weighting scheme can be used to favor certain PPs over\nothers and therefore enabling a more dynamic approach to DS definition and\nexploration.

Most sequential recommendation\nmethods use a deep neural network as sequence encoder to generate user and item\nrepresentations. Existing works mainly center upon designing a stronger\nsequence encoder. However, few attempts have been made with training an\nensemble of networks as sequence encoders, which is more powerful than a single\nnetwork because an ensemble of parallel networks can yield diverse prediction\nresults and hence better accuracy. In this paper, we present Ensemble Modeling\nwith contrastive Knowledge Distillation for sequential recommendation (EMKD).\nOur framework adopts multiple parallel networks as an ensemble of sequence\nencoders and recommends items based on the output distributions of all these\nnetworks. To facilitate knowledge transfer between parallel networks, we\npropose a novel contrastive knowledge distillation approach, which performs\nknowledge transfer from the representation level via Intra-network Contrastive\nLearning (ICL) and Cross-network Contrastive Learning (CCL), as well as\nKnowledge Distillation (KD) from the logits level via minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence between the output distributions of the teacher\nnetwork and the student network.

Extensive experiments on\npublic benchmark datasets show that EMKD achieves a significant improvement\ncompared with the state-of-the-art methods.

We conduct all the observations with\ntwo well-known robotic instrument segmentation datasets of MICCAI EndoVis 2017\nand 2018 challenges.

The objective of the present work is to develop a fast hybrid\npressure-correction algorithm for numerical simulation of incompressible flows\naround obstacles in the context of projection methods. The key idea is to adopt\ndifferent numerical methods/discretizations in the sub-steps of projection\nmethods. Here, a classical second-order time-marching projection method which\nconsists of two sub-steps is chosen for the purpose of demonstration. In the\nfirst sub-step, the momentum equations are discretized on unstructured grids\nand solved by conventional numerical methods, here, a meshless method. In the\nsecond sub-step (pressure-correction), the proposed algorithm adopts a double\ndiscretization system and combines the weighted least squares approximation\nwith the essence of immersed boundary methods. Such a design allows us to\ndevelop a FFT-based solver to speed up the solution of the pressure Poisson\nequation for flow cases with obstacles, while keeping the implementation of\nboundary conditions for the momentum equations as easy as conventional\nnumerical methods do with unstructured grids. Numerical experiments of five\ntest cases have been performed to verify and validate the proposed hybrid\nalgorithm and evaluate its computational performance.

Less\nunderstood but very important is the reverse process of gentrification through\nwhich areas of cities get impoverished.

Moreover, as Windows 11 made a TPM 2.0 mandatory, they are\nsubject to an ever-increasing academic challenge. While discrete TPMs - as\nfound in higher-end systems - have been susceptible to attacks on their exposed\ncommunication interface, more common firmware TPMs (fTPMs) are immune to this\nattack vector as they do not communicate with the CPU via an exposed bus. In\nthis paper, we analyze a new class of attacks against fTPMs: Attacking their\nTrusted Execution Environment can lead to a full TPM state compromise. We\nexperimentally verify this attack by compromising the AMD Secure Processor,\nwhich constitutes the TEE for AMD's fTPMs. In contrast to previous dTPM\nsniffing attacks, this vulnerability exposes the complete internal TPM state of\nthe fTPM. It allows us to extract any cryptographic material stored or sealed\nby the fTPM regardless of authentication mechanisms such as Platform\nConfiguration Register validation or passphrases with anti-hammering\nprotection. First, we demonstrate the impact of our findings by - to the best\nof our knowledge - enabling the first attack against Full Disk Encryption\nsolutions backed by an fTPM. Furthermore, we lay out how any application\nrelying solely on the security properties of the TPM - like Bitlocker's TPM-\nonly protector - can be defeated by an attacker with 2-3 hours of physical\naccess to the target device. Lastly, we analyze the impact of our attack on FDE\nsolutions protected by a TPM and PIN strategy. While a naive implementation\nalso leaves the disk completely unprotected, we find that BitLocker's FDE\nimplementation withholds some protection depending on the complexity of the\nused PIN. Our results show that when an fTPM's internal state is compromised, a\nTPM and PIN strategy for FDE is less secure than TPM-less protection with a\nreasonable passphrase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 09:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 09:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Along the way, we also obtain\nan algorithm for Defective Coloring with complexity quasi-linear in the table\nsize, thus settling the complexity of both problems for these parameters.\n  We then consider the more restricted parameter tree-depth, and bridge the gap\nleft by known lower bounds, by showing that neither problem can be solved in\ntime $n^{o(\\mathrm{td})}$ under ETH. In order to do so, we employ a recursive\nlow tree-depth construction that may be of independent interest.\n  Finally, we show that for both problems, an $\\mathrm{vc}^{o(\\mathrm{vc})}$\nalgorithm would violate ETH, thus already known algorithms are optimal. Our\nproof relies on a new application of the technique of $d$-detecting families\nintroduced by Bonamy et al.\n  Our results, although mostly negative in nature, paint a clear picture\nregarding the complexity of both problems in the landscape of parameterized\ncomplexity, since in all cases we provide essentially matching upper and lower\nbounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 09:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

Introducing Information Retrieval (IR) to provide LLM\nwith external knowledge is good potential to solve this problem. However, where\nand how to introduce IR into LLM is a big challenge. Previous work has the\ndisadvantage that the wrong knowledge retrieved by IR misleads the LLM or\nbreaks the reasoning chain of LLM. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\ncalled Search-in-the-Chain (SearChain) for the interaction between LLM and IR\nto solve the challenges. First, LLM generates the global reasoning chain called\nChain-of-Query (CoQ) where each node consists of an IR-oriented query and the\nanswer to the query. Second, IR verifies the answer of each node of CoQ, it\ncorrects the answer that is not consistent with the retrieved information when\nIR gives high confidence, which improves the credibility. Third, LLM can mark\nits missing knowledge in CoQ and IR can provide this knowledge to LLM. These\nthree operations improve the accuracy of LLM for complex knowledge-intensive\ntasks in terms of reasoning ability and knowledge. Finally, SearChain generates\nthe reasoning process and marks references to supporting documents for each\nreasoning step, which improves traceability. SearChain transforms the topology\nof reasoning from chain to tree, which can modify the reasoning direction.\nExperiment shows that SearChain outperforms baselines on complex\nknowledge-intensive tasks including multi-hop question-answering, slot filling,\nfact checking, and long-form question-answering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 10:15:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 06:56:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 02:35:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 14:08:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Concatenating the VLBI maps\nprovided a sparsely sampled, milliarcsecond view of the spatio-kinematics of\nthe accretion disk covering a physical range of $\\sim$ 50 - 900 AU. We term\nthis observational approach `heat-wave mapping'. We report the discovery of a\nKeplerian accretion disk with a spatially resolved four-arm spiral pattern\naround G358.93-0.03-MM1. This result positively implicates disk accretion and\nspiral arm instabilities into the episodic accretion high-mass star formation\nparadigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 10:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Following the\ninspection of archival infrared data, a peculiar anonymous star was found that\napparently heads a long tail that resembles a wake-like feature. We conducted a\nmultiwavelength analysis including photometry, astrometry, and spectroscopy.\nTogether with theoretical physical considerations, this approach provided a\nreasonable knowledge of the stellar age and kinematic properties, together with\ncompelling indications that the extended feature is indeed the signature of a\nhigh-velocity, or runaway, newborn star. Results. Our main result is the\ndiscovery of a low-mass young stellar object that fits the concept of a runaway\nT-Tauri star that was hypothesized several decades ago. In this peculiar star,\nnicknamed UJT-1, the interaction of the stellar wind with the surrounding\nmedium becomes extreme. Under reasonable assumptions, this unusual degree of\ninteraction has the potential to encode the mass-loss history of the star on\ntimescales of several $10^5$ years\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 11:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

We demonstrate that we can apply this objective to optimize a\nvariety of different hyperparameters in a single training run while being\nsignificantly computationally cheaper than alternative methods aiming to\noptimize the marginal likelihood for neural networks.

We investigate this question through the lens of\ninformation flow. Given a subject-relation query, we study how the model\naggregates information about the subject and relation to predict the correct\nattribute. With interventions on attention edges, we first identify two\ncritical points where information propagates to the prediction: one from the\nrelation positions followed by another from the subject positions. Next, by\nanalyzing the information at these points, we unveil a three-step internal\nmechanism for attribute extraction. First, the representation at the\nlast-subject position goes through an enrichment process, driven by the early\nMLP sublayers, to encode many subject-related attributes. Second, information\nfrom the relation propagates to the prediction. Third, the prediction\nrepresentation \"queries\" the enriched subject to extract the attribute. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, this extraction is typically done via attention heads, which\noften encode subject-attribute mappings in their parameters. Overall, our\nfindings introduce a comprehensive view of how factual associations are stored\nand extracted internally in LMs, facilitating future research on knowledge\nlocalization and editing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 11:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

The increased\nsensitivity of long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanners possibly allows\nto overcome the small branching ratio for positron production from 90Y decays\nand to improve for the post-treatment dosimetry of 90Y of selective internal\nradiation therapy.\n  Methods: For the challenging case of an image quality body phantom, we\ncompare a full Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation with the results from the two\ncommercial software packages Simplicit90Y and Hermes. The voxel dosimetry\nmodule of Hermes relies on the 90Y images taken with a LAFOV PET/CT, while the\nMC and Simplicit90Y dose calculations are image independent.\n  Results: The resulting doses from the MC calculation and Simplicit90Y agree\nwell within the error margins. The image-based dose calculation with Hermes,\nhowever, consistently underestimates the dose. This is due to the mismatch of\nthe activity distribution in the PET images and the size of the volume of\ninterest.

Precision livestock farming\ntechnologies provide individualised monitoring of animals on commercial farms,\noptimising livestock production. Continuous acoustic monitoring is a widely\naccepted sensing technique used to estimate the daily rumination and grazing\ntime budget of free-ranging cattle. However, typical environmental and natural\nnoises on pasture noticeably affect the performance and generalisation of\ncurrent acoustic methods. In this study, we present an acoustic method called\nNoise-Robust Foraging Activity Recognizer (NRFAR). The proposed method\ndetermines foraging activity bouts by analysing fixed-length segments of\nidentified jaw movement events associated with grazing and rumination. The\nadditive noise robustness of NRFAR was evaluated for several signal-to-noise\nratios, using stationary Gaussian white noise and four different non-stationary\nnatural noise sources. In noiseless conditions, NRFAR reaches an average\nbalanced accuracy of 89%, outperforming two previous acoustic methods by more\nthan 7%. Additionally, NRFAR presents better performance than previous acoustic\nmethods in 66 out of 80 evaluated noisy scenarios (p<0.01). NRFAR operates\nonline with a similar computational cost to previous acoustic methods. The\ncombination of these properties and the high performance in harsh free-ranging\nenvironments render NRFAR an excellent choice for real-time implementation in a\nlow-power embedded device.

This problem is reduced to the\nstandard model tuning paradigm if the target data is permissibly fed to the\nmodel. However, it is rather difficult in a wide range of practical cases where\ntarget data is not shared with model providers but commonly some evaluations\nabout the model are accessible. In this paper, we formally set up a challenge\nnamed \\emph{Earning eXtra PerformancE from restriCTive feEDdbacks} (EXPECTED)\nto describe this form of model tuning problems. Concretely, EXPECTED admits a\nmodel provider to access the operational performance of the candidate model\nmultiple times via feedback from a local user (or a group of users). The goal\nof the model provider is to eventually deliver a satisfactory model to the\nlocal user(s) by utilizing the feedbacks. Unlike existing model tuning methods\nwhere the target data is always ready for calculating model gradients, the\nmodel providers in EXPECTED only see some feedbacks which could be as simple as\nscalars, such as inference accuracy or usage rate. To enable tuning in this\nrestrictive circumstance, we propose to characterize the geometry of the model\nperformance with regard to model parameters through exploring the parameters'\ndistribution. In particular, for the deep models whose parameters distribute\nacross multiple layers, a more query-efficient algorithm is further\ntailor-designed that conducts layerwise tuning with more attention to those\nlayers which pay off better.

In contrast, we propose an iterative matching\nand pose estimation framework (IMP) leveraging the geometric connections\nbetween the two tasks: a few good matches are enough for a roughly accurate\npose estimation; a roughly accurate pose can be used to guide the matching by\nproviding geometric constraints. To this end, we implement a geometry-aware\nrecurrent attention-based module which jointly outputs sparse matches and\ncamera poses. Specifically, for each iteration, we first implicitly embed\ngeometric information into the module via a pose-consistency loss, allowing it\nto predict geometry-aware matches progressively. Second, we introduce an\n\\textbf{e}fficient IMP, called EIMP, to dynamically discard keypoints without\npotential matches, avoiding redundant updating and significantly reducing the\nquadratic time complexity of attention computation in transformers.

However,\nmany existing related works cannot comprehensively describe weather conditions\ndue to their complex co-occurrence dependencies. This paper proposes a novel\nmulti-label weather recognition model considering these dependencies. The\nproposed model called MASK-Convolutional Neural Network-Transformer (MASK-CT)\nis based on the Transformer, the convolutional process, and the MASK mechanism.\nThe model employs multiple convolutional layers to extract features from\nweather images and a Transformer encoder to calculate the probability of each\nweather condition based on the extracted features. To improve the\ngeneralization ability of MASK-CT, a MASK mechanism is used during the training\nphase. The effect of the MASK mechanism is explored and discussed. The Mask\nmechanism randomly withholds some information from one-pair training instances\n(one image and its corresponding label). There are two types of MASK methods.\nSpecifically, MASK-I is designed and deployed on the image before feeding it\ninto the weather feature extractor and MASK-II is applied to the image label.\nThe Transformer encoder is then utilized on the randomly masked image features\nand labels. The experimental results from various real-world weather\nrecognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed MASK-CT model outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the high-speed dynamic real-time weather\nrecognition capability of the MASK-CT is evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 14:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

Despite the frequent\nobservations of coronal waves, their counterparts in the chromosphere are\nrarely detected. Why the chromosphere rarely bears the imprints of solar\ntsunamis remained a mystery since their discovery three decades ago. To resolve\nthis question, all coronal waves and associated Moreton waves in the last\ndecade have been initially surveyed, though the detection of Moreton waves\ncould be hampered by utilising the low-quality H$\\alpha$ data from Global\nOscillations Network Group.

However, its strong water absorption nature and low noise tolerance\nlead to undesired blurs and distortions of reconstructed THz images. The\ndiffraction-limited THz signals highly constrain the performances of existing\nrestoration methods. To address the problem, we propose a novel multi-view\nSubspace-Attention-guided Restoration Network (SARNet) that fuses multi-view\nand multi-spectral features of THz images for effective image restoration and\n3D tomographic reconstruction. To this end, SARNet uses multi-scale branches to\nextract intra-view spatio-spectral amplitude and phase features and fuse them\nvia shared subspace projection and self-attention guidance. We then perform\ninter-view fusion to further improve the restoration of individual views by\nleveraging the redundancies between neighboring views.

Although auxiliary variables, such as instrumental\nvariables, are commonly used to identify causal effects, they are often\nunavailable in practice due to stringent and untestable conditions. To address\nthis issue, previous researches have utilized linear structural equation models\nto show that the causal effect can be identifiable when noise variables of the\ntreatment and outcome are both non-Gaussian. In this paper, we investigate the\nproblem of identifying the causal effect using auxiliary covariates and\nnon-Gaussianity from the treatment. Our key idea is to characterize the impact\nof unmeasured confounders using an observed covariate, assuming they are all\nGaussian. The auxiliary covariate can be an invalid instrument or an invalid\nproxy variable. We demonstrate that the causal effect can be identified using\nthis measured covariate, even when the only source of non-Gaussianity comes\nfrom the treatment. We then extend the identification results to the\nmulti-treatment setting and provide sufficient conditions for identification.\nBased on our identification results, we propose a simple and efficient\nprocedure for calculating causal effects and show the $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency of\nthe proposed estimator.

We consider that geographically\ndistributed sensor nodes obtain energy measurements and compute cooperatively a\nstatistic to decide if the source is present or absent. We model the radio\nsource as a stochastic signal and deal with spatially statistically dependent\nmeasurements, whose probability density function (PDF) has unknown positive\nparameters when the radio source is active. Under the framework of the\nGeneralized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) theory, the positive constraint on the\nunknown multidimensional parameter makes the computation of the GLRT asymptotic\nperformance (when the amount of sensor measurements tends to infinity) more\ninvolved. Nevertheless, we analytically characterize the asymptotic\ndistribution of the statistic. Moreover, as the GLRT is not amenable for\ndistributed settings because of the spatial statistical dependence of the\nmeasurements, we study a GLRT-like test where the joint PDF of the measurements\nis substituted by the product of its marginal PDFs, and therefore, the\nstatistical dependence is completely discarded for building this test.\nNevertheless, its asymptotic performance is proved to be identical to the\noriginal GLRT, showing that the statistically dependence of the measurements\nhas no impact on the detection performance in the asymptotic scenario.\nFurthermore, the GLRT-like algorithm has a low computational complexity and\ndemands low communication resources, as compared to the GLRT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 15:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

However,\nlow-count PET scans often suffer from high image noise, which can negatively\nimpact image quality and diagnostic performance. Recent advances in deep\nlearning have shown great potential for recovering underlying signal from noisy\ncounterparts. However, neural networks trained on a specific noise level cannot\nbe easily generalized to other noise levels due to different noise amplitude\nand variances. To obtain optimal denoised results, we may need to train\nmultiple networks using data with different noise levels. But this approach may\nbe infeasible in reality due to limited data availability. Denoising dynamic\nPET images presents additional challenge due to tracer decay and continuously\nchanging noise levels across dynamic frames. To address these issues, we\npropose a Unified Noise-aware Network (UNN) that combines multiple sub-networks\nwith varying denoising power to generate optimal denoised results regardless of\nthe input noise levels. Evaluated using large-scale data from two medical\ncenters with different vendors, presented results showed that the UNN can\nconsistently produce promising denoised results regardless of input noise\nlevels, and demonstrate superior performance over networks trained on single\nnoise level data, especially for extremely low-count data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 15:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

Nevertheless, the combustion of iron powder in air is challenging\nespecially with respect to flame stabilization which depends on the particle\nsize distribution among other factors. Models for the prediction of reaction\nfront speed in iron-air suspensions can contribute to overcoming this\nchallenge. To this end, three different models for iron particle oxidation are\nintegrated into a laminar flame solver for simulating reaction fronts. The\nscientific objective of this work is to elucidate the influence of\npolydispersity on the reaction front speed, which is still not satisfactorily\nunderstood. In a systematic approach, cases with successively increasing\ncomplexity are considered: From single particle combustion to iron-air\nsuspensions prescribing binary particle size distributions (PSDs), generic\nPSDs, and a PSD measured for a real iron powder sample. The simulations show\nthat, dependent on the PSD, particles undergo thermochemical conversion in a\nsequential manner according to their size and every particle fraction exhibits\nan individual combustion environment. The local environment can be leaner or\nricher than the overall iron-to-air ratio would suggest and can be very\ndifferent from single particle experiments. The contribution of individual\nparticle fractions to the overall reaction front speed depends on its ranking\nwithin the PSD. The study further demonstrates, that although the three\nparticle models show good agreement for single particle combustion, they lead\nto very different reaction front speeds. This is due to the different ignition\nbehavior predicted by the particle models, which is shown to strongly influence\nthe reaction front characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 15:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

In a random fractal\nembedded in the Euclidean space, the MFPT is known to obey the power law\nscaling with the distance between a source and a target site with a universal\nexponent. We find that the scaling law for the MFPT is not determined solely by\nthe distance between a source and a target but also by their locations. The\nrole of a site in the first passage processes is quantified by the random walk\ncentrality. It turns out that the site of highest random walk centrality,\ndubbed as a hub, intervenes in first passage processes. We show that the MFPT\nfrom a departure site to a target site is determined by a competition between\ndirect paths and indirect paths detouring via the hub. Consequently, the MFPT\ndisplays a crossover scaling between a short distance regime, where direct\npaths are dominant, and a long distance regime, where indirect paths are\ndominant. The two regimes are characterized by power laws with different\nscaling exponents. The crossover scaling behavior is confirmed by extensive\nnumerical calculations of the MFPTs on the critical percolation cluster in two\ndimensional square lattices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 15:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

Thus, if one\nwishes to localize the quantum information within a spatially separated\nentangled state, one must enact an entanglement extraction protocol also\ndefined with respect to that external frame. Entanglement extraction for\nGaussian ground states in such an external frame construction has been shown to\nrequire a minimum energy and is hence an interesting process for gravitational\nphysics, where examinations of localization vs. energy cost have a long\nhistory. General covariance however, precludes dependence on external frames.\nIn order to enact an extraction protocol in a generally covariant theory,\ndependence on the external reference frame must first be removed and the states\nmade relational. We examine the implementation of an extraction protocol for\nGaussian states, who's center-of-mass and relational degrees of freedom are\nentangled, in a relational toy model where translation invariance stands in for\nfull diffeomorphism invariance. Constructing fully relational states and the\ncorresponding extraction/localization can, in principle, be done in two ways.\nExternal frame position information can be removed through $G$-twirling over\ntranslations or one can spontaneously break the translation symmetry via the\ngradient of an auxiliary field, or $Z$-model. We determine the energetics of\nquantum information localization after the states have been made fully\nrelational via both the $G$-twirl and $Z$-model.

This study presents the generalized formula in\ncompact form that contains the subdivision rules of (3n-1)-point quaternary\napproximating subdivision scheme which are based on the predefined 2n-points\nbinary approximating subdivision scheme. Firstly, we derive a relation between\nthe quaternary approximating subdivision scheme and the even-point binary\napproximating subdivision scheme. By using this relation, we next derive two\ntypes of generalized quaternary approximating subdivision scheme that are based\non the even and odd values of n. Then we apply these generalized formulas on\nthe known binary schemes for specific values of $n$. This gives us the\ncorresponding quaternary approximating subdivision schemes. We also analyze\nsome of the well-known features of binary and its corresponding quaternary\napproximating subdivision schemes.

The frequency of K-mers is used for estimating the\nparameters of DNA assembly, error correction, etc. The process also provides a\nlist of district K-mers which assist in searching large databases and reducing\nthe size of de Bruijn graphs. Nonetheless, K-mer counting is a data and\ncompute-intensive process. Hence, it is crucial to implement a lightweight data\nstructure that occupies low memory but does fast processing of K-mers. We\nproposed a lightweight K-mer counting technique, called KmerCo that implements\na potent counting Bloom Filter variant, called countBF. KmerCo has two phases:\ninsertion and classification. The insertion phase inserts all K-mers into\ncountBF and determines distinct K-mers. The classification phase is responsible\nfor the classification of distinct K-mers into trustworthy and erroneous K-mers\nbased on a user-provided threshold value. We also proposed a novel benchmark\nperformance metric. We used the Hadoop MapReduce program to determine the\nfrequency of K-mers. We have conducted rigorous experiments to prove the\ndominion of KmerCo compared to state-of-the-art K-mer counting techniques. The\nexperiments are conducted using DNA sequences of four organisms. The datasets\nare pruned to generate four different size datasets. KmerCo is compared with\nSqueakr, BFCounter, and Jellyfish. KmerCo took the lowest memory, highest\nnumber of insertions per second, and a positive trustworthy rate as compared\nwith the three above-mentioned methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 10:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}
