Different from the detection of\nordinary objects with pre-definable classes, detecting unexpected obstacles on\nthe road cannot be resolved by upscaling the sensor technology alone (e.g.,\nhigh resolution video imagers / radar antennas, denser LiDAR scan lines). This\nis due to the fact, that there is a wide variety in the types of unexpected\nobstacles that also do not share a common appearance (e.g., lost cargo as a\nsuitcase or bicycle, tire fragments, a tree stem). Also adding object classes\nor adding \\enquote{all} of these objects to a common \\enquote{unexpected\nobstacle} class does not scale. In this contribution, we study the feasibility\nof using a deep learning video-based lane corridor (called \\enquote{AI\nego-corridor}) to ease the challenge by inverting the problem: Instead of\ndetecting a previously unseen object, the AI ego-corridor detects that the\nego-lane ahead ends. A smart ground-truth definition enables an easy\nfeature-based classification of an abrupt end of the ego-lane. We propose two\nneural network designs and research among other things the potential of\ntraining with synthetic data. We evaluate our approach on a test vehicle\nplatform. It is shown that the approach is able to detect numerous previously\nunseen obstacles at a distance of up to 300 m with a detection rate of 95 %.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 16:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 21:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

By\nenforcing identical topology as the ground truth, the topological constraint\ncan effectively resolve topological errors, while Focal Loss tackles class\nimbalance. We begin by constructing persistence diagrams from filtered cubical\ncomplexes of the ground truth and predicted segmentation masks. We subsequently\nutilize the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to determine the optimal transport plan\nbetween the two persistence diagrams. The resultant transport plan minimizes\nthe cost of transporting mass from one distribution to the other and provides a\nmapping between the points in the two persistence diagrams.

However, most HGNNs follow a semi-supervised learning manner, which\nnotably limits their wide use in reality since labels are usually scarce in\nreal applications. Recently, contrastive learning, a self-supervised method,\nbecomes one of the most exciting learning paradigms and shows great potential\nwhen there are no labels. In this paper, we study the problem of\nself-supervised HGNNs and propose a novel co-contrastive learning mechanism for\nHGNNs, named HeCo. Different from traditional contrastive learning which only\nfocuses on contrasting positive and negative samples, HeCo employs cross-view\ncontrastive mechanism. Specifically, two views of a HIN (network schema and\nmeta-path views) are proposed to learn node embeddings, so as to capture both\nof local and high-order structures simultaneously. Then the cross-view\ncontrastive learning, as well as a view mask mechanism, is proposed, which is\nable to extract the positive and negative embeddings from two views. This\nenables the two views to collaboratively supervise each other and finally learn\nhigh-level node embeddings. Moreover, to further boost the performance of HeCo,\ntwo additional methods are designed to generate harder negative samples with\nhigh quality. Besides the invariant factors, view-specific factors\ncomplementally provide the diverse structure information between different\nnodes, which also should be contained into the final embeddings. Therefore, we\nneed to further explore each view independently and propose a modified model,\ncalled HeCo++. Specifically, HeCo++ conducts hierarchical contrastive learning,\nincluding cross-view and intra-view contrasts, which aims to enhance the mining\nof respective structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 16:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Our results are also compatible and\ncomplementary to those obtained using neutrino beams from accelerators, which\nare obtained at lower neutrino energies and are subject to different sources of\nuncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 16:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

AssemblyHands provides 3.0M annotated\nimages, including 490K egocentric images, making it the largest existing\nbenchmark dataset for egocentric 3D hand pose estimation. Using this data, we\ndevelop a strong single-view baseline of 3D hand pose estimation from\negocentric images. Furthermore, we design a novel action classification task to\nevaluate predicted 3D hand poses. Our study shows that having higher-quality\nhand poses directly improves the ability to recognize actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 17:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Transfer\nlearning is an effective solution for training with few labels, however often\nat the expense of a computationally costly fine-tuning of large base models. We\npropose to mitigate this unpleasant trade-off between compute and accuracy via\nsemi-supervised cross-domain distillation from a set of diverse source models.\nInitially, we show how to use task similarity metrics to select a single\nsuitable source model to distill from, and that a good selection process is\nimperative for good downstream performance of a target model.

To\nalleviate this, we propose a weighted multi-source distillation method to\ndistill multiple source models trained on different domains weighted by their\nrelevance for the target task into a single efficient model (named\nDistillWeighted).

The\npredictions of current micro-physical models of CR transport in\nmagneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence are drastically different from what is\nobserved. These models of transport usually focus on MHD turbulence in the\npresence of a strong guide field and ignore the impact of turbulent\nintermittency on particle propagation. This motivates our studying the\nalternative regime of large-amplitude turbulence with $\\delta B/B_0 \\gg 1$, in\nwhich intermittent small-scale magnetic field reversals are ubiquitous. We\nstudy particle transport in such turbulence by integrating trajectories in\nstationary snapshots. To quantify spatial diffusion, we use a setup with\ncontinuous particle injection and escape, which we term the turbulent leaky\nbox. We find that particle transport is very different from the\nstrong-guide-field case. Low-energy particles are better confined than\nhigh-energy particles, despite less efficient pitch-angle diffusion at small\nenergies. In the limit of weak guide field, energy-dependent confinement is\ndriven by the energy-dependent (in)ability to follow reversing magnetic field\nlines exactly and by the scattering in regions of ``resonant curvature\", where\nthe field line bends on a scale that is of order the local particle\ngyro-radius. We derive a heuristic model of particle transport in magnetic\nfolds that approximately reproduces the energy dependence of transport found in\nthe leaky-box experiments. We speculate that CR propagation in the Galaxy is\nregulated by the intermittent field reversals highlighted here and discuss the\nimplications of our findings for the transport of CRs in the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Dark matter that is thermally produced during an\nera of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to\ngenerate the observed dark matter relic abundance. Furthermore, dark matter\ndensity perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow\nlinearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the\nresulting enhancement to the small-scale matter power spectrum increases the\nmicrohalo abundance and boosts the dark matter annihilation rate. We then use\ngamma-ray observations to constrain thermal dark matter production during\nkination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which\nis determined by the small-scale cutoff in the matter power spectrum.\nTherefore, observational limits on the dark matter annihilation rate imply a\nminimum cutoff scale for a given dark matter particle mass and kination\nscenario. For dark matter that was once in thermal equilibrium with the\nStandard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic\ndecoupling temperature for the dark matter. This bound on the decoupling\ntemperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot\nappreciably boost the dark matter annihilation rate if dark matter was once in\nthermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

In our\nfirst epoch we measure continuum polarization as high as 6%, making SN 2017hcc\nthe most intrinsically polarized SN ever reported. During the first 29 days of\ncoverage, when the polarization is strongest, the continuum polarization has a\nwavelength dependence that rises toward blue wavelengths, and becomes\nwavelength independent by day 45. The polarization strength drops rapidly\nduring the first month, even as the SN flux is still climbing to peak\nbrightness. Nonetheless, record-high polarization is maintained until day 68,\nat which point the source polarization declines to 1.9%, comparable to peak\nlevels in previous well-studied SNe IIn. Thereafter the SN continues in\npolarization decline, while exhibiting only minor changes in position angle on\nthe sky. The blue slope of the polarized continuum during the first month,\naccompanied by short-lived polarized flux for Balmer emission, suggests that an\naspherical distribution of dust grains in pre-shock circumstellar material\n(CSM) is echoing the SN IIn spectrum and strongly influencing the polarization,\nwhile the subsequent decline during the wavelength-independent phase appears\nbroadly consistent with electron scattering near the SN/CSM interface. The\npersistence of the polarization position angle between these two phases\nsuggests that the pre-existing CSM responsible for the dust scattering at early\ntimes is part of the same geometric structure as the electron-scattering region\nthat dominates the polarization at later times. SN2017hcc appears to be yet\nanother, but much more extreme, case of aspherical yet well-ordered CSM in Type\nIIn SNe, possibly resulting from pre-SN mass loss shaped by a binary progenitor\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 18:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Current research has established magnetised disc winds as a\npromising way of driving accretion in protoplanetary discs. Aims. We\ninvestigate the evolution of large protoplanetary disc populations under the\ninfluence of magnetically driven disc winds as well as internal and external\nphotoevaporation. We aim to constrain magnetic disc wind models through\ncomparisons with observations. Methods. We ran 1D vertically integrated\nevolutionary simulations for low-viscosity discs, including magnetic braking\nand various outflows. The initial conditions were varied and chosen to produce\npopulations that are representative of actual disc populations inferred from\nobservations. We then compared the observables from the simulations (e.g.\nstellar accretion rate, disc mass evolution, disc lifetime, etc.) with\nobservational data. Results. Our simulations show that to reach stellar\naccretion rates comparable to those found by observations $\\sim\n10^{-8}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot / \\mathrm{yr}$, it is necessary to have access not only\nto strong magnetic torques, but weak magnetic winds as well. The presence of a\nstrong magnetic disc wind, in combination with internal photoevaporation, leads\nto the rapid opening of an inner cavity early on, allowing the stellar\naccretion rate to drop while the disc is still massive. Furthermore, our model\nsupports the notion that external photoevaporation via the ambient\nfar-ultraviolet radiation of surrounding stars is a driving force in disc\nevolution and could potentially exert a strong influence on planetary\nformation. Conclusions. Our disc population syntheses show that for a subset of\nmagnetohydrodynamic wind models (weak disc wind, strong torque), it is possible\nto reproduce important statistical observational constraints.

Unlike existing work that focuses on\nconverting point clouds to other representations--e.g., surfaces or implicit\nfunctions--our key idea is to directly infer the intersection of a light ray\nwith the underlying surface represented by the given point cloud.

In making a dose transition decision, a\nkey scientific question is whether the true DLT rate of the current dose\nexceeds the target DLT rate, and the statistical question is how to evaluate\nthe statistical evidence in the available DLT data with respect to that\nscientific question. In this article, I propose to use generalized likelihood\nratios (GLRs) to measure statistical evidence and support dose transition\ndecisions. This leads to a GLR-based interval design with three parameters: the\ntarget DLT rate and two GLR cut-points representing the levels of evidence\nrequired for dose escalation and de-escalation. The GLR-based design gives a\nlikelihood interpretation to each existing interval design and provides a\nunified framework for comparing different interval designs in terms of how much\nevidence is required for escalation and de-escalation. A GLR-based comparison\nof four popular interval designs reveals that the BOIN and TEQR designs require\nsimilar amounts of evidence for escalation and de-escalation, while the mTPI\nand i3+3 designs require more evidence for de-escalation than for escalation.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the last two designs tend to produce higher\nproportions of over-treated patients than the first two. These observations\nmotivate the consideration of GLR-based designs that require more evidence for\nescalation than for de-escalation. Such designs are shown to reduce the\nproportion of over-treated patients while maintaining the same accuracy of dose\nselection, as compared to the four popular interval designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 18:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Some areas\nare very uniform, e.g., large patches of blue sky, while other areas are\nscattered with many small objects.

Intuitively, retaining more pixels\nrepresenting small objects during downsampling helps to preserve important\ninformation. To achieve this, we propose AutoFocusFormer (AFF), a\nlocal-attention transformer image recognition backbone, which performs adaptive\ndownsampling by learning to retain the most important pixels for the task.\nSince adaptive downsampling generates a set of pixels irregularly distributed\non the image plane, we abandon the classic grid structure. Instead, we develop\na novel point-based local attention block, facilitated by a balanced clustering\nmodule and a learnable neighborhood merging module, which yields\nrepresentations for our point-based versions of state-of-the-art segmentation\nheads.

AICA is a software agent that resides on a\nsystem, and is responsible for defending the system from cyber compromises and\nenabling the response and recovery of the system, usually autonomously. The\nautonomy of the agent is a necessity because of the growing scarcity of human\ncyber-experts who could defend systems, either remotely or onsite, and because\nsophisticated malware could degrade or spoof the communications of a system\nthat uses a remote monitoring center. An AICA Reference Architecture has been\nproposed and defines five main functions: (1) sensing and world state\nidentification, (2) planning and action selection, (3) collaboration and\nnegotiation, (4) action execution and (5) learning and knowledge improvement.\nThe chapter reviews the details of AICA's environment, functions and\noperations. As AICA is intended to make changes within its environment, there\nis a risk that an agent's action could harm a friendly computer. This risk must\nbe balanced against the losses that could occur if the agent does not act.

This difficulty is reinforced when natural disturbances\nexhibit similar output patterns as a faulty setting does. The conventional\nsolution of installing more relays to obtain additional measurements is costly\nand also increases the complexity of the system. In this paper, we propose\ndiagnosis schemes based on optimization-based fault detection filters with the\noutput current as the only measurement. Modeling the microgrid dynamics and the\ndiagnosis filter, we formulate the filter design as a linear programming (LP)\nproblem that accounts for decoupling a class of disturbances and ensuring fault\nsensitivity simultaneously. Next, we robustify the filter to disturbances that\ncannot be fully decoupled. To this end, we leverage tools from the existing\nliterature and extend the optimization program to a quadratic programming (QP)\nproblem in which the filter is trained for this class of disturbances.

The\ncontroller's objective is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the value of\nthe expected system given a priori knowledge of the agents' dropout\nprobabilities. Finding an optimal policy for any specific dropout realization\nis a special case of this problem. For MDPs with a certain transition\nindependence and reward separability structure, we assume that removing agents\nfrom the system forms a new MDP comprised of the remaining agents with new\nstate and action spaces, transition dynamics that marginalize the removed\nagents, and rewards that are independent of the removed agents. We first show\nthat under these assumptions, the value of the expected post-dropout system can\nbe represented by a single MDP; this \"robust MDP\" eliminates the need to\nevaluate all $2^N$ realizations of the system, where $N$ denotes the number of\nagents. More significantly, in a model-free context, it is shown that the\nrobust MDP value can be estimated with samples generated by the pre-dropout\nsystem, meaning that robust policies can be found before dropout occurs. This\nfact is used to propose a policy importance sampling (IS) routine that performs\npolicy evaluation for dropout scenarios while controlling the existing system\nwith good pre-dropout policies. The policy IS routine produces value estimates\nfor both the robust MDP and specific post-dropout system realizations and is\njustified with exponential confidence bounds. Finally, the utility of this\napproach is verified in simulation, showing how structural properties of agent\ndropout can help a controller find good post-dropout policies before dropout\noccurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 21:29:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Yet, despite\ndecades of method development to quantify solid-liquid friction using molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations, an accurate and widely applicable method is still\nmissing. Here, we propose a method to quantify the solid-liquid friction\ncoefficient (FC) from equilibrium MD simulations of a liquid confined between\nparallel solid walls. In this method, the FC is evaluated by fitting the\nGreen-Kubo (GK) integral of the S-L shear force autocorrelation for the range\nof time scales where the GK integral slowly decays with time. The fitting\nfunction was derived based on the analytical solution considering the\nhydrodynamic equations in our previous work [H. Oga et al., Phys. Rev. Research\n3, L032019 (2021)], assuming that the timescales related to the friction kernel\nand to the bulk viscous dissipation can be separated. By comparing the results\nwith those of other equilibrium MD-based methods and those of non-equilibrium\nMD for a Lennard-Jones liquid between flat crystalline walls with different\nwettability, we show that the FC is extracted with excellent accuracy by the\npresent method, even in wettability regimes where other methods become\ninnacurate. We then show that the method is also applicable to grooved solid\nwalls, for which the GK integral displays a complex behavior at short times.\nOverall, the present method extracts efficiently the FC for various systems,\nwith easy implementation and low computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 21:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

The GFM flood extent is an ensemble product\nbased on a combination of three independently developed flood mapping\nalgorithms that individually derive the flood information from Sentinel-1 data.\nEach flood algorithm also provides classification uncertainty information that\nis aggregated into the GFM ensemble likelihood product as the mean of the\nindividual classification likelihoods. As the flood detection algorithms derive\nuncertainty information with different methods, the value range of the three\ninput likelihoods must be harmonized to a range from low [0] to high [100]\nflood likelihood. The ensemble likelihood is evaluated on two test sites in\nMyanmar and Somalia, showcasing the performance during an actual flood event\nand an area with challenging conditions for SAR-based flood detection. The\nMyanmar use case demonstrates the robustness if flood detections in the\nensemble step disagree and how that information is communicated to the\nend-user.

In this context, robust evaluations of the heterogeneous health\nimpacts of air pollution regulations are key to justifying and designing\nmaximally protective future interventions. Such evaluations are complicated by\ntwo key issues: 1) much of air pollution regulatory policy is focused on\nintervening on large emissions generators while resulting health impacts are\nmeasured in exposed populations; 2) due to air pollution transport, an\nintervention on one emissions generator can impact geographically distant\ncommunities. In causal inference, such a scenario has been described as that of\nbipartite network interference (BNI).

In order to handle the large amounts of network data based on digital\ntwins (DTs), wireless systems can exploit the paradigm of semantic\ncommunication (SC) for facilitating informed decision-making under strict\ncommunication constraints by utilizing AI techniques such as causal reasoning.\nIn this paper, a novel framework called causal semantic communication (CSC) is\nproposed for DT-based wireless systems. The CSC system is posed as an imitation\nlearning (IL) problem, where the transmitter, with access to optimal network\ncontrol policies using a DT, teaches the receiver using SC over a bandwidth\nlimited wireless channel how to improve its knowledge to perform optimal\ncontrol actions. The causal structure in the source data is extracted using\nnovel approaches from the framework of deep end-to-end causal inference,\nthereby enabling the creation of a semantic representation that is causally\ninvariant, which in turn helps generalize the learned knowledge of the system\nto unseen scenarios. The CSC decoder at the receiver is designed to extract and\nestimate semantic information while ensuring high semantic reliability. The\nreceiver control policies, semantic decoder, and causal inference are\nformulated as a bi-level optimization problem within a variational inference\nframework. This problem is solved using a novel concept called network state\nmodels, inspired from world models in generative AI, that faithfully represents\nthe environment dynamics leading to data generation.

Controlling these phenomena is highly desirable, but difficult since\nextrinsic factors, such as the surface termination by adsorbed species, can\ndeeply affect the reactivity of diamond and its resistance to wear. In this\nwork, we investigate the effects of diamond oxidation by massive ab initio\nmolecular dynamics simulations of silica sliding against diamond surfaces\nconsidering different surface orientations, O-coverages, and tribological\nconditions. Our findings reveal a dual role of oxygen that depends on coverage.\nAt full coverage, the adsorbed oxygen is very effective in friction and wear\nreduction because the repulsion with the silica counter-surface prevents the\nformation of chemical bonds across the interface. At reduced coverage and high\npressure, Si-O-C bonds are anyway established. In this situation the presence\nof oxygen results detrimental as it weakens the surface C-C bonds making the\nsurface more vulnerable to wear. Indeed we observed atomic wear on the C(110)\nsurface at 50% O-coverage under harsh tribological conditions. The mechanisms\nof friction reduction and atomistic wear are explained through the analysis of\nthe electronic properties and surface-surface interactions.

Common data augmentation techniques fall short in this context due to\nthe limited features contained in the few-shot tuning data. To tackle this\nchallenge, we first identify an opportunity for FViTs in few-shot tuning:\npretrained FViTs themselves have already learned highly representative features\nfrom large-scale pretraining data, which are fully preserved during widely used\nparameter-efficient tuning. We thus hypothesize that leveraging those learned\nfeatures to augment the tuning data can boost the effectiveness of few-shot\nFViT tuning. To this end, we propose a framework called Hint-based Data\nAugmentation (Hint-Aug), which aims to boost FViT in few-shot tuning by\naugmenting the over-fitted parts of tuning samples with the learned features of\npretrained FViTs. Specifically, Hint-Aug integrates two key enablers: (1) an\nAttentive Over-fitting Detector (AOD) to detect over-confident patches of\nfoundation ViTs for potentially alleviating their over-fitting on the few-shot\ntuning data and (2) a Confusion-based Feature Infusion (CFI) module to infuse\neasy-to-confuse features from the pretrained FViTs with the over-confident\npatches detected by the above AOD in order to enhance the feature diversity\nduring tuning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on five datasets and\nthree parameter-efficient tuning techniques consistently validate Hint-Aug's\neffectiveness: 0.04% ~ 32.91% higher accuracy over the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\ndata augmentation method under various low-shot settings.

Furthermore, the loss\nfunction of PI-INN includes two components: a residual-based physics-informed\nloss term and a new independence loss term. The presented independence loss\nterm can Gaussianize the random latent variables and ensure statistical\nindependence between two parts of INN output by effectively utilizing the\nestimated density function. Several numerical experiments are presented to\ndemonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed PI-INN, including\ninverse kinematics, inverse problems of the 1-d and 2-d diffusion equations,\nand seismic traveltime tomography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 03:17:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 12:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

With a constant flow speed, a\nprescribed high inertia and a small structural damping, we show that the system\nundergoes a subcritical Hopf bifurcation to large-amplitude limit-cycle\noscillations (LCOs) for all the sweep angles. The onset of LCOs depends largely\non the static characteristics of the wing.

By\ncomparing the model's outcomes with more than 20,000 opinions from people\nliving in different countries, the model can infer the weight of\ningroup-coherence needed to match each other. We found a strong correspondence\nbetween the presence of this mechanism and the political content of the\nanswers. This work helps us understand the role of ingroup-coherence favoritism\nin political opinion formation and sheds light on the importance of combining\nefforts from experimental approaches, theoretical modeling, and large-scale\nempirical studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 04:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

While\nO-RAN harbors the potential to revolutionize cellular access networks, the\nabsence of an open platform for use case prototyping has served as an\nimpediment to its widespread adoption. The situation is further compounded by\nthe fact that O-RAN's flagship use case, network slicing, presents a rigid\ndichotomy. On the one hand, systems research in the slicing domain is largely\ncentered around LTE, while, on the other hand, 3GPP slicing specifications\nexclusively cater to 5G Standalone (SA). From a practical standpoint, most\ncommercial networks today use a mix of 4G, 5G NSA (Non-standalone), and 5G SA,\nnecessitating the need for solutions across all radio access technologies\n(RATs). With a view to addressing these challenges, this paper introduces\nHexRAN, a first of its kind purpose-built multi-RAT O-RAN compliant access\nnetwork. Key highlights of HexRAN include support for LTE, 5G NSA, and 5G SA\nwith full disaggregation, a novel Programmable Protocol-level API repository, a\nmulti-RAT RAN slicing framework, a modular and extensible E2 Agent, and a new\nO-RAN service model in support of slicing. Furthermore, the paper also includes\na comprehensive system evaluation addressing the key themes of scalability and\ndisaggregation, the slicing framework's impact, and system performance. The\nresults thus obtained showcase that not only is HexRAN the most\nfeature-complete RAN platform to date, it also offers a significant performance\nadvantage over the prior art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 04:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Re-ranking, a popular post-processing practice, has revealed the\nsuperiority of capturing neighbor relations in single-modality retrieval tasks.\nHowever, it is ineffective to directly extend existing re-ranking algorithms to\nimage-text retrieval.

To\ntackle this degeneracy problem, we propose a robust LiDAR inertial odometry\ncalled \\textit{AdaLIO}, which employs an adaptive parameter setting strategy.\nTo this end, we first check the degeneracy by checking whether the surroundings\nare corridor-like environments.

We find that transformer-based models\ngenerally are easier to converge during the training process and have higher\naccuracy, but usually exhibit more memory consumption and low processing\nefficiency. Among nine models, SwinUNet outperforms the other two transformers\nand shows the highest accuracy among nine models.

Due to the lack of boundary\ninformation during training, existing approaches formulate WTAL as a\nclassificationproblem, i.e., generating the temporal class activation map\n(T-CAM) for localization. However, with only classification loss, the model\nwould be sub-optimized, i.e., the action-related scenes are enough to\ndistinguish different class labels. Regarding other actions in the\naction-related scene ( i.e., the scene same as positive actions) as co-scene\nactions, this sub-optimized model would misclassify the co-scene actions as\npositive actions. To address this misclassification, we propose a simple yet\nefficient method, named bidirectional semantic consistency constraint (Bi-SCC),\nto discriminate the positive actions from co-scene actions. The proposed Bi-SCC\nfirstly adopts a temporal context augmentation to generate an augmented video\nthat breaks the correlation between positive actions and their co-scene actions\nin the inter-video; Then, a semantic consistency constraint (SCC) is used to\nenforce the predictions of the original video and augmented video to be\nconsistent, hence suppressing the co-scene actions. However, we find that this\naugmented video would destroy the original temporal context. Simply applying\nthe consistency constraint would affect the completeness of localized positive\nactions. Hence, we boost the SCC in a bidirectional way to suppress co-scene\nactions while ensuring the integrity of positive actions, by cross-supervising\nthe original and augmented videos. Finally, our proposed Bi-SCC can be applied\nto current WTAL approaches, and improve their performance.

Our extensive experiments prove the proposed model\nhas a better performance compare to the state-of-the-art ConvLSTM model for air\npollution predicting while the number of parameters is much smaller.

The introduction of mean\nfield theory has enhanced the scalability of multi-agent reinforcement learning\nin recent years. This paper considers partially observable multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL), where each agent can only observe other agents\nwithin a fixed range. This partial observability affects the agent's ability to\nassess the quality of the actions of surrounding agents. This paper focuses on\ndeveloping a method to capture more effective information from local\nobservations in order to select more effective actions. Previous work in this\nfield employs probability distributions or weighted mean field to update the\naverage actions of neighborhood agents, but it does not fully consider the\nfeature information of surrounding neighbors and leads to a local optimum. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm,\nPartially Observable Mean Field Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning based on\nGraph--Attention (GAMFQ) to remedy this flaw. GAMFQ uses a graph attention\nmodule and a mean field module to describe how an agent is influenced by the\nactions of other agents at each time step. This graph attention module consists\nof a graph attention encoder and a differentiable attention mechanism, and this\nmechanism outputs a dynamic graph to represent the effectiveness of\nneighborhood agents against central agents. The mean--field module approximates\nthe effect of a neighborhood agent on a central agent as the average effect of\neffective neighborhood agents. We evaluate GAMFQ on three challenging tasks in\nthe MAgents framework. Experiments show that GAMFQ outperforms baselines\nincluding the state-of-the-art partially observable mean-field reinforcement\nlearning algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 08:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

Splitting continuous speech into\nshorter segments, known as speech segmentation, plays an important role in ST.\nRecent segmentation methods trained to mimic the segmentation of ST corpora\nhave surpassed traditional approaches. Tsiamas et al. proposed a segmentation\nframe classifier (SFC) based on a pre-trained speech encoder called wav2vec\n2.0. Their method, named SHAS, retains 95-98% of the BLEU score for ST corpus\nsegmentation. However, the segments generated by SHAS are very different from\nST corpus segmentation and tend to be longer with multiple combined utterances.\nThis is due to SHAS's reliance on length heuristics, i.e., it splits speech\ninto segments of easily translatable length without fully considering the\npotential for ST improvement by splitting them into even shorter segments.\nLonger segments often degrade translation quality and ST's time efficiency. In\nthis study, we extended SHAS to improve ST translation accuracy and efficiency\nby splitting speech into shorter segments that correspond to sentences.

A\nmalicious user is able to both exclude and include desired features when\nmultiple counterfactual explanations are available. This disagreement seems to\nbe driven mainly by the dataset characteristics and the type of counterfactual\nalgorithm. XAI centers on the transparency of algorithmic decision-making, but\nour analysis advocates for transparency about this self-proclaimed transparency\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 09:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

In\nparticular, we provide a comprehensive data base to explore Twitter usage in\nMali, a west African country that until recently has had a relatively\nprecarious media ecology. Mali has since 2012 been affected by an intersection\nof armed conflicts, often between different ethnic and religious groups. We\ncollected the database in 2022, in a period when the Malian conflict became\nmore violent, both internally and towards external, international actors. We\nassume that this context influences the ways in which people access social\nmedia, and therefore the shape of the Twittersphere and its characteristics.\nHence our aim is to primarily invite researchers from various disciplines\nincluding complex networks and social sciences scholars to further explore\nthese characteristics. The given snapshot of the Malian Twitter follower\nnetwork, contains 7M accounts with 56K accounts clearly identifiable as Malian,\na figure that coincides with official numbers.

This paper describes a specification-based approach to guide the design\nof test inputs (both the test database and the user inputs) for a database\napplication and to automatically evaluate the test adequacy. First, the system\nspecification of the application is modelled: (1) the structure of the database\nand the user interface are represented in a single model, called Integrated\nData Model (IDM), (2) the functional requirements are expressed as a set of\nbusiness rules, written in terms of the IDM. Then, a MCDC-based criterion is\napplied over the business rules to automatically derive the situations of\ninterest to be tested (test requirements), which guide the design of the test\ninputs. Finally, the adequacy of these test inputs is automatically evaluated\nto determine whether the test requirements are covered. The approach has been\napplied to the TPC-C benchmark. The results show that it allows designing test\ncases that are able to detect interesting faults which were located in the\nprocedural code of the implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 09:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

An important class of examples is\nquantum network protocols that require a certain number of entangled pairs.\nHere, we consider a setting in which a process generates a quantum resource\nstate with some probability $p$ in each time step, and stores it in a quantum\nmemory that is subject to time-dependent noise. To maintain sufficient quality\nfor an application, each resource state is discarded from the memory after $w$\ntime steps. Let $s$ be the number of desired resource states required by a\nprotocol. We characterise the probability distribution $X_{(w,s)}$ of the ages\nof the quantum resource states, once $s$ states have been generated in a window\n$w$. Combined with a time-dependent noise model, the knowledge of this\ndistribution allows for the calculation of fidelity statistics of the $s$\nquantum resources. We also give exact solutions for the first and second\nmoments of the waiting time $\\tau_{(w,s)}$ until $s$ resources are produced\nwithin a window $w$, which provides information about the rate of the protocol.\nSince it is difficult to obtain general closed-form expressions for statistical\nquantities describing the expected waiting time $\\mathbb{E}(\\tau_{(w,s)})$ and\nthe distribution $X_{(w,s)}$, we present two novel results that aid their\ncomputation in certain parameter regimes.

This is achieved by randomly\nperturbing the statistics to be published, which in turn leads to a\nprivacy-accuracy trade-off: larger perturbations provide stronger privacy\nguarantees, but they result in less accurate statistics that offer lower\nutility to the recipients. Of particular interest are therefore optimal\nmechanisms that provide the highest accuracy for a pre-selected level of\nprivacy. To date, work in this area has focused on specifying families of\nperturbations a priori and subsequently proving their asymptotic and/or\nbest-in-class optimality. In this paper, we develop a class of mechanisms that\nenjoy non-asymptotic and unconditional optimality guarantees.

These\ncomplications can be reduced through early application of antibiotics, hence\nthe ability to anticipate the onset of sepsis early is crucial to the survival\nand well-being of patients. Current machine learning algorithms deployed inside\nmedical infrastructures have demonstrated poor performance and are insufficient\nfor anticipating sepsis onset early. In recent years, deep learning\nmethodologies have been proposed to predict sepsis, but some fail to capture\nthe time of onset (e.g., classifying patients' entire visits as developing\nsepsis or not) and others are unrealistic to be deployed into medical\nfacilities (e.g., creating training instances using a fixed time to onset where\nthe time of onset needs to be known apriori). Therefore, in this paper, we\nfirst propose a novel but realistic prediction framework that predicts each\nmorning whether sepsis onset will occur within the next 24 hours using data\ncollected at night, when patient-provider ratios are higher due to\ncross-coverage resulting in limited observation to each patient. However, as we\nincrease the prediction rate into daily, the number of negative instances will\nincrease while that of positive ones remain the same. Thereafter, we have a\nsevere class imbalance problem, making a machine learning model hard to capture\nrare sepsis cases. To address this problem, we propose to do nightly profile\nrepresentation learning (NPRL) for each patient. We prove that NPRL can\ntheoretically alleviate the rare event problem. Our empirical study using data\nfrom a level-1 trauma center further demonstrates the effectiveness of our\nproposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 11:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

For example, a variable may get assigned a wrong value, which then\nnegatively influences the remaining computation. Once a developer identifies\nsuch a divergence, how to fix the code so that it provides the desired\nbehavior? This paper presents TraceFixer, a technique for predicting how to\nedit source code so that it does not diverge from the expected behavior\nanymore. The key idea is to train a neural program repair model that not only\nlearns from source code edits but also exploits excerpts of runtime traces. The\ninput to the model is a partial execution trace of the incorrect code, which\ncan be obtained automatically through code instrumentation, and the correct\nstate that the program should reach at the divergence point, which the user\nprovides, e.g., in an interactive debugger. Our approach fundamentally differs\nfrom current program repair techniques, which share a similar goal but exploit\nneither execution traces nor information about the desired program state.

After training the\nmodel on hundreds of thousands of code edits created by a neural model that\nmimics real-world bugs, we find that exploiting execution traces improves the\nbug-fixing ability by 13% to 20% (depending on the dataset, within the top-10\npredictions) compared to a baseline that learns from source code edits only.\nApplying TraceFixer to 20 real-world Python bugs shows that the approach\nsuccessfully fixes 10 of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 11:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

We utilize N-body simulations\nincluding pebble and gas accretion as well as planetary migration to\ninvestigate how the gas accretion rates influence the formation of systems of\ninner sub-Neptunes and outer gas giants as well as the eccentricity\ndistribution of the outer giant planets. Less efficient envelope contraction\nrates allow a more efficient formation of systems with inner sub-Neptunes and\nouter giants. This is caused by the fact that the cores formed in the inner\ndisc are too small to accrete large envelopes and only cores growing in the\nouter disc can become giants. As a result, instabilities between the outer\ngiant planets do not necessarily destroy the inner systems of sub-Neptunes\nunlike simulations where giant planets can form closer in. Our simulations show\nthat up to 50% of the systems of cold Jupiters could have inner sub-Neptunes,\nin agreement with observations. Our simulations show a good agreement with the\neccentricity distribution of giants, even though we find a slight mismatch to\nthe mass and semi-major axes distributions. Synthetic transit observations of\nthe inner systems (r<0.7 AU) reveal an excellent match to the Kepler\nobservations, where our simulations match the period ratios of adjacent planet\npairs. Thus, the breaking the chains model for super-Earth and sub-Neptune\nformation remains consistent with observations even when outer giant planets\nare present. However, simulations with outer giant planets produce more systems\nwith mostly only one inner planet and with larger eccentricities, in contrast\nto simulations without outer giants.

Sensors are able to detect objects in the\nsurrounding environment and information such as their current location is\nexchanged among vehicles. In order to cope with the vehicles' mobility, such\ninformation is required to be as fresh as possible for proper operation of\ncooperative driving applications. The age of information (AoI) has been\nproposed as a metric for evaluating freshness of information; recently also\nwithin the context of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). We investigate\nmechanisms to reduce the AoI of data transported in form of beacon messages\nwhile controlling their emission rate.

As\nan example, we characterize such importance using the orientation and the\ndistance of the involved vehicles.

We present an Adaptive Stimuli Algorithm that is robust to\ncompeting waves of messages as multiple stimuli change, possibly adversarially.\nMoreover, in addition to handling arbitrary stimulus dynamics, the algorithm\ncan handle agents reconfiguring the connections (edges) of the graph over time\nin a controlled way.\n  As an application, we show how this Adaptive Stimuli Algorithm on\nreconfigurable graphs can be used to solve the foraging problem, where food\nsources may be discovered, removed, or shifted at arbitrary times.

This requirement entails distribution system\noperators (DSOs) to optimize restoration to normal operational states\ndynamically. However, these design challenges demand collaborative research\nefforts on sophisticated modeling and simulation approaches. Approach: In the\nESOSEG research project, analyzing the smart grid domain as a\nsoftware-intensive system, we employed a dynamic architecture approach,\nparticularly the FOCUS theory, to model and assure the domains' self-healing\nrequirements. Although some works specify various self-healing systems, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the use of the approach in smart grids is the first work\nto enable a formal specification and verification of self-healing properties in\nsmart grids. Results: As a result, to support the modeling and verification\nprocess, we developed tool support with Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF),\nXtext, and other languages in the EMF ecosystem. The tool includes a grammar or\na meta-model of the DSL, an interface to enable textual and graphical modeling\nof architectural patterns and code transformer engine for verification.\nFurthermore, we evaluated the modeling and verification features of the tool\nsupport with an e-Car charging scenario for modeling adaptive self-healing\nproperties. Futureworks: As an outlook, future works could include\ninvestigation of comprehensive case studies. These, for instance, could be\nfurther particular adaptability scenarios addressing challenges in DSOs.\nAnother interesting aspect could be the evaluation of the modeling approach by\ninvestigating its use with engineers involved in a smart grid design.

The core of our methods is to scale the gradient of\neach actor based on how high the reward (for R-Weighted) or the loss (for\nL-Weighted) is compared to the other actors. During training, each agent\noperates in differently initialized versions of the same environment, which\ngives different gradients from different actors.

For giant planet\nformation this means that a massive core must form within the lifetime of the\ngas disk. The accretion of roughly km-sized planetesimals and the accretion of\nmm-cm sized pebbles are typically discussed separately as the main solid\naccretion mechanisms. We investigate the interplay between the two accretion\nprocesses in a disk containing both pebbles and planetesimals for planet\nformation in general and in the context of giant planet formation specifically.\nThe goal is to disentangle and understand the fundamental interactions that\narise in such hybrid pebble-planetesimal models. We combine a simple model of\npebble formation and accretion with a global model of planet formation which\nconsiders the accretion of planetesimals. We compare synthetic populations of\nplanets formed in disks composed of different amounts of pebbles and 600 meter\nsized planetesimals. On a system-level, we study the formation pathway of giant\nplanets in these disks. We find that, in hybrid disks containing both pebbles\nand planetesimals, the formation of giant planets is strongly suppressed\nwhereas in a pebbles-only or planetesimals-only scenario, giant planets can\nform. We identify the heating associated with the accretion of up to 100 km\nsized planetesimals after the pebble accretion period to delay the runaway gas\naccretion of massive cores. Coupled with strong inward type-I migration acting\non these planets, this results in close-in icy sub-Neptunes originating from\nthe outer disk. We conclude that, in hybrid pebble-planetesimal scenarios, the\nlate accretion of planetesimals is a critical factor in the giant planet\nformation process and that inward migration is more efficient for planets in\nincreasingly pebble dominated disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 13:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

One bit-width reduction method adds auxiliary spins to\ntransform into a bit-width reduced (BWR) Ising model in which the ground states\nare theoretically the same as those of the Ising model before bit-width\nreduction (original Ising model).

Indeed, these\nexceptions may cross the entire software stack (including applications and\nlibraries). Thus, studying the patterns in stack traces can help practitioners\nand researchers understand the causes of exceptions in ML applications and the\nchallenges faced by ML developers. To that end, we mine Stack Overflow (SO) and\nstudy 11,449 stack traces related to seven popular Python ML libraries. First,\nwe observe that ML questions that contain stack traces gain more popularity\nthan questions without stack traces; however, they are less likely to get\naccepted answers.

Quantum annealing involves letting a\nquantum system evolve according to the Schr\\\"odinger equation, with the goal of\nobtaining the optimal solution to an optimization problem through measurements\nof the final state. However, the continuous nature of quantum annealing makes\nanalytical analysis challenging, particularly with regard to the instantaneous\neigenenergies. The adiabatic theorem provides a theoretical result for the\nannealing time required to obtain the optimal solution with high probability,\nwhich is inversely proportional to the square of the minimum spectral gap.\nAvoided level crossings can create exponentially closing gaps, which can lead\nto exponentially long running times for optimization problems.

In particular,\nan explicit numerical example is given of a Heisenberg measurement with a\ncomplete set of common observables that violates Bell's inequality in Minkowski\nspace but, mutatatis mutandis, satisfies it in Hilbert space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 14:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

To improve robustness, the denoising strength in\nReSiDe-S and ReSiDe- M is auto-tuned using the discrepancy principle.\n  RESULTS: Studies I, II, and III compare ReSiDe-S and ReSiDe-M against other\nself-supervised or unsupervised methods using data from T1- and T2-weighted\nbrain MRI, MRXCAT digital perfusion phantom, and first-pass cardiac perfusion,\nrespectively. ReSiDe-S and ReSiDe-M outperform other methods in terms of\nreconstruction signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure\nfor Studies I and II and in terms of expert scoring for Study III.\n  CONCLUSION: A self-supervised image reconstruction method is presented and\nvalidated in both static and dynamic MRI applications. These developments can\nbenefit MRI applications where availability of fully sampled training data is\nlimited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 15:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

The\nLDM is more stable and requires less computation to train than GANs, albeit\nwith more computationally expensive generation. We benchmark it against the\nGAN-based Deep Generative Models of Rainfall (DGMR) and a statistical model,\nPySTEPS. The LDM produces more accurate precipitation predictions, while the\ncomparisons are more mixed when predicting whether the precipitation exceeds\npredefined thresholds. The clearest advantage of the LDM is that it generates\nmore diverse predictions than DGMR or PySTEPS. Rank distribution tests indicate\nthat the distribution of samples from the LDM accurately reflects the\nuncertainty of the predictions.

The\ngame thus captures the tension between resource pooling (to benefit from the\nresulting statistical economies of scale) and competition between coalitions\nover market share.

We introduce a\nmethod for dynamically engineering adiabaticity in the evolution of\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians that allows for both chiral and non-chiral mode\nconversion on the same path. Our method is based on quantifying and controlling\nthe instantaneous adiabaticity, allowing for non-uniform evolution throughout\nthe entire path. By optimizing the evolution based on the distributed nature of\nadiabaticity, we achieve the same quality as conventional quasi-adiabatic\nevolution in only one-third of the time.

We compute the chemical enrichment of Eu occurring in the\nbuilding blocks that have possibly formed the Galactic halo. In this framework,\nthe enrichment from neutron star mergers can be influenced by the dynamics of\nthe binary systems in the gravitational potential of the original host galaxy.\nIn the least massive systems, the neutron stars can merge outside the host\ngalaxy and so only a small fraction of newly produced Eu can be retained by the\nparent galaxy itself.\\\\ Results.

As a\nbaseline case, a flow over a smooth orthoconic model with a blunt cone end is\ninvestigated numerically at Reynolds numbers from 500 to 1500. As Reynolds\nincreases, two different shedding mechanisms - hairpin-vortex wake and\nspiral-vortex wake - are captured. We notice that an introduction of annulation\nover the cone surface changes the critical Reynolds number for the transition\nof the shedding mechanism. The dominant shedding frequency increases with the\nReynolds number for the smooth and annulated cone flows. Moreover, the\nannulation reduces the dominant frequency for the same Reynolds number and\nincreases the time-averaged drag coefficient. Modal decompositions - Proper\nOrthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition\n(SPOD) - are used to capture the coherent structures and their oscillating\nfrequencies. We have captured modes corresponding to the hairpin-vortex wake\nand spiral-vortex wake shedding mechanisms. Comparing the leading POD modes for\nthe smooth and the annulated cone flows, we find that the annulation can reduce\nthe twisting effects of the coherent structures in the wake.

We find that after correcting for likely interstellar\npolarization, SNe IIn commonly show intrinsic continuum polarization of 1--3%\nat the time of peak optical luminosity, although a few show weaker or\nnegligible polarization. While some SNe IIn have even stronger polarization at\nearly times, their polarization tends to drop smoothly over several hundred\ndays after peak. We find a tendency for the intrinsic polarization to be\nstronger at bluer wavelengths, especially at early times. While polarization\nfrom an electron scattering region is expected to be grey, scattering of SN\nlight by dusty circumstellar material (CSM) may induce such a\nwavelength-dependent polarization. For most SNe IIn, changes in polarization\ndegree and wavelength dependence are not accompanied by changes in the position\nangle, requiring that asymmetric pre-SN mass loss had a persistent geometry.\nWhile 2--3% polarization is typical, about 30% of SNe IIn have very low or\nundetected polarization.

Electrocatalysis can be applied to generate\nhydrogen which can be stored for future use in fuel cells for clean\nelectricity. The use of solid oxide in electrocatalysis specially in hydrogen\nevolution reaction is promising. However, further improvements are essential in\norder to meet the ever-increasing global energy demand. Improvement of the\nperformance of these high energy chemical systems is directly linked to the\nunderstanding and improving the complex physical and chemical phenomena and\nexchanges that take place at their different interfaces. To enable large length\nand time scale atomistic simulations of solid oxide electrocatalysis for\nhydrogen generation, we developed an eReaxFF force field for barium zirconate\ndoped with 20 mol% of yttrium (BZY20). All parameters for the eReaxFF were\noptimized to reproduce quantum mechanical (QM) calculations on relevant\ncondensed phase and cluster systems describing oxygen vacancies, vacancy\nmigrations, water adsorption, water splitting and hydrogen generation on the\nsurfaces of the BZY20 solid oxide. Using the developed force field, we\nperformed zero-voltage molecular dynamics simulations to observe water\nadsorption and the eventual hydrogen production. Based on our simulation\nresults, we conclude that this force field sets a stage for the introduction of\nexplicit electron concept in order to simulate electron conductivity, electron\nleakage and non-zero-voltage effects on hydrogen generation. Overall, we\ndemonstrate how atomistic-scale simulations can enhance our understanding of\nprocesses at interfaces in solid oxide materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 16:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}

Recent research suggests that, even in the absence\nof homophily, the advantage of GNNs still exists as long as nodes from the same\nclass share similar neighborhood patterns.

For example, in online marketing, the\ncascade behavior pattern of $impression \\rightarrow click \\rightarrow\nconversion$ is usually modeled as multiple tasks in a multi-task manner, where\nthe sequential dependence between tasks is simply connected with an explicitly\ndefined function or implicitly transferred information in current works. These\nmethods alleviate the data sparsity problem for long-path sequential tasks as\nthe positive feedback becomes sparser along with the task sequence. However,\nthe error accumulation and negative transfer will be a severe problem for\ndownstream tasks. Especially, at the beginning stage of training, the\noptimization for parameters of former tasks is not converged yet, and thus the\ninformation transferred to downstream tasks is negative. In this paper, we\npropose a prior information merged model (\\textbf{PIMM}), which explicitly\nmodels the logical dependence among tasks with a novel prior information merged\n(\\textbf{PIM}) module for multiple sequential dependence task learning in a\ncurriculum manner. Specifically, the PIM randomly selects the true label\ninformation or the prior task prediction with a soft sampling strategy to\ntransfer to the downstream task during the training. Following an\neasy-to-difficult curriculum paradigm, we dynamically adjust the sampling\nprobability to ensure that the downstream task will get the effective\ninformation along with the training. The offline experimental results on both\npublic and product datasets verify that PIMM outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines. Moreover, we deploy the PIMM in a large-scale FinTech platform, and\nthe online experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of PIMM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 07:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}
