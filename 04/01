In the pursuit of perfect depth estimation, most existing\nstate-of-the-art learning techniques predict a single scalar depth value\nper-pixel. Yet, it is well-known that the trained model has accuracy limits and\ncan predict imprecise depth. Therefore, an SIDP approach must be mindful of the\nexpected depth variations in the model's prediction at test time. Accordingly,\nwe introduce an approach that performs continuous modeling of per-pixel depth,\nwhere we can predict and reason about the per-pixel depth and its distribution.\nTo this end, we model per-pixel scene depth using a multivariate Gaussian\ndistribution. Moreover, contrary to the existing uncertainty modeling methods\n-- in the same spirit, where per-pixel depth is assumed to be independent, we\nintroduce per-pixel covariance modeling that encodes its depth dependency w.r.t\nall the scene points. Unfortunately, per-pixel depth covariance modeling leads\nto a computationally expensive continuous loss function, which we solve\nefficiently using the learned low-rank approximation of the overall covariance\nmatrix. Notably, when tested on benchmark datasets such as KITTI, NYU, and\nSUN-RGB-D, the SIDP model obtained by optimizing our loss function shows\nstate-of-the-art results. Our method's accuracy (named MG) is among the top on\nthe KITTI depth-prediction benchmark leaderboard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 16:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 08:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-19"}

A variety of faults or failures could occur, and there\nexists a high variety of ways to respond to such events. Once a fault or\nfailure is detected, there is a need to classify its severity and decide on\nappropriate and safe mitigating actions. To provide a solution to this\nmitigation challenge, in this paper a functional-safety architecture is\nproposed and an optimization-based mitigation algorithm is introduced. This\nalgorithm uses nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to bring a vehicle,\nsuffering from a severe fault, such as a power steering failure, to a\nsafe-state. The internal model of the NMPC uses the information from the fault\ndetection, isolation and identification to optimize the tracking performance of\nthe controller, showcasing the need of the proposed architecture. Given a\nstring of ACC vehicles, our results demonstrate a variety of tactical\ndecision-making approaches that a fault-affected vehicle could employ to manage\nany faults.

Devices that perform these\nmeasurements therefore need to be extremely precise to obtain correct system\ndiagnostics and accurate predictions, consequently requiring a rigorous\ncalibration procedure which models their errors before being employed. While\nthe deterministic components of these errors do not represent a major modelling\nchallenge, most of the research over the past years has focused on delivering\nmethods that can explain and estimate the complex stochastic components of\nthese errors. This effort has allowed to greatly improve the precision and\nuncertainty quantification of measurement devices but has this far not\naccounted for a significant stochastic noise that arises for many of these\ndevices: vibration noise. Indeed, having filtered out physical explanations for\nthis noise, a residual stochastic component often carries over which can\ndrastically affect measurement precision. This component can originate from\ndifferent sources, including the internal mechanics of the measurement devices\nas well as the movement of these devices when placed on moving objects or\nvehicles. To remove this disturbance from signals, this work puts forward a\nmodelling framework for this specific type of noise and adapts the Generalized\nMethod of Wavelet Moments to estimate these models.

As\nwith all language, text generated by language models can be harmful, or used to\nbring about harm. Automating language generation adds both an element of scale\nand also more subtle or emergent undesirable tendencies to the generated text.\nPrior work establishes a wide variety of language model harms to many different\nactors: existing taxonomies identify categories of harms posed by language\nmodels; benchmarks establish automated tests of these harms; and documentation\nstandards for models, tasks and datasets encourage transparent reporting.\nHowever, there is no risk-centric framework for documenting the complexity of a\nlandscape in which some risks are shared across models and contexts, while\nothers are specific, and where certain conditions may be required for risks to\nmanifest as harms. RiskCards address this methodological gap by providing a\ngeneric framework for assessing the use of a given language model in a given\nscenario. Each RiskCard makes clear the routes for the risk to manifest harm,\ntheir placement in harm taxonomies, and example prompt-output pairs. While\nRiskCards are designed to be open-source, dynamic and participatory, we present\na \"starter set\" of RiskCards taken from a broad literature survey, each of\nwhich details a concrete risk presentation.

Long-term capacity trajectory predictions can fail due to cumulative\nerrors and noise. To address this issue, this study proposes a data-centric\nmethod that uses early single-cycle data to predict the capacity degradation\ntrajectory of lithium-ion cells. The method involves predicting a few knots at\nspecific retention levels using a deep learning-based model and interpolating\nthem to reconstruct the trajectory. Two approaches are used to identify the\nretention levels of two to four knots: uniformly dividing the retention up to\nthe end of life and finding optimal locations using Bayesian optimization. The\nproposed model is validated with experimental data from 169 cells using\nfive-fold cross-validation. The results show that mean absolute percentage\nerrors in trajectory prediction are less than 1.60% for all cases of knots. By\npredicting only the cycle numbers of at least two knots based on early\nsingle-cycle charge and discharge data, the model can directly estimate the\noverall capacity degradation trajectory. Further experiments suggest using\nthree-cycle input data to achieve robust and efficient predictions, even in the\npresence of noise. The method is then applied to predict various shapes of\ncapacity degradation patterns using additional experimental data from 82 cells.\nThe study demonstrates that collecting only the cycle information of a few\nknots during model training and a few early cycle data points for predictions\nis sufficient for predicting capacity degradation. This can help establish\nappropriate warranties or replacement cycles in battery manufacturing and\ndiagnosis processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 16:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

The\nliterature on thermal instability (TI) reveals that even for a simple\nhomogeneous plasma, all these possibilities can occur, depending on whether the\ncondensations that form evolve in an isobaric or nonisobaric manner. Here we\nderive several general identities from the evolution equation for entropy that\nreveals the mechanism by which TI saturates: whenever the boundary of the\ninstability region (the Balbus contour) is crossed, a dynamical change is\ntriggered that causes the comoving time derivative of the pressure to change\nsign. This temporal event implies that the gas pressure force reverses\ndirection, slowing the continued growth of the condensation. For isobaric\nevolution, this `pressure reversal' occurs nearly simultaneously for every\nfluid element in the condensation and a steady state is quickly reached. For\nnonisobaric evolution, the condensation is no longer in mechanical equilibrium\nand the contracting gas rebounds with greater force during the expansion phase\nthat accompanies gas reaching the equilibrium curve. The cloud then pulsates\nbecause the return to mechanical equilibrium becomes wave-mediated as a result\nof the pressure reversal occurring at different times for different locations\nin the cloud core. We show that both the contraction rebound event and the\nsubsequent pulsation behavior follow analytically from an analysis of the new\nidentities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 16:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

Here we use stellar kinematics extracted from\nintegral-field spectroscopy observations with Adaptive Optics (AO) using MUSE\nand OASIS. We exploit our high-resolution integral field spectroscopy to\nspectrally decompose the central AGN from the stars. We derive an accurate\ninner stellar-density profile and find it is flatter than previously assumed.\nWe also use the spectrally-extracted AGN as a reference to accurately determine\nthe observed MUSE and OASIS AO PSF. We then perform Jeans Anisotropic Modelling\n(JAM), with a new flexible spatially-variable anisotropy, and measure the\nanisotropy profile, stellar mass-to-light variations, inner dark matter\nfraction, and black hole mass. Our preferred black hole mass is $M_{\\rm\nBH}=(8.7\\pm1.2) \\times 10^9 \\ M_\\odot $. However, using the inner stellar\ndensity from previous studies, we find a preferred black hole mass of $M_{\\rm\nBH} = (5.5^{+0.5}_{-0.3}) \\times 10^9 \\ M_\\odot $, consistent with previous\nwork. We conduct numerous systematic tests of the kinematics and model\nassumptions and conclude that uncertainties in the black hole mass of M87 from\nprevious determinations may have been underestimated and further analyses are\nneeded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 17:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

With the limitations of the current noisy intermediate scale quantum\ncomputer (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm offers\na promising approach to efficiently estimate the stable energy state of a given\nmolecule. This study is focused on predicting the ground state and single\nelectron detachment energy of the hydride ion because of its high electron\nelectron correlation and numerous applications in astrophysics and quantum\nchemistry. The hydride ion is the first three body quantum problem for which\nthe ground state energy has been calculated theoretically using the\nChandrasekhar Wavefunction, which takes high electron-electron correlation into\naccount. For the calculation of hydride ion, we used the VQE algorithm with two\ntypes of quantum computational ansatz, (i) chemistry inspired ansatz based on\nunitary CC (UCC) and (ii) hardware efficient based ansatz (HEA). To check the\nversatility of the algorithm, we analyzed two proton transfer reactions\ninvolving the hydride ion and finds the energy to be exothermic with a much\nimproved result compared to previous studies. Overall, the VQE algorithm with a\nquantum computational approach is found to be reliable in calculating stable\nstate energy, single electron detachment energy, and reaction energy for proton\ntransfer reactions involving a highly correlated molecule with a low relative\npercentage error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 16:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

However, this scenario has recently been questioned by the\nobservational evidence of a few galaxies at z~4-5 with a gas velocity\ndispersion similar to what is observed in the local population. Our goal is to\ndetermine whether galaxies in the first Gyrs of the Universe have already\nformed a dynamically cold rotating disk similar to the local counterparts. We\nstudied the gas kinematic of 22 main-sequence star-forming galaxies at z > 5\nand determined their dynamical state by estimating the ratio of the rotational\nvelocity and of the gas velocity dispersion. We mined the ALMA archive and\nexploited the [CII] and [OIII] observations to perform a kinematic analysis of\nthe cold and warm gas of z>5 main-sequence galaxies. The gas kinematics of the\nhigh-z galaxies is consistent within the errors with rotating but turbulent\ndisks. We infer a velocity dispersion that is systematically higher by 4 times\nthan the local galaxy population and the z~5 dust-obscured galaxies reported in\nthe literature. The difference between our results and those reported at\nsimilar redshift can be ascribed to the systematic difference in the galaxy\nproperties in the two samples: the disks of massive dusty galaxies are\ndynamically colder than the disks of dust-poor galaxies. The comparison with\nthe theoretical predictions suggests that the main driver of the velocity\ndispersion in high-z galaxies is the gravitational energy that is released by\nthe transport of mass within the disk. Finally, we stress that future deeper\nALMA high-angular resolution observations are crucial to constrain the\nkinematic properties of high-z galaxies and to distinguish rotating disks from\nkpc-scale mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Some of these solutions, however, cannot\naccount for the enrichment produced by Type Ia SNe due to the presence of the\ndelay time distributions (DTDs) in the models.\n  Aims: We present a new analytic solution for the chemical evolution model of\nthe Galaxy. This solution can be used with different prescriptions of the DTD,\nincluding the single and double degenerate scenarios, and allows the inclusion\nof an arbitrary number of pristine gas infalls.\n  Methods: We integrate the chemical evolution model by extending the\ninstantaneous recycling approximation with the contribution of Type Ia SNe. For\nthose DTDs that lead to non-analytic integrals, we describe them as a\nsuperposition of Gaussian, exponential and 1/t functions using a restricted\nleast-squares fitting method.\n  Results: We obtain the exact solution for a chemical model with Type Ia SNe\nwidely used in previous works. This solution can reproduce the expected\nchemical evolution of the alpha and iron-peak elements in less computing time\nthan numerical integration methods. We compare the pattern in the [Si/Fe] vs.\n[Fe/H] plane observed by APOGEE DR17 with that predicted by the model. We find\nthe low alpha sequence can be explained by a delayed gas infall.

This feature is\nprobably due to long-term circularization processes induced by tidal\ninteraction between the two stars of each binary. It seemed as if coeval\nmain-sequence (MS) samples of open clusters display $P_{\\rm cut}$ that depends\non the sample age. Using the unprecedentedly large sample of MS spectroscopic\norbits recently released by $\\textit{Gaia}$ we have found that the $P_{\\rm\ncut}$ does not depend on the stellar age but, instead, varies with stellar\ntemperature, decreasing linearly from $6.5$ day at $T_{\\rm eff}\\sim 5700$ K to\n$\\sim 2.5$ day at $6800$ K. $P_{\\rm cut}$ was derived by a new algorithm that\nrelied on clear upper envelopes displayed in the period-eccentricity diagrams.\nOur $P_{\\rm cut}$ determines both the border between the circular and eccentric\nbinaries and the location of the upper envelope. The results are inconsistent\nwith the theory which assumes circularization occurs during the stellar MS\nphase, a theory that was adopted by many studies. The circularization has\nprobably taken place at the pre-main-sequence phase, as suggested already in\n1989 by Zahn and Bouchet, and later by Khaluillin and Khaluillina in 2011. Our\nresults suggest that the weak dependence of $P_{\\rm cut}$ on the cluster age is\nnot significant, and/or might be due to the different temperatures of the\nsamples. If indeed true, this has far-reaching implications for the theory of\nbinary and exoplanet circularization, synchronization, and alignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 18:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-12"}

Given a target and a reference point cloud, the goal is to\nlearn a minimal transformation that aligns the target to the reference under\nthe constraint that the topological structure of the target point cloud is\npreserved. Similar to coherent point drift (CPD), the registration (alignment)\nproblem is viewed as the movement of data points sampled from a target\ndistribution along a regularized displacement vector field. While the coherence\nconstraint in CPD is stated in terms of local motion coherence, the proposed\nregularization term relies on a global smoothness constraint as a proxy for\npreserving local topology. This makes CPD less flexible when the deformation is\nlocally rigid but globally non-rigid as in the case of multiple objects and\narticulate pose registration. To mitigate these issues, a Jacobian-based cost\nfunction along with geometric-aware statistical distances is proposed. The\nlatter allows for measuring misalignment between the target and the reference.\nThe justification for the kNN-graph preservation of target data, when the\nJacobian cost is used, is also provided. Further, a stochastic approximation\nfor high dimensional registration is introduced to make a high-dimensional\nalignment feasible.

Most of the existing works are limited to the\nactivity classification of a single human subject at a given time. Conversely,\na more realistic scenario is to achieve simultaneous, multi-subject activity\nclassification. The first key challenge in that context is that the number of\nclasses grows exponentially with the number of subjects and activities.\nMoreover, it is known that Wi-Fi sensing systems struggle to adapt to new\nenvironments and subjects. To address both issues, we propose SiMWiSense, the\nfirst framework for simultaneous multi-subject activity classification based on\nWi-Fi that generalizes to multiple environments and subjects. We address the\nscalability issue by using the Channel State Information (CSI) computed from\nthe device positioned closest to the subject.

The paper defines resolving power as a metric's sampling uncertainty\nscaled by its signal. Resolving power's primary application is to compare the\ndiscriminating capacity of threshold-free evaluation metrics, such as the area\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under\nthe precision-recall curve (AUPRC). A simulation study compares the AUROC and\nthe AUPRC in a variety of contexts. The analysis suggests that the AUROC\ngenerally has greater resolving power, but that the AUPRC is superior in some\nconditions, such as those where high-quality models are applied to low\nprevalence outcomes.

The real-time data in the\nelectrical distribution system is collected through distribution-level phasor\nmeasurement units referred to as $\\mu$PMU which report high-resolution phasor\nmeasurements comprising various event signatures which provide situational\nawareness and enable a level of visibility into the distribution system. These\nevents are infrequent, unschedule, and uncertain; it is a challenge to\nscrutinize, detect and predict the occurrence of such events. For electrical\ndistribution systems, it is challenging to explicitly identify evolution\nfunctions that describe the complex, non-linear, and non-stationary signature\npatterns of events. In this paper, we seek to address this problem by\ndeveloping a physics dynamics-based approach to detect anomalies in the\n$\\mu$PMU streaming data and simultaneously predict the events using governing\nequations. We propose a data-driven approach based on the Hankel alternative\nview of the Koopman (HAVOK) operator, called DynamoPMU, to analyze the\nunderlying dynamics of the distribution system by representing them in a linear\nintrinsic space.

While originally studied in point-like ensembles,\nthis phenomenon persists in extended ordered systems if the inter-particle\ndistance is below a certain bound. Here, we investigate Dicke superradiance in\na realistic experimental setting using ordered arrays of alkaline earth(-like)\natoms, such as strontium and ytterbium. Such atoms offer exciting new\nopportunities for light-matter interaction as their internal structure offers\nthe possibility of trapping at short interatomic distances compared to their\nstrong long-wavelength transitions, providing the potential for strong\ncollectively modified interactions. Despite their intricate electronic\nstructure, we show that two-dimensional arrays of these atomic species should\nexhibit many-body superradiance for achievable lattice constants. Moreover,\nsuperradiance effectively ''closes'' transitions, such that multilevel atoms\nbecome more two-level like. This occurs because the avalanche-like decay\nfunnels the emission of most photons into the dominant transition, overcoming\nthe single-atom decay ratios dictated by their fine structure and Zeeman\nbranching. Our work represents an important step in harnessing alkaline-earth\natoms as quantum optical sources and as dissipative generators of entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 19:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

However, a natural question follows:\n\\emph{what is the cost or benefit of being transparent}, as one may suspect\nthat transparency imposes additional constraints on the information structure,\ndecreasing the maneuverability of the information provider. This work proposes\nand quantitatively investigates the \\emph{price of transparency} (PoT) in\nstrategic information disclosure by comparing the perfect Bayesian equilibrium\npayoffs under two representative information structures: overt persuasion and\ncovert signaling models. PoT is defined as the ratio between the payoff\noutcomes in covert and overt interactions. As the main contribution, this work\ndevelops a bilevel-bilinear programming approach, called $Z$-programming, to\nsolve for non-degenerate perfect Bayesian equilibria of dynamic incomplete\ninformation games with finite states and actions. Using $Z$-programming, we\nshow that it is always in the information provider's interest to choose the\ntransparent information structure, as $0\\leq \\textrm{PoT}\\leq 1$. The upper\nbound is attainable for any strictly Bayesian-posterior competitive games, of\nwhich zero-sum games are a particular case. For continuous games, the PoT,\nstill upper-bounded by $1$, can be arbitrarily close to $0$, indicating the\ntightness of the lower bound. This tight lower bound suggests that the lack of\ntransparency can result in significant loss for the provider.

One straightforward and\nmodel-agnostic way to interpret complex ML models is to train surrogate models,\nsuch as rule sets and decision trees, that sufficiently approximate the\noriginal ones while being simpler and easier-to-explain. Yet, rule sets can\nbecome very lengthy, with many if-else statements, and decision tree depth\ngrows rapidly when accurately emulating complex ML models. In such cases, both\napproaches can fail to meet their core goal, providing users with model\ninterpretability.

Our solution helps\nusers to explore the complexity vs fidelity trade-off by incrementally\ngenerating more stumps, creating attribute-based explanations with weighted\nstumps to justify decision making, and analyzing the impact of rule overriding\non training instance allocation between one or more stumps. An independent test\nset allows users to monitor the effectiveness of manual rule changes and form\nhypotheses based on case-by-case investigations.

However, current methods to classify these sources using the\nX-ray data themselves suffer problems - detailed X-ray spectroscopy of\nindividual sources is too time-consuming, while hardness ratios often lack\naccuracy, and can be difficult to use effectively. These methods fail to use\nthe power of X-ray CCD detectors to identify X-ray emission lines and\ndistinguish line-dominated spectra (from chromospherically active stars,\nsupernova remnants, etc.) from continuum-dominated ones (e.g., compact objects\nor active galactic nuclei [AGN]). In this paper, we probe the use of artificial\nneural networks (ANN) in differentiating Chandra spectra of young stars in the\nChandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) survey from AGN in the Chandra Deep\nField South (CDFS) survey. We use these surveys to generate 100,000 artificial\nspectra of stars and AGN and train our ANN models to separate the two kinds of\nspectra. We find that our methods reach an accuracy of approx. 92% in\nclassifying simulated spectra of moderate-brightness objects in typical\nexposures, but their performance slightly decreases on the observed COUP and\nCDFS spectra (approx. 91%), due in large part to the relatively high background\nof these long-exposure datasets.

Our goal is to carry out a star\nmembership study in these nearby open clusters employing an astrometric model\nwith proper motions and an unsupervised clustering machine learning algorithm\nusing positions, proper motions and parallaxes.

We use the Gaia DR3\ncatalogue to determine star members using two approaches: a classical Bayesian\nmodel and the unsupervised machine learning algorithm DBSCAN. For star members\nwe build the radial density profiles, the spatial distributions and compute the\nKing parameters. The ages and metallicities were estimated using the BASE-9\nBayesian software. Results. We identified 958, 744 and 488 star members for the\nPleiades, Praesepe and Blanco 1 respectively.

Recently, there has been substantial progress in\nconditionally generating images with specific quantitative attributes, like the\nemotion conveyed by one's face. These methods typically require a user to\nexplicitly quantify the desired intensity of a visual attribute. A limitation\nof this method is that many attributes, like how \"angry\" a human face looks,\nare difficult for a user to precisely quantify. However, a user would be able\nto reliably say which of two faces seems \"angrier\". Following this premise, we\ndevelop the $\\textit{PrefGen}$ system, which allows users to control the\nrelative attributes of generated images by presenting them with simple paired\ncomparison queries of the form \"do you prefer image $a$ or image $b$?\" Using\ninformation from a sequence of query responses, we can estimate user\npreferences over a set of image attributes and perform preference-guided image\nediting and generation. Furthermore, to make preference localization feasible\nand efficient, we apply an active query selection strategy. We demonstrate the\nsuccess of this approach using a StyleGAN2 generator on the task of human face\nediting.

A trustworthy medical AI algorithm should\ndemonstrate its effectiveness on tail conditions to avoid clinically dangerous\ndamage in these out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. In this paper, we adopt the\nconcept of object queries in Mask Transformers to formulate semantic\nsegmentation as a soft cluster assignment. The queries fit the feature-level\ncluster centers of inliers during training. Therefore, when performing\ninference on a medical image in real-world scenarios, the similarity between\npixels and the queries detects and localizes OOD regions. We term this OOD\nlocalization as MaxQuery. Furthermore, the foregrounds of real-world medical\nimages, whether OOD objects or inliers, are lesions. The difference between\nthem is less than that between the foreground and background, possibly\nmisleading the object queries to focus redundantly on the background.

To this end, we propose a convolutional broad learning system\n(ConvBLS) based on the spherical K-means (SKM) algorithm and two-stage\nmulti-scale (TSMS) feature fusion, which consists of the convolutional feature\n(CF) layer, convolutional enhancement (CE) layer, TSMS feature fusion layer,\nand output layer.

Such a non-separable\ncorrelation structure poses challenging issues for characterizing the\nfundamental limits of holographic MIMO channels, which has not been tackled in\nthe literature. In this paper, we investigate the distribution for the mutual\ninformation (MI) of holographic MIMO systems with the non-separable channel\ncorrelation, where both the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight components are\nconsidered. We set up a central limit theorem for the MI by random matrix\ntheory (RMT) and give the closed-form expressions for the mean and variance.\nThe derived results are used to approximate the outage probability and reveal\ninteresting physical insights regarding the impact of antenna spacing. It is\nshown that reducing antenna spacing will improve the ergodic MI and decrease\nthe outage probability of holographic MIMO systems. The scaling law of the\nergodic MI with respect to the antenna spacing is also derived. Numerical\nsimulations validate the accuracy of the evaluation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 04:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Transfer learning is\na new technique promising higher accuracy in the derived data products, with\ninformation from one domain being transferred to improve the accuracy of a\nneural network model in another domain. In this work, we demonstrate the\nfeasibility of applying the deep transfer learning (DTL) approach to\nhigh-resolution spectra in the framework of photospheric stellar parameter\ndetermination. To this end, we used 14 stars of the CARMENES survey sample with\ninterferometric angular diameters to calculate the effective temperature, as\nwell as six M dwarfs that are common proper motion companions to FGK-type\nprimaries with known metallicity. After training a deep learning (DL) neural\nnetwork model on synthetic PHOENIX-ACES spectra, we used the internal feature\nrepresentations together with those 14+6 stars with independent parameter\nmeasurements as a new input for the transfer process. We compare the derived\nstellar parameters of a small sample of M dwarfs kept out of the training phase\nwith results from other methods in the literature. Assuming that temperatures\nfrom bolometric luminosities and interferometric radii and metallicities from\nFGK+M binaries are sufficiently accurate, DTL provides a higher accuracy than\nour previous state-of-the-art DL method (mean absolute differences improve by\n20 K for temperature and 0.2 dex for metallicity from DL to DTL when compared\nwith reference values from interferometry and FGK+M binaries). Furthermore, the\nmachine learning (internal) precision of DTL also improves as uncertainties are\nfive times smaller on average. These results indicate that DTL is a robust tool\nfor obtaining M-dwarf stellar parameters comparable to those obtained from\nindependent estimations for well-known stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 04:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

In this architecture, the leader\nmoves toward the target by taking optimal actions, and followers should also\navoid obstacles while maintaining their desired formation shape. Most of the\nstudies in this field have inspected formation control and obstacle avoidance\nseparately. The present study proposes a new approach based on deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) for end-to-end motion planning and control of\nunder-actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The aim is to design\noptimal adaptive distributed controllers based on actor-critic structure for\nAUVs formation motion planning. This is accomplished by controlling the speed\nand heading of AUVs. In obstacle avoidance, two approaches have been deployed.\nIn the first approach, the goal is to design control policies for the leader\nand followers such that each learns its own collision-free path. Moreover, the\nfollowers adhere to an overall formation maintenance policy. In the second\napproach, the leader solely learns the control policy, and safely leads the\nwhole group towards the target. Here, the control policy of the followers is to\nmaintain the predetermined distance and angle. In the presence of ocean\ncurrents, communication delays, and sensing errors, the robustness of the\nproposed method under realistically perturbed circumstances is shown. The\nefficiency of the algorithms has been evaluated and approved using a number of\ncomputer-based simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 04:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

The\nproblem of controlling joints to follow a given trajectory is called the\ntracking control problem. In this study, we focus on the tracking control\nproblem of a human finger attached with thin McKibben muscles. To achieve\nprecise control with thin McKibben muscles, there are two problems: one is the\ncomplex characteristics of the muscles, for example, non-linearity, hysteresis,\nuncertainties in the real world, and the other is the difficulty in accessing a\nprecise model of the muscles and human fingers. To solve these problems, we\nadopted DreamerV2, which is a model-based reinforcement learning method, but\nthe target trajectory cannot be generated by the learned model. Therefore, we\npropose Tracker, which is an extension of DreamerV2 for the tracking control\nproblem. In the experiment, we showed that Tracker can achieve an approximately\n81% smaller error than PID for the control of a two-link manipulator that\nimitates a part of human index finger from the metacarpal bone to the proximal\nbone. Tracker achieved the control of the third joint of the human index finger\nwith a small error by being trained for approximately 60 minutes. In addition,\nit took approximately 15 minutes, which is less than the time required for the\nfirst training, to achieve almost the same accuracy by fine-tuning the policy\npre-trained by the user's finger after taking off and attaching thin McKibben\nmuscles again as the accuracy before taking off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 05:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

In this work, we investigate the problem of hashing with\nGraph Convolutional Network on bipartite graphs for effective Top-N search. We\npropose an end-to-end Bipartite Graph Convolutional Hashing approach, namely\nBGCH, which consists of three novel and effective modules: (1) adaptive graph\nconvolutional hashing, (2) latent feature dispersion, and (3) Fourier\nserialized gradient estimation. Specifically, the former two modules achieve\nthe substantial retention of the structural information against the inevitable\ninformation loss in hash encoding; the last module develops Fourier Series\ndecomposition to the hashing function in the frequency domain mainly for more\naccurate gradient estimation. The extensive experiments on six real-world\ndatasets not only show the performance superiority over the competing\nhashing-based counterparts, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of all\nproposed model components contained therein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 06:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

However, using a single seed point\nfeature as the cue for voting fails to produce high-quality 3D proposals.\nAdditionally, the equal treatment of seed points in the voting process,\nregardless of their significance, exacerbates this limitation. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel transformer-based voting scheme to generate\nbetter proposals. Specifically, a global-local transformer (GLT) module is\ndevised to integrate object- and patch-aware geometric priors into seed point\nfeatures, resulting in robust and accurate cues for offset learning of seed\npoints. To train the GLT module, we introduce an importance prediction branch\nthat learns the potential importance weights of seed points as a training\nconstraint. Incorporating this transformer-based voting scheme into 3D RPN, a\nnovel Siamese method dubbed GLT-T is developed for 3D single object tracking on\npoint clouds. Moreover, we identify that the highest-scored proposal in the\nSiamese paradigm may not be the most accurate proposal, which limits tracking\nperformance. Towards this concern, we approach the binary score prediction task\nas a ranking problem, and design a target-aware ranking loss and a\nlocalization-aware ranking loss to produce accurate ranking of proposals.

With the inspiration of software reuse, building DNN models\nthrough reusing existing ones has gained increasing attention recently. Prior\napproaches to DNN model reuse have two main limitations: 1) reusing the entire\nmodel, while only a small part of the model's functionalities (labels) are\nrequired, would cause much overhead (e.g., computational and time costs for\ninference), and 2) model reuse would inherit the defects and weaknesses of the\nreused model, and hence put the new system under threats of security attack. To\nsolve the above problem, we propose SeaM, a tool that re-engineers a trained\nDNN model to improve its reusability. Specifically, given a target problem and\na trained model, SeaM utilizes a gradient-based search method to search for the\nmodel's weights that are relevant to the target problem. The re-engineered\nmodel that only retains the relevant weights is then reused to solve the target\nproblem. Evaluation results on widely-used models show that the re-engineered\nmodels produced by SeaM only contain 10.11% weights of the original models,\nresulting 42.41% reduction in terms of inference time. For the target problem,\nthe re-engineered models even outperform the original models in classification\naccuracy by 5.85%. Moreover, reusing the re-engineered models inherits an\naverage of 57% fewer defects than reusing the entire model. We believe our\napproach to reducing reuse overhead and defect inheritance is one important\nstep forward for practical model reuse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 06:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

The values of {\\mu} exhibit an underlying characteristic memory\nbehavior of seismic activities common to all the countries considered, while\nthe values of \\b{eta} suggest a regional dependence which could be a\nmanifestation of different seismic dynamics in various regions. This new\nperspective may provide a more versatile approach in studying the independent\ndatasets that may be extracted from various earthquake catalogs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 09:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

In the realization, the salience mechanism is used as a\nmetric of channel salience to guide pruning. Therefore, salience-based channel\npruning can dynamically adjust the channel width at run-time, which provides a\nflexible pruning scheme. However, there are two problems emerging: a gating\nfunction is often needed to truncate the specific salience entries to zero,\nwhich destabilizes the forward propagation; dynamic architecture brings more\ncost for indexing in inference which bottlenecks the inference speed. In this\npaper, we propose a Progressive Channel-Shrinking (PCS) method to compress the\nselected salience entries at run-time instead of roughly approximating them to\nzero. We also propose a Running Shrinking Policy to provide a testing-static\npruning scheme that can reduce the memory access cost for filter indexing.

Given the current biological sequencing data volume, learning an\nexplicit representation is prohibitive due to the dimensionality of the\nresulting feature vectors. Kernel-based methods, e.g., SVM, are a proven\nefficient and useful alternative for several machine learning (ML) tasks such\nas sequence classification. Three challenges with kernel methods are (i) the\ncomputation time, (ii) the memory usage (storing an $n\\times n$ matrix), and\n(iii) the usage of kernel matrices limited to kernel-based ML methods\n(difficult to generalize on non-kernel classifiers). While (i) can be solved\nusing approximate methods, challenge (ii) remains for typical kernel methods.\nSimilarly, although non-kernel-based ML methods can be applied to kernel\nmatrices by extracting principal components (kernel PCA), it may result in\ninformation loss, while being computationally expensive. In this paper, we\npropose a general-purpose representation learning approach that embodies kernel\nmethods' qualities while avoiding computation, memory, and generalizability\nchallenges.

We have recently shown\nthat coupling curved membrane complexes to protrusive forces, exerted by the\nactin polymerization that they recruit, provides a mechanism that can give rise\nto spontaneous membrane shapes and patterns. In the presence of an adhesive\nsubstrate, this model was shown to give rise to an emergent motile phenotype,\nresembling a motile cell. Here, we utilize this ``minimal-cell\" model to\nexplore the impact of external shear flow on the cell shape and migration on a\nuniform adhesive flat substrate. We find that in the presence of shear the\nmotile cell reorients such that its leading edge, where the curved active\nproteins aggregate, faces the shear flow. The flow-facing configuration is\nfound to minimize the adhesion energy by allowing the cell to spread more\nefficiently over the substrate. For the non-motile vesicle shapes, we find that\nthey mostly slide and roll with the shear flow. We compare these theoretical\nresults with experimental observations, and suggest that the tendency of many\ncell types to move against the flow may arise from the very general, and\nnon-cell-type-specific mechanism predicted by our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 11:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

The dynamic scene perspective reconstruction\ntechnology based on neural rendering field can be used to solve this\nrequirement, but most of the current methods are poor in reconstruction\naccuracy due to the blurred input image and overfitting of dynamic and static\nregions.

To meet the tremendous rise of demand for future\ngeneration wireless LANs, a robust and efficient MAC protocol is required for\nthe Wi-Fi network. However, traditional MAC mechanisms are not suitable for\nnext-generation communications due to some inherent constraints. In this\nregard, OFDMA technology could be adopted to design an efficient MAC protocol\nfor the Wi-Fi network.\n  The purpose of this research is to provide a high-speed network for Wi-Fi\nusers. The thesis presents three MAC protocols, namely, HTFA (High Throughput\nand Fair Access), ERA (Efficient Resource Allocation), and PRS (Proportional\nResource Scheduling), by employing the OFDMA technology. The novel protocols\nimprove Wi-Fi communication using the latest IEEE 802.11ax standard, i.e.,\nWi-Fi 6. In particular, the protocols improve several performance parameters of\nthe MAC protocol, such as increasing the throughput, goodput, fairness index,\nand reducing the packet retransmissions, collisions, etc. Simulation results\nvalidate that the new protocols are far better than the existing protocols.\n  The protocols designed in this thesis are compliant with the latest IEEE\n802.11ax standard that promises to enhance the throughput at least four times\nper user and support ten times users. Thus, the new protocols can ensure\nuninterrupted and smooth communication in highly dense environments.

However, not Independent and Identically\nDistributed (non-IID) distribution among edge clients can impair the local\nmodel performance. The existing single prototype-based strategy represents a\nsample by using the mean of the feature space. However, feature spaces are\nusually not clustered, and a single prototype may not represent a sample well.\nMotivated by this, this paper proposes a multi-prototype federated contrastive\nlearning approach (MP-FedCL) which demonstrates the effectiveness of using a\nmulti-prototype strategy over a single-prototype under non-IID settings,\nincluding both label and feature skewness. Specifically, a multi-prototype\ncomputation strategy based on \\textit{k-means} is first proposed to capture\ndifferent embedding representations for each class space, using multiple\nprototypes ($k$ centroids) to represent a class in the embedding space. In each\nglobal round, the computed multiple prototypes and their respective model\nparameters are sent to the edge server for aggregation into a global prototype\npool, which is then sent back to all clients to guide their local training.\nFinally, local training for each client minimizes their own supervised learning\ntasks and learns from shared prototypes in the global prototype pool through\nsupervised contrastive learning, which encourages them to learn knowledge\nrelated to their own class from others and reduces the absorption of unrelated\nknowledge in each global iteration. Experimental results on MNIST, Digit-5,\nOffice-10, and DomainNet show that our method outperforms multiple baselines,\nwith an average test accuracy improvement of about 4.6\\% and 10.4\\% under\nfeature and label non-IID distributions, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 09:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-05"}

Recent large-scale vision-language\nadvances pave the way to for novices to conveniently customize 3D content.\nHowever, the generated CG-friendly assets still cannot represent the desired\nfacial traits for human characteristics. In this paper, we present DreamFace, a\nprogressive scheme to generate personalized 3D faces under text guidance. It\nenables layman users to naturally customize 3D facial assets that are\ncompatible with CG pipelines, with desired shapes, textures, and fine-grained\nanimation capabilities. From a text input to describe the facial traits, we\nfirst introduce a coarse-to-fine scheme to generate the neutral facial geometry\nwith a unified topology. We employ a selection strategy in the CLIP embedding\nspace, and subsequently optimize both the details displacements and normals\nusing Score Distillation Sampling from generic Latent Diffusion Model. Then,\nfor neutral appearance generation, we introduce a dual-path mechanism, which\ncombines the generic LDM with a novel texture LDM to ensure both the diversity\nand textural specification in the UV space. We also employ a two-stage\noptimization to perform SDS in both the latent and image spaces to\nsignificantly provides compact priors for fine-grained synthesis. Our generated\nneutral assets naturally support blendshapes-based facial animations. We\nfurther improve the animation ability with personalized deformation\ncharacteristics by learning the universal expression prior using the\ncross-identity hypernetwork. Notably, DreamFace can generate of realistic 3D\nfacial assets with physically-based rendering quality and rich animation\nability from video footage, even for fashion icons or exotic characters in\ncartoons and fiction movies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 07:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-07"}

But as the original problem\nbecomes more complex, so does its efficacy and expandability. Thus, the purpose\nof this research is to introduce the Lagrange Elementary Optimization (Leo) as\nan evolutionary method, which is self-adaptive inspired by the remarkable\naccuracy of vaccinations using the albumin quotient of human blood. They\ndevelop intelligent agents using their fitness function value after gene\ncrossing. These genes direct the search agents during both exploration and\nexploitation. The main objective of the Leo algorithm is presented in this\npaper along with the inspiration and motivation for the concept. To demonstrate\nits precision, the proposed algorithm is validated against a variety of test\nfunctions, including 19 traditional benchmark functions and the CECC06 2019\ntest functions. The results of Leo for 19 classic benchmark test functions are\nevaluated against DA, PSO, and GA separately, and then two other recent\nalgorithms such as FDO and LPB are also included in the evaluation. In\naddition, the Leo is tested by ten functions on CECC06 2019 with DA, WOA, SSA,\nFDO, LPB, and FOX algorithms distinctly. The cumulative outcomes demonstrate\nLeo's capacity to increase the starting population and move toward the global\noptimum. Different standard measurements are used to verify and prove the\nstability of Leo in both the exploration and exploitation phases. Moreover,\nStatistical analysis supports the findings results of the proposed research.\nFinally, novel applications in the real world are introduced to demonstrate the\npracticality of Leo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2023 11:50:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 14:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

This paper explores several\nportfolio management strategies, including asset allocation, diversification,\nactive management, and risk management, and their importance in optimizing\nportfolio performance. These strategies are examined individually and in\ncombination to demonstrate how they can help investors maximize alpha and\nminimize beta. Asset allocation is the process of dividing a portfolio among\ndifferent asset classes to achieve the desired level of risk and return.\nDiversification involves spreading investments across different securities and\nsectors to minimize the impact of individual security or sector-specific risks.\nActive management involves security selection and risk management techniques to\ngenerate excess returns while minimizing losses. Risk management strategies,\nsuch as stop-loss orders and options strategies, aim to minimize losses in\nadverse market conditions. The importance of combining these strategies for\noptimizing portfolio performance is emphasized in this paper. The proper\nimplementation of these strategies can help investors achieve their investment\ngoals over the long-term, while minimizing exposure to risks.

The genlangs created by ChatGPT\nfor this research (Voxphera, Vivenzia, and Lumivoxa) each have unique features,\nappear facially coherent, and plausibly \"translate\" into English. This study\ninvestigates whether genlangs created by ChatGPT follow Zipf's law. Zipf's law\napproximately holds across all natural and artificially constructed human\nlanguages. According to Zipf's law, the word frequencies in a text corpus are\ninversely proportional to their rank in the frequency table. This means that\nthe most frequent word appears about twice as often as the second most frequent\nword, three times as often as the third most frequent word, and so on. We\nhypothesize that Zipf's law will hold for genlangs because (1) genlangs created\nby ChatGPT fundamentally operate in the same way as human language with respect\nto the semantic usefulness of certain tokens, and (2) ChatGPT has been trained\non a corpora of text that includes many different languages, all of which\nexhibit Zipf's law to varying degrees. Through statistical linguistics, we aim\nto understand if LLM-based languages statistically look human. Our findings\nindicate that genlangs adhere closely to Zipf's law, supporting the hypothesis\nthat genlangs created by ChatGPT exhibit similar statistical properties to\nnatural and artificial human languages. We also conclude that with human\nassistance, AI is already capable of creating the world's first\nfully-functional genlang, and we call for its development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2023 20:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Secondly, the Fama-French\nthree-factor model, which uses a combination of market, size and value factors\nto price capital assets, is analysed, showing that it is able to capture most\nof the variation in A-share market returns, with an adjusted R-squared greater\nthan 0.88 for the 25 portfolios constructed.
