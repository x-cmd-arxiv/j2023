The ability to switch between\nappropriate states (phenotypes) in response to different conditions is\nessential for biological functions. How are robustness and plasticity\nsimultaneously acquired through evolution? We examine the evolution of\ngenotypes that realize plastic switching between two phenotypes upon external\ninputs, as well as stationary expressions of phenotypes. We introduce a\nstatistical physics model consisting of spins, with active and regulatory\nsites, which are distinct from each other. We represent the phenotype and\ngenotype as spin configurations and the spin-spin interactions, respectively.\nThe fitness for selection is given so that it takes a higher value as more of\nthe active sites take two requested spin configurations depending on the\nregulation. We numerically evolve the interaction matrix by changing them with\nmutations and selection of those with higher fitness. Our numerical simulations\nshow that characteristic genotypes evolve slightly above the transition\ntemperature between replica symmetric and replica symmetry breaking phase.\nThese genotypes shape two spin configurations separately depending on the\nregulation, where the two phenotypes are dominantly represented by the\ngenotypes' first and second eigenmodes, and smooth switching of two phenotypes\nare achieved by following a one-dimensional path connecting the two phenotypes.\nUpon changes in regulations, spin configurations are attracted to this path,\nwhich allows for robust and plastic switching between the two phenotypes. The\nstatistical-physics analysis show that the free energy landscape has a valley\nalong the switching path. Our finding indicates that the compatibility of the\nrobustness and plasticity is acquired by the evolution of the\nlow-dimensionality in the phenotype space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 16:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

To\naddress this issue, we propose Dehazing-NeRF, a method that can recover clear\nNeRF from hazy image inputs. Our method simulates the physical imaging process\nof hazy images using an atmospheric scattering model, and jointly learns the\natmospheric scattering model and a clean NeRF model for both image dehazing and\nnovel view synthesis.

The\nmost appealing aspect of the spin-orbit coupling is the apparent Magnus force\nsensed by a spin system which locks the Fermi momentum with electron spin in a\nfascinating manner. In the current carrying state, the resulting macroscopic\nspin polarization becomes directly accessible in the form of spin current or\nspin density. At a Rashba interface, for example, a charge current shifts the\nspin-locked Fermi surface, leading to a non-equilibrium spin density at the\ninterface, commonly known as the Rashba-Edelstein effect. Since the\nRashba-Edelstein effect is an intrinsically interface property, direct\ndetection of the spin moment is harder to set-up. Here we demonstrate that a\nsimple planar Josephson Junction geometry, realized by placing two closely\nspaced superconducting electrodes on such a Rashba interface, allows a direct\nestimation of strength of the non-equilibrium spin moment. Measurements of\nFraunhofer patterns of Nb-(Pt/Cu)-Nb planar Josephson junctions in a\nperpendicular magnetic field showed a shift of the center of the Fraunhofer\npattern to a non-zero field value. By performing extensive control\nmeasurements, we argue that the screening currents in the junction effectively\nlock the external field with the spin moment of the Rashba-Edelstein effect\ninduced spin-density, leading to the observed shift in the Fraunhofer patterns.\nThis simple experiment offers a fresh perspective on direct detection of spin\npolarization induced by various spin-orbit effects. Very interestingly, this\ndevice platform also offers the possibility of retaining a controllable phase\nat zero field in the junction without using any magnetic material, and thereby\nuseful as phase batteries for superconducting quantum circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 18:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

The intuition, often termed visual\nintuitive physics, is a critical ability that allows us to make effective plans\nto manipulate the scene to achieve desired outcomes without relying on\nextensive trial and error. In this paper, we present a framework capable of\nlearning 3D-grounded visual intuitive physics models from videos of complex\nscenes with fluids. Our method is composed of a conditional Neural Radiance\nField (NeRF)-style visual frontend and a 3D point-based dynamics prediction\nbackend, using which we can impose strong relational and structural inductive\nbias to capture the structure of the underlying environment. Unlike existing\nintuitive point-based dynamics works that rely on the supervision of dense\npoint trajectory from simulators, we relax the requirements and only assume\naccess to multi-view RGB images and (imperfect) instance masks acquired using\ncolor prior. This enables the proposed model to handle scenarios where accurate\npoint estimation and tracking are hard or impossible. We generate datasets\nincluding three challenging scenarios involving fluid, granular materials, and\nrigid objects in the simulation. The datasets do not include any dense particle\ninformation so most previous 3D-based intuitive physics pipelines can barely\ndeal with that. We show our model can make long-horizon future predictions by\nlearning from raw images and significantly outperforms models that do not\nemploy an explicit 3D representation space.

However, so far,\nLLMs cannot reliably solve long-horizon planning problems. By contrast,\nclassical planners, once a problem is given in a formatted way, can use\nefficient search algorithms to quickly identify correct, or even optimal,\nplans. In an effort to get the best of both worlds, this paper introduces\nLLM+P, the first framework that incorporates the strengths of classical\nplanners into LLMs. LLM+P takes in a natural language description of a planning\nproblem, then returns a correct (or optimal) plan for solving that problem in\nnatural language. LLM+P does so by first converting the language description\ninto a file written in the planning domain definition language (PDDL), then\nleveraging classical planners to quickly find a solution, and then translating\nthe found solution back into natural language. Along with LLM+P, we define a\ndiverse set of different benchmark problems taken from common planning\nscenarios. Via a comprehensive set of experiments on these benchmark problems,\nwe find that LLM+P is able to provide optimal solutions for most problems,\nwhile LLMs fail to provide even feasible plans for most problems.\\footnote{The\ncode and results are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/Cranial-XIX/llm-pddl.git.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2023 20:34:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 02:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

Meanwhile,\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can flexibly control the scattered\nelectromagnetic (EM) fields for sensing the target and can thus help\ncomputational imaging in the near field. In this paper, we propose a near-field\nimaging scheme based on holograghic aperture RIS. Specifically, we first\nestablish an end-to-end EM propagation model from the perspective of Maxwell\nequations. To mitigate the inherent ill conditioning of the inverse problem in\nthe imaging system, we design the EM field patterns as masks that help\ntranslate the inverse problem into a forward problem. Next, we utilize RIS to\ngenerate different virtual EM masks on the target surface and calculate the\ncross-correlation between the mask patterns and the electric field strength at\nthe receiver. We then provide a RIS design scheme for virtual EM masks by\nemploying a regularization technique. The cross-range resolution of the\nproposed method is analyzed based on the spatial spectrum of the generated\nmasks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve\nhigh-quality imaging. Moreover, the imaging quality can be improved by\ngenerating more virtual EM masks, by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nat the receiver, or by placing the target closer to the RIS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 01:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Due to the high cost of model training -- such as collecting\nrelevant samples, labeling data, and consuming computing power --\nmodel-stealing attack is one of the most fundamental but vitally important\nissues. When it comes to quantum computing, such a quantum machine learning\n(QML) model-stealing attack also exists and it is even more severe because the\ntraditional encryption method can hardly be directly applied to quantum\ncomputation. On the other hand, due to the limited quantum computing resources,\nthe monetary cost of training QML model can be even higher than classical ones\nin the near term. Therefore, a well-tuned QML model developed by a company can\nbe delegated to a quantum cloud provider as a service to be used by ordinary\nusers. In this case, the QML model will be leaked if the cloud provider is\nunder attack. To address such a problem, we propose a novel framework, namely\nQuMoS, to preserve model security. Instead of applying encryption algorithms,\nwe propose to distribute the QML model to multiple physically isolated quantum\ncloud providers. As such, even if the adversary in one provider can obtain a\npartial model, the information of the full model is maintained in the QML\nservice company. Although promising, we observed an arbitrary model design\nunder distributed settings cannot provide model security. We further developed\na reinforcement learning-based security engine, which can automatically\noptimize the model design under the distributed setting, such that a good\ntrade-off between model performance and security can be made. Experimental\nresults on four datasets show that the model design proposed by QuMoS can\nachieve a close accuracy to the model designed with neural architecture search\nunder centralized settings while providing the highest security than the\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 01:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

To this end, we propose TriSIM4Rec, a triple structural\ninformation modeling method for accurate, explainable and interactive\nrecommendation on dynamic interaction graphs. Specifically, TriSIM4Rec consists\nof 1) a dynamic ideal low-pass graph filter to dynamically mine co-occurrence\ninformation in user-item interactions, which is implemented by incremental\nsingular value decomposition (SVD); 2) a parameter-free attention module to\ncapture sequential information of user interactions effectively and\nefficiently; and 3) an item transition matrix to store the transition\nprobabilities of item pairs. Then, we fuse the predictions from the triple\nstructural information sources to obtain the final recommendation results. By\nanalyzing the relationship between the SVD-based and the recently emerging\ngraph signal processing (GSP)-based collaborative filtering methods, we find\nthat the essence of SVD is an ideal low-pass graph filter, so that the interest\nvector space in TriSIM4Rec can be extended to achieve explainable and\ninteractive recommendation, making it possible for users to actively break\nthrough the information cocoons.

Based on the hydrodynamic simulation TNG300-1, we\nanalyze the cross power spectrum matrix of galaxies in the magnitude and color\nspace of multiple photometric bands. (1) We find that the first principal\ncomponent $E_i^{(1)}$ is an excellent proxy of the galaxy deterministic bias\n$b_{D}$, in that $E_i^{(1)}=\\sqrt{\\lambda^P(1)/P_{mm}}b_{D,i}$.

As consumer cameras are not\ndesigned for high-precision visual tasks, manufacturers do not disclose\nspectral sensitivities. Their estimation requires a costly optical setup, which\ntriggered researchers to come up with numerous indirect methods that aim to\nlower cost and complexity by using color targets. However, the use of color\ntargets gives rise to new complications that make the estimation more\ndifficult, and consequently, there currently exists no simple, low-cost, robust\ngo-to method for spectral sensitivity estimation. Furthermore, even if not\nlimited by hardware or cost, researchers frequently work with imagery from\nmultiple cameras that they do not have in their possession. To provide a\npractical solution to this problem, we propose a framework for spectral\nsensitivity estimation that not only does not require any hardware, but also\ndoes not require physical access to the camera itself. Similar to other work,\nwe formulate an optimization problem that minimizes a two-term objective\nfunction: a camera-specific term from a system of equations, and a universal\nterm that bounds the solution space. Different than other work, we use publicly\navailable high-quality calibration data to construct both terms. We use the\ncolorimetric mapping matrices provided by the Adobe DNG Converter to formulate\nthe camera-specific system of equations, and constrain the solutions using an\nautoencoder trained on a database of ground-truth curves.

The approach falls within the\nreachability analysis framework and is based on the computation of\ninner-approximations of controlled reach-avoid sets(CRSs). Given a target set\nand a safe set, the controlled reach-avoid set is the set of states such that\nstarting from each of them, there exists at least one controller to ensure that\nthe system can enter the target set while staying inside the safe set before\nthe target hitting time. Therefore, the boundary of the controlled reach-avoid\nset acts as a barrier, which separating states capable of achieving the\nreach-avoid objective from those that are not, and thus the computed\ninner-approximation provides a viable space for the system to achieve the\nreach-avoid objective.

It is difficult to provide\nevidence about the safe functioning of such components. To overcome this\nproblem, Runtime Assurance Architecture (RTA) solutions have been proposed. The\n\\RAP's decision component evaluates the system's safety risk and whenever the\nrisk is higher than acceptable the RTA switches to a safety mode that, for\nexample, activates a controller with strong evidence for its safe functioning.\nIn this way, RTAs increase CPS runtime safety and resilience by recovering the\nsystem from higher to lower risk levels. The goal of this paper is to automate\nrecovery proofs of CPSes using RTAs. We first formalize the key verification\nproblems, namely, the decision sampling-time adequacy problem and the\ntime-bounded recoverability problem. We then demonstrate how to automatically\ngenerate proofs for the proposed verification problems using symbolic rewriting\nmodulo SMT. Automation is enabled by integrating the rewriting logic tool\n(Maude), which generates sets of non-linear constraints, with an SMT-solver\n(Z3) to produce proofs\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 07:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

To achieve the\nobjective, we propose a diffusion-based trajectory generation (Diff-Traj)\nframework, effectively integrating the generation capability of the diffusion\nmodel and learning from the spatial-temporal features of trajectories.\nSpecifically, we gradually convert real trajectories to noise through a forward\ntrajectory noising process. Then, Diff-Traj reconstructs forged trajectories\nfrom the noise by a reverse trajectory denoising process. In addition, we\ndesign a trajectory UNet (Traj-UNet) structure to extract trajectory features\nfor noise level prediction during the reverse process. Experiments on two\nreal-world datasets show that Diff-Traj can be intuitively applied to generate\nhigh-quality trajectories while retaining the original distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 08:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

However, such a network suffers from\ntedious hyper-parameter tuning and task misalignment, limiting the tracking\nperformance. Towards these concerns, we propose a simple yet effective\none-stage point-to-box network for point cloud-based 3D single object tracking.\nIt synchronizes 3D proposal generation and center-ness score prediction by a\nparallel predictor without tedious hyper-parameters. To guide a task-aligned\nscore ranking of proposals, a center-aware focal loss is proposed to supervise\nthe training of the center-ness branch, which enhances the network's\ndiscriminative ability to distinguish proposals of different quality. Besides,\nwe design a binary target classifier to identify target-relevant points. By\nintegrating the derived classification scores with the center-ness scores, the\nresulting network can effectively suppress interference proposals and further\nmitigate task misalignment.

In such\ncases, conventional methods generate reconstructions with significant\nartifacts. In order to remove these artifacts, regularization methods must be\napplied that beneficially incorporate additional information. An important\nexample of such methods is TV reconstruction. It is well-known that this\ntechnique can efficiently compensate for the missing data and reduce\nreconstruction artifacts. At the same time, however, tomographic data is also\ncontaminated by noise, which poses an additional challenge. The use of a single\npenalty term (regularizer) within a variational regularization framework must\ntherefore account for both, the missing data and the noise. However, a single\nregularizer may not be ideal for both tasks. For example, the TV regularizer is\na poor choice for noise reduction across different scales, in which case\n$\\ell^1$-curvelet regularization methods work well. To address this issue, in\nthis paper we introduce a novel variational regularization framework that\ncombines the advantages of two different regularizers.

Both reconstruction stages are connected by a\ndata consistency condition, which makes them close to each other in the data\ndomain.

This research proposes to condense video generation into a problem\nof motion generation, to improve the expressiveness of motion and make video\ngeneration more manageable. This can be achieved by breaking down the video\ngeneration process into latent motion generation and video reconstruction. We\npresent a latent motion diffusion (LaMD) framework, which consists of a\nmotion-decomposed video autoencoder and a diffusion-based motion generator, to\nimplement this idea. Through careful design, the motion-decomposed video\nautoencoder can compress patterns in movement into a concise latent motion\nrepresentation. Meanwhile, the diffusion-based motion generator is able to\nefficiently generate realistic motion on a continuous latent space under\nmulti-modal conditions, at a cost that is similar to that of image diffusion\nmodels. Results show that LaMD generates high-quality videos with a wide range\nof motions, from stochastic dynamics to highly controllable movements.

In dynamic setups, users can freely depart and\nenter the network at any moment. The shared caching concept has the potential\nto handle this issue by assigning $K$ users to $P$ caching profiles, where all\n$\\eta_{p}$ users assigned to profile $p$ store the same cache content defined\nby that profile. The existing schemes, however, cannot be applied in general\nand are not dynamic in the true sense as they put constraints on the\ntransmitter-side spatial multiplexing gain $\\alpha$. Specifically, they work\nonly if $\\alpha \\leq \\min_{p} \\eta_{p}$ or $\\alpha \\geq \\hat{\\eta}$, where in\nthe latter case, $\\gamma$ is the normalized cache size of each user,\n$\\hat{\\eta}$ is an arbitrary parameter satisfying $1 \\leq \\hat{\\eta} \\leq\n\\max_{p} \\eta_{p}$, and the extra condition of $\\alpha \\geq K\\gamma$ should\nalso be met.

However, an industrial robot's working space is mostly\nrestricted in real working environments, making the collected samples fail in\ncovering the actual working space to result in the overall migration data.

To cater for\nmultiple mobile users, adjusting IRS beamforming patterns over time, i.e.,\ndynamic IRS beamforming (DIBF), is generally needed for achieving satisfactory\nperformance, which results in high controlling power consumption and overhead.\nTo avoid such cost, we propose a new architecture based on the static regulated\nIRS for wireless coverage enhancement, where the principle of distributed\nmultiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) is integrated into the system to\nexploite the diversity of spatial directions provided by multiple access points\n(APs). For this new D-MIMO empowered static IRS architecture, the total target\narea is partitioned into several subareas and each subarea is served by an\nassigned AP.

It treats the players asymmetrically, considering only one of the\ntwo players as having imperfect information when evaluating truth, resp.,\nfalsity, of a sentence.

Previous methods rely on the learnable weights of the\nclassification layer that represent the identities. However, the evaluation\nprocess learns no identity representation and drops the classifier from\ntraining. This inconsistency could confuse the feature encoder in understanding\nthe evaluation goal and hinder the effect of identity-based methods. To\nalleviate the above problem, we propose a novel approach namely Contrastive\nRegularization for Face recognition (CoReFace) to apply image-level\nregularization in feature representation learning. Specifically, we employ\nsample-guided contrastive learning to regularize the training with the\nimage-image relationship directly, which is consistent with the evaluation\nprocess. To integrate contrastive learning into face recognition, we augment\nembeddings instead of images to avoid the image quality degradation. Then, we\npropose a novel contrastive loss for the representation distribution by\nincorporating an adaptive margin and a supervised contrastive mask to generate\nsteady loss values and avoid the collision with the classification supervision\nsignal. Finally, we discover and solve the semantically repetitive signal\nproblem in contrastive learning by exploring new pair coupling protocols.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our CoReFace\nwhich is highly competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 14:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

Second,\nwe find that the statistical differences between natural and DeepFake images\nare positively associated with the distribution shifting between the two kinds\nof images, and we propose to use a distribution-aware loss to guide the\noptimization of different degradations. As a result, the feature distributions\nof generated adversarial examples is close to the natural images.Furthermore,\nwe extend the StatAttack to a more powerful version, MStatAttack, where we\nextend the single-layer degradation to multi-layer degradations sequentially\nand use the loss to tune the combination weights jointly.

DomMa consist of 100,000 questions in both Chinese and English\nsourced from graduate entrance examinations and undergraduate exams in Chinese\ncollege.

The\nforward current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of Ni/GaN vertical Schottky\ndiodes fabricated on the epilayer gave average values of the Schottky barrier\nheight of 0.79 eV and ideality factor of 1.14. A statistical analysis over a\nset of diodes, combined with temperature dependence measurements, confirmed the\nformation of an inhomogeneous Schottky barrier in this material. From a plot of\nFB versus n, an ideal homogeneous barrier close to 0.9 eV was estimated,\nsimilar to that extrapolated by capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis.

Recent advancement of\nlarge language models (LLMs) motivates us to study how far this challenge can\nbe addressed by ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art LLM. Unfortunately, our study shows\nthat ChatGPT has a low probability (28.8%) of finding correct failure-inducing\ntest cases for buggy programs. A possible reason is that finding\nfailure-inducing test cases requires analyzing the subtle code differences\nbetween a buggy program and its correct version.

Our experimental results show that our proposed method can\nincrease the accuracy of 3D reconstruction from a single fringe pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 08:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

In this\nattack, a synthetic image is produced and merged with genuine. Next, the\nresultant image is user for authentication. Numerous deep neural convolutional\narchitectures have been proposed in literature for face Morphing Attack\nDetection (MADs) to prevent such attacks and lessen the risks associated with\nthem. Although, deep learning models achieved optimal results in terms of\nperformance, it is difficult to understand and analyse these networks since\nthey are black box/opaque in nature. As a consequence, incorrect judgments may\nbe made. There is, however, a dearth of literature that explains\ndecision-making methods of black box deep learning models for biometric\nPresentation Attack Detection (PADs) or MADs that can aid the biometric\ncommunity to have trust in deep learning-based biometric systems for\nidentification and authentication in various security applications such as\nborder control, criminal database establishment etc. In this work, we present a\nnovel visual explanation approach named Ensemble XAI integrating Saliency maps,\nClass Activation Maps (CAM) and Gradient-CAM (Grad-CAM) to provide a more\ncomprehensive visual explanation for a deep learning prognostic model\n(EfficientNet-B1) that we have employed to predict whether the input presented\nto a biometric authentication system is morphed or genuine. The\nexperimentations have been performed on three publicly available datasets\nnamely Face Research Lab London Set, Wide Multi-Channel Presentation Attack\n(WMCA), and Makeup Induced Face Spoofing (MIFS). The experimental evaluations\naffirms that the resultant visual explanations highlight more fine-grained\ndetails of image features/areas focused by EfficientNet-B1 to reach decisions\nalong with appropriate reasoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 13:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-01"}

KI-67 proliferation and tumor-infiltrated lymphocyte\nestimation play a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and treatment. PathRTM is an\nextension of the PathoNet work, which uses single pixel keypoints for within\neach cell. We demonstrate that PathRTM, with higher-level supervision in the\nform of bounding box labels generated automatically from the keypoints using\nNuClick, can significantly improve KI-67 proliferation and tumorinfiltrated\nlymphocyte estimation. Experiments on our custom dataset show that PathRTM\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in KI-67 immunopositive, immunonegative,\nand lymphocyte detection, with an average precision (AP) of 41.3%. Our results\nsuggest that PathRTM is a promising approach for accurate KI-67 proliferation\nand tumor-infiltrated lymphocyte estimation, offering annotation efficiency,\naccurate predictive capabilities, and improved runtime. The method also enables\nestimation of cell sizes of interest, which was previously unavailable, through\nthe bounding box predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2023 08:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}
