One of the key characteristics of spin glasses is that they\ncontain random disorder, which leads to many possible states of the system\noccurring with very close probabilities. We explore the concept of spin-glass\nsuperposition states (SSs), which are equiprobable SSs of possible electronic\nconfigurations. Using the Edward-Anderson (EA) type SG order parameter $q_{EA}$\nand magnetization, we demonstrate that these SSs can be classified based on\ntheir contribution to distinguishing magnetic order (disorder), such as SG,\n(anti)ferromagnetic (FM), and paramagnetic (PM) phases.

We show\nthat the SG order parameter can be utilized to determine the entanglement of\nmagnetically ordered (disordered) phases, or vice versa, with negativity\nsignifying magnetic order. Our findings provide further insight into the nature\nof quantum SSs and their relevance to SGs and quantum magnets.

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), which transforms a\nfull-precision model into low bit-width directly, is an effective and\nconvenient approach to reduce model inference complexity. But it suffers severe\naccuracy drop when applied to complex tasks such as object detection. PTQ\noptimizes the quantization parameters by different metrics to minimize the\nperturbation of quantization. The p-norm distance of feature maps before and\nafter quantization, Lp, is widely used as the metric to evaluate perturbation.\nFor the specialty of object detection network, we observe that the parameter p\nin Lp metric will significantly influence its quantization performance. We\nindicate that using a fixed hyper-parameter p does not achieve optimal\nquantization performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a framework,\nDetPTQ, to assign different p values for quantizing different layers using an\nObject Detection Output Loss (ODOL), which represents the task loss of object\ndetection. DetPTQ employs the ODOL-based adaptive Lp metric to select the\noptimal quantization parameters. Experiments show that our DetPTQ outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art PTQ methods by a significant margin on both 2D and 3D\nobject detectors.

Recent\nobservations have revealed significant morphological complexities in their\noutflows, most likely caused by a companion. We study the impact of the\nradiation force on such companion-perturbed AGB outflows. We present the\nimplementation of a ray tracer for radiative transfer in smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) and compared four different descriptions of radiative\ntransfer: the free-wind, the geometrical, the Lucy, and the attenuation\napproximation. For both low and high mass-loss rates, the velocity profile of\nthe outflow is modified when going from the free-wind to the geometrical\napproximation, also resulting in a different morphology. In the case of a low\nmass-loss rate, the effect of the Lucy and attenuation approximation is\nnegligible due to the low densities but morphological differences appear in the\nhigh mass-loss rate regime. By comparing the radiative equilibrium temperature\nand radiation force to full 3D radiative transfer, we show that the Lucy\napproximation works best. Although, close to the companion, artificial heating\noccurs and it fails to simulate the shadow cast by the companion. The\nattenuation approximation produces a lower equilibrium temperature and weaker\nradiation force, but it produces the shadow cast by the companion. From the\npredictions of the 3D radiative transfer, we also conclude that a radially\ndirected radiation force is a reasonable assumption. The radiation force thus\nplays a critical role in dust-driven AGB winds, impacting the velocity profile\nand morphological structures. For low mass-loss rates, the geometrical\napproximation suffices, while high mass-loss rates require a more rigorous\nmethod, where the Lucy approximation provides the most accurate results\nalthough not accounting for all effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 16:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

We develop two parameters to quantify and disentangle these\ntwo effects on gas stripping in HI-bearing galaxies: the strength of external\nforces at the optical-disk edge, and the outside-in extents of HI-disk\nstripping. We find that gas stripping is widespread in this group, affecting\n80% of HI-detected non-merging galaxies, and that 34% are experiencing both\ntypes of stripping. Among the galaxies experiencing both effects, the strengths\n(and extents) of ram-pressure and tidal stripping are independent of each\nother. Both strengths are correlated with HI-disk shrinkage. The tidal strength\nis related to a rather uniform reddening of low-mass galaxies\n($M_*<10^9\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$) when tidal stripping is the dominating effect. In\ncontrast, ram pressure is not clearly linked to the color-changing patterns of\ngalaxies in the group. Combining these two stripping extents, we estimate the\ntotal stripping extent, and put forward an empirical model that can describe\nthe decrease of HI richness as galaxies fall toward the group center. The\nstripping timescale we derived decreases with distance to the center, from\n$\\mathord{\\sim}1\\,\\text{Gyr}$ around $R_{200}$ to\n$\\mathord{\\lesssim}10\\,\\text{Myr}$ near the center.

In MetaBEV, signals from multiple sensors are first\nprocessed by modal-specific encoders. Subsequently, a set of dense BEV queries\nare initialized, termed meta-BEV.

These networks use simple spiking neuron models, such as the\n$\\theta$-neuron or the quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neuron, that\nreplicate the essential features of real neural dynamics. Interactions between\nneurons are modeled with infinitely narrow pulses, or spikes, rather than the\nmore complex dynamics of real synapses. To make these networks biologically\nmore plausible, it has been proposed that they must also account for the finite\nwidth of the pulses, which can have a significant impact on the network\ndynamics. However, the derivation and interpretation of these pulses is\ncontradictory and the impact of the pulse shape on the network dynamics is\nlargely unexplored. Here, I take a comprehensive approach to pulse-coupling in\nnetworks of QIF and $\\theta$-neurons. I argue that narrow pulses activate\nvoltage-dependent synaptic conductances and show how to implement them in QIF\nneurons such that their effect can last through the phase after the spike.\nUsing an exact low-dimensional description for networks of globally coupled\nspiking neurons, I prove for instantaneous interactions that collective\noscillations emerge due to an effective coupling through the mean voltage. I\nanalyze the impact of the pulse shape by means of a family of smooth pulse\nfunctions with arbitrary finite width and symmetric or asymmetric shapes. For\nsymmetric pulses, the resulting voltage-coupling is little effective in\nsynchronizing neurons, but pulses that are slightly skewed to the phase after\nthe spike readily generate collective oscillations. The results unveil a\nvoltage-dependent spike synchronization mechanism in neural networks, which is\nfacilitated by pulses of finite width and complementary to traditional synaptic\ntransmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 16:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

Rayleigh backscattering can be particularly difficult to\navoid in wave-guiding systems and arises from both material defects and\ngeometric defects at the subwavelength scale. It has been previously shown that\nsystems with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) can naturally suppress\ndetrimental Rayleigh backscattering, but these approaches have never been\ndemonstrated in integrated photonics or through practical TRS-breaking\ntechniques. In this work, we show that it is possible to suppress\ndisorder-induced Rayleigh backscattering in integrated photonics via electrical\nexcitation, even when defects are clearly present. Our experiment is performed\nin a lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) integrated ring resonator at telecom\nwavelength, in which TRS is strongly broken through an acousto-optic\ninteraction that is induced via radiofrequency input. We present evidence that\nRayleigh backscattering in the resonator is almost completely suppressed by\nmeasuring both the optical density of states and through direct measurements of\nthe back-scattered light. We additionally provide an intuitive argument to show\nthat, in an appropriate frame of reference, the suppression of backscattering\ncan be readily understood as a form of topological protection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 17:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

Ideally, RL theory should be able to provide\nan understanding of why this is, i.e. bounds predictive of practical\nperformance. Unfortunately, current theory does not quite have this ability. We\ncompare standard deep RL algorithms to prior sample complexity prior bounds by\nintroducing a new dataset, BRIDGE. It consists of 155 MDPs from common deep RL\nbenchmarks, along with their corresponding tabular representations, which\nenables us to exactly compute instance-dependent bounds. We find that prior\nbounds do not correlate well with when deep RL succeeds vs. fails, but discover\na surprising property that does. When actions with the highest Q-values under\nthe random policy also have the highest Q-values under the optimal policy, deep\nRL tends to succeed; when they don't, deep RL tends to fail. We generalize this\nproperty into a new complexity measure of an MDP that we call the effective\nhorizon, which roughly corresponds to how many steps of lookahead search are\nneeded in order to identify the next optimal action when leaf nodes are\nevaluated with random rollouts. Using BRIDGE, we show that the effective\nhorizon-based bounds are more closely reflective of the empirical performance\nof PPO and DQN than prior sample complexity bounds across four metrics.

The majority of the ADM gas gravitationally collapses into\ndark \"clumps\" (regions of black hole or mirror star formation), which form a\nprominent bulge and a rotating thick disk in the central galaxy. These clumps\nform early and quickly sink to the inner ~kpc of the galaxy, affecting the\ngalaxy's star-formation history and present-day baryonic and CDM distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Feedback\ncan drive turbulence in the ICM and turbulent dissipation can potentially be an\nimportant source of heating. Due to the limited spatial and spectral\nresolutions of X-ray telescopes, direct observations of turbulence in the hot\nICM have been challenging. Recently, we developed a new method to measure\nturbulence in the ICM using multiphase filaments as tracers. These filaments\nare ubiquitous in cluster centers and can be observed at very high resolution\nusing optical and radio telescopes. We study the kinematics of the filaments by\nmeasuring their velocity structure functions (VSFs) over a wide range of scales\nin the centers of $\\sim 10$ galaxy clusters. We find features of the VSFs that\ncorrelate with the SMBHs activities, suggesting that SMBHs are the main driver\nof gas motions in the centers of galaxy clusters. In all systems, the VSF is\nsteeper than the classical Kolmogorov expectation and the slopes vary from\nsystem to system. One theoretical explanation is that the VSFs we have measured\nso far mostly reflect the motion of the driver (jets and bubbles) rather than\nthe cascade of turbulence. We show that in Abell 1795, the VSF of the outer\nfilaments far from the SMBH flattens on small scales to a Kolmogorov slope,\nsuggesting that the cascade is only detectable farther out with the current\ntelescope resolution. The level of turbulent heating computed at small scales\nis typically an order of magnitude lower than that estimated at the driving\nscale. Even though SMBH feedback heavily influences the kinematics of the ICM\nin cluster centers, the level of turbulence it drives is rather low, and\nturbulent heating can only offset $\\lesssim10\\%$ of the cooling loss,\nconsistent with the findings of numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

In particular, for some\ncombinations of the spin-orbit angle $\\psi$ and the inclination of the stellar\nspin $i_*$, all such planets will eventually transit at some point over the\nduration of their precession period. Thus, as the time over which the sky has\nbeen monitored for transiting planets increases, the frequency of planets with\ndetectable transits will increase, potentially leading to biased estimates of\nexoplanet occurrence rates, especially orbiting more massive stars.\nFurthermore, due to the dependence of the precession period on orbital\nparameters such as spin-orbit misalignment, the observed distributions of such\nparameters may also be biased.

This program represents an\nimaging and spectroscopic survey of 25 reionization-era quasars and their\nenvironments by utilizing the unprecedented capabilities of NIRCam Wide Field\nSlitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) mode. ASPIRE will deliver the largest\n($\\sim280~{\\rm arcmin}^2$) galaxy redshift survey at 3-4 $\\mu$m among JWST\nCycle-1 programs and provide extensive legacy values for studying the formation\nof the earliest supermassive black holes (SMBHs), the assembly of galaxies,\nearly metal enrichment, and cosmic reionization. In this first ASPIRE paper, we\nreport the discovery of a filamentary structure traced by the luminous quasar\nJ0305-3150 and ten [OIII] emitters at $z=6.6$. This structure has a 3D galaxy\noverdensity of $\\delta_{\\rm gal}=12.6$ over 637 cMpc$^3$, one of the most\noverdense structures known in the early universe, and could eventually evolve\ninto a massive galaxy cluster. Together with existing VLT/MUSE and ALMA\nobservations of this field, our JWST observations reveal that J0305-3150 traces\na complex environment where both UV-bright and dusty galaxies are present, and\nindicate that the early evolution of galaxies around the quasar is not\nsimultaneous. In addition, we discovered 31 [OIII] emitters in this field at\nother redshifts, $5.3<z<6.7$, with half of them situated at $z\\sim5.4$ and\n$z\\sim6.2$. This indicates that star-forming galaxies, such as [OIII] emitters,\nare generally clustered at high redshifts. These discoveries demonstrate the\nunparalleled redshift survey capabilities of NIRCam WFSS and the potential of\nthe full ASPIRE survey dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Recent observations suggest a substantial decrease in the magnetic\nbraking efficiency when stars reach a critical value of the Rossby number, the\nstellar rotation period normalized by the convective overturn timescale. Cooler\nstars have deeper convection zones with longer overturn times, reaching this\ncritical Rossby number at slower rotation rates. The nature and timing of the\ntransition to weakened magnetic braking has previously been constrained by\nseveral solar analogs and two slightly hotter stars. In this Letter, we derive\nthe first direct constraints from stars cooler than the Sun. We present new\nspectropolarimetry of the old G8 dwarf $\\tau$ Cet from the Large Binocular\nTelescope, and we reanalyze a published Zeeman Doppler image of the younger G8\nstar 61 UMa, yielding the large-scale magnetic field strengths and\nmorphologies.

Previous work\nshowed efficient radiative cooling enables clouds to survive in hot galactic\nwinds, as can magnetic fields even in purely adiabatic simulations for\nsufficiently small density contrasts between the wind and cloud. In this work,\nwe study the interplay between radiative cooling and magnetic draping via three\ndimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find magnetic fields\ndecrease the critical cloud radius for survival by two orders of magnitude\n(i.e., to sub-pc scales) in the strongly magnetized ($\\beta_{\\rm wind}=1$)\ncase. Our results show magnetic fields (i) accelerate cloud entrainment through\nmagnetic draping, (ii) can cause faster cloud destruction in cases of\ninefficient radiative cooling, (iii) do not significantly suppress mass growth\nfor efficiently cooling clouds, and, crucially, in combination with radiative\ncooling (iv) reduce the average overdensity by providing non-thermal pressure\nsupport of the cold gas. This substantially reduces the acceleration time\ncompared to the destruction time (more than due to draping alone), enhancing\ncloud survival.

Similarly, the popular, apparently\nheuristic strategy of using a decaying threshold in POCS is revealed to be the\nresult of the continuation strategy that HQS must employ to converge to a\nsolution of the minimizer. Finally, we prove that for off-the-grid receivers,\nthe POCS algorithms must operate in an inner-outer fashion (i.e., an inverse\nproblem is solved at each outer iteration). In light of our new theoretical\nunderstanding, we suggest the use of a modern solver such as the Chambolle-Pock\nPrimal-Dual algorithm and show that this can lead to a new POCS-like method\nwith superior interpolation capabilities at nearly the same computational cost\nof the industry-standard POCS method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 19:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 07:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

Recent\n\\textit{in-vitro} experiments provide clear evidence that motile cells are\naffected by the curvature of the substrate on which they migrate, preferring\ncertain curvatures to others, termed ``curvotaxis\". The origin and underlying\nmechanism that gives rise to this curvature sensitivity are not well\nunderstood. Here, we employ a ``minimal cell\" model which is composed of a\nvesicle that contains curved membrane protein complexes, that exert protrusive\nforces on the membrane (representing the pressure due to actin polymerization).\nThis minimal-cell model gives rise to spontaneous emergence of a motile\nphenotype, driven by a lamellipodia-like leading edge. By systematically\nscreening the behaviour of this model on different types of curved substrates\n(sinusoidal, cylinder and tube), we show that minimal ingredients and energy\nterms capture the experimental data. The model recovers the observed migration\non the sinusoidal substrate, where cells move along the grooves (minima), while\navoiding motion along the ridges. In addition, the model predicts the tendency\nof cells to migrate circumferentially on convex substrates and axially on\nconcave ones. Both of these predictions are verified experimentally, on several\ncell types. Altogether, our results identify the minimization of\nmembrane-substrate adhesion energy and binding energy between the membrane\nprotein complexes as key players of curvotaxis in cell migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 19:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

In addition, most models produce only a single prediction at\ntest-time. Our core insight which addresses these shortcomings is that\ncorresponding keypoints between images can be used to obtain the optimal\ntransformation via a differentiable closed-form expression. We use this\nobservation to drive the end-to-end learning of keypoints tailored for the\nregistration task, and without knowledge of ground-truth keypoints. This\nframework not only leads to substantially more robust registration but also\nyields better interpretability, since the keypoints reveal which parts of the\nimage are driving the final alignment.

This study utilizes a novel pre-labeled dataset of\n38048 physician reviews to establish the effectiveness of large language models\nin classifying reviews. Specifically, we compare the performance of traditional\nML models, such as logistic regression and support vector machines, to\ngenerative pre-trained transformer models. Furthermore, we use GPT4, the newest\nmodel in the GPT family, to uncover the key dimensions along which fake and\ngenuine physician reviews differ. Our findings reveal significantly superior\nperformance of GPT-3 over traditional ML models in this context. Additionally,\nour analysis suggests that GPT3 requires a smaller training sample than\ntraditional models, suggesting its appropriateness for tasks with scarce\ntraining data. Moreover, the superiority of GPT3 performance increases in the\ncold start context i.e., when there are no prior reviews of a doctor. Finally,\nwe employ GPT4 to reveal the crucial dimensions that distinguish fake physician\nreviews. In sharp contrast to previous findings in the literature that were\nobtained using simulated data, our findings from a real-world dataset show that\nfake reviews are generally more clinically detailed, more reserved in\nsentiment, and have better structure and grammar than authentic ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 19:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Even in this optimistic scenario, our main\nresults show that it is very difficult to remove the fake news from the\nnetwork, even when the correct news would spread much faster than the fake\nnews.

Rarely are\nsuch models tested to this level, let alone their dependence upon model inputs\nlike sky temperature maps. We therefore test the ability of seven commonly\nemployed foreground models -- including nonlinear and linear forward-models,\npolynomials, and maximally-smooth polynomials -- to fit realistic simulated\nmock spectra, as well as their dependence upon model inputs. The mock spectra\nare synthesized from intrinsic foregrounds with realistic spatial and spectral\nstructure, chromatic beams, horizon profiles, and discrete time-sampling. For a\nsingle LST bin spectrum, the nonlinear-forward model with 4 parameters is\npreferred using a KS-test of the noise-normalized residuals, while the linear\nforward-model fits well with 6-7 parameters. The polynomials and\nmaximally-smooth polynomials, like those employed by the EDGES and SARAS3\nexperiments, cannot produce good fits with 5 parameters.

To reduce such programmings efforts, we have been developing\n``Learning-from-observation (LfO)'' that automatically generates robot programs\nby observing human demonstrations. One of the main issues with introducing this\nLfO system into the domain of household tasks is the cluttered environments,\nwhich cause difficulty in determining which elements are important for task\nexecution when observing demonstrations. To overcome this issue, it is\nnecessary for the system to have common sense shared with the human\ndemonstrator. This paper addresses three relationships that LfO in the\nhousehold domain should focus on when observing demonstrations and proposes\nrepresentations to describe the common sense used by the demonstrator for\noptimal execution of task sequences. Specifically, the paper proposes to use\nlabanotation to describe the postures between the environment and the robot,\ncontact-webs to describe the grasping methods between the robot and the tool,\nand physical and semantic constraints to describe the motions between the tool\nand the environment. Then, based on these representations, the paper formulates\ntask models, machine-independent robot programs, that indicate what to do and\nhow to do. Third, the paper explains the task encoder to obtain task models and\ntask decoder to execute the task models on the robot hardware. Finally, this\npaper presents how the system actually works through several example scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 20:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

These are complex distributions, and it is hard to get a real sense\nfor their dynamics using simplifications like average or median. One metric\nthat characterizes such distributions better is the Gini Index, which on one\nextreme is 0, a completely equitable distribution, and on the other extreme is\n1, the most inequitable, where a single individual has all the resources. Most\nexperts agree that viable economies cannot exist at either extreme, but\nidentifying a preferred range has historically been a matter of conflicting\npolitical philosophies and emotional appeals. This research explores instead\nwhether there might be a theoretical and empirical basis for a preferred Gini\nIndex. Specifically, I explore a simple question: Before financial systems\nexisted, how were natural assets allocated? Intrinsic human attributes such as\nheight, strength, & beauty were the original measures of value in which human\nsocial groups traded. Each of these attributes is distributed in a diverse and\ncharacteristic way, which I propose has gradually established the acceptable\nbounds of inequality through evolutionary psychology. I collect data for a wide\narray of such traits and calculate a Gini Index for them in a novel way\nassuming their magnitudes to be analogous to levels of financial wealth. The\nvalues fall into a surprisingly intuitive pattern ranging from Gini=0.02 to\n0.51. Income distributions in many countries are within the top half of this\nrange after taxes and transfers are applied (0.2 to 0.4). Wealth distributions\non the other hand are mostly outside of this range, with the United States at a\nvery inequitable 0.82. Additional research is needed on the interconnections\nbetween this range of \"natural\" Gini Indexes and human contentment; and whether\nany explicit policy goals should be considered to target them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 21:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Some prediction models have been\nused to make treatment decisions, but this is not appropriate when the data on\nwhich the model was developed included a mix of individuals with some who did\nand others who did not initiate that treatment. By contrast, predictions under\nhypothetical interventions are estimates of what a person's risk of an outcome\nwould be if they were to follow a particular treatment strategy, given their\nindividual characteristics. Such predictions can give important input to\nmedical decision making. However, evaluating predictive performance of\ninterventional predictions is challenging. Standard ways of evaluating\npredictive performance do not apply, because prediction under interventions\ninvolves obtaining predictions of the outcome under conditions that differ from\nthose that are observed for some patients in the validation data.

Indeed, confinement makes all physical properties\nposition-dependent and possibly anisotropic, and characterizing such spatial\nvariations and directionality is an intense area of focus in experimental and\ncomputational studies of confined matter. While this task is fairly\nstraightforward for simple mechanical observables, it is far more daunting for\ntransport properties such as diffusivity that can only be estimated from\nautocorrelations of mechanical observables. For instance, there are well\nestablished methods for estimating diffusivity from experimentally observed or\ncomputationally generated trajectories in the bulk. No rigorous generalizations\nof such methods, however, exist for confined systems. In this work, we present\ntwo filtered covariance estimators for computing anisotropic and\nposition-dependent diffusivity tensors and validate them by applying them to\nstochastic trajectories generated according to known diffusivity profiles.\nThese estimators can accurately capture spatial variations spanning over\nseveral orders of magnitude and assuming different functional forms. Our\napproach is also very robust to implementation details such as the localization\nfunction and time discretization and performs significantly better than\nestimators that are solely based on local covariance. Moreover, the kernel\nfunction does not have to be localized and can instead belong to a dictionary\nof orthogonal functions. Therefore, the proposed estimator can be readily used\nto obtain functional estimates of diffusivity rather than a tabulated\ncollection of pointwise estimates. Nonetheless, the susceptibility of the\nproposed estimators to time discretization is higher close to hard boundaries.\nWe demonstrate this heightened susceptibility to be common among all\ncovariance-based estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 23:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

To learn an optimal policy that maximizes the satisfaction probability,\nwe take a product between a dynamic system and the translated automaton to\nconstruct a product system on which we solve an optimal planning problem. Since\nthis product system has a hybrid product state space that results in reward\nsparsity, we introduce a generalized optimal backup order, in reverse to the\ntopological order, to guide the value backups and accelerate the learning\nprocess. We provide the optimality proof for using the generalized optimal\nbackup order in this optimal planning problem. Further, this paper presents an\nactor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm when topological order applies.\nThis algorithm leverages advanced mathematical techniques and enjoys the\nproperty of hyperparameter self-tuning. We provide proof of the optimality and\nconvergence of our proposed reinforcement learning algorithm. We use neural\nnetworks to approximate the value function and policy function for hybrid\nproduct state space. Furthermore, we observe that assigning integer numbers to\nautomaton states can rank the value or policy function approximated by neural\nnetworks. To break the ordinal relationship, we use an individual neural\nnetwork for each automaton state's value (policy) function, termed modular\nlearning. We conduct two experiments.

However, many\nreal flocks are small sized (10 to 100 individuals), called the mesoscopic\nscales, where stochasticity arising from the finite flock sizes is important.\nDeveloping mesoscopic scale equations, typically in the form of stochastic\ndifferential equations, can be challenging even for the simplest of the\ncollective motion models. Here, we take a novel data-driven equation learning\napproach to construct the stochastic mesoscopic descriptions of a simple\nself-propelled particle (SPP) model of collective motion. In our SPP model, a\nfocal individual can interact with k randomly chosen neighbours within an\ninteraction radius. We consider k = 1 (called stochastic pairwise\ninteractions), k = 2 (stochastic ternary interactions), and k equalling all\navailable neighbours within the interaction radius (equivalent to Vicsek-like\nlocal averaging). The data-driven mesoscopic equations reveal that the\nstochastic pairwise interaction model produces a novel form of collective\nmotion driven by a multiplicative noise term (hence termed, noise-induced\nflocking). In contrast, for higher order interactions (k > 1), including\nVicsek-like averaging interactions, yield collective motion driven primarily by\nthe deterministic forces. We find that the relation between the parameters of\nthe mesoscopic equations describing the dynamics and the population size are\nsensitive to the density and to the interaction radius, exhibiting deviations\nfrom mean-field theoretical expectations. We provide semi-analytic arguments\npotentially explaining these observed deviations.

The existing defense methods are either\nlimited in application or only defend on results, but not on process. In this\nwork, we propose a novel method to infer the adversary intent and discover\naudio adversarial examples based on the AEs generation process. The insight of\nthis method is based on the observation: many existing audio AE attacks utilize\nquery-based methods, which means the adversary must send continuous and similar\nqueries to target ASR models during the audio AE generation process.

Here, we present an innovative detaching\napproach for thin films: Electro-capillary peeling method. The\nelectro-capillary peeling method achieves thin films' detachment by driving\nliquid to percolate and spread into the bonding layer under electric fields.\nCompared with traditional methods, thin film detached by this novel peeling\nmode shows a much lower deformation and strain of film (reaching 86%).\nEvaluated by various applied voltages and films, the electro-capillary peeling\nmethod shows active control characterizations and is appropriate in a broad\nrange of films. Theoretically, it is demonstrated that the electro-capillary\npeeling method is actualized by utilizing Maxwell stress to compete with the\nfilm's adhesive stress and tension stress. The peeling length versus time,\napplied voltage, film's thickness, and elastic modulus are described by $r\\sim\nt$, $r \\sim U$, $r\\sim d_{0}^{-1/2}$, and $r\\sim E^{-1/2}$, respectively.\nAdditionally, observations of critical peeling voltage present that the thin\nfilm is readily detached by using the electro-capillary peeling method at the\nultra-low voltage of only 0.7 V.

Given a pre-trained network trained\non source domain data, the proposed SATA framework modifies the batch-norm\naffine parameters using source anchoring based self-distillation. This ensures\nthat the model incorporates the knowledge of the newly encountered domains,\nwithout catastrophically forgetting about the previously seen ones.

Specifically, we design a set of prompts and evaluate\nChatGPT's performance on five recommendation scenarios. Unlike traditional\nrecommendation methods, we do not fine-tune ChatGPT during the entire\nevaluation process, relying only on the prompts themselves to convert\nrecommendation tasks into natural language tasks. Further, we explore the use\nof few-shot prompting to inject interaction information that contains user\npotential interest to help ChatGPT better understand user needs and interests.\nComprehensive experimental results on Amazon Beauty dataset show that ChatGPT\nhas achieved promising results in certain tasks and is capable of reaching the\nbaseline level in others. We conduct human evaluations on two\nexplainability-oriented tasks to more accurately evaluate the quality of\ncontents generated by different models. And the human evaluations show ChatGPT\ncan truly understand the provided information and generate clearer and more\nreasonable results. We hope that our study can inspire researchers to further\nexplore the potential of language models like ChatGPT to improve recommendation\nperformance and contribute to the advancement of the recommendation systems\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 08:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Second, the\ndriving image does not explicitly disentangle movement-relevant information,\nsuch as poses and expressions, which restricts the manipulation of different\nattributes during generation. Third, the generated videos tend to have\nflickering artifacts due to the inconsistency of the extracted landmarks\nbetween adjacent frames.

To date, only a few\nAGB stars have been observed showing an extended shell in the ultraviolet: the\ncometary tail drifting away from $o$ Ceti, and a bubble around IRC+10216, CIT6,\nand U Hya. This paper describes a search of UV extended shells around AGB stars\nusing archival GALEX far-UV images. After inspecting visually 282 GALEX images,\nwe identified the fourth discovery of a UV bubble around the AGB star R Dor.\nThe bubble is seen as a 26'x29' ring, corresponding to an actual diameter of\n0.41x0.46 parsec$^2$. The mass of the thin UV bubble is estimated to be\n$\\simeq$0.003 $M_{\\odot}$. The morphological asymmetry (less than $\\sim 20$\\%)\nand brightness variations of this shell are uncorrelated with the stellar\nproper motion and thus they can rather be ascribed to inhomogeneities in the\nISM.

In this paper, we introduce Ranking Approaches for Unknown\nStructures (RAUS), an automated framework to systematically inform variable\nordering and learn networks end-to-end.

Longitudinal\nobservations from 67,460 patients were collected from our electronic health\nrecord (EHR) and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria were\nthen applied to define AKI events. RAUS learns multiple DBNs simultaneously to\npredict a future AKI event at different time points (i.e., 24-, 48-, 72-hours\nin advance of AKI). We also compared the results of the learned AKI prediction\nmodels and variable orderings to baseline techniques (logistic regression,\nrandom forests, and extreme gradient boosting).

Under the\npresent hardware infrastructure, decoherence of quantum states poses a\nsignificant challenge to performing perfect or efficient teleportation, meaning\nthat a teleportation-based protocol must be run multiple times to observe\nsuccess. Thus, performance analyses of such protocols usually consider the\ncompletion time, i.e., the time until success, rather than the duration of a\nsingle attempt. Moreover, due to decoherence, the success of an attempt is in\ngeneral dependent on the duration of individual phases of that attempt, as\nquantum states must wait in memory while the success or failure of a generation\nphase is communicated to the relevant parties. In this work, we do a\nperformance analysis of the completion time of the BB84 protocol in a setting\nwhere the sender and the receiver are connected via a single quantum repeater\nand the only quantum channel between them does not see any adversarial attack.\nAssuming certain distributional forms for the generation and communication\nphases of teleportation, we provide a method to compute the MGF of the\ncompletion time and subsequently derive an estimate of the CDF and a bound on\nthe tail probability. This result helps us gauge the (tail) behaviour of the\ncompletion time in terms of the parameters characterising the elementary phases\nof teleportation, without having to run the protocol multiple times. We also\nprovide an efficient simulation scheme to generate the completion time, which\nrelies on expressing the completion time in terms of aggregated teleportation\ntimes.

We find that when the size of\nthe system is of the order of the Jeans length associated with the\nself-interactions, a central soliton quickly forms and makes about 50% of the\ntotal mass. However, if the halo is ten times greater than this\nself-interaction scale, a soliton only quickly forms in cuspy halos where the\ncentral density is large enough to trigger the self-interactions. If the halo\nhas a flat core, it takes a longer time for a soliton to appear, after small\nrandom fluctuations on the de Broglie wavelength size build up to reach a large\nenough density.

MvNet investigates the possibility of leveraging the\noff-the-shelf 2D pre-trained models to achieve the few-shot classification,\nwhich can alleviate the over-dependence issue of the existing baseline models\ntowards the large-scale annotated 3D point cloud data. Specifically, MvNet\nfirst encodes a 3D point cloud into multi-view image features for a number of\ndifferent views. Then, a novel multi-view prompt fusion module is developed to\neffectively fuse information from different views to bridge the gap between 3D\npoint cloud data and 2D pre-trained models. A set of 2D image prompts can then\nbe derived to better describe the suitable prior knowledge for a large-scale\npre-trained image model for few-shot 3D point cloud classification. Extensive\nexperiments on ModelNet, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNet datasets demonstrate that\nMvNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance for 3D few-shot point cloud\nimage classification.

CCGG emerges naturally in the Palatini formulation, where\nthe vierbein and the spin connection are independent fields. Neither torsion\nnor non-metricity are excluded.

Thereby, the original system\nof matter fields in flat spacetime, represented by non-degenerate Hamiltonian\ndensities, is amended by spacetime fields. The coupling of matter and spacetime\nfields leaves the action integral of the combined system invariant under active\nlocal Lorentz transformations and passive diffeomorphisms, aka Principle of\nGeneral Relativity. We consider the Klein-Gordon, Maxwell-Proca, and Dirac\nfields and derive the corresponding equations of motion.

The affine connection is a function of the spin connection and\nvierbein fields. Requesting the spin connection to be anti-symmetric gives\nnaturally metric compatibility.

While professional\ntest drivers are supported with technical means to semi-automatically annotate\ndriving maneuvers to allow better event identification, simple data loggers in\nlarge vehicle fleets typically lack automatic and detailed event classification\nand hence, extra effort is needed when post-processing such data. Yet, the data\nquality from professional test drivers is apparently higher than the one from\nlarge fleets where labels are missing, but the non-annotated data set from\nlarge vehicle fleets is much more representative for typical, realistic driving\nscenarios to be handled by automated vehicles.

We find that the low energy properties of axion are\nvery sensitive to the phase transition of Quantum Chromodynamics, in\nparticular, when the bulk quark matter is close to criticality. Then, for the\nfirst time in the literature we compute the axion potential at finite quark\nchemical potential and study the axion domain walls in bulk quark matter. We\nfind that the energy barrier between two adjacent vacuum states decrease in the\nchirally restored phase: this results in a lower surface tension of the walls.\nFinally, we comment on the possibility of production of walls in dense quark\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 11:58:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

By deploying current Security\nfootages, CCTV cameras, and computer vision (CV), it will also be able to\nidentify those who are experiencing the calamity of social separation.\nProviding tools for safety and security, this technology disposes the need for\na labor-force based surveillance system, yet a manual governing body is still\nrequired to monitor, track, and inform on the violations that are committed.\nAny sort of infrastructure, including universities, hospitals, offices of the\ngovernment, schools, and building sites, can employ the technology. Therefore,\nthe risk management system created to report and analyze video streams along\nwith the social distance detector system might help to ensure our protection\nand security as well as the security of our loved ones.

The recent development of brain-machine\ninterfaces enables online control of external devices and closed-loop\nneuroprosthetics using single-unit activity, making online spike sorting\ndesired. Most existing spike sorters work in an offline manner, i.e., sorting\nafter data collection. However, offline spike sorters usually suffer from\nperformance degradation in online tasks due to the instability of neural\nsignals. In an online process, neuronal properties can change over time (such\nas waveform deformations), and new neurons can appear. Therefore, a static\nspike sorter requires periodic recalibration to maintain its performance.

NeuSort can robustly track individual neurons' activities against\nwaveform deformations and automatically recognize new coming neurons in\nreal-time. The adaptation ability of NeuSort is achieved by online parameter\nupdates of the neuromorphic model, according to the plasticity learning rule\ninspired by biological neural systems.

In this\npaper, we present a holistic vision of a limitless, wireless metaverse that\ndistills the metaverse into an intersection of seven worlds and experiences\nthat include the: i) physical, digital, and virtual worlds, along with the ii)\ncyber, extended, live, and parallel experiences.

We\nparticularly highlight the need for end-to-end synchronization of DTs, and the\nrole of human-level AI and reasoning abilities for cognitive avatars.

Moreover, by making use of the gauge freedom\nof the Killing vector field $\\ppa{t}{a}$, we find a favorite parameter $t'$\nwhich just gives the first law and makes the mass integrable.

In this paper, we apply global and local measures of entropy to the\ncommuting networks of 25 US cities to capture structural diversity in\nresidential and work patterns.

Recent work has begun to apply the divergence\nmethod to produce regional methane emission rate estimates.

Our analysis is limited to spacetimes\nsolving the Einstein's EoM, thus we can not exclude the presence of other\nG\\\"{o}del-type solutions solving the EoM of local and nonlocal higher\nderivative theories but not the Einstein's EoM.It turns out that the\nhomogeneous G\\\"{o}del spacetimes without CTC are basically exact solutions for\nall theories, while the metrics with CTC are not exact solutions of\n(super-)renormalizable local or nonlocal gravitational theories. Hence, the\nquantum renormalizability property excludes theories suffering of the\nG\\\"{o}del's causality violation. We also comment about nonlocal gravity\nnon-minimally coupled to matter. In this class of theories, all the G\\\"{o}del's\nspacetimes, with or without CTC, are exact solutions at classical level.\nHowever, the quantum corrections, although perturbative, very likely spoil the\nexactness of such solutions. Therefore, we can state that the G\\\"{o}del's\nUniverses with CTC and the super-renormalizability are mutually exclusive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 13:51:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

On top of that, the trend of the future costs of the\nenvironmental damage is unknown: Will global warming dominate or technological\nadvancements prevail? The truth is that we do not know which scenario will be\nrealised and the scientific debate is still open. This paper captures those two\nlayers of uncertainty by developing a real-options-like model in which a\ndecision maker aims at adopting a once-and-for-all costly reduction in the\ncurrent emissions rate, when the stochastic dynamics of the socioeconomic costs\nof pollution are subject to Brownian shocks and the drift is an unobservable\nrandom variable. By keeping track of the actual evolution of the costs, the\ndecision maker is able to learn the unknown drift and to form a posterior\ndynamic belief of its true value. The resulting decision maker's timing problem\nboils down to a truly two-dimensional optimal stopping problem which we address\nvia probabilistic free-boundary methods and a state-space transformation. We\nshow that the optimal timing for implementing the emissions reduction policy is\nthe first time that the learning process has become ``decisive'' enough; that\nis, when it exceeds a time-dependent percentage.

It depends only on $Y$ and the noise level $\\sigma$ as well as the\noperator $T$ and the filter $\\left(q_\\alpha\\right)_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal A}$ and\ndoes not require any problem-dependent tuning of further parameters. We prove\nan oracle inequality for the corresponding MSE in a general setting and derive\nthe rates of convergence in different scenarios. By a careful analysis we show\nthat no other a posteriori parameter choice rule can yield a better performance\nin terms of the convergence rate of the MSE. In particular, our results reveal\nthat the typical understanding of Lepskiii-type methods in inverse problems\nleading to a loss of a log factor is wrong. In addition, the empirical\nperformance of SOLIT is examined in simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 14:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Analyzing the IllustrisTNG simulation,\nMart\\'in-Navarro et al.

As a result, a modulation of the\nquenched fraction with respect to the major axis of the central galaxy is a\nnatural prediction of hierarchical structure formation.

Our theory is predicated on the assumption that it is the singlet\ntriplet-pair component of the 'dark' state that undergoes bimolecular singlet\nfission. We use valence bond theory to develop a minimal two-chain model of the\ntriplet-pair states. The single and double chain triplet-pair spectrum is\ndescribed, as this helps explain the dynamics and the equilibrated populations.\nWe simulate the dynamics of the initial entangled pair state using the quantum\nLiouville equation, including both spin-conserving and spin-nonconserving\ndephasing processes. By computing the intrachain and interchain singlet,\ntriplet and quintet triplet-pair populations, we show that singlet fission\ndepends critically on the interchain coupling and the driving potential (that\ndetermines endothermic versus exothermic fission).

Relevant gate voltages in such device can\ncreate two voltage tunable quantum dots (VTQDs) underneath the gates, as well\nas can manipulate their eigenstate detuning and the inter-dot coupling to\ngenerate superposition, whereas a small drain bias may cause its collapse\nleading to qubit read out. Such qubit operations, i.e., Initialization,\nManipulation, and Measurement, are theoretically modeled in the present work by\ndeveloping a second quantization filed operator based Schrodinger-Poisson\nself-consistent framework coupled to non-equilibrium Greens function formalism.\nThe study shows that the Bloch sphere coverage can be discretized along polar\nand azimuthal directions by reducing the nanowire diameter and increasing the\ninter-dot separation respectively, that can be utilized for selective\ninformation encoding. The theoretically obtained stability diagrams suggest\nthat downscaled nanowire diameter and increased gate separation sharpen the\nbonding and anti-bonding states with reduced anticrossing leading to a gradual\ntransformation of the hyperbolic current mapping into a pair of straight lines.\nHowever, the dephasing time in the proposed GaAs VTQD-based qubit may be\nsignificantly improved by scaling down both the nanowire diameter and gate\nseparation. Therefore, the present study suggests an optimization window for\ngeometrical engineering of a dual gate nanowire FET qubit to achieve superior\nqubit performance. Most importantly, such device is compatible with the\nmainstream CMOS technology and can be utilized for large scale implementation\nby little modification of the state of the art fabrication processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 11:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

The primary objective of CBA is to encourage knowledge\nsharing and collaboration between the different groups involved in business\nanalysis, as this can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the data\nand better decision-making. CBA typically involves a range of activities,\nincluding data gathering and analysis, brainstorming, problem-solving,\ndecision-making and knowledge sharing. These activities may take place through\nvarious channels, such as in-person meetings, virtual collaboration tools or\nonline forums. This paper deals with virtual collaboration tools as an\nimportant part of Business Intelligence (BI) platform. Collaborative Business\nIntelligence (CBI) tools are becoming more user-friendly, accessible, and\nflexible, allowing users to customize their experience and adapt to their\nspecific needs. The goal of a virtual assistant is to make data exploration\nmore accessible to a wider range of users and to reduce the time and effort\nrequired for data analysis. It describes the unified business intelligence\nsemantic model, coupled with a data warehouse and collaborative unit to employ\ndata mining technology. Moreover, we propose a virtual assistant for CBI and a\nreference model of virtual tools for CBI, which consists of three components:\nconversational, data exploration and recommendation agents. We believe that the\nallocation of these three functional tasks allows you to structure the CBI\nissue and apply relevant and productive models for human-like dialogue,\ntext-to-command transferring, and recommendations simultaneously. The complex\napproach based on these three points gives the basis for virtual tool for\ncollaboration.

This success is\nlargely indebted to the massive size of deep learning models that is expected\nto increase unceasingly. This growth of the deep learning models is accompanied\nby issues related to their considerable energy consumption, both during the\ntraining and inference phases, as well as their scalability. Although a number\nof work based on unconventional physical systems have been proposed which\naddresses the issue of energy efficiency in the inference phase, efficient\ntraining of deep learning models has remained unaddressed. So far, training of\ndigital deep learning models mainly relies on backpropagation, which is not\nsuitable for physical implementation as it requires perfect knowledge of the\ncomputation performed in the so-called forward pass of the neural network.\nHere, we tackle this issue by proposing a simple deep neural network\narchitecture augmented by a biologically plausible learning algorithm, referred\nto as \"model-free forward-forward training\".

To\naddress this issue, we propose CEIL, a novel Classification-Enhanced Iterative\nLearning framework for short text clustering, which aims at generally promoting\nthe clustering performance by introducing a classification objective to\niteratively improve feature representations. In each iteration, we first adopt\na language model to retrieve the initial text representations, from which the\nclustering results are collected using our proposed Category Disentangled\nContrastive Clustering (CDCC) algorithm.

In\nthis paper, we propose a theoretical approach called Behavior Expectation\nBounds (BEB) which allows us to formally investigate several inherent\ncharacteristics and limitations of alignment in large language models.\nImportantly, we prove that for any behavior that has a finite probability of\nbeing exhibited by the model, there exist prompts that can trigger the model\ninto outputting this behavior, with probability that increases with the length\nof the prompt. This implies that any alignment process that attenuates\nundesired behavior but does not remove it altogether, is not safe against\nadversarial prompting attacks. Furthermore, our framework hints at the\nmechanism by which leading alignment approaches such as reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback increase the LLM's proneness to being prompted into the\nundesired behaviors. Moreover, we include the notion of personas in our BEB\nframework, and find that behaviors which are generally very unlikely to be\nexhibited by the model can be brought to the front by prompting the model to\nbehave as specific persona. This theoretical result is being experimentally\ndemonstrated in large scale by the so called contemporary \"chatGPT jailbreaks\",\nwhere adversarial users trick the LLM into breaking its alignment guardrails by\ntriggering it into acting as a malicious persona.

Among them,\nLoRa is widely deployed for its unique characteristics and open-source\ntechnology. By adopting the Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, LoRa\nenables low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) communication. The standard LoRa\ndemodulation method accumulates the chirp power of the whole chirp into an\nenergy peak in the frequency domain. In this way, it can support communication\neven when SNR is lower than -15 dB. Beyond that, we proposed NELoRa, a\nneural-enhanced decoder that exploits multi-dimensional information to achieve\nsignificant SNR gain. This paper presents the dataset used to train/test\nNELoRa, which includes 27,329 LoRa symbols with spreading factors from 7 to 10,\nfor further improvement of neural-enhanced LoRa demodulation. The dataset shows\nthat NELoRa can achieve 1.84-2.35 dB SNR gain over the standard LoRa decoder.\nThe dataset and codes can be found at\nhttps://github.com/daibiaoxuwu/NeLoRa_Dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 14:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

However, achieving effective and scalable\ncooperation among junctions (agents) remains an open challenge, as existing\nmethods often rely on extensive, non-generalizable reward shaping or on\nnon-scalable centralized learning. To address these problems, we propose a new\nMARL method for traffic signal control, SocialLight, which learns cooperative\ntraffic control policies by distributedly estimating the individual marginal\ncontribution of agents on their local neighborhood. SocialLight relies on the\nAsynchronous Actor Critic (A3C) framework, and makes learning scalable by\nlearning a locally-centralized critic conditioned over the states and actions\nof neighboring agents, used by agents to estimate individual contributions by\ncounterfactual reasoning. We further introduce important modifications to the\nadvantage calculation that help stabilize policy updates. These modifications\ndecouple the impact of the neighbors' actions on the computed advantages,\nthereby reducing the variance in the gradient updates. We benchmark our trained\nnetwork against state-of-the-art traffic signal control methods on standard\nbenchmarks in two traffic simulators, SUMO and CityFlow. Our results show that\nSocialLight exhibits improved scalability to larger road networks and better\nperformance across usual traffic metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 12:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}
