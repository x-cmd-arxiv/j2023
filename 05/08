In this paper, we propose Unified Demonstration Retriever\n(\\textbf{UDR}), a single model to retrieve demonstrations for a wide range of\ntasks. To train UDR, we cast various tasks' training signals into a unified\nlist-wise ranking formulation by language model's feedback.

There has to\nbe an accurate automated method for measuring seizure frequency and severity in\norder to assess the efficacy of pharmacological therapy for epilepsy. The drug\nquantities are often derived from patient reports which may cause significant\nissues owing to inadequate or inaccurate descriptions of seizures and their\nfrequencies. Methods and materials: This study proposes a novel deep learning\narchitecture based lightweight convolution transformer (LCT). The transformer\nis able to learn spatial and temporal correlated information simultaneously\nfrom the multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to detect seizures at\nsmaller segment lengths. In the proposed model, the lack of translation\nequivariance and localization of ViT is reduced using convolution tokenization,\nand rich information from the transformer encoder is extracted by sequence\npooling instead of the learnable class token. Results: Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed model of cross-patient learning can\neffectively detect seizures from the raw EEG signals. The accuracy and F1-score\nof seizure detection in the cross-patient case on the CHB-MIT dataset are shown\nto be 96.31% and 96.32%, respectively, at 0.5 sec segment length. In addition,\nthe performance metrics show that the inclusion of inductive biases and\nattention-based pooling in the model enhances the performance and reduces the\nnumber of transformer encoder layers, which significantly reduces the\ncomputational complexity.

Specifically, two materials of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and\nWSi$_2$N$_4$ due to their very desirable electrical and thermal properties are\nnoticed. On the other hand, the reliability of transistors, which is determined\nby the maximum temperature they obtain during the performance, specifies the\nusefulness of the newly proposed channels for thermal management solution. In\nthis work, the FETs, including MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and WSi$_2$N$_4$ channels, are\ninvestigated using Monte Carlo simulation of the phonon Boltzmann equation. In\nparticular, the phonon analysis has been carried out to investigate the peak\ntemperature rise. Our calculations confirm that MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and WSi$_2$N$_4$\npresent lower maximum temperature than the previously suggested candidate, the\nblue phosphorene (BP) which itself reaches a shallow temperature. Concretely,\nthe phonon exploration shows that the competition between the dominant heat\ncarrier velocity, and its related frequency settles the maximum temperature\nvalue. The material WSi$_2$N$_4$ with much more phonons in TA mode, with almost\nhigh velocity and relatively low-frequency, shows adequate thermal condition,\nand its peak temperature is very low, say 110 K, less than that of BP. The\nmaterial MoSi$_2$N$_4$ attains the maximum temperature of only 10 K less than\nBP peak temperature. This behavior attributes to the dominant LA phonons which\nare fast but also have high frequency and consequently make the temperature get\nlarger than that of the WSi$_2$N$_4$. In summary, WSi$_2$N$_4$, with very low\npeak temperature, and in the next step MoSi$_2$N$_4$, both with beneficial\nelectrical/thermal properties, are suggested as very suitable candidates for\nproducing more reliable FETs, fulfilling the thermal management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2023 16:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Meanwhile, the angular separation\n$s$ decreases, and relative magnitude $r_{mag}$ increases with increasing $l$\nfor prograde motion but they show opposite behaviour for the retrograde motion.\nFor Sgr A*, the angular position $\\theta_{\\infty}$ is $\\in$ (16.404, 39.8044)\n$\\mu$as, while for M87* $\\in$ (12.3246, 29.9057) $\\mu$as. The angular\nseparation $s$ is ranging $\\in$ (0.008306-0.37573) $\\mu$as for Sgr A* and $\\in$\n(0.00624-0.282295) $\\mu$as for M87*. The relative magnitude $r_{mag}$ $\\in$\n(0.04724, 1.53831). We estimate the time delay between the first and second\nrelativistic images using twenty supermassive galactic centre black holes as\nlenses. Our analysis concludes that, within the $1 \\sigma$ region, a\nsignificant portion of the BH-I and BH-II and for a small portion of BH-III\nparameter space agrees with the EHT results of M87* and Sgr A* whereas NH is\ncompletely ruled out. We discover that the EHT results of Sgr A* place more\nstringent limits on the parameter space of LMRBH black holes than those\nestablished by the EHT results of M87*.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2023 17:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

These psychophysical and communicative\nconstraints help explain why languages around the world have remarkably\nsimilar, but not identical, mappings of colors to color terms. Languages\nconverge on a small set of efficient representations. But languages also\nevolve, and the number of terms in a color vocabulary may change over time.\nHere we show that history, i.e. the existence of an antecedent color\nvocabulary, acts as a non-adaptive constraint that biases the choice of\nefficient solution as a language transitions from a vocabulary of size n to n+1\nterms. Moreover, as vocabularies evolve to include more terms they explore a\nsmaller fraction of all possible efficient vocabularies compared to\nequally-sized vocabularies constructed de novo. This path dependence on the\ncultural evolution of color naming presents an opportunity. Historical\nconstraints can be used to reconstruct ancestral color vocabularies, allowing\nus to answer long-standing questions about the evolutionary sequences of color\nwords, and enabling us to draw inferences from phylogenetic patterns of\nlanguage change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2023 17:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

For this purpose we work in the double-scaled SYK model which is\ndual in a certain limit to JT gravity, a theory of gravity in AdS$_2$. In\nparticular, states on the boundary have a clear geometrical definition in the\nbulk. We use this result to show that Krylov complexity of the\ninfinite-temperature thermofield double state on the boundary of AdS$_2$ has a\nprecise bulk description in JT gravity, namely the length of the two-sided\nwormhole. We do this by showing that the Krylov basis elements, which are\neigenstates of the Krylov complexity operator, are mapped to length eigenstates\nin the bulk theory by subjecting K-complexity to the bulk-boundary map\nidentifying the bulk/boundary Hilbert spaces. Our result makes extensive use of\nchord diagram techniques and identifies the Krylov basis of the boundary\nquantum system with fixed chord number states building the bulk gravitational\nHilbert space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2023 18:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Furthermore, existing\nevaluations of ANNS algorithms are typically heavily focused on measuring and\noptimizing for queries-per second (QPS) at a given accuracy, which can be\nhardware-dependent and ignores important metrics such as build time.\n  In this paper, we propose a set of principled measures for evaluating ANNS\nalgorithms which refocuses on their scalability to billion-size datasets.

More\nrecently, independent studies of this problem have been carried out by Yoo,\nHarada and Okawa \\cite{Yoo2017} and by East \\cite{East2019}. A common feature\nin these works is that the initial data are dust-like.

We argue that the\nLin-Mestel-Shu solution is not relevant for studying the weak cosmic censorship\nof the Einstein-Vlasov system and we argue that dust-like initial data is also\nnot relevant. To investigate collapse of highly prolate spheroidal\nconfigurations for the Einstein-Vlasov system is nevertheless interesting in\nview of the Hoop conjecture. By choosing highly prolate initial data the weak\ncosmic censorship conjecture is seriously tested. We carry out such a study for\ninitial data which are not dust-like.

However, given the discounted nature of the RL objective, this\ndata collection strategy might not be the best option. Indeed, the rewards\ntaken in early simulation steps weigh exponentially more than future rewards.\nTaking a cue from this intuition, in this paper, we design an a-priori budget\nallocation strategy that leads to the collection of trajectories of different\nlengths, i.e., truncated. The proposed approach provably minimizes the width of\nthe confidence intervals around the empirical estimates of the expected return\nof a policy.

Given a single\nLDR image with a depth map, our method predicts spatially consistent lighting\nat any given image position. Particularly, when the input is an LDR video\nsequence, our framework not only progressively refines the lighting prediction\nas it sees more regions, but also preserves temporal consistency by keeping the\nrefinement smooth. Our framework reconstructs a spherical Gaussian lighting\nvolume (SGLV) through a tailored 3D encoder-decoder, which enables spatially\nconsistent lighting prediction through volume ray tracing, a hybrid blending\nnetwork for detailed environment maps, an in-network Monte-Carlo rendering\nlayer to enhance photorealism for virtual object insertion, and recurrent\nneural networks (RNN) to achieve temporally consistent lighting prediction with\na video sequence as the input. For training, we significantly enhance the\nOpenRooms public dataset of photorealistic synthetic indoor scenes with around\n360K HDR environment maps of much higher resolution and 38K video sequences,\nrendered with GPU-based path tracing.

One of their critical applications is to universally solve different\ndownstream inverse tasks via a single diffusion prior without re-training for\neach task. Most inverse tasks can be formulated as inferring a posterior\ndistribution over data (e.g., a full image) given a measurement (e.g., a masked\nimage). This is however challenging in diffusion models since the nonlinear and\niterative nature of the diffusion process renders the posterior intractable. To\ncope with this challenge, we propose a variational approach that by design\nseeks to approximate the true posterior distribution. We show that our approach\nnaturally leads to regularization by denoising diffusion process (RED-Diff)\nwhere denoisers at different timesteps concurrently impose different structural\nconstraints over the image. To gauge the contribution of denoisers from\ndifferent timesteps, we propose a weighting mechanism based on\nsignal-to-noise-ratio (SNR).

These approaches can\nlead to the undesirable propagation of errors from low-fidelity representations\nto high-fidelity ones.

Many manually designed driving\npolicies are difficult to scale to the real world. Fortunately, reinforcement\nlearning has shown great success in many tasks by automatic trial and error.\nHowever, when it comes to autonomous driving in interactive dense traffic, RL\nagents either fail to learn reasonable performance or necessitate a large\namount of data. Our insight is that when humans learn to drive, they will 1)\nmake decisions over the high-level skill space instead of the low-level control\nspace and 2) leverage expert prior knowledge rather than learning from scratch.\nInspired by this, we propose ASAP-RL, an efficient reinforcement learning\nalgorithm for autonomous driving that simultaneously leverages motion skills\nand expert priors. We first parameterized motion skills, which are diverse\nenough to cover various complex driving scenarios and situations. A skill\nparameter inverse recovery method is proposed to convert expert demonstrations\nfrom control space to skill space. A simple but effective double initialization\ntechnique is proposed to leverage expert priors while bypassing the issue of\nexpert suboptimality and early performance degradation. We validate our\nproposed method on interactive dense-traffic driving tasks given simple and\nsparse rewards. Experimental results show that our method can lead to higher\nlearning efficiency and better driving performance relative to previous methods\nthat exploit skills and priors differently.

We observe that many deep learning based models exhibit\nexceptional performance on removing homogeneous haze, but they usually fail to\naddress the challenge of non-homogeneous dehazing. Two main factors account for\nthis situation. Firstly, due to the intricate and non uniform distribution of\ndense haze, the recovery of structural and chromatic features with high\nfidelity is challenging, particularly in regions with heavy haze. Secondly, the\nexisting small scale datasets for non-homogeneous dehazing are inadequate to\nsupport reliable learning of feature mappings between hazy images and their\ncorresponding haze-free counterparts by convolutional neural network\n(CNN)-based models. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a novel two\nbranch network that leverages 2D discrete wavelete transform (DWT), fast\nFourier convolution (FFC) residual block and a pretrained ConvNeXt model.\nSpecifically, in the DWT-FFC frequency branch, our model exploits DWT to\ncapture more high-frequency features. Moreover, by taking advantage of the\nlarge receptive field provided by FFC residual blocks, our model is able to\neffectively explore global contextual information and produce images with\nbetter perceptual quality. In the prior knowledge branch, an ImageNet\npretrained ConvNeXt as opposed to Res2Net is adopted. This enables our model to\nlearn more supplementary information and acquire a stronger generalization\nability. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is\ndemonstrated via extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Exploiting\nthis fact, we decouple the discretization of the Lie group convolution\nelucidating two separate sampling instances: the filter and the signal. To\ndiscretize the filters, we exploit the exponential map that links a Lie group\nwith its associated Lie algebra. We show that the discrete Lie group filter\nlearned from the data determines a unique filter in $L^{1}(G)$, and we show how\nthis uniqueness of representation is defined by the bandwidth of the filter\ngiven a spectral representation.

Based on this success,\ncurrent image editing methods use texts to achieve intuitive and versatile\nmodification of images. To edit a real image using diffusion models, one must\nfirst invert the image to a noisy latent from which an edited image is sampled\nwith a target text prompt. However, most methods lack one of the following:\nuser-friendliness (e.g., additional masks or precise descriptions of the input\nimage are required), generalization to larger domains, or high fidelity to the\ninput image. In this paper, we design an accurate and quick inversion\ntechnique, Prompt Tuning Inversion, for text-driven image editing.\nSpecifically, our proposed editing method consists of a reconstruction stage\nand an editing stage. In the first stage, we encode the information of the\ninput image into a learnable conditional embedding via Prompt Tuning Inversion.\nIn the second stage, we apply classifier-free guidance to sample the edited\nimage, where the conditional embedding is calculated by linearly interpolating\nbetween the target embedding and the optimized one obtained in the first stage.\nThis technique ensures a superior trade-off between editability and high\nfidelity to the input image of our method.

In recent years, diffusion models have achieved very\npromising results in the field of image generation, outperforming previous\ngeneration models. However, it has not been widely used in the field of image\ndenoising because it is difficult to control the appropriate position of the\nadded noise. Inspired by diffusion models, this paper proposes a novel general\ndenoising diffusion model that can be used for real-world image denoising. We\nintroduce a diffusion process with linear interpolation, and the intermediate\nnoisy image is interpolated from the original clean image and the corresponding\nreal-world noisy image, so that this diffusion model can handle the level of\nadded noise.

This effort is complicated by the complex modelling of pulsar\nnoise. Without proper care, mis-specified noise models can lead to\nfalse-positive detections.

In\nthis paper, we introduce HACK (Head-And-neCK), a novel parametric model for\nconstructing the head and cervical region of digital humans. Our model seeks to\ndisentangle the full spectrum of neck and larynx motions, facial expressions,\nand appearance variations, providing personalized and anatomically consistent\ncontrols, particularly for the neck regions. To build our HACK model, we\nacquire a comprehensive multi-modal dataset of the head and neck under various\nfacial expressions. We employ a 3D ultrasound imaging scheme to extract the\ninner biomechanical structures, namely the precise 3D rotation information of\nthe seven vertebrae of the cervical spine. We then adopt a multi-view\nphotometric approach to capture the geometry and physically-based textures of\ndiverse subjects, who exhibit a diverse range of static expressions as well as\nsequential head-and-neck movements. Using the multi-modal dataset, we train the\nparametric HACK model by separating the 3D head and neck depiction into various\nshape, pose, expression, and larynx blendshapes from the neutral expression and\nthe rest skeletal pose. We adopt an anatomically-consistent skeletal design for\nthe cervical region, and the expression is linked to facial action units for\nartist-friendly controls. HACK addresses the head and neck as a unified entity,\noffering more accurate and expressive controls, with a new level of realism,\nparticularly for the neck regions.

We propose DiffBFR to introduce Diffusion\nProbabilistic Model (DPM) for BFR to tackle the above problem, given its\nsuperiority over GAN in aspects of avoiding training collapse and generating\nlong-tail distribution. DiffBFR utilizes a two-step design, that first restores\nidentity information from low-quality images and then enhances texture details\naccording to the distribution of real faces.

With theoretical proof,\ntwo cascade conditional DPMs with different input sizes are introduced to\nstrengthen this sampling effect and reduce training difficulty in the\nhigh-resolution image generated directly. 2) Texture Enhancement Module (TEM)\nfor polishing the texture of the image. Here an unconditional DPM, a LQ-free\nmodel, is introduced to further force the restorations to appear realistic. We\ntheoretically proved that this unconditional DPM trained on pure HQ images\ncontributes to justifying the correct distribution of inference images output\nfrom IRM in pixel-level space.

In addition, to construct effective visual-to-audio mapping, the audio\ntemporal models can generate audio features time-aligned with visual features.\nThrough extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the MTLAM\nachieving state-of-the-art performances on two public VSR datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 08:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

This\ndiscrepancy can be attributed to a knowledge gap between radiologists and the\ngeneration models. While radiologists possess patient-specific prior\ninformation, the models solely receive X-ray images at a specific time point.\nTo tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach that leverages a rule-based\nlabeler to extract comparison prior information from radiology reports. This\nextracted comparison prior is then seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based models, enabling them to produce more realistic and\ncomprehensive reports. Our method is evaluated on English report datasets, such\nas IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR. The results demonstrate that our approach surpasses\nbaseline models in terms of natural language generation metrics. Notably, our\nmodel generates reports that are free from false references to non-existent\nprior exams, setting it apart from previous models. By addressing this\nlimitation, our approach represents a significant step towards bridging the gap\nbetween radiologists and generation models in the domain of medical report\ngeneration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 09:12:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2023 10:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}

However, due\nto its irreversible nature, resetting processes incur a thermodynamic cost,\nwhich becomes infinite in case of instantaneous resetting. Here, we take into\nconsideration both the cost and first passage time (FPT) required for a\nresetting process, in which the reset or return to the initial location is\nimplemented using a trapping potential over a finite but random time period. An\niterative generating function and counting functional method \\`a la Feynman and\nKac are employed to calculate the FPT and average work for this process. From\nthese results, we obtain an explicit form of the time-cost trade-off relation,\nwhich provides the lower bound of the mean FPT for a given work input when the\ntrapping potential is linear. This trade-off relation clearly shows that\ninstantaneous resetting is achievable only when an infinite amount of work is\nprovided. More surprisingly, the trade-off relation derived from the linear\npotential seems to be valid for a wide range of trapping potentials. In\naddition, we have also shown that the fixed-time or sharp resetting can further\nenhance the trade-off relation compared to that of the stochastic resetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 09:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

There is general agreement that the origin\nof radio halos is connected to turbulence, generated during cluster mergers.\nStatistical studies of large samples of galaxy clusters in the radio band have\nthe potential to unveil the connection between the properties of radio halos\nand the mass and dynamics of the host clusters. Previous studies have been\nlimited to massive clusters and based on a small number of radio halos. The aim\nof this paper is to investigate the scaling relation between the radio power of\nradio halos and the mass of the host clusters at low frequencies and down to\nlower cluster masses. We analysed the clusters from the second catalogue of\nPlanck Sunyaev Zel'dovich sources that lie within the 5634 sq deg covered by\nthe second Data Release of the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey. We derived the\ncorrelation between the radio power and the mass of the host clusters and we\ninvestigated the distribution of clusters without radio halos with respect to\nthe correlation. We use X-ray observations to classify the dynamical state of\nclusters and investigate its role on the power of radio halos. We found a\ncorrelation between the power of radio halos at 150 MHz and the mass of the\nhost clusters down to 3e14 Msun. This correlation has a large scatter, part of\nwhich can be attributed to the different dynamical states of host clusters. We\nused two statistical test to show that the distribution of clusters with and\nwithout (upper limits) radio halos in the mass-radio power diagram is not\ncompatible with a single correlation and that it is also not compatible with\nclusters being uniformly distributed below an upper envelope constituted by the\ncorrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 09:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

The need\nfor real-time air quality monitoring has become increasingly important, given\nthe rise in pollutant emissions due to urbanization and its adverse effects on\nhuman health. The proposed methodology involves solving the linear\nadvection-diffusion problem, where the solution of the Reynolds-averaged\nNavier-Stokes equations gives the convective field. At the same time, the\nsource term consists of an empirical time series. However, the computational\nrequirements of this approach, including microscale spatial resolution,\nrepeated evaluation, and low time scale, necessitate the use of\nhigh-performance computing facilities, which can be a bottleneck for real-time\nmonitoring. To address this challenge, a problem-specific methodology was\ndeveloped that leverages a data-driven approach based on Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition with regression (POD-R) coupled with Galerkin projection (POD-G)\nendorsed with the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The proposed\nmethod employs a feedforward neural network to non-intrusively retrieve the\nreduced-order convective operator required for online evaluation. The numerical\nframework was validated on synthetic emissions and real wind measurements. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the\ncomputational burden of the traditional approach and is suitable for real-time\nair quality monitoring.

Integrating multiple energy carriers in the planning of distribution\nnetworks presents new challenges, including uncertainties in demand prediction,\nenergy prices, and renewable energy availability. In response to these\nchallenges, we propose an approach that aims to aid strategic decision-making\nin a new planning process for integrated multi-energy networks using robust\noptimization.

However,\nsince dwarfs play a role in a vast range of different environments, much can be\nlearned about galaxy formation and evolution through extending the study of\nthese objects to various locations. We present MUSE spectroscopy of a sample of\n56 dwarf galaxies as a follow-up to the MATLAS survey in low-to-moderate\ndensity environments beyond the Local Volume. The dwarfs have stellar masses in\nthe range of $M_{*}/M_{\\odot}$ = 10$^{6.1}$-10$^{9.4}$ and show a distance\nrange of D = 14-148 Mpc, the majority (75%) of which are located in the range\ntargeted by the MATLAS survey (10-45 Mpc). We thus report a 75% (79% for dwarf\nellipticals) success rate for the semi-automatic identification of dwarf\ngalaxies in the MATLAS survey on the here presented subsample. Using pPXF full\nspectrum fitting, we determine their line-of-sight velocity and can match the\nmajority of them with their massive host galaxy. Close inspection of their\nspectra reveals that ~30% show clear emission lines and thus star formation\nactivity. We estimate their stellar population properties (age and metallicity)\nand compare our results with other works investigating Local Volume and cluster\ndwarf galaxies. We find that the dwarf galaxies presented in this work show a\nsystematic offset from the stellar mass-metallicity relation towards lower\nmetallicities at the same stellar mass. A similar deviation is present in other\nworks in the stellar mass range probed in this work and might be attributed to\nthe use of different methodologies for deriving the metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 10:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Existing work on privacy-preserving localization\naims to defend against an attacker who has access to a cloud-based service. In\nthis paper, we show that an attacker can learn about details of a scene without\nany access by simply querying a localization service. The attack is based on\nthe observation that modern visual localization algorithms are robust to\nvariations in appearance and geometry. While this is in general a desired\nproperty, it also leads to algorithms localizing objects that are similar\nenough to those present in a scene. An attacker can thus query a server with a\nlarge enough set of images of objects, \\eg, obtained from the Internet, and\nsome of them will be localized. The attacker can thus learn about object\nplacements from the camera poses returned by the service (which is the minimal\ninformation returned by such a service).

Bloat exists in all layers of software, from the\noperating system, to the application, resulting in computing resource wastage.\nThe problem is exacerbated in both cloud and edge setting as the number of\napplications running increase. To remove software bloat, multiple debloating\ntools have been proposed in the literature. However, these tools do not provide\nsafety guarantees on the debloated software, with some files needed during\nrun-time removed.

The high active power infeed of such sources during times of peak\nproduction is a stress test which distribution grids have usually not been\nexposed to in the past. When high amounts of active power are injected into the\ngrid, the overall power flow is often limited because of voltages reaching\ntheir upper acceptable limits. Volt/VAr methods aim to raise this power flow\nlimit by controlling the voltage using reactive power. This way, more active\npower can be transmitted safely without physically reinforcing the grid. In\nthis paper, we use real consumption and generation data on a low-voltage\nCIGR\\'E grid model and an experiment on a real distribution grid feeder to\nanalyze how different Volt/VAr methods can virtually reinforce the distribution\ngrid. We show that droop control and machine-learning-improved droop control\nvirtually reinforce the grid but do not utilize the reactive power resources to\ntheir full extent. In contrast, methods which coordinate the usage of reactive\npower resources across the grid, such as \\ac{OFO}, can reinforce the grid to\nits full potential. The simulation study performed on data of an entire year\nsuggests that Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) can enable another 9\\% of\nmaximum active power injections. To achieve that, OFO only requires voltage\nmagnitude measurements, minimal model knowledge and communication with the\nreactive power sources. A real-life experiment provides a demonstration of how\nOFO acts at the level of a single device, and proves the practical feasibility\nof the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 12:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

However, the\nlack of a fast and precise magnetic domain wall (DW) shifting mechanism and the\nrequired extremely high DW motion (DWM) driving current both make the racetrack\ndifficult to commercialize. Here, we propose a method for coherent DWM that is\nfree from above issues, which is driven by chirality switching (CS) and an\nultralow spin-orbit-torque (SOT) current. The CS, as the driving force of DWM,\nis achieved by the sign change of DM interaction which is further induced by a\nferroelectric switching voltage. The SOT is used to break the symmetry when the\nmagnetic moment is rotated to the Bloch direction. We numerically investigate\nthe underlying principle and the effect of key parameters on the DWM through\nmicromagnetic simulations. Under the CS mechanism, a fast (102 m/s), ultralow\nenergy (5 attojoule), and precisely discretized DWM can be achieved.\nConsidering that skyrmions with topological protection and smaller size are\nalso promising for future racetrack, we similarly evaluate the feasibility of\napplying such a CS mechanism to a skyrmion. However, we find that the CS only\ncauses it to \"breathe\" instead of moving. Our results demonstrate that the CS\nstrategy is suitable for future DW racetrack memory with ultralow power\nconsumption and discretized DWM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 12:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Our approach guides the robot towards behaviors that encourage\npreparation and organization, reducing overall costs in long-lived planning\nscenarios. We evaluate our method on blockworld environments and show that our\napproach reduces the overall planning costs by 5% as compared to planning\nwithout anticipatory planning.

This may happen when the system\ninteracts with humans and feedback patterns emerge, reinforcing old biases in\nthe system and creating new biases. While existing works try to identify and\nmitigate long-run biases through smart system design, we introduce techniques\nfor monitoring fairness in real time. Our goal is to build and deploy a monitor\nthat will continuously observe a long sequence of events generated by the\nsystem in the wild, and will output, with each event, a verdict on how fair the\nsystem is at the current point in time. The advantages of monitoring are\ntwo-fold. Firstly, fairness is evaluated at run-time, which is important\nbecause unfair behaviors may not be eliminated a priori, at design-time, due to\npartial knowledge about the system and the environment, as well as\nuncertainties and dynamic changes in the system and the environment, such as\nthe unpredictability of human behavior. Secondly, monitors are by design\noblivious to how the monitored system is constructed, which makes them suitable\nto be used as trusted third-party fairness watchdogs. They function as\ncomputationally lightweight statistical estimators, and their correctness\nproofs rely on the rigorous analysis of the stochastic process that models the\nassumptions about the underlying dynamics of the system. We show, both in\ntheory and experiments, how monitors can warn us (1) if a bank's credit policy\nover time has created an unfair distribution of credit scores among the\npopulation, and (2) if a resource allocator's allocation policy over time has\nmade unfair allocations. Our experiments demonstrate that the monitors\nintroduce very low overhead.

The average fidelity of quantum gates is a\nparticular figure of merit that can be estimated efficiently by Randomized\nBenchmarking (RB). However, the concept of gate-fidelity itself relies on the\ncrucial assumption that noise behaves in a predictable, time-local, or\nso-called Markovian manner, whose breakdown can naturally become the leading\nsource of errors as quantum devices scale in size and depth. We analytically\nshow that error suppression techniques such as Dynamical Decoupling (DD) and\nRandomized Compiling (RC) can operationally Markovianize RB: i) fast DD reduces\nnon-Markovian RB to an exponential decay plus longer-time corrections, while on\nthe other hand, ii) RC generally does not affect the average, but iii) it\nalways suppresses the variance of such RB outputs. We demonstrate these effects\nnumerically with a qubit noise model.

Such surface PDEs often involve\nboundary conditions prescribed on the surface, at points or curves on its\ninterior or along the geometric (exterior) boundary of an open surface.\nHowever, input surfaces can take many forms (e.g., meshes, parametric surfaces,\npoint clouds, level sets, neural implicits). One must therefore generate a mesh\nto apply finite element-type techniques or derive specialized discretization\nprocedures for each surface representation.\n  We propose instead to address such problems through a novel extension of the\nclosest point method (CPM) to handle interior boundary conditions specified at\nsurface points or curves. CPM solves the surface PDE by solving a volumetric\nPDE defined over the Cartesian embedding space containing the surface; only a\nclosest point function is required to represent the surface. As such, CPM\nsupports surfaces that are open or closed, orientable or not, and of any\ncodimension or even mixed-codimension. To enable support for interior boundary\nconditions, we develop a method to implicitly partition the embedding space\nacross interior boundaries. CPM's finite difference and interpolation stencils\nare adapted to respect this partition while preserving second-order accuracy.\nFurthermore, an efficient sparse-grid implementation and numerical solver is\ndeveloped that can scale to tens of millions of degrees of freedom, allowing\nPDEs to be solved on more complex surfaces. We demonstrate our method's\nconvergence behaviour on selected model PDEs. Several geometry processing\nproblems are explored: diffusion curves on surfaces, geodesic distance, tangent\nvector field design, and harmonic map construction. Our proposed approach thus\noffers a powerful and flexible new tool for a range of geometry processing\ntasks on general surface representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 13:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Eradicating\nflakiness in test suites is therefore an important goal, but automated\ndebugging tools are needed to support developers when trying to understand the\ncauses of flakiness. A popular example for an automated approach to support\nregular debugging is spectrum-based fault localization (SFL), a technique that\nidentifies software components that are most likely the causes of failures.\nWhile it is possible to also apply SFL for locating likely sources of flakiness\nin code, unfortunately the flakiness makes SFL both imprecise and\nnon-deterministic. In this paper we introduce SFFL (Spectrum-based Flaky Fault\nLocalization), an extension of traditional coverage-based SFL that exploits our\nobservation that 80% of flaky tests exhibit varying coverage behavior between\ndifferent runs. By distinguishing between stable and flaky coverage, SFFL is\nable to locate the sources of flakiness more precisely and keeps the\nlocalization itself deterministic. An evaluation on 101 flaky tests taken from\n48 open-source Python projects demonstrates that SFFL is effective: Of five\nprominent SFL formulas, DStar, Ochiai, and Op2 yield the best overall\nperformance. On average, they are able to narrow down the fault's location to\n3.5 % of the project's code base, which is 18.7 % better than traditional SFL\n(for DStar).

Recently, the transformer-based models have shown strong\nperformance on various sequence modeling tasks, which rely on attention to\ncapture pairwise token relations, and position embedding to inject positional\ninformation. While showing good performance, the transformer models are\ninefficient to scale to long input sequences, mainly due to the quadratic\nspace-time complexity of attention. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose\nto model sequences with a relative position encoded Toeplitz matrix and use a\nToeplitz matrix-vector production trick to reduce the space-time complexity of\nthe sequence modeling to log linear. A lightweight sub-network called relative\nposition encoder is proposed to generate relative position coefficients with a\nfixed budget of parameters, enabling the proposed Toeplitz neural network to\ndeal with varying sequence lengths.

Extensive experiments on\nautoregressive and bidirectional language modeling, image modeling, and the\nchallenging Long-Range Arena benchmark show that our method achieves better\nperformance than its competitors in most downstream tasks while being\nsignificantly faster.

Here,\nwe adapt the concept of full counting statistics (FCS) to provide a very deep\ninsight into the spin-dependent transport in these hybrid systems. We\nillustrate the power of FCS by analyzing different situations in which YSR\nstates show up including single-impurity junctions, as well as double-impurity\nsystems where one can probe the tunneling between individual YSR states. The\nFCS concept allows us to unambiguously identify every tunneling process that\nplays a role in these situations. Moreover, FCS provides all the relevant\ntransport properties, including current, shot noise and all the cumulants of\nthe current distribution. Our approach can reproduce the experimental results\nrecently reported on the shot noise of a single-impurity junction with a normal\nSTM tip. We also predict the signatures of resonant (and non-resonant) multiple\nAndreev reflections in the shot noise of single-impurity junctions with two\nsuperconducting electrodes. In the case of double-impurity junctions we show\nthat the direct tunneling between YSR states is characterized by a strong\nreduction of the Fano factor that reaches a minimum value of 7/32, a new\nfundamental result in quantum transport. The FCS approach presented here can be\nnaturally extended to investigate the spin-dependent superconducting transport\nin a variety of situations, and it is also suitable to analyze multi-terminal\nsuperconducting junctions, irradiated contacts, and many other basic\nsituations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 15:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Upcoming observing runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and future third\ngeneration detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will allow the\nextraction of detailed information on these matter effects from the GW\nsignature of BNS and NSBH systems. One subtle effect which may be helpful to\nextract more information from the detection of compact binary systems is the\nnon-linear memory. In this work, we investigate the observational consequences\nof gravitational wave non-linear memory in the presence of matter effects.\n  We start by quantifying the impact of non-linear memory on distinguishing BNS\nmergers from binary black holes (BBH) or NSBH mergers. We find that for the\nthird generation detectors, the addition of non-linear memory to the GW signal\nmodel expands the parameter space where BNS signals become distinguishable from\nthe BBH and NSBH signals. Using numerical relativity simulations, we also study\nthe non-linear memory generated from the post-merger phase of BNS systems. We\nfind that it does not show a strong dependence on the equation of state of the\nNS. However, the non-linear memory from the BNS post-merger phase is much lower\nthan the one from BBH systems of the same masses. Furthermore, we compute the\ndetection prospects of non-linear memory from the post-merger phase of NS\nsystems by accumulating signal strength from a population of BNS mergers for\nthe current and future detectors. Finally, we discuss the impact of possible\nlinear memory from the dynamical ejecta of BNS and NSBH systems and its signal\nstrength relative to the non-linear memory.

Existing approaches achieve efficiency either by limiting the\nnumber of images to one view per face, or simplifying global inferences to only\nachieve local color consistency.

Selecting an appropriate channel combination from the original\nmultichannel image can improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation and reduce\nthe cost of data storage, processing and future acquisition. Existing channel\nselection methods typically use a reasonable selection procedure to determine a\ndesirable channel combination, and then train a semantic segmentation network\nusing that combination. In this study, the concept of pruning from a supernet\nis used for the first time to integrate the selection of channel combination\nand the training of a semantic segmentation network. Based on this concept, a\nOne-Shot Task-Adaptive (OSTA) channel selection method is proposed for the\nsemantic segmentation of multichannel images. OSTA has three stages, namely the\nsupernet training stage, the pruning stage and the fine-tuning stage. The\noutcomes of six groups of experiments (L7Irish3C, L7Irish2C, L8Biome3C,\nL8Biome2C, RIT-18 and Semantic3D) demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency\nof OSTA. OSTA achieved the highest segmentation accuracies in all tests (62.49%\n(mIoU), 75.40% (mIoU), 68.38% (mIoU), 87.63% (mIoU), 66.53% (mA) and 70.86%\n(mIoU), respectively).

Many interesting\ncounting problems (e.g., subgraph and induced subgraph counts) are finite\nlinear combinations $p(\\cdot)=\\sum_{H}\\alpha_{H}\\hom(H,\\cdot)$ of homomorphism\ncounts, and such linear combinations are known to be hard to evaluate iff they\ncontain a large-treewidth graph $S$. The hardness can be shown in two steps:\nFirst, the problems $\\hom(S,\\cdot)$ for colorful (i.e., bijectively colored)\nlarge-treewidth graphs $S$ are shown to be hard. In a second step, these\nproblems are reduced to finite linear combinations of homomorphism counts that\ncontain the uncolored version $S^{\\circ}$ of $S$. This step can be performed\nvia inclusion-exclusion in $2^{|E(S)|}\\mathrm{poly}(n,s)$ time, where $n$ is\nthe size of the input graph and $s$ is the maximum number of vertices among all\ngraphs in the linear combination.\n  We show that the second step can be performed even in time\n$4^{\\Delta(S)}\\mathrm{poly}(n,s)$, where $\\Delta(S)$ is the maximum degree of\n$S$. Our reduction is based on graph products with Cai-F\\\"urer-Immerman graphs,\na novel technique that is likely of independent interest. For colorful graphs\n$S$ of constant maximum degree, this technique yields a polynomial-time\nreduction from $\\hom(S,\\cdot)$ to linear combinations of homomorphism counts\ninvolving $S^{\\circ}$. Under certain conditions, it actually suffices that a\nsupergraph $T$ of $S^{\\circ}$ is contained in the target linear combination.\n  The new reduction yields $\\mathsf{\\#P}$-hardness results for several counting\nproblems that could previously be studied only under parameterized complexity\nassumptions. This includes the problems of counting, on input a graph from a\nrestricted graph class and a general graph $G$, the homomorphisms or (induced)\nsubgraph copies from $H$ in $G$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 15:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

The main highlight of the proposed framework is energy formulation,\nwhere the log prior of the distribution is learned by a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) module. The energy formulation enables us to introduce\noptimization algorithms with guaranteed convergence, even when the CNN module\nis not constrained as a contraction. Current PnP methods, which do not often\nhave well-defined energy formulations, require a contraction constraint that\nrestricts their performance in challenging applications. The energy and the\ncorresponding score function are learned from reference data using denoising\nscore matching, where the noise variance serves as a smoothness parameter that\ncontrols the shape of the learned energy function. We introduce a multi-scale\noptimization strategy, where a sequence of smooth approximations of the true\nprior is used in the optimization process. This approach improves the\nconvergence of the algorithm to the global minimum, which translates to\nimproved performance. The preliminary results in the context of MRI show that\nthe multi-scale energy PnP framework offers comparable performance to unrolled\nalgorithms. Unlike unrolled methods, the proposed PnP approach can work with\narbitrary forward models, making it an easier option for clinical deployment.\nIn addition, the training of the proposed model is more efficient from a memory\nand computational perspective, making it attractive in large-scale (e.g., 4D)\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 15:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Using a sample of galaxy\nclusters observed with the XMM-Newton EPIC, we quantified the effective area\ncross-calibration bias between the EPIC instruments as implemented in the\npublic calibration data base on November 2021 in the 0.5-6.1 keV energy band.\nWe invested significant efforts in controlling and minimising the systematic\nuncertainties of the cross-calibration bias below 1%. The statistical\nuncertainties are similar and thus we can reliably measure effects at 1% level.\nThe effective area cross-calibration in the 0.5-6.1 keV band between MOS and pn\nis biased at a substantial level. The MOS/pn bias is systematic suggesting that\nMOS (pn) effective area may be calibrated too low (high), by $\\sim$3-27% on\naverage depending on the instrument and energy band. The excellent agreement of\nthe energy dependencies (i.e. shapes) of the effective area of MOS2 and pn\nsuggest that they are correctly calibrated within $\\sim$1% in the 0.5-4.5 keV\nband. Comparison with an independent data set of point sources (3XMM) confirms\nthis. The cluster sample indicates that the MOS1/pn effective area shape\ncross-calibration has an approximately linear bias amounting to $\\sim$10% in\nmaximum in the 0.5-4.5 keV band. The effective area cross-calibration of\nXMM-Newton/EPIC instruments on November 2021 in the 0.5-4.5 keV band is in a\nrelatively good shape. However, the cluster-to-cluster rms scatter of the bias\nis substantial compared to the median bias itself. Thus, a statistically robust\nimplementation of the cross-calibration uncertainties to a scientific analysis\nof XMM-Newton/EPIC data should include the propagation of the scatter to the\nbest-fit parameters, instead of a simple average bias correction of the\neffective area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 15:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

There is a noticeable gap\nbetween the results known for both EF1 and EFX in the goods and chores\nsettings. The case of chores turns out to be much more challenging. We reduce\nthis gap by providing slightly relaxed versions of the known results on goods\nfor the chores setting. Interestingly, our algorithms run in polynomial time,\nunlike their analogous versions in the goods setting.\n  We introduce the concept of $k$ surplus which means that up to $k$ more\nchores are allocated to the agents and each of them is a copy of an original\nchore. We present a polynomial-time algorithm which gives EF1 and PO\nallocations with $(n-1)$ surplus.\n  We relax the notion of EFX slightly and define tEFX which requires that the\nenvy from agent $i$ to agent $j$ is removed upon the transfer of any chore from\nthe $i$'s bundle to $j$'s bundle. We give a polynomial-time algorithm that in\nthe chores case for $3$ agents returns an allocation which is either\nproportional or tEFX.

To conduct sound investigations on test flakiness, it is\ncrucial to have large, diverse, and unbiased datasets of flaky tests. A common\nmethod to build such datasets is by rerunning the test suites of selected\nprojects multiple times and checking for tests that produce different outcomes.\nWhile using this technique on a single project is mostly straightforward,\napplying it to a large and diverse set of projects raises several\nimplementation challenges such as (1) isolating the test executions, (2)\nsupporting multiple build mechanisms, (3) achieving feasible run times on large\ndatasets, and (4) analyzing and presenting the test outcomes. To address these\nchallenges we introduce FlaPy, a framework for researchers to mine flaky tests\nin a given or automatically sampled set of Python projects by rerunning their\ntest suites. FlaPy isolates the test executions using containerization and\nfresh execution environments to simulate real-world CI conditions and to\nachieve accurate results. By supporting multiple dependency installation\nstrategies, it promotes diversity among the studied projects. FlaPy supports\nparallelizing the test executions using SLURM, making it feasible to scan\nthousands of projects for test flakiness. Finally, FlaPy analyzes the test\noutcomes to determine which tests are flaky and depicts the results in a\nconcise table.

It is shown that the initial Dirac equation should contain usual\nDirac matrices but not the Pauli ones. The spin of graphene electrons is not\nthe isotopic spin and takes the values $\\pm1/2$. The exact Foldy-Wouthuysen\nHamiltonian of a graphene electron in uniform and nonuniform magnetic fields is\nderived. The exact energy spectrum agreeing with experimental data and exact\nFoldy-Wouthuysen wave eigenfunctions are obtained. These eigenfunctions\ndescribe multiwave (structured) states in (2+1)-space. It is proven that the\nHermite-Gauss beams exist even in the free space. In the multiwave\nHermite-Gauss states, graphene electrons acquire nonzero effective masses\ndependent on a quantum number and move with group velocities which are less\nthan the Fermi velocity. Graphene electrons in a static electric field also can\nexist in the multiwave Hermite-Gauss states defining non-spreading coherent\nbeams. These beams can be accelerated and decelerated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2023 17:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

The following\npersisting challenges motivated our research: (i) User and vehicular mobility,\nas well as redundant beam-reselections in mmWave networks, degrade the\nefficiency; (ii) Due to the large beamforming dimension at the BS, the\nbeamforming weights predicted by the cutting-edge DL-based methods often do not\nsuit the channel distributions; (iii) Co-located user devices may cause a\nsevere beam conflict, thus deteriorating system performance. To address the\naforementioned challenges, we exploit the synergy of supervised learning and\nsuper-resolution technology to enable low-overhead beam- and power allocation.\nIn the first step, we propose a method for beam-quality prediction.

We propose a distribution-aware fairness testing approach (called\nDistroFair) that systematically exposes class-level fairness violations in\nimage classifiers via a synergistic combination of out-of-distribution (OOD)\ntesting and semantic-preserving image mutation. DistroFair automatically learns\nthe distribution (e.g., number/orientation) of objects in a set of images. Then\nit systematically mutates objects in the images to become OOD using three\nsemantic-preserving image mutations -- object deletion, object insertion and\nobject rotation. We evaluate DistroFair using two well-known datasets\n(CityScapes and MS-COCO) and three major, commercial image recognition software\n(namely, Amazon Rekognition, Google Cloud Vision and Azure Computer Vision).\nResults show that about 21% of images generated by DistroFair reveal\nclass-level fairness violations using either ground truth or metamorphic\noracles. DistroFair is up to 2.3x more effective than two main baselines, i.e.,\n(a) an approach which focuses on generating images only within the distribution\n(ID) and (b) fairness analysis using only the original image dataset. We\nfurther observed that DistroFair is efficient, it generates 460 images per\nhour, on average. Finally, we evaluate the semantic validity of our approach\nvia a user study with 81 participants, using 30 real images and 30\ncorresponding mutated images generated by DistroFair. We found that images\ngenerated by DistroFair are 80% as realistic as real-world images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 08:38:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 02:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

Specifically, the philosophical idea of intangible clouds of\nconcepts is analyzed with empirical studies of concept representation and\nmental model formation, and mathematical formalizations of such ideas.\nEmpirical findings on emergent neural activity from neural network combinations\nare also examined for evidence of novel, emergent ideas from the collision of\nexisting ones.
