Recently,\nhoneypots are being deployed for Internet of things (IoT) devices to lure\nattackers, and learn their behavior. However, most of the existing IoT\nhoneypots, even the high interaction ones, are easily detected by an attacker\nwho can observe honeypot traffic due to lack of real network traffic\noriginating from the honeypot. This implies that, to build better honeypots and\nenhance cyber deception capabilities, IoT honeypots need to generate realistic\nnetwork traffic flows. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel deep learning\nbased approach for generating traffic flows that mimic real network traffic due\nto user and IoT device interactions. A key technical challenge that our\napproach overcomes is scarcity of device-specific IoT traffic data to\neffectively train a generator. We address this challenge by leveraging a core\ngenerative adversarial learning algorithm for sequences along with domain\nspecific knowledge common to IoT devices. Through an extensive experimental\nevaluation with 18 IoT devices, we demonstrate that the proposed synthetic IoT\ntraffic generation tool significantly outperforms state of the art sequence and\npacket generators in remaining indistinguishable from real traffic even to an\nadaptive attacker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 16:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Each utterance in\nspoken conversation can be represented by many semantic and speaker attributes,\nand there has been an interest in building Spoken Language Understanding (SLU)\nsystems for automatically predicting these attributes. Recent work has shown\nthat incorporating dialogue history can help advance SLU performance. However,\nseparate models are used for each SLU task, leading to an increase in inference\ntime and computation cost. Motivated by this, we aim to ask: can we jointly\nmodel all the SLU tasks while incorporating context to facilitate low-latency\nand lightweight inference? To answer this, we propose a novel model\narchitecture that learns dialog context to jointly predict the intent, dialog\nact, speaker role, and emotion for the spoken utterance. Note that our joint\nprediction is based on an autoregressive model and we need to decide the\nprediction order of dialog attributes, which is not trivial. To mitigate the\nissue, we also propose an order agnostic training method. Our experiments show\nthat our joint model achieves similar results to task-specific classifiers and\ncan effectively integrate dialog context to further improve the SLU\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 16:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

However, recovering texture for the 3D human avatar\nfrom a single image has been relatively less addressed. Because the generated\n3D human avatar reveals the occluded texture of the given image as it moves, it\nis critical to synthesize the occluded texture pattern that is unseen from the\nsource image. To generate a plausible texture map for 3D human avatars, the\noccluded texture pattern needs to be synthesized with respect to the visible\ntexture from the given image. Moreover, the generated texture should align with\nthe surface of the target 3D mesh. In this paper, we propose a texture\nsynthesis method for a 3D human avatar that incorporates geometry information.\nThe proposed method consists of two convolutional networks for the sampling and\nrefining process. The sampler network fills in the occluded regions of the\nsource image and aligns the texture with the surface of the target 3D mesh\nusing the geometry information. The sampled texture is further refined and\nadjusted by the refiner network. To maintain the clear details in the given\nimage, both sampled and refined texture is blended to produce the final texture\nmap. To effectively guide the sampler network to achieve its goal, we designed\na curriculum learning scheme that starts from a simple sampling task and\ngradually progresses to the task where the alignment needs to be considered. We\nconducted experiments to show that our method outperforms previous methods\nqualitatively and quantitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 16:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

The\nproposed estimator-controller framework is implemented in scenarios with and\nwithout vehicle-to-vehicle communication, demonstrating successful performance\nin maintaining platoon safety and stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 17:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

This is especially true in\nsystems where mutually beneficial cooperation between agents is possible, such\nas multi-agent systems. The large number of possible payoffs available to\nagents in reactive systems with quantitative properties means that there are\nmany scenarios in which agents deviate from mutually beneficial outcomes in\norder to gain negligible payoff improvements. This behavior often leads to less\ndesirable outcomes for all agents involved. For this reason we study\nsatisficing goals, derived from a decision-making approach aimed at meeting a\ngood-enough outcome instead of pure optimization. By considering satisficing\ngoals, we are able to employ efficient automata-based algorithms to find\npure-strategy Nash equilibria. We then show that these algorithms extend to\nscenarios in which agents have multiple thresholds, providing an approximation\nof optimization while still retaining the possibility of mutually beneficial\ncooperation and efficient automata-based algorithms.

Differential item\nfunctioning (DIF) analysis is typically conducted to assess measurement\ninvariance at the item level. Traditional DIF analysis methods require knowing\nthe comparison groups (reference and focal groups) and anchor items (a subset\nof DIF-free items). Such prior knowledge may not always be available, and\npsychometric methods have been proposed for DIF analysis when one piece of\ninformation is unknown. More specifically, when the comparison groups are\nunknown while anchor items are known, latent DIF analysis methods have been\nproposed that estimate the unknown groups by latent classes. When anchor items\nare unknown while comparison groups are known, methods have also been proposed,\ntypically under a sparsity assumption - the number of DIF items is not too\nlarge. However, there does not exist a method for DIF analysis when both pieces\nof information are unknown. This paper fills the gap. In the proposed method,\nwe model the unknown groups by latent classes and introduce item-specific DIF\nparameters to capture the DIF effects. Assuming the number of DIF items is\nrelatively small, an $L_1$-regularised estimator is proposed to simultaneously\nidentify the latent classes and the DIF items. A computationally efficient\nExpectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is developed to solve the non-smooth\noptimisation problem for the regularised estimator. The performance of the\nproposed method is evaluated by simulation studies and an application to item\nresponse data from a real-world educational test\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 17:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Our simulations show that wrapped clusters on narrower\ntubes grow more rapidly, evaporate more slowly, and require a lower protein\nconcentration to grow compared to equal-area round clusters on wider tubes.\nThese results suggest that cluster wrapping, facilitated by narrower tubes,\ncould be an important factor in the growth and stability of IRE1 clusters and\nthus impact the persistence of the UPR, connecting geometry to signaling\nbehavior. This work is consistent with recent experimental observations of IRE1\nclusters wrapped around narrow tubes in the ER network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 17:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

We confirm that the most\nprominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a\nlow number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing\nalgorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo\npositions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes\nstripped matter.

We find that the star formation efficiency\nis an order of magnitude smaller than that required to explain the CEERS\nphotometric observations mentioned earlier. Using the estimated star formation\nefficiency, we find the strongest constraints on the red tilt of the power\nspectrum on certain length scales. Our study shows that JWST observations will\nbe an excellent probe of the power spectrum and can lead to novel discoveries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

To achieve the presented efficiency, we consider inexact\nsolutions for the augmented Lagrangian subproblems, and through an adaptive\nsampling mechanism, we control the variance in the gradient estimates.\nFurthermore, we analyze the theoretical performance of the proposed scheme by\nshowing equivalence to a gradient descent algorithm on a Moreau envelope\nfunction, and we prove sublinear convergence for convex objectives and linear\nconvergence for strongly convex objectives with affine equality constraints.\nThe worst-case sample complexity of the resulting algorithm, for an arbitrary\nchoice of penalty parameter in the augmented Lagrangian function, is\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3-\\delta})$, where $\\epsilon > 0$ is the expected error\nof the solution and $\\delta > 0$ is a user-defined parameter.

Although hemispheric asymmetries of some\nheliospheric parameters vary systematically with Hale cycle, this is not common\nfor solar parameters. Also, no physical mechanism exists which can explain\nsystematic hemispheric asymmetries. We use a novel method of high\nheliolatitudes to increase the fraction of one hemisphere in solar 10.7cm radio\nfluxes and sunspot numbers. We calculate sets of hemispheric high-latitude\nradio fluxes and sunspot numbers with increasing heliographic latitude during\nthe last 75 years. We also normalise these fluxes by yearly means in order to\nstudy their continuous variation. We find that cycle maximum radio fluxes and\nsunspot numbers in each odd cycle (19, 21, 23) are larger at northern high\nlatitudes, while in all even cycles (18, 20, 22 24) they are larger at southern\nlatitudes. This alternation indicates a new form of Hale cycle variation in\nsolar activity. Hemispheric differences at cycle maxima are 15% for radio flux\nand 23% for sunspot numbers. The difference is largest during cycle 19 and\nsmallest in cycle 24. Continuous fluxes depict a Hale cycle in both\nhemispheres, with an opposite phase and amplitude of 5% in north and 4% in\nsouth. Hemispheric Hale cycle can be explained if there is a northward directed\nrelic magnetic field, which is shifted northward. In odd cycles, the northern\nhemisphere is enhanced more than the southern hemisphere and, in even cycles,\nthe northern hemisphere is reduced more than the southern hemisphere. The\ndecrease of asymmetry during the 7 cycles can be explained if the relic shift\noscillates at the 210-year Suess/deVries period.

We propose what is to our\nknowledge the first model-agnostic measure of the inherent generalization\ndifficulty of tasks. Our inductive bias complexity measure quantifies the total\ninformation required to generalize well on a task minus the information\nprovided by the data. It does so by measuring the fractional volume occupied by\nhypotheses that generalize on a task given that they fit the training data. It\nscales exponentially with the intrinsic dimensionality of the space over which\nthe model must generalize but only polynomially in resolution per dimension,\nshowing that tasks which require generalizing over many dimensions are\ndrastically more difficult than tasks involving more detail in fewer\ndimensions. Our measure can be applied to compute and compare supervised\nlearning, reinforcement learning and meta-learning generalization difficulties\nagainst each other.

It typically involves collecting and storing\nobservable software data, which can be analyzed online or offline. Despite the\nusefulness of collecting system data, it may significantly impact the system\nexecution by delaying response times and competing with system resources. The\ntypical approach to cope with this is to filter portions of the system to be\nmonitored and to sample data. Although these approaches are a step towards\nachieving a desired trade-off between the amount of collected information and\nthe impact on the system performance, they focus on collecting data of a\nparticular type or may capture a sample that does not correspond to the actual\nsystem behavior.

Inspired by the 2021 Diabetic Foot Ulcer\nGrand Challenge, researchers designed automated multi-class classification of\nDFU, including infection, ischaemia, both of these conditions, and none of\nthese conditions. However, it remains a challenge as classification accuracy is\nstill not satisfactory. This paper proposes a Venn Diagram interpretation of\nmulti-label CNN-based method, utilizing different image enhancement strategies,\nto improve the multi-class DFU classification.

The coherent motion is due to the long-range\ncooperation of molecular motors tethered to chromatin. Cooperation occurs if\neach motor acts simultaneously on the polymer and the surrounding solvent,\nexerting on them equal and opposite forces. This drives the flow of solvent\npast the polymer, which in turn affects the orientation of nearby motors and,\nif the drive is strong enough, an active polar (``ferromagnetic'') phase of\nmotors can spontaneously form. Depending on boundary conditions, either\ntransverse flows, or sustained longitudinal oscillations and waves are\npossible. Predicted time and length scales are consistent with experiments. We\nnow have in hand a coarse-grained description of chromatin dynamics which\nreproduces the directed coherent flows of chromatin seen in experiments. This\nfield-theoretic description can be analytically coupled to other features of\nthe nuclear environment such as fluctuating or porous boundaries, local\nheterogeneities in the distribution of chromatin or its activity, leading to\ninsights on the effects of activity on the cell nucleus and its contents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 19:32:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 17:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

On the flip side, minimax/outage-optimal policies are\ntoo pessimistic and often hard to determine. We propose a new risk-aware\nformulation of the resource allocation problem for standard multi-user\npoint-to-point power-constrained communication with no cross-interference, by\nemploying the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CV@R) as a measure of fading risk. A\nremarkable feature of this approach is that it is a convex generalization of\nthe ergodic setting while inducing robustness and reliability in a fully\ntunable way, thus bridging the gap between the (naive) ergodic and\n(conservative) minimax approaches. We provide a closed-form expression for the\nCV@R-optimal policy given primal/dual variables, extending the classical\nstochastic waterfilling policy. We then develop a primal-dual tail-waterfilling\nscheme to recursively learn a globally optimal risk-aware policy. The\neffectiveness of the approach is verified via detailed simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 19:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

This\nchallenge has motivated the exploration of alternative search methods, such as\ndeep neural networks (DNNs). Previous attempts to apply convolutional\nimage-classification DNN architectures to all-sky and directed CW searches\nshowed promise for short, one-day search durations, but proved ineffective for\nlonger durations of around ten days. In this paper, we offer a hypothesis for\nthis limitation and propose new design principles to overcome it. As a proof of\nconcept, we show that our novel convolutional DNN architecture attains\nmatched-filtering sensitivity for a targeted search (i.e., single sky-position\nand frequency) in Gaussian data from two detectors spanning ten days. We\nillustrate this performance for two different sky positions and five\nfrequencies in the $20 - 1000 \\mathrm{Hz}$ range, spanning the spectrum from an\n``easy'' to the ``hardest'' case. The corresponding sensitivity depths fall in\nthe range of $82 - 86 / \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$. The same DNN architecture is\ntrained for each case, taking between $4 - 32$ hours to reach matched-filtering\nsensitivity. The detection probability of the trained DNNs as a function of\nsignal amplitude varies consistently with that of matched filtering.\nFurthermore, the DNN statistic distributions can be approximately mapped to\nthose of the $\\mathcal{F}$-statistic under a simple monotonic function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 19:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Increasingly, sites are moving to a\nmodel where the initial HTTP response contains only an HTML skeleton plus\nJavaScript that makes API calls to a variety of servers for the content\n(typically in JSON format), and then builds out the DOM client-side, more\neasily allowing for periodically refreshing the content in a page and allowing\ndynamic modification of the content. This client-side rendering, now\npredominant in social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, is also\nbeing adopted by news outlets, such as CNN.com. When conventional web archiving\ntechniques, such as crawling with Heritrix, are applied to pages that render\ntheir content client-side, the JSON responses can become out of sync with the\nHTML page in which it is to be embedded, resulting in temporal violations on\nreplay. Because the violative JSON is not directly observable in the page\n(i.e., in the same manner a violative embedded image is), the temporal\nviolations can be difficult to detect. We describe how the top level CNN.com\npage has used client-side rendering since April 2015 and the impact this has\nhad on web archives. Between April 24, 2015 and July 21, 2016, we found almost\n15,000 mementos with a temporal violation of more than 2 days between the base\nCNN.com HTML and the JSON responses used to deliver the content under the main\nstory. One way to mitigate this problem is to use browser-based crawling\ninstead of conventional crawlers like Heritrix, but browser-based crawling is\ncurrently much slower than non-browser-based tools such as Heritrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 20:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Despite the superior performance, these learning systems are\ninherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks - maliciously crafted inputs that\nare designed to mislead, or trick, models into making incorrect predictions. An\nadversary can physically change their appearance by wearing adversarial\nt-shirts, glasses, or hats or by specific behavior, to potentially avoid\nvarious forms of detection, tracking and recognition of surveillance systems;\nand obtain unauthorized access to secure properties and assets. This poses a\nsevere threat to the security and safety of modern surveillance systems. This\npaper reviews recent attempts and findings in learning and designing physical\nadversarial attacks for surveillance applications. In particular, we propose a\nframework to analyze physical adversarial attacks and provide a comprehensive\nsurvey of physical adversarial attacks on four key surveillance tasks:\ndetection, identification, tracking, and action recognition under this\nframework. Furthermore, we review and analyze strategies to defend against the\nphysical adversarial attacks and the methods for evaluating the strengths of\nthe defense.

When many cilia are located on a surface, their beating can synchronise\nsuch that their phases form metachronal waves. Here, we computationally study a\nmodel where each cilium is represented as a spherical particle, moving along a\ntilted trajectory with a position-dependent active driving force and a\nposition-dependent internal drag coefficient. The model thus takes into account\nall the essential broken symmetries of the ciliary beat. We show that taking\ninto account the near-field hydrodynamic interactions, the effective coupling\nbetween cilia can become nonreciprocal: the phase of a cilium is more strongly\naffected by an adjacent cilium on one side than by a cilium at the same\ndistance in the opposite direction. As a result, synchronisation starts from a\nseed at the edge of a group of cilia and propagates rapidly across the system,\nleading to a synchronisation time that scales proportionally to the linear\ndimension of the system. We show that a ciliary carpet is characterised by\nthree different velocities: the velocity of fluid transport, the phase velocity\nof metachronal waves and the group velocity of order propagation.

It is a key primitive for developing\nquantum technologies. Neural network quantum state tomography (NNQST), which\naims to reconstruct the quantum state via a neural network ansatz, is often\nimplemented via a basis-dependent cross-entropy loss function. State-of-the-art\nimplementations of NNQST are often restricted to characterizing a particular\nsubclass of states, to avoid an exponential growth in the number of required\nmeasurement settings. To provide a more broadly applicable method for efficient\nstate reconstruction, we present \"neural-shadow quantum state tomography\"\n(NSQST)-an alternative neural network-based QST protocol that uses infidelity\nas the loss function. The infidelity is estimated using the classical shadows\nof the target state. Infidelity is a natural choice for training loss,\nbenefiting from the proven measurement sample efficiency of the classical\nshadow formalism. Furthermore, NSQST is robust against various types of noise\nwithout any error mitigation.

The present work introduces an autoencoder framework that combines\nimplicit regularization with internal linear layers and $L_2$ regularization\n(weight decay) to automatically estimate the underlying dimensionality of a\ndata set, produce an orthogonal manifold coordinate system, and provide the\nmapping functions between the ambient space and manifold space, allowing for\nout-of-sample projections. We validate our framework's ability to estimate the\nmanifold dimension for a series of datasets from dynamical systems of varying\ncomplexities and compare to other state-of-the-art estimators. We analyze the\ntraining dynamics of the network to glean insight into the mechanism of\nlow-rank learning and find that collectively each of the implicit regularizing\nlayers compound the low-rank representation and even self-correct during\ntraining. Analysis of gradient descent dynamics for this architecture in the\nlinear case reveals the role of the internal linear layers in leading to faster\ndecay of a \"collective weight variable\" incorporating all layers, and the role\nof weight decay in breaking degeneracies and thus driving convergence along\ndirections in which no decay would occur in its absence. We show that this\nframework can be naturally extended for applications of state-space modeling\nand forecasting by generating a data-driven dynamic model of a spatiotemporally\nchaotic partial differential equation using only the manifold coordinates.\nFinally, we demonstrate that our framework is robust to hyperparameter choices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 21:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Our method uses zero real-world\nexperience (indoor or outdoor), and requires the simulator to model no\npredominantly-outdoor phenomenon (sloped grounds, sidewalks, etc). The key to\nI2O transfer is in providing the robot with additional context of the\nenvironment (i.e., a satellite map, a rough sketch of a map by a human, etc.)\nto guide the robot's navigation in the real-world. The provided context-maps do\nnot need to be accurate or complete -- real-world obstacles (e.g., trees,\nbushes, pedestrians, etc.) are not drawn on the map, and openings are not\naligned with where they are in the real-world. Crucially, these inaccurate\ncontext-maps provide a hint to the robot about a route to take to the goal.

These experiments are used to\nestimate a variety of effects: the increase in click rate due to the\nrepositioning of a banner, the impact on subscription rate as a consequence of\na discount or special offer, etc. In these settings, even effects whose sizes\nare very small can have large downstream impacts. The simple difference in\nmeans estimator (Splawa-Neyman et al., 1990) is still the standard estimator of\nchoice for many online A/B testing platforms due to its simplicity. This\nmethod, however, can fail to detect small effects, even when the experiment\ncontains thousands or millions of observational units. As a by-product of these\nexperiments, however, large amounts of additional data (covariates) are\ncollected. In this paper, we discuss benefits, costs and risks of allowing\nexperimenters to leverage more complicated estimators that make use of\ncovariates when estimating causal effects of interest. We adapt a recently\nproposed general-purpose algorithm for the estimation of causal effects with\ncovariates to the setting of online A/B tests. Through this paradigm, we\nimplement several covariate-adjusted causal estimators. We thoroughly evaluate\ntheir performance at scale, highlighting benefits and shortcomings of different\nmethods. We show on real experiments how \"covariate-adjusted\" estimators can\n(i) lead to more precise quantification of the causal effects of interest and\n(ii) fix issues related to imbalance across treatment arms - a practical\nconcern often overlooked in the literature. In turn, (iii) these more precise\nestimates can reduce experimentation time, cutting cost and helping to\nstreamline decision-making processes, allowing for faster adoption of\nbeneficial interventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 22:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Solutions to the linearized\nquasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equations are first used to show that the\nvertical length scale of a tropopause geopotential anomaly is initially\nshallow, but significantly increased by diabatic heating from radiative\nrelaxation. This process is deemed as geostrophic adjustment of the\nstratosphere to tropospheric forcing. Idealized, time-dependent calculations\nshow that tropopause geopotential anomalies can appreciably rise in the\nstratosphere on time scales of a couple months. A previously developed, coupled\ntroposphere-stratosphere model is introduced and modified to further understand\nhow tropospheric geopotential forcing can induce upwelling in the stratosphere.\nSolutions to steady, zonally-symmetric sea-surface-temperature forcings in the\nlinear $\\beta$-plane model show that the upwards stratospheric penetration of\nthe thermally induced tropopause geopotential anomaly is controlled by a\nnon-dimensional parameter that depends on the ratio between the time scale of\nwave-drag to that of radiation. It is also shown that the horizontal scale of\nthe tropopause geopotential anomaly modulates the vertical scale of the\nanomaly. When Earth-like non-dimensional parameters are used, the theoretical\nmodel predicts stratospheric temperature anomalies around two times larger in\nmagnitude than those in the boundary layer, approximately in line with\nobservational data. The results are argued to show that wave-drag alone may not\nsuffice to explain certain observed features of the lower stratosphere,\nforemost of which is the anti-correlation between sea-surface temperature and\nlower stratospheric temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 22:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

However, the high dependence of a weight\n$l$ makes it a key parameter to reach the maximum probability of success in the\nsearch process. Although many advances have been achieved with search\nalgorithms based on quantum walks, the number of self-loops can also be\ncritical for search tasks.

Therefore it is critical to understand how machine learning\nalgorithms can influence human actions, particularly in situations where\nmachine goals are misaligned with those of people. Since humans continually\nadapt to their environment using a combination of explicit and implicit\nstrategies, when the environment contains an adaptive machine, the human and\nmachine play a game. Game theory is an established framework for modeling\ninteractions between two or more decision-makers that has been applied\nextensively in economic markets and machine algorithms. However, existing\napproaches make assumptions about, rather than empirically test, how adaptation\nby individual humans is affected by interaction with an adaptive machine. Here\nwe tested learning algorithms for machines playing general-sum games with human\nsubjects. Our algorithms enable the machine to select the outcome of the\nco-adaptive interaction from a constellation of game-theoretic equilibria in\naction and policy spaces. Importantly, the machine learning algorithms work\ndirectly from observations of human actions without solving an inverse problem\nto estimate the human's utility function as in prior work. Surprisingly, one\nalgorithm can steer the human-machine interaction to the machine's optimum,\neffectively controlling the human's actions even while the human responds\noptimally to their perceived cost landscape. Our results show that game theory\ncan be used to predict and design outcomes of co-adaptive interactions between\nintelligent humans and machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 23:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Quantum circuit compilers that decompose high-level gates to native\ngates of the hardware and optimize the circuit play a key role in quantum\ncomputing. However, the quality and time complexity of the optimization process\ncan vary significantly especially for practically relevant large-scale quantum\ncircuits. As a result, third-party (often less-trusted/untrusted) compilers\nhave emerged, claiming to provide better and faster optimization of complex\nquantum circuits than so-called trusted compilers. However, untrusted compilers\ncan pose severe security risks, such as the theft of sensitive intellectual\nproperty (IP) embedded within the quantum circuit. We propose an obfuscation\ntechnique for quantum circuits using randomized reversible gates to protect\nthem from such attacks during compilation. The idea is to insert a small random\ncircuit into the original circuit and send it to the untrusted compiler. Since\nthe circuit function is corrupted, the adversary may get incorrect IP. However,\nthe user may also get incorrect output post-compilation. To circumvent this\nissue, we concatenate the inverse of the random circuit in the compiled circuit\nto recover the original functionality. We demonstrate the practicality of our\nmethod by conducting exhaustive experiments on a set of benchmark circuits and\nmeasuring the quality of obfuscation by calculating the Total Variation\nDistance (TVD) metric. Our method achieves TVD of up to 1.92 and performs at\nleast 2X better than a previously reported obfuscation method. We also propose\na novel adversarial reverse engineering (RE) approach and show that the\nproposed obfuscation is resilient against RE attacks.

It allows a\ndirect analysis for stochastic gradient/Langevin descent (SGD/SGLD) learning\nalgorithms without strong assumptions such as Lipschitz or convexity\nconditions. However, the current generalization error bounds within this\nframework are still far from optimal, while substantial improvements on these\nbounds are quite challenging due to the intractability of high-dimensional\ninformation quantities. To address this issue, we first propose a novel\ninformation theoretical measure: kernelized Renyi's entropy, by utilizing\noperator representation in Hilbert space. It inherits the properties of\nShannon's entropy and can be effectively calculated via simple random sampling,\nwhile remaining independent of the input dimension. We then establish the\ngeneralization error bounds for SGD/SGLD under kernelized Renyi's entropy,\nwhere the mutual information quantities can be directly calculated, enabling\nevaluation of the tightness of each intermediate step. We show that our\ninformation-theoretical bounds depend on the statistics of the stochastic\ngradients evaluated along with the iterates, and are rigorously tighter than\nthe current state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

In this paper, we focus on the use of citizen science\ndata in addressing complex challenges in environmental conservation. We\nconsider this issue from three perspectives. First, we present a literature\nscan of papers that have employed Bayesian models with citizen science in\necology. Second, we compare several popular majority vote algorithms and\nintroduce a Bayesian item response model that estimates and accounts for\nparticipants' abilities after adjusting for the difficulty of the images they\nhave classified.

The\ninteractions of neutrinos with matter in these environments are\nflavor-specific, which makes it of paramount importance to understand the\nflavor evolution of neutrinos. Flavor evolution in these environments can be a\nhighly nontrivial problem thanks to a multitude of collective effects in flavor\nspace, arising due to neutrino-neutrino ($\\nu$-$\\nu$) interactions in regions\nwith high neutrino densities. A neutrino ensemble undergoing flavor\noscillations under the influence of significant $\\nu$-$\\nu$ interactions is\nsomewhat analogous to a system of coupled spins with long-range interactions\namong themselves and with an external field ('long-range' in momentum-space in\nthe case of neutrinos). As a result, it becomes pertinent to consider whether\nthese interactions can give rise to significant quantum correlations among the\ninteracting neutrinos, and whether these correlations have any consequences for\nthe flavor evolution of the ensemble.

Despite their ability to eliminate over-fitting, existing few-shot object\ndetectors encounter drawbacks such as slow detection speed and high memory\nrequirements, making them difficult to implement in a real-world deployment\nscenario. To this end, we propose a lightweight and effective few-shot detector\nto achieve competitive performance with general object detection with only a\nfew samples for ore images. First, the proposed support feature mining block\ncharacterizes the importance of location information in support features. Next,\nthe relationship guidance block makes full use of support features to guide the\ngeneration of accurate candidate proposals. Finally, the dual-scale semantic\naggregation module retrieves detailed features at different resolutions to\ncontribute with the prediction process. Experimental results show that our\nmethod consistently exceeds the few-shot detectors with an excellent\nperformance gap on all metrics.

Fans are a favourable option for respirators to\nventilate the mask and remove the stale air. This study utilized computational\nfluid dynamics simulation consisting of a hybrid Reynolds-averaged\nNavier-Stokes (RANS)-large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence method to compare\nthe inhalation flow properties for different fan locations (bottom, top, and\nside) with regular respirator breathing. Three mask positions, top, side, and\nbottom, were evaluated under two breathing cycles (approximately 9.65s of\nbreathing time).

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as one\nof the most effective recommender system models because they model the rich\nrelational information. The ever-growing volume of data can make training GNNs\nprohibitively expensive. To address this, previous attempts propose to train\nthe GNN models incrementally as new data blocks arrive. Feature and structure\nknowledge distillation techniques have been explored to allow the GNN model to\ntrain in a fast incremental fashion while alleviating the catastrophic\nforgetting problem. However, preserving the same amount of the historical\ninformation for all users is sub-optimal since it fails to take into account\nthe dynamics of each user's change of preferences. For the users whose\ninterests shift substantially, retaining too much of the old knowledge can\noverly constrain the model, preventing it from quickly adapting to the users'\nnovel interests. In contrast, for users who have static preferences, model\nperformance can benefit greatly from preserving as much of the user's long-term\npreferences as possible. In this work, we propose a novel training strategy\nthat adaptively learns personalized imitation weights for each user to balance\nthe contribution from the recent data and the amount of knowledge to be\ndistilled from previous time periods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nlearning imitation weights via a comparison on five diverse datasets for three\nstate-of-art structure distillation based recommender systems.

One method for creating ion-photon\nentanglement is to exploit optically transitions from the P_(1/2) to S_(1/2)\nlevels, which naturally emit spin-photon entangled states. But these optical\ntransitions typically lie in the ultra-violet and visible wavelength regimes.\nThese wavelengths exhibit significant fiber-optic propagation loss, thereby\nlimiting the transfer of quantum information to tens of meters. Quantum\nfrequency conversion is essential to convert these photons to telecom\nwavelengths so that they can propagate over long distances in fiber-based\nnetworks, as well as for compatibility with the vast number of telecom-based\nopto-electronic components. Here, we generate O-band telecom photons via a low\nnoise quantum frequency conversion scheme from photons emitted from the P_(1/2)\nto S_(1/2) dipole transition of a trapped barium ion.

In this work, we\nstudy steady-state quantum thermodynamics involving baths with negative\ntemperatures. A bath with a negative temperature is created synthetically using\ntwo baths of positive temperatures and weakly coupling these with a qutrit\nsystem. These baths are then coupled to each other via a working system. At\nsteady-state, the laws of thermodynamics are analyzed. We find that whenever\nthe temperatures of these synthetic baths are identical, there is no heat flow,\nwhich reaffirms the zeroth law. There is always a spontaneous heat flow for\ndifferent temperatures. In particular, heat flows from a bath with a negative\ntemperature to a bath with a positive temperature which, in turn, implies that\na bath with a negative temperature is `hotter' than a bath with a positive\ntemperature. This warrants an amendment in the Kelvin-Planck statement of the\nsecond law, as suggested in earlier studies. In all these processes, the\noverall entropy production is positive, as required by the Clausius statement\nof the second law.

In addition, we find\nthat a step change of the sound velocity occurs in the hadron-quark mixed\nphase, and it is restored with the decrease of nucleon and lepton degrees of\nfreedom in the high density quark phase. The approximate rule that the\npolytropic index $\\gamma \\leq 1.75$ can also be used as a criterion for\nseparating hadronic from quark matter in our work.

We present a self-consistent\ninterior-atmosphere model to constrain the volatile mass fraction, surface\npressure, and temperature of rocky planets with water and CO2 atmospheres.\nThese parameters obtained in our analysis can then be used to predict\nobservations in emission spectroscopy and photometry with JWST, which can\ndetermine the presence of an atmosphere, and if present, its composition. To\nobtain the bolometric emission and Bond albedo for an atmosphere in\nradiative-convective equilibrium, we present the k-uncorrelated approximation\nfor fast computations within our retrieval on planetary mass, radius and host\nstellar abundances. For the generation of emission spectra, we use our\nk-correlated atmospheric model. An adaptive MCMC is used for an efficient\nsampling of the parameter space at low volatile mass fractions. We show how to\nuse our modelling approach to predict observations with JWST for TRAPPIST-1 c\nand 55 Cancri e. TRAPPIST-1 c's most likely scenario is a bare surface,\nalthough the presence of an atmosphere cannot be ruled out. If the emission in\nthe MIRI F1500 filter is 731 ppm or higher, there would be a water-rich\natmosphere. For fluxes between 730 and 400 ppm, no atmosphere is present, while\nlow emission fluxes (300 ppm) indicate a CO2-dominated atmosphere. In the case\nof 55 Cancri e, a combined spectrum with NIRCam and MIRI LRS may present high\nuncertainties at wavelengths between 3 and 3.7 $\\mu$m. However, this does not\naffect the identification of H2O and CO2 because they do not present spectral\nfeatures in this wavelength range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 08:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Instead, it directly uses 2D images of the product as\navailable in product catalog database, and a 2D picture of the context, for\nexample taken from the user's phone camera.

Even when fatty acid\nvesicles appear adhered or hemifused to each other, the intervening barriers\nbetween vesicles do not rupture. This difference is likely because fatty acids\nhave a single aliphatic tail, and are more dynamic than their phospholipid\ncounterparts. To address this, we postulate that fusion could instead occur\nunder conditions, such as lipid exchange, that disrupt lipid packing.

However, further tuning the VPG\npart of the VL-LLM still suffers from indispensable computational costs, i.e.,\nrequiring thousands of GPU hours and millions of training data. One alternative\nsolution is to transfer an existing VPG from any existing VL-LLMs for the\ntarget VL-LLM.\n  In this work, we for the first time investigate the VPG transferability\nacross LLMs, and explore a solution to reduce the cost of VPG transfer. We\nfirst study the VPG transfer across different LLM sizes (e.g., small-to-large),\nand across different LLM types, through which we diagnose the key factors to\nmaximize the transfer efficiency. Based on our observation, we design a\ntwo-stage transfer framework named VPGTrans, which is simple yet highly\neffective. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that VPGTrans helps\nsignificantly speed up the transfer learning process without compromising\nperformance. Remarkably, it helps achieve the VPG transfer from BLIP-2\nOPT$_\\text{2.7B}$ to BLIP-2 OPT$_\\text{6.7B}$ with over 10 times speed-up and\n10.7% training data compared with connecting a VPG to OPT$_\\text{6.7B}$ from\nscratch.

However, which path to take in the evolution is\noften unclear, and a direct linear interpolation, which is the most common\nmethod, may not be optimal. In this work, we explore new types of adiabatic\npaths based on an eigendecomposition of the coefficient tensor in the second\nquantised representation of the difference between the final and initial\nhamiltonian (the residual hamiltonian). Since there is a direct correspondence\nbetween this tensor and a projection of the residual hamiltonian onto the\nsubspace of two particles, this approach is essentially a two-body spectral\ndecomposition. We show how for general hamiltonians, the adiabatic time\ncomplexity may be upper bounded in terms of the number of one-body modes $L$\nand a minimal gap $\\Delta$ along the path. Our finding is that the complexity\nis determined primarily by the degree of pairing in the two-body states. As a\nresult, systems whose two-body eigenstates are uniform superpositions of\ndistinct fermion pairs tend to exhibit maximal complexity, which scales as\n$O(L^4/\\Delta^3)$ in direct interpolation and $O(L^6/\\Delta^3)$ in an evolution\nthat follows a path along the corners of a hypercube in parameter space. The\nusefulness of our method is demonstrated through a few examples involving\nFermi-Hubbard models where, due to symmetries, level crossings occur in direct\ninterpolation.

In this paper, we present Arax, a\nruntime system that decouples applications from heterogeneous accelerators\nwithin a server. First, Arax maps application tasks dynamically to available\nresources, managing all required task state, memory allocations, and task\ndependencies. As a result, Arax can share accelerators across applications in a\nserver and adjust the resources used by each application as load fluctuates\nover time. dditionally, Arax offers a simple API and includes Autotalk, a stub\ngenerator that automatically generates stub libraries for applications already\nwritten for specific accelerator types, such as NVIDIA GPUs. Consequently, Arax\napplications are written once without considering physical details, including\nthe number and type of accelerators. Our results show that applications, such\nas Caffe, TensorFlow, and Rodinia, can run using Arax with minimum effort and\nlow overhead compared to native execution, about 12% (geometric mean). Arax\nsupports efficient accelerator sharing, by offering up to 20% improved\nexecution times compared to NVIDIA MPS, which supports NVIDIA GPUs only. Arax\ncan transparently provide elasticity, decreasing total application turn-around\ntime by up to 2x compared to native execution without elasticity support.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 09:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

While\ntopological properties in electronic systems are often linked to the\nquantization of electric conductivity observed in the integer quantum Hall\neffect, a direct analogue in optics remains elusive. In this study, we bridge\nthis gap by demonstrating that the response of the Poynting vector (which may\nbe regarded as a \"photon current\") to the mechanical acceleration of a medium\nprovides a precise photonic analogue of the electric conductivity. In\nparticular, it is shown that the photonic conductivity determines the\nirreversible energy transferred from a periodic mechanical driving of the\nmedium to the electromagnetic field. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that for\nnonreciprocal systems enclosed in a cavity, the constant acceleration of the\nsystem induces a flow of photons along a direction perpendicular to the\nacceleration, analogous to the Hall effect but for light. The spectral density\nof the photonic conductivity is quantized in the band gaps of the bulk region\nwith the conductivity quantum determined by the gap Chern number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 09:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

The\ncompression of such data becomes challenging with overwhelming data amounts\ncomprising millions of points. Herein, we leverage the human geometric prior in\ngeometry redundancy removal of point clouds, greatly promoting the compression\nperformance. More specifically, the prior provides topological constraints as\ngeometry initialization, allowing adaptive adjustments with a compact parameter\nset that could be represented with only a few bits. Therefore, we can envisage\nhigh-resolution human point clouds as a combination of geometric priors and\nstructural deviations. The priors could first be derived with an aligned point\ncloud, and subsequently the difference of features is compressed into a compact\nlatent code. The proposed framework can operate in a play-and-plug fashion with\nexisting learning based point cloud compression methods. Extensive experimental\nresults show that our approach significantly improves the compression\nperformance without deteriorating the quality, demonstrating its promise in a\nvariety of applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 10:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

The goal is to find an incremental\nsolution that guarantees a good competitive ratio against the optimum solution\nfor all cardinalities simultaneously. The central challenge is to characterize\nmaximization problems where this is possible, and to determine the\nbest-possible competitive ratio that can be attained. A lower bound of $2.18$\nand an upper bound of $\\varphi + 1 \\approx 2.618$ are known on the competitive\nratio for monotone and accountable objectives [Bernstein et al., Math.

We solve the 3D MHD equations\nwith the Pencil Code in a solar-like convective zone in a spherical wedge setup\nwith a $2\\pi$ azimuthal extent.

It is\nusually assumed that in vacuum the electromagnetic waves propagate along null\ngeodesics, a result which follows from the geometrical optics approximation.\nHowever, this model is valid only in the limit of infinitely high frequencies.\nAt large but finite frequencies, the ray dynamics is affected by the wave\npolarization. Therefore, the propagation of the electromagnetic waves can\ndeviate from null geodesics, and this phenomenon is known as the gravitational\nspin Hall effect of light. On the other hand, Maxwell's equations have the\nremarkable property of conformal invariance. This property is a cornerstone of\nWeyl geometry and the corresponding gravitational theories. As a first step in\nour study, we obtain the polarization-dependent ray equations in Weyl geometry,\ndescribing the gravitational spin Hall effect of light in the presence of\nnonmetricity. As a specific example of the spin Hall effect of light in Weyl\ngeometry, we consider the case of the simplest conformally invariant action,\nconstructed from the square of the Weyl scalar, and the strength of the Weyl\nvector only. The action is linearized in the Weyl scalar by introducing an\nauxiliary scalar field. In static spherical symmetry, this theory admits an\nexact black hole solution, which generalizes the standard Schwarzschild\nsolution through the presence of two new terms in the metric, having a linear\nand a quadratic dependence on the radial coordinate.

One of\nthese innovations is crowdsourced delivery, where deliveries are made by\noccasional drivers who wish to utilize their surplus resources (unused\ntransport capacity) by making deliveries in exchange for some compensation. In\naddition to reducing delivery costs, the potential benefits of crowdsourced\ndelivery include better utilization of transport capacity, a reduction in\noverall traffic, and increased flexibility (by scaling up and down delivery\ncapacity as needed). The use of occasional drivers poses new challenges because\n(unlike traditional couriers) neither their availability nor their behavior in\naccepting delivery offers is certain.

Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) implement Hamiltonian theory in\ndeep learning and form a comprehensive framework for modeling autonomous\nenergy-conservative systems. Despite being suitable to estimate a wide range of\nphysical system behavior from data, classical HNNs are restricted to systems\nwithout inputs and require noiseless state measurements and information on the\nderivative of the state to be available. To address these challenges, this\npaper introduces an Output Error Hamiltonian Neural Network (OE-HNN) modeling\napproach to address the modeling of physical systems with inputs and noisy\nstate measurements. Furthermore, it does not require the state derivatives to\nbe known. Instead, the OE-HNN utilizes an ODE-solver embedded in the training\nprocess, which enables the OE-HNN to learn the dynamics from noisy state\nmeasurements. In addition, extending HNNs based on the generalized Hamiltonian\ntheory enables to include external inputs into the framework which are\nimportant for engineering applications.

In this constraint framework, the sizes and values of\nthe goods are agent-specific, and one needs to allocate the goods among the\nagents fairly while further ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of total\nsize at most the corresponding budget of the agent. Since, in such a constraint\nsetting, it may not always be feasible to partition all the goods among the\nagents, we conform -- as in recent works -- to the construct of charity to\ndesignate the set of unassigned goods. For this allocation framework, we obtain\nexistential and computational guarantees for envy-free (appropriately defined)\nallocation of divisible and indivisible goods, respectively, among agents with\nindividual, additive valuations for the goods.\n  We deem allocations to be fair by evaluating envy only with respect to\nfeasible subsets. In particular, an allocation is said to be feasibly envy-free\n(FEF) iff each agent prefers its bundle over every (budget) feasible subset\nwithin any other agent's bundle (and within the charity). The current work\nestablishes that, for divisible goods, FEF allocations are guaranteed to exist\nand can be computed efficiently under generalized assignment constraints.\n  In the context of indivisible goods, FEF allocations do not necessarily\nexist, and hence, we consider the fairness notion of feasible envy-freeness up\nto any good (FEFx). We show that, under generalized assignment constraints, an\nFEFx allocation of indivisible goods always exists. In fact, our FEFx result\nresolves open problems posed in prior works. Further, for indivisible goods and\nunder generalized assignment constraints, we provide a pseudo-polynomial time\nalgorithm for computing FEFx allocations, and a fully polynomial-time\napproximation scheme (FPTAS) for computing approximate FEFx allocations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 11:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

When the FD deployment evolves into next-generation mobile\nnetworking, the SI problem becomes more complicated, significantly limiting its\npotential gains.} In this paper, we conceive a multi-cell FD networking scheme\nby deploying a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) at the cell boundary to\nconfigure the radio environment proactively. To achieve the full potential of\nthe system, we aim to maximize the sum rate (SR) of multiple cells by jointly\noptimizing the transmit precoding (TPC) matrices at FD base stations (BSs) and\nusers and the phase shift matrix at RIS. Since the original problem is\nnon-convex, we reformulate and decouple it into a pair of subproblems by\nutilizing the relationship between the SR and minimum mean square error (MMSE).\nThe optimal solutions of TPC matrices are obtained in closed form, while both\ncomplex circle manifold (CCM) and successive convex approximation (SCA) based\nalgorithms are developed to resolve the phase shift matrix suboptimally. Our\nsimulation results show that introducing an RIS into an FD networking system\nnot only improves the overall SR significantly but also enhances the cell edge\nperformance prominently. More importantly, we validate that the RIS deployment\nwith optimized phase shifts can reduce the requirement for SIC and the number\nof BS antennas, which further reduces the hardware cost and power consumption,\nespecially with a sufficient number of reflecting elements.

In contrast to drop coalescence, and in spite of the singular\nstretching of polymers, we find that the presence of the dissolved polymers\ndoes not at all affect the coalescence dynamics at early times. The polymer\nelasticity is found to slow down the flow only during the later stages of\ncoalescence. These observations are interpreted using an asymptotic solution of\nthe Oldroyd-B model, which predicts a strong stress singularity near the\nextremity of the neck.

Such a theory can be motivated by Palatini $R+R^2$\nmodified gravity. Assuming a runaway inflaton potential, we take the Universe\nto become dominated by the kinetic energy density of the scalar field after\ninflation. Initially, the leading kinetic term is quartic and we call the\ncorresponding period hyperkination. Subsequently, the usual quadratic kinetic\nterm takes over and we have regular kination, until reheating. We study, both\nanalytically and numerically, the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves\ngenerated during inflation and re-entering the horizon during the subsequent\neras. We demonstrate that the spectrum is flat for modes re-entering during\nradiation domination and hyperkination and linear in frequency for modes\nre-entering during kination: kinetic domination boosts the spectrum, but\nhyperkination truncates its peak. As a result, the effects of the kinetic\nperiod can be extended to observable frequencies without generating excessive\ngravitational waves, which could otherwise destabilise the process of Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis. We show that there is ample parameter space for the primordial\ngravitational waves to be observable in the near future.

While these polarization textures are\ninteresting and promising in terms of applications, their topology in general\nis yet to be fully understood. For example, the relation between topological\npolarization structures and band topology has not been explored, and polar\ndomain structures are typically considered in topologically trivial systems. In\nparticular, the local polarization in a crystal supercell is not well-defined,\nand typically calculated using approximations which do not satisfy gauge\ninvariance. Furthermore, local polarization in supercells is typically\napproximated using calculations involving smaller unit cells, meaning the\nconnection to the electronic structure of the supercell is lost.

The trust game (TG) is\nwidely used for studying trust and trustworthiness and entails a sequential\ninteraction between two players, an investor and a trustee. It requires at\nleast two strategies or options for an investor (e.g. to trust versus not to\ntrust a trustee). According to the evolutionary game theory, the antisocial\nstrategies (e.g. not to trust) evolve such that the investor and trustee end up\nwith lower payoffs than those that they would get with the prosocial strategies\n(e.g.to trust). A generalisation of the TG to a multiplayer (i.e.more than two\nplayers) TG was recently proposed. However, its outcomes hinge upon two\nassumptions that various real situations may substantially deviate from: (i)\ninvestors are forced to trust trustees and (ii) investors can turn into\ntrustees by imitation and vice versa. We propose an asymmetric multiplayer TG\nthat allows investors not to trust and prohibits the imitation between players\nof different roles; instead, investors learn from other investors and the same\nfor trustees. We show that the evolutionary game dynamics of the proposed TG\nqualitatively depends on the nonlinearity of the payoff function and the amount\nof incentives collected from and distributed to players through an institution.\nWe also show that incentives given to trustees can be useful and sufficient to\ncost-effectively promote trust and trustworthiness among self-interested\nplayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 13:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

The LQG controller comprises a linear quadratic regulator\n(LQR) and a steady-state Kalman observer; while the data-based LQR design\nproblem has been previously studied, constructing the Kalman gain and the LQG\ncontroller from noisy data presents a novel challenge.\n  In this work, a data-based formulation for computing the steady-state Kalman\ngain is proposed based on semi-definite programming (SDP) using some noise-free\ninput-state-output data. Additionally, a data-based LQG controller is\ndeveloped, which is shown to be equivalent to the model-based LQG controller.\nFor cases where offline data are corrupted by noise, a robust data-based\nobserver gain is constructed by tackling a relaxed SDP.

We use an analytic LTE disk model to fit the CO bandhead and\nthe dust emission, found to originate in different disk regions. For the first\ntime we modeled the 2nd overtone emission. Furthermore, we fit continuum\nnormalized bandheads and show the importance of this in constraining the\nemission region. We also include $^{13}\\rm CO$ in our models as an additional\nprobe of the young nature of the studied objects. We find that the CO emission\noriginates in a narrow region close to the star (<1 AU) and under very similar\ndisk conditions (temperatures and densities) for the different objects. This is\nconsistent with previous modeling of this emission in a diverse range of young\nstellar objects. We discuss these results in the context of the positions of\nthese PMS stars in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram and the CO emission's\nassociation with early age and high accretion rates in (massive) young stellar\nobjects.

Such problems are usually formulated as\nmixed-integer optimal control (MIOC) problems, which are challenging to solve\ndue to the complexity of the solution space. Numerical methods such as\nbranch-and-bound are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time\ncontrol. This paper proposes a novel continuous-discrete reinforcement learning\n(CDRL) algorithm, twin delayed deep deterministic actor-Q (TD3AQ), for MIOC\nproblems. TD3AQ combines the advantages of both actor-critic and Q-learning\nmethods, and can handle the continuous and discrete action spaces\nsimultaneously. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a hybrid electric\nvehicle (HEV) energy management problem, where real-time control of the\ncontinuous variable engine torque and discrete variable gear ratio is essential\nto maximize fuel economy while satisfying driving constraints. Simulation\nresults on different drive cycles show that TD3AQ can achieve near-optimal\nsolutions compared to dynamic programming (DP) and outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art discrete RL algorithm Rainbow, which is adopted for MIOC by\ndiscretizing continuous actions into a finite set of discrete values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 14:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

The most successful prior studies used a dataset 0.01-1 mHz,\nso the lunar response could be modeled as a simple dipole. However, earlier\nefforts also produced transfer functions up to 40 mHz. The smaller\nelectromagnetic skin depth at higher frequency would better resolve the\nuppermost mantle - where key information about primitive lunar evolution may\nstill be preserved - but requires a multipole treatment. I compute new profiles\nof electrical conductivity vs depth using both the low-frequency and the\nfull-bandwidth ranges of published Apollo-Explorer TFs. I derive temperature\nprofiles at depths >400 km (<1 mHz) consistent with conductive heat loss and\nexpectations of the iron (and possibly water) content of the mantle. The\nnear-constant iron fraction (Mg# 81 +/- 7) implies either efficient mixing, due\nto now-defunct convection or perhaps incomplete overturn of gravitationally\nunstable cumulates following crystallization of the magma ocean. In contrast,\nthe full-bandwidth analysis produced a different conductivity profile that\ncould not be realistically matched by conduction, convection, partial melting,\nor simple considerations of lateral heterogeneity. I conclude that the TF\nmethod at the Moon is unreliable >>1 mHz. Future EM sounding using the\nmagnetotelluric method can operate up to 100s Hz and is largely insensitive to\nmultipole effects, resolving structure to 100 km or less.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 14:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

The proposed quadratic formula is constructed based on an\nefficient formula of computing a projected derivative. It is efficient in that\nit completely eliminates the need to compute and store second derivatives of\nsolution variables or any other quantities, which are typically required in\nupgrading a second-order cell-centered unstructured-grid finite-volume\ndiscretization to third-order accuracy. Moreover, a high-order flux quadrature\nformula, as required for third-order accuracy, can also be simplified by\nutilizing the efficient projected-derivative formula, resulting in a numerical\nflux at a face centroid plus a curvature correction not involving second\nderivatives of the flux. Similarly, a source term can be integrated over a cell\nto high-order in the form of a source term evaluated at the cell centroid plus\na curvature correction, again, not requiring second derivatives of the source\nterm. The discretization is defined as an approximation to an integral form of\na conservation law but the numerical solution is defined as a point value at a\ncell center, leading to another feature that there is no need to compute and\nstore geometric moments for a quadratic polynomial to preserve a cell average.\nThird-order accuracy and improved second-order accuracy are demonstrated and\ninvestigated for simple but illustrative test cases in three dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 14:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

In\nsuch applications, it is important to find the clustering of points that is not\n``skewed'' in terms of the number of points, i.e., no cluster should contain\ntoo many points. This is modeled by capacity constraints on the sizes of\nclusters. In an orthogonal direction, another important consideration in\nclustering is how to handle the presence of outliers in the data. Indeed, these\nclustering problems have been generalized in the literature to separately\nhandle capacity constraints and outliers. To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas been very little work on studying the approximability of clustering\nproblems that can simultaneously handle both capacities and outliers.\n  We initiate the study of the Capacitated $k$-Median with Outliers (C$k$MO)\nproblem. Here, we want to cluster all except $m$ outlier points into at most\n$k$ clusters, such that (i) the clusters respect the capacity constraints, and\n(ii) the cost of clustering, defined as the sum of distances of each\nnon-outlier point to its assigned cluster-center, is minimized.\n  We design the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for C$k$MO. In\nparticular, our algorithm returns a (3+\\epsilon)-approximation for C$k$MO in\ngeneral metric spaces, and a (1+\\epsilon)-approximation in Euclidean spaces of\nconstant dimension, that runs in time in time $f(k, m, \\epsilon) \\cdot\n|I_m|^{O(1)}$, where $|I_m|$ denotes the input size. We can also extend these\nresults to a broader class of problems, including Capacitated\nk-Means/k-Facility Location with Outliers, and Size-Balanced Fair Clustering\nproblems with Outliers. For each of these problems, we obtain an approximation\nratio that matches the best known guarantee of the corresponding outlier-free\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 14:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Generating FM\ncombs in semiconductor lasers generally requires a fast saturable gain, usually\nlimited by the intrinsic gain medium properties. Here, we show how a spatial\nmodulation of the laser gain medium can enhance the gain saturation dynamics\nand nonlinearities to generate self-starting FM combs. We demonstrate this with\ntapered planarized THz quantum cascade lasers (QCLs). While simple ridge THz\nQCLs typically generate combs which are a mixture of amplitude and frequency\nmodulation, the on-chip field enhancement resulting from extreme spatial\nconfinement leads to an ultrafast saturable gain regime, generating a pure FM\ncomb with a flatter intensity spectrum, a clear linear frequency chirp and very\nintense beatnotes up to -30 dBm. The observed linear frequency chirp is\nreproduced using a spatially inhomogeneous mean-field theory model which\nconfirms the crucial role of field enhancement. In addition, the modified\nspatial temperature distribution within the waveguide results in an improved\nhightemperature comb operation, up to a heat sink temperature of 115 K, with\ncomb bandwidths of 600 GHz at 90 K. The spatial inhomogeneity also leads to\ndynamic switching between various harmonic states in the same device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 15:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

Further, decreasing the disc mass slows down planet\nmigration, but it then also increases the dust's radial drift, thereby\ndepleting the disc dust faster.

The\nRayleigh Gans Debye (RGD) approximation has enjoyed great success in describing\na wide range of scattering phenomena. We derive a generalized RGD formulation\nfrom the perturbation of Maxwell equations. In contrast to most treatments of\nRGD scattering, our formulation can model any soft scattering phenomena in\nlinear media, including scattering by stochastic process, lossy media, and by\nanisotropic inhomogeneities occurring at multiple length scales. Our\nfirst-principles derivation makes explicit underlying assumptions and provides\njumping off points for more general treatments. The derivation also facilitates\na deeper understanding of soft scattering. It is demonstrated that sources of\nscattering are not interfaces as is often presumed, but excess accelerating\ncharges emitting uncompensated radiation. Approximations to the equations are\nalso presented and discussed.

We show that DDVal is especially\nefficient in data distribution scenarios with many clients that have few data\npoints - for example, more than 16 clients with 8,000 data points each. By\nintegrating DDVal into a decentralized system, we show that it is not only\nsuitable for centralized federated learning, but also decentralized swarm\nlearning, which aligns well with the research on emerging internet technologies\nsuch as web3 to reward users for providing data to algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 22:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Existing flight trajectory\nprediction (FTP) approaches primarily rely on the flight status of historical\ntrajectory, leading to significant delays in the prediction of real-time\nmaneuvering instruction, which is not conducive to conflict detection. A major\nreason is that spoken instructions and flight trajectories are presented in\ndifferent modalities in the current air traffic control (ATC) system, bringing\ngreat challenges to considering the maneuvering instruction in the FTP tasks.\nIn this paper, a spoken instruction-aware FTP framework, called SIA-FTP, is\ninnovatively proposed to support high-maneuvering FTP tasks by incorporating\ninstant spoken instruction. To address the modality gap and minimize the data\nrequirements, a 3-stage learning paradigm is proposed to implement the SIA-FTP\nframework in a progressive manner, including trajectory-based FTP pretraining,\nintent-oriented instruction embedding learning, and multi-modal finetuning.\nSpecifically, the FTP model and the instruction embedding with maneuvering\nsemantics are pre-trained using volumes of well-resourced trajectory and text\ndata in the 1st and 2nd stages. In succession, a multi-modal fusion strategy is\nproposed to incorporate the pre-trained instruction embedding into the FTP\nmodel and integrate the two pre-trained networks into a joint model.

Starting from a circuit\nmodel, we theoretically demonstrate the nonreciprocal behaviour on a\ntransmission line building block creating a strong field asymmetry with a\nswitchable matching stub to enable two distinct working states. After\ntranslating to an electromagnetic model, this concept is first proved by\nsimulation and then experimentally verified on a microstrip-line-based\ndiode-integrated metasurface showing nonreciprocal transmission.

However, attaining\ntruly trustworthy AI concerns a wider vision that comprises the trustworthiness\nof all processes and actors that are part of the system's life cycle, and\nconsiders previous aspects from different lenses. A more holistic vision\ncontemplates four essential axes: the global principles for ethical use and\ndevelopment of AI-based systems, a philosophical take on AI ethics, a\nrisk-based approach to AI regulation, and the mentioned pillars and\nrequirements. The seven requirements (human agency and oversight; robustness\nand safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity,\nnon-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental wellbeing; and\naccountability) are analyzed from a triple perspective: What each requirement\nfor trustworthy AI is, Why it is needed, and How each requirement can be\nimplemented in practice. On the other hand, a practical approach to implement\ntrustworthy AI systems allows defining the concept of responsibility of\nAI-based systems facing the law, through a given auditing process. Therefore, a\nresponsible AI system is the resulting notion we introduce in this work, and a\nconcept of utmost necessity that can be realized through auditing processes,\nsubject to the challenges posed by the use of regulatory sandboxes.

In this transition, the energy vector hydrogen\nis expected to play a key role as it can be produced from (renewable) power and\nutilized in a plethora of applications and processes across sectors. To date,\nhowever, there is no infrastructure for the production, storage, and transport\nof renewable hydrogen, nor is there a demand for it on a larger scale. In order\nto link production and demand sites, it is planned to re-purpose and expand the\nexisting European gas pipeline network in the future. During the early stages\nof ramping up the hydrogen sector (2020s and early 2030s), however, blending\nnatural gas with hydrogen for joint pipeline transmission has been suggested.\nAgainst this background, this paper studies hydrogen blending from a modeling\nperspective, both in terms of the implications of considering (or omitting)\ntechnical modeling details and in terms of the potential impact on the ramp-up\nof the hydrogen sector. To this end, we present a highly modular and flexible\nintegrated sector-coupled energy system optimization model of the power,\nnatural gas, and hydrogen sectors with a novel gas flow formulation for\nmodeling blending in the context of steady-state gas flows. A stylized case\nstudy illustrates that hydrogen blending has the potential to initiate and to\nfacilitate the ramp-up of the hydrogen sector, while omitting the technical\nrealities of gas flows -- particularly in the context of blending -- can result\nin suboptimal expansion planning not only in the hydrogen, but also in the\npower sector, as well as in an operationally infeasible system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 07:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}
