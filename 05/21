It is more flexible\nthan the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) early exiting method PABEE because it\ncan simultaneously adjust the similarity score thresholds and the patience\nparameters. Extensive experiments show that: (1) F-PABEE makes a better\nspeedup-accuracy balance than existing early exiting strategies on both SLC and\nMLC tasks. (2) F-PABEE achieves faster inference and better performances on\ndifferent PLMs such as BERT and ALBERT.

With the advances in machine learning algorithms and\ncomputational capabilities, this approach is becoming increasingly important\nfor solving challenging control problems in robotics by learning unknown or\npartially known robot dynamics. Active exploration, in which a robot directs\nitself to states that yield the highest information gain, is essential for\nefficient data collection and minimizing human supervision. Similarly,\nuncertainty-aware deployment has been a growing concern in robotic control, as\nuncertain actions informed by the learned model can lead to unstable motions or\nfailure. However, active exploration and uncertainty-aware deployment have been\nstudied independently, and there is limited literature that seamlessly\nintegrates them. This paper presents a unified model-based reinforcement\nlearning framework that bridges these two tasks in the robotics control domain.\nOur framework uses a probabilistic ensemble neural network for dynamics\nlearning, allowing the quantification of epistemic uncertainty via Jensen-Renyi\nDivergence. The two opposing tasks of exploration and deployment are optimized\nthrough state-of-the-art sampling-based MPC, resulting in efficient collection\nof training data and successful avoidance of uncertain state-action spaces. We\nconduct experiments on both autonomous vehicles and wheeled robots, showing\npromising results for both exploration and deployment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 17:20:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 May 2023 12:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

As it forages, Physarum\ndynamically rearranges its network structure as a response to local stimuli\ninformation, optimising the connection between food sources. This high-level\nbehaviour was already exploited to solve numerous optimisation problems. We\ndevelop a flow-based model for the adaptive network formation of Physarum,\nwhich solves some inconsistencies of previous models. We first derive a general\nclass of equations describing the adaptation and flow dynamics of a static\nnetwork comprised of elastic channels filled with an incompressible fluid\nundergoing a Hagen-Poiseuille flow. An explicit form of the model is obtained\nby minimising the total power dissipated by the network. Considering a more\ngeneral functional form of the adaptive equations, a phase transition in the\nsystem is also found. The model is used for maze-solving and to build efficient\nand resilient networks in an arena mimicking mainland Portugal. By comparing\nthe resulting networks with the real Portuguese railway system, we found that\nthe model produced networks with a better overall performance when considering\nfluctuations in the network flows. Finally, the adaption model is extended to\nincorporate the network growth in the presence of multiple food sources. The\ncoupling of both processes produces networks with similar traits to several\nnetwork systems found in nature. We found that when the food sources operate\nalternately, the model can replicate the direct connections between the food\nsources observed in Physarum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 17:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

The wake recovery is analysed as a function of\nthe frequency of motion, measured by the Strouhal number, St. Our findings\nindicate that both directions of motion accelerate the transition to the\nfar-wake compared to the fixed turbine. The experimental outcomes confirm the\nCFD results of Li et al. (2022) showing that sideways motions lead to faster\nwake recovery, especially for St in [0.3, 0.6]. Additionally, we find that\nfore-aft motions also lead to better recovery for St in [0.3, 0.9]. Moreover,\nwe see that the recovery is closely linked to non-linear spatio-temporal\ndynamics. Special nonlinear dynamical effects are found in the shear layer\nregion of the wake (y = R). For both directions of motion and St in [0.25,\n0.55], the noisy wake dynamics synchronise to the frequency of the motion. For\nfore-aft motions and St in [0.55, 0.9], the wake shows more complex\nquasi-periodic phenomena. In fact, the driven frequency and a selfgenerated\nmeandering mode emerge and interact non-linearly, as proved by occurring mixing\ncomponents. Sideways motions result in large spatial structures of meandering.\nFore-aft motions induce pulsing of the wake. Both modes are linked to the\nsynchronisation effect. The quasi-periodic phenomena of fore-aft motions are\nconnected to meandering mode. Overall, the spatio-temporal phenomena lead to\nfaster recovery likely due to an increase of momentum transport towards wake\ncentre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 17:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

In this study, we focus on the problem of hedging a given target\noption by using multiple options. To extend the deep hedging framework to this\nsetting, the options used as hedging instruments also have to be priced during\ntraining. While one might use classical pricing model such as the Black-Scholes\nformula, ignoring frictions can offer arbitrage opportunities which are\nundesirable for deep hedging learning. The goal of this study is to develop a\nnested deep hedging method. That is, we develop a fully-deep approach of deep\nhedging in which the hedging instruments are also priced by deep neural\nnetworks that are aware of frictions. However, since the prices of hedging\ninstruments have to be calculated under many different conditions, the entire\nlearning process can be computationally intractable. To overcome this problem,\nwe propose an efficient learning method for nested deep hedging. Our method\nconsists of three techniques to circumvent computational intractability, each\nof which reduces redundant computations during training. We show through\nexperiments that the Black-Scholes pricing of hedge instruments can admit\nsignificant arbitrage opportunities, which are not observed when the pricing is\nperformed by deep hedging. We also demonstrate that our proposed method\nsuccessfully reduces the hedging risks compared to a baseline method that does\nnot use options as hedging instruments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 18:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

In this\nwork, we formulate a mathematical definition of what it means to safely learn a\ndynamical system by sequentially deciding where to initialize the next\ntrajectory. In our framework, the state of the system is required to stay\nwithin a safety region for a horizon of $T$ time steps under the action of all\ndynamical systems that (i) belong to a given initial uncertainty set, and (ii)\nare consistent with the information gathered so far.\n  For our first set of results, we consider the setting of safely learning a\nlinear dynamical system involving $n$ states.

Trustworthiness of the streamed data is\ncrucial which requires quantum safety and breach resiliency. Digital signatures\nare essential for scalable authentication and non-repudiation. Yet, NIST PQC\nsignature standards are exorbitantly costly for low-end IoT without considering\nforward security. Moreover, Post-Quantum (PQ) signatures lack aggregation,\nwhich is highly desirable to reduce the transmission and storage burdens in\nDTs. Hence, there is an urgent need for lightweight digital signatures that\noffer compromise resiliency and compactness while permitting an effective\ntransition into the PQ era for DTs.\n  We create a series of highly lightweight digital signatures called\nHardware-ASsisted Efficient Signature (HASES) that meets the above\nrequirements. The core of HASES is a hardware-assisted cryptographic commitment\nconstruct oracle (CCO) that permits verifiers to obtain expensive commitments\nwithout signer interaction. We created three HASES schemes: PQ-HASES is a\nforward-secure PQ signature, LA-HASES is an efficient aggregate Elliptic-Curve\nsignature, and HY-HASES is a novel hybrid scheme that combines PQ-HASES and\nLA-HASES with novel strong nesting and sequential aggregation. HASES does not\nrequire a secure-hardware on the signer. We proved that HASES schemes are\nsecure and implemented them on commodity hardware and an 8-bit AVR ATmega2560.\nOur experiments confirm that PQ-HASES and LA-HASES are two magnitudes of times\nmore signer efficient than their PQ and conventional-secure counterparts,\nrespectively.

We evaluate and\nbenchmark LEOShot against the state of the art and the results show that it\ndrastically expedites FL convergence by more than an order of magnitude. Also\nsurprisingly, despite the one-shot nature, its model accuracy is on par with or\neven outperforms regular iterative FL schemes by a large margin\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 May 2023 01:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

More specifically, it analyzes the\nFederal Reserve's quantitative easing (QE) programs, liquidity facilities, and\nforward guidance operations conducted from 2007 to 2018. The essay's detailed\nexamination of these policies culminates in an interrupted time-series (ITS)\nanalysis of the long-term causal effects of the QE programs on U.S. inflation\nand real GDP. The results of this formal design-based natural experimental\napproach show that the QE operations positively affected U.S. real GDP but did\nnot significantly impact U.S. inflation. Specifically, it is found that, for\nthe 2011Q2-2018Q4 post-QE period, real GDP per capita in the U.S. increased by\nan average of 231 dollars per quarter relative to how it would have changed had\nthe QE programs not been conducted. Moreover, the results show that, in 2018Q4,\nten years after the beginning of the QE programs, real GDP per capita in the\nU.S. was 14% higher relative to what it would have been during that quarter had\nthere not been the QE programs. These findings contradict Williamson's (2017)\ninformal natural experimental evidence and confirm the conclusions of VARs and\nnew Keynesian DSGE models that the Federal Reserve's QE policies positively\naffected U.S. real GDP. The results suggest that the current U.S. and worldwide\nhigh inflation rates are likely not because of the QE programs implemented in\nresponse to the financial crisis that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. They\nare likely due to the unprecedentedly large fiscal stimulus packages used, the\npeculiar nature of the financial downturn itself, the negative supply shocks\nfrom the war in Ukraine, or a combination of these factors. This paper is the\nfirst study to measure the macroeconomic effects of QE using a design-based\nnatural experimental approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 May 2023 02:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Though attractive, integrated recommendation requires\nthe ranking methods to migrate from conventional user-item models to the new\nuser-channel-item paradigm in order to better capture users' preferences on\nboth item and channel levels. Moreover, practical feed recommendation systems\nusually impose exposure constraints on different channels to ensure user\nexperience. This leads to greater difficulty in the joint ranking of\nheterogeneous items. In this paper, we investigate the integrated\nrecommendation task with exposure constraints in practical recommender systems.\nOur contribution is forth-fold. First, we formulate this task as a binary\nonline linear programming problem and propose a two-layer framework named\nMulti-channel Integrated Recommendation with Exposure Constraints (MIREC) to\nobtain the optimal solution. Second, we propose an efficient online allocation\nalgorithm to determine the optimal exposure assignment of different channels\nfrom a global view of all user requests over the entire time horizon.

The joint modeling of user interests, cross-channel\ncorrelation, and page context in our models aligns more with the browsing\nnature of feed products than existing models. Finally, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on both offline datasets and online A/B tests to verify the\neffectiveness of MIREC.

A one-stage linear weighted least squares\nestimator is proposed to simultaneously determine user equipment (UE)\nlocations, velocities, and scatterer (or RIS) locations using line-of-sight\n(LOS) and NLOS paths. The estimator supports environment sensing and UE\nlocalization even using only NLOS paths. A second-stage estimator is also\nintroduced to improve environment sensing accuracy by considering the nonlinear\nrelationship between UE and scatterer locations. Simulation results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed estimators in rich scattering environments\nand the benefits of using NLOS paths for improving UE location accuracy and\nassisting in environment sensing. The effects of RIS number, size, and\ndeployment on localization performance are also analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 May 2023 03:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Since predicting packet loss is challenging, these\nsystems only enhance their resilience to packet loss after it occurs, leaving\nsome frames insufficiently protected against burst packet losses. They may also\nadd too much redundancy even after the packet loss has subsided. We present\nGrace++, a new real-time video communication system. With Grace++, (i) a video\nframe can be decoded, as long as any non-empty subset of its packets are\nreceived, and (ii) the quality gracefully degrades as more packets are lost,\nand (iii) approximates that of a standard codec (like H.265) in absence of\npacket loss. To achieve this, Grace++ encodes and decodes frames by using\nneural networks (NNs). It uses a new packetization scheme that makes packet\nloss appear to have the same effect as randomly masking (zeroing) a subset of\nelements in the NN-encoded output, and the NN encoder and decoder are specially\ntrained to achieve decent quality if a random subset of elements in the\nNN-encoded output are masked.

By analyzing affect dynamics, we\ncan gain insights into how people communicate, respond to different situations,\nand form relationships. However, modeling affect dynamics is challenging due to\ncontextual factors, such as the complex and nuanced nature of interpersonal\nrelationships, the situation, and other factors that influence affective\ndisplays. To address this challenge, we propose a Cross-person Memory\nTransformer (CPM-T) framework which is able to explicitly model affective\ndynamics (intrapersonal and interpersonal influences) by identifying verbal and\nnon-verbal cues, and with a large language model to utilize the pre-trained\nknowledge and perform verbal reasoning. The CPM-T framework maintains memory\nmodules to store and update the contexts within the conversation window,\nenabling the model to capture dependencies between earlier and later parts of a\nconversation.

While the error of\nPad\\'e-like approximants depends inverse polynomially on the degree of the\napproximant, the error of minimax approximants has root exponential dependence\nand we give detailed estimates of the exponents in both cases. We also explain\nhow minimax approximants can be obtained in practice using the differential\ncorrection algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 May 2023 08:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Recently, diffusional denoising probabilistic models\n(DDPM) have demonstrated remarkable performance in the generative domain. Apart\nfrom their image generation capability, the denoising process in diffusion\nmodels can comprehensively account for the semantic correlation of\nspectral-spatial features in HSI, resulting in the retrieval of semantically\nrelevant features in the original image. In this work, we extend the diffusion\nmodel's application to the HSI-CD field and propose a novel unsupervised HSI-CD\nwith semantic correlation diffusion model (DiffUCD). Specifically, the semantic\ncorrelation diffusion model (SCDM) leverages abundant unlabeled samples and\nfully accounts for the semantic correlation of spectral-spatial features, which\nmitigates pseudo change between multi-temporal images arising from inconsistent\nimaging conditions. Besides, objects with the same semantic concept at the same\nspatial location may exhibit inconsistent spectral signatures at different\ntimes, resulting in pseudo change. To address this problem, we propose a\ncross-temporal contrastive learning (CTCL) mechanism that aligns the spectral\nfeature representations of unchanged samples.

Existing approaches rely on high-quality training sequences that\ncapture a diverse range of human motions in 3D scenes. However, such motion\ndata is costly, difficult to obtain and can never cover the full range of\nplausible human-scene interactions in complex indoor environments. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach to learn\npolicy networks that predict latent variables of a powerful generative motion\nmodel that is trained on a large-scale motion capture dataset (AMASS). For\nnavigating in a 3D environment, we propose a scene-aware policy training scheme\nwith a novel collision avoidance reward function. Combined with the powerful\ngenerative motion model, we can synthesize highly diverse human motions\nnavigating 3D indoor scenes, meanwhile effectively avoiding obstacles.

Therefore, traditional methods that\nmainly focus on improving the accuracy of recommended items are suboptimal for\nfeed recommendations because they may recommend highly similar items. For feed\nrecommendation, it is crucial to consider both the accuracy and diversity of\nthe recommended item sequences in order to satisfy users' evolving interest\nwhen consecutively viewing items. To this end, this work proposes a general\nre-ranking framework named Multi-factor Sequential Re-ranking with\nPerception-Aware Diversification (MPAD) to jointly optimize accuracy and\ndiversity for feed recommendation in a sequential manner.

A time-independent parametric\ndrive can be utilized to increase the estimation precision of the tripartite\ncoupling strength. By calculating the quantum Fisher information (QFI), we can\nobtain the optimal estimation precision by measuring the eigenstate of the\ntripartite system. At the critical position, the QFI is divergent due to that\nthe preparation time of the eigenstate is divergent. When the system is\nsubjected to a dissipation, the QFI near the critical point of the\ndriven-dissipation phase transition is analytically obtained.

For naturalness,\nwe novelly introduce a contextual watermarking scheme to generate watermarked\nvariables more coherent in the context atop graph neural networks. Each\nvariable is treated as a node on the graph and the node feature gathers\nneighborhood (context) information through learning. Watermarks embedded into\nthe features are thus reflected not only by the variables but also by the local\ncontexts. We further introduce a pre-trained model on source code as a teacher\nto guide more natural variable generation.

A typical approach is to leverage off-the-shelf machine translation\n(MT) systems to utilize either the training corpus or developed models from\nhigh-resource languages. In this work, we investigate whether it is helpful to\nutilize MT at all in this task. To do so, we simulate a low-resource scenario\nassuming access to limited Chinese dialog data in the movie domain and large\namounts of English dialog data from multiple domains. Experiments show that\nleveraging English dialog corpora can indeed improve the naturalness, relevance\nand cross-domain transferability in Chinese. However, directly using English\ndialog corpora in its original form, surprisingly, is better than using its\ntranslated version. As the topics and wording habits in daily conversations are\nstrongly culture-dependent, MT can reinforce the bias from high-resource\nlanguages, yielding unnatural generations in the target language. Considering\nthe cost of translating large amounts of text and the strong effects of the\ntranslation quality, we suggest future research should rather focus on\nutilizing the original English data for cross-lingual transfer in dialog\ngeneration. We perform extensive human evaluations and ablation studies. The\nanalysis results, together with the collected dataset, are presented to draw\nattention towards this area and benefit future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 May 2023 15:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

To this end, we develop a compact\ngadget framework in which the used gadget is a square matrix instead of the\nshort and fat one used in previous constructions. To work with this compact\ngadget, we devise a specialized gadget sampler, called semi-random sampler, to\ncompute the approximate preimage. It first deterministically computes the error\nand then randomly samples the preimage. We show that for uniformly random\ntargets, the preimage and error distributions are simulatable without knowing\nthe trapdoor. This ensures the security of the signature applications. Compared\nto the Gaussian-distributed errors in previous algorithms, the deterministic\nerrors have a smaller size, which lead to a substantial gain in security and\nenables a practically working instantiation.\n  As the applications, we present two practically efficient gadget-based\nsignature schemes based on NTRU and Ring-LWE respectively. The NTRU-based\nscheme offers comparable efficiency to Falcon and Mitaka and a simple\nimplementation without the need of generating the NTRU trapdoor. The LWE-based\nscheme also achieves a desirable overall performance. It not only greatly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art LWE-based hash-and-sign signatures, but also\nhas an even smaller size than the LWE-based Fiat-Shamir signature scheme\nDilithium. These results fill the long-term gap in practical gadget-based\nsignatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 May 2023 15:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

This autotelic learning process, literally the\npursuit of self-generated (auto) goals (telos), becomes more and more\nopen-ended as the goals become more diverse, abstract and creative. The\nresulting exploration of the space of possible skills is supported by an\ninter-individual exploration: goal representations are culturally evolved and\ntransmitted across individuals, in particular using language. Current\nartificial agents mostly rely on predefined goal representations corresponding\nto goal spaces that are either bounded (e.g. list of instructions), or\nunbounded (e.g. the space of possible visual inputs) but are rarely endowed\nwith the ability to reshape their goal representations, to form new\nabstractions or to imagine creative goals.

The LM is used as an imperfect model\nof human cultural transmission; an attempt to capture aspects of humans'\ncommon-sense, intuitive physics and overall interests. Specifically, it\nsupports three key components of the autotelic architecture: 1)~a relabeler\nthat describes the goals achieved in the agent's trajectories, 2)~a goal\ngenerator that suggests new high-level goals along with their decomposition\ninto subgoals the agent already masters, and 3)~reward functions for each of\nthese goals.

Predicting a stock market performance of a company is nearly hard\nbecause every time the prices of a company stock keeps changing and not\nconstant. So, its complex to determine the stock data. But if the previous\nperformance of a company in stock market is known, then we can track the data\nand provide predictions to stockholders in order to wisely take decisions on\nhandling the stocks to a company. To handle this, many machine learning models\nhave been invented but they didn't succeed due to many reasons like absence of\nadvanced libraries, inaccuracy of model when made to train with real time data\nand much more. So, to track the patterns and the features of data, a CNN-LSTM\nNeural Network can be made. Recently, CNN is now used in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) based applications, so by identifying the features from stock\ndata and converting them into tensors, we can obtain the features and then send\nit to LSTM neural network to find the patterns and thereby predicting the stock\nmarket for given period of time. The accuracy of the CNN-LSTM NN model is found\nto be high even when allowed to train on real-time stock market data. This\npaper describes about the features of the custom CNN-LSTM model, experiments we\nmade with the model (like training with stock market datasets, performance\ncomparison with other models) and the end product we obtained at final stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 May 2023 08:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

As an inherent nature of big data, data heterogeneity widely exists in\nreal-world recommendation systems. It reflects the differences in the\nproperties among sub-populations. Ignoring the heterogeneity in recommendation\ndata could limit the performance of recommendation models, hurt the\nsub-populational robustness, and make the models misled by biases. However,\ndata heterogeneity has not attracted substantial attention in the\nrecommendation community. Therefore, it inspires us to adequately explore and\nexploit heterogeneity for solving the above problems and assisting data\nanalysis. In this work, we focus on exploring two representative categories of\nheterogeneity in recommendation data that is the heterogeneity of prediction\nmechanism and covariate distribution and propose an algorithm that explores the\nheterogeneity through a bilevel clustering method. Furthermore, the uncovered\nheterogeneity is exploited for two purposes in recommendation scenarios which\nare prediction with multiple sub-models and supporting debias. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world data validate the existence of heterogeneity in\nrecommendation data and the effectiveness of exploring and exploiting data\nheterogeneity in recommendation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 May 2023 11:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

These Wi-Fi-based methods exhibit several\nadvantages over conventional state-of-the-art techniques that rely on cameras\nand sensors, including lower costs and ease of deployment. However, a\nsignificant challenge associated with Wi-Fi-based HAR is the significant\ndecline in performance when the scene or subject changes. To mitigate this\nissue, it is imperative to train the model using an extensive dataset. In\nrecent studies, the utilization of CNN-based models or sequence-to-sequence\nmodels such as LSTM, GRU, or Transformer has become prevalent. While\nsequence-to-sequence models can be more precise, they are also more\ncomputationally intensive and require a larger amount of training data. To\ntackle these limitations, we propose a novel approach that leverages a temporal\nconvolution network with augmentations and attention, referred to as TCN-AA.\nOur proposed method is computationally efficient and exhibits improved accuracy\neven when the data size is increased threefold through our augmentation\ntechniques.

Locksynth serves as the\nimplementation of our prior work on deriving abstract synchronization code.\nDesigning concurrent data structures involves inferring correct synchronization\ncode starting with a prior understanding of the sequential data structure's\noperations. Further, an understanding of shared memory model and the\nsynchronization primitives is also required. The reasoning involved\ntransforming a sequential data structure into its concurrent version can be\nperformed using Answer Set Programming and we mechanized our approach in\nprevious work. The reasoning involves deduction and abduction that can be\nsuccinctly modeled in ASP. We assume that the abstract sequential code of the\ndata structure's operations is provided, alongside axioms that describe\nconcurrent behavior. This information is used to automatically derive\nconcurrent code for that data structure, such as dictionary operations for\nlinked lists and binary search trees that involve a constant number of\ndestructive update operations. We also are able to infer the correct set of\nlocks (but not code synthesis) for external height-balanced binary search trees\nthat involve left/right tree rotations. Locksynth performs the analyses\nrequired to infer correct sets of locks and as a final step, also derives the\nC++ synchronization code for the synthesized data structures. We also provide a\nperformance analysis of the C++ code synthesized by Locksynth with the\nhand-crafted versions available from the Synchrobench microbenchmark suite. To\nthe best of our knowledge, our tool is the first to employ ASP as a backend\nreasoner to perform concurrent data structure synthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 20:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

An alternative to the\ntraditional top-down development of public services is co-creation of public\nservices. Co-creation promotes collaboration between stakeholders with the aim\nto create better public services and achieve public values. At the same time,\ndata analytics has been fuelled by the availability of immense amounts of\ntextual data. Whilst both co-creation and TA have been used in the private\nsector, we study existing works on the application of Text Analytics (TA)\ntechniques on text data to support public service co-creation. We\nsystematically review 75 of the 979 papers that focus directly or indirectly on\nthe application of TA in the context of public service development. In our\nreview, we analyze the TA techniques, the public service they support, public\nvalue outcomes, and the co-creation phase they are used in. Our findings\nindicate that the TA implementation for co-creation is still in its early\nstages and thus still limited. Our research framework promotes the concept and\nstimulates the strengthening of the role of Text Analytics techniques to\nsupport public sector organisations and their use of co-creation process. From\npolicy-makers' and public administration managers' standpoints, our findings\nand the proposed research framework can be used as a guideline in developing a\nstrategy for the designing co-created and user-centred public services.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 17:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}
