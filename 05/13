Despite its popularity in practice, a\nsatisfactory level of understanding of the convergence behavior of\nGaussian-gated MoE parameter estimation is far from complete. The underlying\nreason for this challenge is the inclusion of covariates in the Gaussian gating\nand expert networks, which leads to their intrinsically complex interactions\nvia partial differential equations with respect to their parameters. We address\nthese issues by designing novel Voronoi loss functions to accurately capture\nheterogeneity in the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for resolving parameter\nestimation in these models. Our results reveal distinct behaviors of the MLE\nunder two settings: the first setting is when all the location parameters in\nthe Gaussian gating are non-zeros while the second setting is when there exists\nat least one zero-valued location parameter. Notably, these behaviors can be\ncharacterized by the solvability of two different systems of polynomial\nequations.

The rate of innovation, as of today, is limited by a lack of\ndesign principles linking chemical motifs to functional microscopic structures,\nand by an incapacity to experimentally access microscopic structures from\ninvestigating macroscopic device properties. In this work, we envision a layout\nof a Digital Twin for PV materials aimed at removing both limitations. The\nlayout combines machine learning approaches, as performed in materials\nacceleration platforms (MAPs), with mathematical models derived from the\nunderlying physics and digital twin concepts from the engineering world. This\nlayout will allow using high-throughput (HT) experimentation in MAPs to improve\nthe parametrization of quantum chemical and solid-state models. In turn, the\nimproved and generalized models can be used to obtain the crucial structural\nparameters from HT data.

This asymmetry\nis expected to exist around the major galactic axis, and arises due to\nanisotropy of the interstellar radiation field and the inclination of M31. ICS\nemission and its asymmetry were modeled by GALPROP code for the trial case of\n$e^\\pm$ generated by annihilating weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs)\nwith various properties. The asymmetry was obtained to appear at photon\nenergies above $\\sim$ 0.1 MeV. Morphological and spectral properties of the\nasymmetry were studied in detail. Potential observational detection of the\nasymmetry may allow to infer the leptonic fraction in the emission generation\nmechanism, thus providing valuable inferences for understanding the nature of\nM31 gamma-ray halo emission. Specific asymmetry predictions were made for the\nrecently claimed DM interpretation of the outer halo emission. The paper also\nstudied the role of secondary -- ICS and bremsstrahlung -- emissions due to DM\nannihilation for that interpretation. And, finally, the latter was shown to be\nin significant tension with the recently derived WIMP constraints by radio data\non M31.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 16:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach\nfor training GANs with images as inputs, but without enforcing any pairwise\nconstraints. The intuition is that images are more structured than noise, which\nthe generator can leverage to learn a more robust transformation. The process\ncan be made efficient by identifying closely related datasets, or a ``friendly\nneighborhood'' of the target distribution, inspiring the moniker, Spider GAN.\nTo define friendly neighborhoods leveraging proximity between datasets, we\npropose a new measure called the signed inception distance (SID), inspired by\nthe polyharmonic kernel. We show that the Spider GAN formulation results in\nfaster convergence, as the generator can discover correspondence even between\nseemingly unrelated datasets, for instance, between Tiny-ImageNet and CelebA\nfaces. Further, we demonstrate cascading Spider GAN, where the output\ndistribution from a pre-trained GAN generator is used as the input to the\nsubsequent network. Effectively, transporting one distribution to another in a\ncascaded fashion until the target is learnt -- a new flavor of transfer\nlearning.

In this paper it is extended to include the\nintramolecular stretching coordinates of the three diatomic monomers. The\ncornerstone of our 12D methodology is the partitioning of the full vibrational\nHamiltonian of the trimer into two reduced-dimension Hamiltonians, one in 9D\nfor the intermolecular degrees of freedom (DOFs) and another in 3D for the\nintramolecular vibrations of the trimer, and a remainder term. These two\nHamiltonians are diagonalized separately and a fraction of their respective 9D\nand 3D eigenstates is included in the 12D product contracted basis for both the\nintra- and intermolecular DOFs, in which the matrix of the full 12D vibrational\nHamiltonian of the trimer is diagonalized. This methodology is implemented in\nthe 12D quantum calculations of the coupled intra- and intermolecular\nvibrational states of the hydrogen-bonded HF trimer on an {\\it ab initio}\ncalculated potential energy surface (PES).

Such moderation engines must answer a large number of queries with\nheavy computational cost, even though the actual number of images with\nobjectionable content is usually a tiny fraction. Inspired by recent work on\nNeural Group Testing, we propose an approach which exploits this fact to reduce\nthe overall computational cost of such engines using the technique of\nCompressed Sensing (CS). We present the quantitative matrix-pooled neural\nnetwork (QMPNN), which takes as input $n$ images, and a $m \\times n$ binary\npooling matrix with $m < n$, whose rows indicate $m$ pools of images i.e.\nselections of $r$ images out of $n$. The QMPNN efficiently outputs the product\nof this matrix with the unknown sparse binary vector indicating whether each\nimage is objectionable or not, i.e. it outputs the number of objectionable\nimages in each pool. For suitable matrices, this is decoded using CS decoding\nalgorithms to predict which images were objectionable. The computational cost\nof running the QMPNN and the CS algorithms is significantly lower than the cost\nof using a neural network with the same number of parameters separately on each\nimage to classify the images, which we demonstrate via extensive experiments.\nOur technique is inherently resilient to moderate levels of errors in the\nprediction from the QMPNN. Furthermore, we present pooled deep outlier\ndetection, which brings CS and group testing techniques to deep outlier\ndetection, to provide for the case when the objectionable images do not belong\nto a set of pre-defined classes. This technique enables efficient automated\nmoderation of off-topic images shared on topical forums dedicated to sharing\nimages of a certain single class, many of which are currently human-moderated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 17:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

Methods: The hybrid design considers\nintegration of the PIONEER 6 RCT with RWD controls using the\nexperiment-selector cross-validated targeted maximum likelihood estimator. We\nevaluate 95% confidence interval coverage, power, and average patient-time\nduring which participants would be precluded from receiving a glucagon-like\npeptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA) for each design using simulations.\nFinally, we estimate the effect of oral semaglutide on MACE for the hybrid\nPIONEER 6-RWD analysis. Results: In simulations, Designs 1 and 2 performed\nsimilarly. The tradeoff between decreased coverage and patient-time without the\npossibility of a GLP1-RA for Designs 1 and 3 depended on the simulated bias. In\nreal data analysis using Design 3, external controls were integrated in 84% of\ncross-validation folds, resulting in an estimated risk difference of\n-1.53%-points (95% CI -2.75%-points to -0.30%-points).

Supernova remnants (SNRs) represent strong candidates, as they\nprovide sufficient energetics to reproduce the CR flux observed at Earth.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether they can accelerate particles to PeV\nenergies, particularly after the very early stages of their evolution. This\nuncertainty has prompted searches for other source classes and necessitates\ncomprehensive theoretical modeling of the maximum proton energy, $E_{\\rm max}$,\naccelerated by an arbitrary shock. While analytic estimates of $E_{\\rm max}$\nhave been put forward in the literature, they do not fully account for the\ncomplex interplay between particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification,\nand shock evolution. This paper uses a multi-zone, semi-analytic model of\nparticle acceleration based on kinetic simulations to place constraints on\n$E_{\\rm max}$ for a wide range of astrophysical shocks. In particular, we\ndevelop relationships between $E_{\\rm max}$, shock velocity, size, and ambient\nmedium. We find that SNRs can only accelerate PeV particles under a select set\nof circumstances, namely, if the shock velocity exceeds $\\sim 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$\nand escaping particles drive magnetic field amplification. However, older,\nslower SNRs may still produce observational signatures of PeV particles due to\npopulations accelerated when the shock was younger. Our results serve as a\nreference for modelers seeking to quickly produce a self-consistent estimate of\nthe maximum energy accelerated by an arbitrary astrophysical shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

The purpose of this article is to define and investigate a solution\nof the Dirichlet problem, which we call Perron solution, in a setting where no\nmaximum principle is available. We characterise this solution in different\nways: by approximating the domain by smooth domains from the interior, by\nvariational properties, by the pointwise boundary behaviour at regular boundary\npoints and by using the approximative trace. We also investigate for which\nboundary data the Perron solution has finite energy.

While offline\nplanning allows optimizing a full reference trajectory for the minimum lap time\nobjective, such modeling discrepancies are particularly detrimental when using\noffline planning, as planning model errors compound with controller modeling\nerrors.

However,\nexisting deep learning-based methods recover only one HRMS image from the LRMS\nimage and PAN image using a deterministic mapping, thus ignoring the diversity\nof the HRMS image. In this paper, to alleviate this ill-posed issue, we propose\na flow-based pan-sharpening network (PanFlowNet) to directly learn the\nconditional distribution of HRMS image given LRMS image and PAN image instead\nof learning a deterministic mapping. Specifically, we first transform this\nunknown conditional distribution into a given Gaussian distribution by an\ninvertible network, and the conditional distribution can thus be explicitly\ndefined.

This stands in contrast to the broad\nadaptation of semantic parsing approaches over structured data sources (e.g.,\nrelational database, knowledge graphs), that convert natural language questions\nto logical forms and execute them with query engines. Towards combining the\nstrengths of neural and symbolic methods, we propose a framework of question\nparsing and execution on textual QA. It comprises two central pillars: (1) We\nparse the question of varying complexity into an intermediate representation,\nnamed H-expression, which is composed of simple questions as the primitives and\nsymbolic operations representing the relationships among them; (2) To execute\nthe resulting H-expressions, we design a hybrid executor, which integrates the\ndeterministic rules to translate the symbolic operations with a drop-in neural\nreader network to answer each decomposed simple question. Hence, the proposed\nframework can be viewed as a top-down question parsing followed by a bottom-up\nanswer backtracking. The resulting H-expressions closely guide the execution\nprocess, offering higher precision besides better interpretability while still\npreserving the advantages of the neural readers for resolving its primitive\nelements. Our extensive experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiQA, HotpotQA, and NQ show\nthat the proposed parsing and hybrid execution framework outperforms existing\napproaches in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings, while also\neffectively exposing its underlying reasoning process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 22:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

The change in microstructure due to composition and process\nvariations is expected to impact material properties. Identifying\nmicrostructural features such as grain boundaries thus becomes an important\ntask in the process-microstructure-properties loop. Applying convolutional\nneural network (CNN) based deep-learning models is a powerful technique to\ndetect features from material micrographs in an automated manner. Manual\nlabeling of the images for the segmentation task poses a major bottleneck for\ngenerating training data and labels in a reliable and reproducible way within a\nreasonable timeframe. In this study, we attempt to overcome such limitations by\nutilizing multi-modal microscopy to generate labels directly instead of manual\nlabeling. We combine scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of 347H\nstainless steel as training data and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)\nmicrographs as pixel-wise labels for grain boundary detection as a semantic\nsegmentation task. We demonstrate that despite producing instrumentation drift\nduring data collection between two modes of microscopy, this method performs\ncomparably to similar segmentation tasks that used manual labeling.\nAdditionally, we find that na\\\"ive pixel-wise segmentation results in small\ngaps and missing boundaries in the predicted grain boundary map. By\nincorporating topological information during model training, the connectivity\nof the grain boundary network and segmentation performance is improved.\nFinally, our approach is validated by accurate computation on downstream tasks\nof predicting the underlying grain morphology distributions which are the\nultimate quantities of interest for microstructural characterization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 22:49:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Each of these goals can present different challenges when analyzing\nlarge spatial data sets. Current research uses a variety of methods, including\nspatial basis functions (reduced rank), covariance tapering, etc, to achieve\nthese goals. However, spatial indexing, which is very similar to composite\nlikelihood, offers some advantages. We develop a simple framework for all four\ngoals listed above by using indexing to create a block covariance structure and\nnearest-neighbor predictions while maintaining a coherent linear model. We show\nexact inference for fixed effects under this block covariance construction.\nSpatial indexing is very fast, and simulations are used to validate methods and\ncompare to another popular method. We study various sample designs for indexing\nand our simulations showed that indexing leading to spatially compact\npartitions are best over a range of sample sizes, autocorrelation values, and\ngenerating processes.

However, running\nseparate single-task models on edge devices is inefficient regarding the\nrequired computational resource and time. In this context, multi-task learning\nallows leveraging a single deep learning model for performing multiple tasks,\nsuch as semantic segmentation and depth estimation on incoming video frames.\nThis single processing pipeline generates common deep features that are shared\namong multi-task modules. However, in a collaborative intelligence scenario,\ngenerating common deep features has two major issues. First, the deep features\nmay inadvertently contain input information exposed to the downstream modules\n(violating input privacy). Second, the generated universal features expose a\npiece of collective information than what is intended for a certain task, in\nwhich features for one task can be utilized to perform another task (violating\ntask privacy).

To achieve this, we propose a\nchannel squeeze-excitation based feature metamorphosis module, Cross-SEC, to\nachieve distinct attention of all tasks and a de-correlation loss function with\ndifferential-privacy to train a deep learning model that produces distinct\nprivacy-aware features as an output for the respective tasks.

We performed thousands of simulations of\nelectromechanical activation dynamics in ventricular geometries and used the\ndata to train a neural network which subsequently predicts the\nthree-dimensional electrical wave pattern that caused the deformation. We\ndemonstrate that, next to focal wave patterns, even complicated\nthree-dimensional electrical wave patterns can be reconstructed, even if the\nnetwork has never seen the particular arrhythmia. We show that the deep\nlearning model has the ability to generalize by training it on data generated\nwith the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method and subsequently applying\nit to data generated with the finite element method (FEM). Predictions can be\nperformed in the presence of scars and with significant heterogeneity. Our\nresults suggest that, deep neural networks could be used to calculate\nintramural action potential wave patterns from imaging data of the motion of\nthe heart muscle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 02:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

The\ngeometrical visualization shows that the client models surround the global\nmodel within a common basin, and the global model may deviate from the bottom\nof the basin even though it performs better than the client models. To further\nunderstand this phenomenon, we decompose the expected prediction error of the\nglobal model into five factors related to client models.

For a base matrix with a pair of\nfinite and arbitrarily chosen coupling width and coupling length, we propose a\nnovel power allocation policy, termed V-power allocation.

We\ninvestigate the three polar phases of BaTiO3: tetragonal (T) at room\ntemperature, orthorhombic (O) below 280 K and rhombohedral (R) below 190 K,\nacross a total range of 77 K to 420 K. We find two distinct responses; a\nstep-like change in the anisotropy across the low-temperature phase\ntransitions, and a sharp high-temperature reduction around the ferroelectric\nCurie temperature, measured from hard axis hysteresis loops. Using our\nmeasurements of this anisotropy strength we are then able to show by\nmicromagnetic simulation the behaviour of all possible magnetic domain wall\nstates and determine their scaling as a function of temperature. The most\nsignificant changes occur in the head-to-head domain wall states, with a\nmaximum change of 210 nm predicted across the entire range effectively doubling\nthe size of the domain wall as compared to room temperature. Notably, similar\nchanges are seen for both high and low temperatures which suggest different\nroutes for potential control of magnetic anisotropy and elastically pinned\nmagnetic domain walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 09:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Experimental results show that the proposed matching layer can achieve an\naverage sound energy transmission enhancement above 16.7dB from 880Hz to 1760Hz\nacross the water-air interface. Moreover, we use the proposed matching layer to\ndemonstrate a multicolor picture transmission from air to water, which shows\nextremely high communication capacity and accuracy. Our work is promising for\nmore applications based on water-air transmission and opens a new avenue to the\ndesign and implementation of the extreme impedance matching case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 11:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

However, estimating the associated uncertainties in\nthe process is not trivial. Commonly, uncertainty estimation is performed\nwithin the Bayesian framework through sampling algorithms to estimate the\nposterior distribution and identify the associated uncertainty. Nevertheless,\nsuch an approach has to deal with complex posterior structures (e.g.,\nmultimodality), high-dimensional model parameters, and large-scale datasets,\nwhich lead to high computational demands and time-consuming procedures. As a\nresult, uncertainty analysis is rarely performed, especially at the industrial\nscale, and thus, it drives practitioners away from utilizing it for\ndecision-making. This work proposes a frugal approach to estimate uncertainty\nin FWI through the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm by\nutilizing a relatively small number of velocity model particles. We warm-start\nthe SVGD algorithm by perturbing the optimized velocity model obtained from a\ndeterministic FWI procedure with random field-based perturbations. Such\nperturbations cover the scattering (i.e., high wavenumber) and the transmission\n(i.e., low wavenumber) components of FWI and, thus, represent the uncertainty\nof the FWI holistically. We demonstrate the proposed approach on the Marmousi\nmodel; we have learned that by utilizing a relatively small number of\nparticles, the uncertainty map presents qualitatively reliable information that\nhonours the physics of wave propagation at a reasonable cost, allowing for the\npotential for industrial-scale applications.

Therefore, the nucleation and growth of $Al_{2}O_{3}$ and\n$HfO_{2}$ films onto 1L-$MoS_{2}$/Au was investigated, by monitoring the\nsurface coverage as a function of the number (N) of ALD cycles, with N from 10\nto 120. At low N values, a slower growth rate of the initially formed nuclei\nwas observed for $HfO_{2}$, probably due to the bulky nature of the TDMAHf\nprecursor as compared to TMA. On the other hand, the formation of continuous\nfilms was obtained in both cases for N>80 ALD cycles, corresponding to 3.6 nm\n$Al_{2}O_{3}$ and 3.1 nm $HfO_{2}$. Current mapping by C-AFM showed, for the\nsame applied bias, a uniform insulating behavior of $Al_{2}O_{3}$ and the\noccurrence of few localized breakdown spots in the case of $HfO_{2}$,\nassociated to less compact films regions. Finally, an increase of the\n1L-$MoS_{2}$ tensile strain was observed by Raman mapping after encapsulation\nwith both high-k films, accompanied by a reduction in the PL intensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 14:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

In this\npaper, we propose an innovative 360-degree VR streaming architecture that\naddresses three under-exploited issues: overlapping field-of-views (FoVs),\nstatistical QoS provisioning (SQP), and loss-tolerant active data discarding.\nSpecifically, an overlapping FoV-based optimal joint unicast and multicast\n(JUM) task assignment scheme is designed to implement the non-redundant task\nassignments, thereby conserving wireless resources remarkably. Furthermore,\nleveraging stochastic network calculus, we develop a comprehensive SQP\ntheoretical framework that encompasses two SQP schemes from delay and rate\nperspectives. Additionally, a corresponding optimal adaptive joint time-slot\nallocation and active-discarding (ADAPT-JTAAT) transmission scheme is proposed\nto minimize resource consumption while guaranteeing diverse statistical QoS\nrequirements under loss-intolerant and loss-tolerant scenarios from delay and\nrate perspectives, respectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the designed overlapping FoV-based JUM optimal task assignment\nscheme. Comparisons with six baseline schemes validate that the proposed\noptimal ADAPTJTAAT transmission scheme can achieve superior SQP performance in\nresource utilization, flexible rate control, and robust queue behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 14:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

The APNet vocoder is composed of an amplitude spectrum\npredictor (ASP) and a phase spectrum predictor (PSP). The ASP is a residual\nconvolution network which predicts frame-level log amplitude spectra from\nacoustic features. The PSP also adopts a residual convolution network using\nacoustic features as input, then passes the output of this network through two\nparallel linear convolution layers respectively, and finally integrates into a\nphase calculation formula to estimate frame-level phase spectra. Finally, the\noutputs of ASP and PSP are combined to reconstruct speech waveforms by inverse\nshort-time Fourier transform (ISTFT). All operations of the ASP and PSP are\nperformed at the frame level. We train the ASP and PSP jointly and define\nmultilevel loss functions based on amplitude mean square error, phase\nanti-wrapping error, short-time spectral inconsistency error and time domain\nreconstruction error. Experimental results show that our proposed APNet vocoder\nachieves an approximately 8x faster inference speed than HiFi-GAN v1 on a CPU\ndue to the all-frame-level operations, while its synthesized speech quality is\ncomparable to HiFi-GAN v1. The synthesized speech quality of the APNet vocoder\nis also better than that of several equally efficient models. Ablation\nexperiments also confirm that the proposed parallel phase estimation\narchitecture is essential to phase modeling and the proposed loss functions are\nhelpful for improving the synthesized speech quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 15:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Digital\nmediation refers to the process by which digital interactions influence and\nfacilitate human interactions. While digital mediations can bring benefits,\nthey also pose potential health risks. We identify four levels where problems\nmay arise: the medium itself, mediation architects, end users, and mediation\norchestrators. Addressing the challenges associated with shaping digital\nmediation of human interactions for health requires strategies and future\nresearch. Shifting focus towards understanding the impact of digitally mediated\ninteractions on health is crucial for advancing research, policy, and practice\nin this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 09:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

In this work, we focus on the\nGhost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA), an extension of the Gutzwiller\nApproximation (GA) based on the variational principle. We derive a framework\ncalled \"Ghost Density Matrix Embedding Theory\" (gDMET) from quantum embedding\n(QE) principles similar to those in Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET),\nwhich reproduces the gGA equations for multi-orbital Hubbard models with a\nsimpler implementation. This derivation highlights the crucial role of the\nghost degrees of freedom, not only as an extension to the GA, but also as the\nkey element in establishing a consistent conceptual connection between DMET and\nthe gGA. This connection further elucidates how gGA overcomes the systematic\naccuracy limitations of standard GA and achieves results comparable to\nDynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). Furthermore, it offers an alternative\ninterpretation of the gGA equations, fostering new ideas and generalizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 11:10:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 00:28:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}
