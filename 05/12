Inaccurate timing prediction wastes design effort, hurts\ncircuit performance, and may lead to design failure. This work focuses on\ntiming prediction after clock tree synthesis and placement legalization, which\nis the earliest opportunity to time and optimize a \"complete\" netlist. The\npaper first documents that having \"oracle knowledge\" of the final post-DR\nparasitics enables post-global routing (GR) optimization to produce improved\nfinal timing outcomes. To bridge the gap between GR-based parasitic and timing\nestimation and post-DR results during post-GR optimization, machine learning\n(ML)-based models are proposed, including the use of features for macro\nblockages for accurate predictions for designs with macros. Based on a set of\nexperimental evaluations, it is demonstrated that these models show higher\naccuracy than GR-based timing estimation. When used during post-GR\noptimization, the ML-based models show demonstrable improvements in post-DR\ncircuit performance. The methodology is applied to two different tool flows -\nOpenROAD and a commercial tool flow - and results on 45nm bulk and 12nm FinFET\nenablements show improvements in post-DR slack metrics without increasing\ncongestion.

As many document types have a distinct visual style,\nlearning only visual features with deep CNNs to classify document images have\nencountered the problem of low inter-class discrimination, and high intra-class\nstructural variations between its categories. In parallel, text-level\nunderstanding jointly learned with the corresponding visual properties within a\ngiven document image has considerably improved the classification performance\nin terms of accuracy. In this paper, we design a self-attention-based fusion\nmodule that serves as a block in our ensemble trainable network. It allows to\nsimultaneously learn the discriminant features of image and text modalities\nthroughout the training stage. Besides, we encourage mutual learning by\ntransferring the positive knowledge between image and text modalities during\nthe training stage.

In such missions, robots are deployed to locate targets,\nsuch as human survivors, but they might get trapped at hazardous locations,\nsuch as in a trapping pit or by debris. Thus, the information the robot\ncollected is lost owing to the lack of communication. In our prior work, we\ndeveloped the notion of a path-based sensor. A path-based sensor detects\nwhether or not an event has occurred along a particular path, but it does not\nprovide the exact location of the event. Such path-based sensor observations\nare well-suited to communication-denied environments, and various studies have\nexplored methods to improve information gathering in such settings.

However, existing DMVSC methods\nstill have two issues: (1) they mainly focus on using autoencoders to\nnonlinearly embed the data, while the embedding may be suboptimal for\nclustering because the clustering objective is rarely considered in\nautoencoders, and (2) existing methods typically have a quadratic or even cubic\ncomplexity, which makes it challenging to deal with large-scale data. To\naddress these issues, in this paper we propose a novel deep multi-view subspace\nclustering method with anchor graph (DMCAG). To be specific, DMCAG firstly\nlearns the embedded features for each view independently, which are used to\nobtain the subspace representations. To significantly reduce the complexity, we\nconstruct an anchor graph with small size for each view. Then, spectral\nclustering is performed on an integrated anchor graph to obtain pseudo-labels.\nTo overcome the negative impact caused by suboptimal embedded features, we use\npseudo-labels to refine the embedding process to make it more suitable for the\nclustering task. Pseudo-labels and embedded features are updated alternately.\nFurthermore, we design a strategy to keep the consistency of the labels based\non contrastive learning to enhance the clustering performance.

As a result, collective communications\nare often on the critical path, and hiding their latency by overlapping\nkernel-granular communication and computation is difficult due to the absence\nof independent computation.\n  In this work, we propose fusing computation with communication using\nGPU-initiated networking, and leverage GPUs' massive parallelism to enable\nfine-grained overlap of the fused operations. We have developed a single,\nself-contained GPU kernel where workgroups (WGs) immediately communicate their\nresults to remote GPUs when they complete their computation. Meanwhile, other\nWGs within the same kernel perform overlapping computation, maintaining high\nALU utilization. Furthermore, we propose zero-copy optimizations for\npeer-to-peer GPU communication where the data computed by one GPU is directly\nwritten to the destination buffers within the peer GPUs, eliminating\nintermediate stores and extra buffering. Our approach leverages the emerging\nmulti-node GPU system trend where GPUs are physically close to network with\ndirect GPU-NIC interconnects. We demonstrate our approach by creating an\nembedding + All-to-All fused kernel which overlaps embedding operations and the\ndependent all-to-all collective in DLRM models. We evaluate our approach both\nusing simulation and real hardware.

The associated exponent in one dimension is\ndifferent from the mean-field prediction whenever diffusive mixing is not too\nstrong and spatial correlations are relevant.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)\ntechniques have recently achieved promising cross-modality medical image\nsegmentation by transferring knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an\nunlabeled target domain. However, it is also difficult to collect annotations\nfrom the source domain in many clinical applications, rendering most prior\nworks suboptimal with the label-scarce source domain, particularly for few-shot\nscenarios, where only a few source labels are accessible. To achieve efficient\nfew-shot cross-modality segmentation, we propose a novel\ntransformation-consistent meta-hallucination framework, meta-hallucinator, with\nthe goal of learning to diversify data distributions and generate useful\nexamples for enhancing cross-modality performance. In our framework,\nhallucination and segmentation models are jointly trained with the\ngradient-based meta-learning strategy to synthesize examples that lead to good\nsegmentation performance on the target domain. To further facilitate data\nhallucination and cross-domain knowledge transfer, we develop a self-ensembling\nmodel with a hallucination-consistent property. Our meta-hallucinator can\nseamlessly collaborate with the meta-segmenter for learning to hallucinate with\nmutual benefits from a combined view of meta-learning and self-ensembling\nlearning. Extensive studies on MM-WHS 2017 dataset for cross-modality cardiac\nsegmentation demonstrate that our method performs favorably against various\napproaches by a lot in the few-shot UDA scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 17:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

LeaVe leverages this decoupling to make\nverification of contract satisfaction practical. To scale to realistic\nprocessor designs LeaVe further employs inductive reasoning on relational\nabstractions.

In this paper we\nconsider function classes which besides the total functions only contain finite\nfunctions whose domain of definition is an initial segment of the natural\nnumbers. Such functions appear naturally in computation. We show that a rich\ncomputability theory can be developed for these functions classes which\nembraces the central results of classical computability theory, in which all\npartial (computable) functions are considered. To do so the concept of a\nG\\\"odel number is generalised, resulting in a broader class of numberings. The\ncentral algorithmic idea in this approach is to search in enumerated lists. By\nthis way the notion of computation is reduced to that of enumeration. Beside of\nthe development of a computability theory for the functions classes, the new\nnumberings -- called quasi-G\\\"odel numberings -- are studied from a\nnumbering-theoretic perspective: they are complete, and each of the function\nclasses numbered in this way is a retract of the G\\\"odel numbered set of all\npartial computable functions. Moreover, the Rogers semi-lattice of all\ncomputable numberings of the considered function classes is studied and results\nas in the case of the computable numberings of the partial computable functions\nare obtained.

The\nrecent success of large language models (LLMs) for QA aggravates lexical\nmatching failures since candidate answers become longer, thereby making\nmatching with the gold answers even more challenging. Without accurate\nevaluation, the true progress in open-domain QA remains unknown. In this paper,\nwe conduct a thorough analysis of various open-domain QA models, including\nLLMs, by manually evaluating their answers on a subset of NQ-open, a popular\nbenchmark.

We further demonstrate that\nregex matching ranks QA models consistent with human judgments, although still\nsuffering from unnecessary strictness. Finally, we demonstrate that automated\nevaluation models are a reasonable surrogate for lexical matching in some\ncircumstances, but not for long-form answers generated by LLMs. The automated\nmodels struggle in detecting hallucinations in LLM answers and are thus unable\nto evaluate LLMs. At this time, there appears to be no substitute for human\nevaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 17:14:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 May 2023 21:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

In this work we show that three-layer neural networks have provably\nricher feature learning capabilities than two-layer networks.

While these image-language\nmodels can efficiently bootstrap the representation learning of video-language\nmodels, they typically concatenate uniformly sampled video frames as visual\ninputs without explicit language-aware, temporal modeling. When only a portion\nof a video input is relevant to the language query, such uniform frame sampling\ncan often lead to missing important visual cues. Although humans often find a\nvideo moment to focus on and rewind the moment to answer questions, training a\nquery-aware video moment localizer often requires expensive annotations and\nhigh computational costs. To address this issue, we propose Self-Chained Video\nLocalization-Answering (SeViLA), a novel framework that leverages a single\nimage-language model (BLIP-2) to tackle both temporal keyframe localization and\nQA on videos. SeViLA framework consists of two modules: Localizer and Answerer,\nwhere both are parameter-efficiently fine-tuned from BLIP-2. We chain these\nmodules for cascaded inference and self-refinement. First, in the forward\nchain, the Localizer finds multiple language-aware keyframes in a video, which\nthe Answerer uses to predict the answer. Second, in the reverse chain, the\nAnswerer generates keyframe pseudo-labels to refine the Localizer, alleviating\nthe need for expensive video moment localization annotations. SeViLA\noutperforms several strong baselines/previous works on five video QA and event\nprediction tasks, and achieves the state-of-the-art in both fine-tuning\n(NExT-QA, STAR) and zero-shot (NExT-QA, STAR, How2QA, VLEP) settings.

Basically speaking,\nthese models mainly learn the underlying user preference from historical\nbehavior data, and then estimate the user-item matching relationships for\nrecommendations. Inspired by the recent progress on large language models\n(LLMs), we take a different approach to developing the recommendation models,\nconsidering recommendation as instruction following by LLMs. The key idea is\nthat the preferences or needs of a user can be expressed in natural language\ndescriptions (called instructions), so that LLMs can understand and further\nexecute the instruction for fulfilling the recommendation task. Instead of\nusing public APIs of LLMs, we instruction tune an open-source LLM (3B\nFlan-T5-XL), in order to better adapt LLMs to recommender systems. For this\npurpose, we first design a general instruction format for describing the\npreference, intention, task form and context of a user in natural language.\nThen we manually design 39 instruction templates and automatically generate a\nlarge amount of user-personalized instruction data (252K instructions) with\nvarying types of preferences and intentions. To demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach, we instantiate the instruction templates into several\nwidely-studied recommendation (or search) tasks, and conduct extensive\nexperiments on these tasks with real-world datasets. Experiment results show\nthat the proposed approach can outperform several competitive baselines,\nincluding the powerful GPT-3.5, on these evaluation tasks. Our approach sheds\nlight on developing more user-friendly recommender systems, in which users can\nfreely communicate with the system and obtain more accurate recommendations via\nnatural language instructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 17:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

We consider a widely studied third-degree\nprice discrimination model where an information intermediary with perfect\nknowledge of the arriving buyer's value sends a signal to the seller, hence\nchanging the seller's posterior and inducing the seller to set a personalized\nposted price. Prior work of Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris (American Economic\nReview, 2015) has shown the existence of a signaling scheme that preserves\nseller revenue, while always selling the item, hence maximizing consumer\nsurplus. In a departure from prior work, we ask whether the consumer surplus\ngenerated is fairly distributed among buyers with different values. To this\nend, we aim to maximize welfare functions that reward more balanced surplus\nallocations.\n  Our main result is the surprising existence of a novel signaling scheme that\nsimultaneously $8$-approximates all welfare functions that are non-negative,\nmonotonically increasing, symmetric, and concave, compared with any other\nsignaling scheme. Classical examples of such welfare functions include the\nutilitarian social welfare, the Nash welfare, and the max-min welfare. Such a\nguarantee cannot be given by any consumer-surplus-maximizing scheme -- which\nare the ones typically studied in the literature. In addition, our scheme is\nsocially efficient, and has the fairness property that buyers with higher\nvalues enjoy higher expected surplus, which is not always the case for existing\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 17:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

In this work, we study the\nproblem of computing PID in two systems: the Poisson system inspired by the\n'ideal Poisson channel' and the multinomial system inspired by multinomial\nthinning, for a scalar M. We provide sufficient conditions for both systems\nunder which closed-form expressions for many operationally-motivated PID can be\nobtained, thereby allowing us to easily compute PID for these systems. Our\nproof consists of showing that one of the unique information terms is zero,\nwhich allows the remaining unique, redundant, and synergistic terms to be\neasily computed using only the marginal and the joint mutual information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 17:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

The latter can exhibit a roto-translative dynamics,\nwhich is shown here to be at the origin of the structural behavior of MHPs as a\nfunction of temperature, pressure and composition. The application of high\nhydrostatic pressure allows for unraveling the nature of the interaction\nbetween both sublattices, characterized by the simultaneous action of hydrogen\nbonding and steric hindrance. In particular, we find that under the conditions\nof unleashed cation dynamics, the key factor that determines the structural\nstability of MHPs is the repulsive steric interaction rather than hydrogen\nbonding.

We perform spectral stacking to obtain high signal-to-noise\ndetections of rest-frame UV absorption and emission lines, and find that the\nstacks with LyC-leaker candidates show (i) strong nebular OIII]1666,\n[SiIII]1883 and [CIII]1907+CIII]1909 emission, suggesting high ionisation\nparameters due to an elevated production rate of ionising photons coming from\nyoung, metal-poor stars; (ii) high equivalent widths of HeII1640 (~1-3 A),\npossibly indicating a hard ionising spectrum alongside with a high ionising\nphoton production efficiency; (iii) SiII*1533 emission, revealing the presence\nof neutral hydrogen off the line of sight, thus implying a highly anisotropic\ninterstellar medium (ISM); (iv) high CIV1548,1550 to [CIII]1907+CIII]1909\nratios (CIV/CIII] > 0.75), partly associated with the increased ISM\ntransparency. In contrast, the stacks with non-leakers show weaker nebular\nemission lines, low HeII1640 equivalent widths (<1 A), and low CIV/CIII]\n(<0.25), suggesting a low ionisation state of the ISM and a high neutral\nhydrogen content. Consequently, our results substantiate that the CIV/CIII]\nratio can be used as an indirect tracer of $f_{\\rm{esc}}$, providing a\npromising tool for identification of ionising sources among star-forming\ngalaxies in the epoch of reionisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

The main causes for\nmini-quenching are stellar feedback, lack of gas accretion onto galaxies and\ngalaxy-galaxy interactions.

Although measuring\nthe spin polarization of the hadronic top quark is known to be challenging, our\nstudy indicates that it is feasible to reconstruct the spin density matrix of\nthe two-qubit system using an optimal hadronic polarimeter. This is achieved\nwith the aid of jet substructure techniques and NN-inspired reconstruction\nmethods, which improve the mapping between subjets and quarks. We find that\nentanglement can already be observed at more than $5\\sigma$ level with existing\ndata, and violation of Bell inequalities may be probed above 4$\\sigma$ level at\nthe HL-LHC with 3 ab$^{-1}$ of data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 18:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

In this work, we begin addressing this\nquestion from a modern bootstrap perspective. Our main tool is the boundary\noperator expansion (BOE), which holds for any QFT in AdS. Following Kabat and\nLifschytz, we argue that the BOE is strongly constrained by demanding locality\nof correlators involving bulk fields. Focusing on 'AdS form factors' of one\nbulk and two boundary insertions, we reformulate these locality constraints as\na complete set of sum rules on the BOE data. We show that these sum rules lead\nto a manifestly local representation of form factors in terms of 'local\nblocks'. The sum rules are valid non-perturbatively, but are especially\nwell-adapted for perturbative computations in AdS where they allow us to\nbootstrap the BOE data in a systematic fashion.

One of its main difficulties is capturing the most discriminative\ninter-class variances among visually similar classes. Recently, methods with\nVision Transformer (ViT) have demonstrated noticeable achievements in FGVC,\ngenerally by employing the self-attention mechanism with additional\nresource-consuming techniques to distinguish potentially discriminative regions\nwhile disregarding the rest. However, such approaches may struggle to\neffectively focus on truly discriminative regions due to only relying on the\ninherent self-attention mechanism, resulting in the classification token likely\naggregating global information from less-important background patches.\nMoreover, due to the immense lack of the datapoints, classifiers may fail to\nfind the most helpful inter-class distinguishing features, since other\nunrelated but distinctive background regions may be falsely recognised as being\nvaluable. To this end, we introduce a simple yet effective Salient Mask-Guided\nVision Transformer (SM-ViT), where the discriminability of the standard ViT`s\nattention maps is boosted through salient masking of potentially discriminative\nforeground regions.

Automotive radars are the key component\nof the vehicle sensing suit. However, when these radars operate in proximity to\nflat surfaces, such as roads and guardrails, they experience a multipath\nphenomenon that can degrade the accuracy of the direction-of-arrival (DOA)\nestimation. Presence of multipath leads to misspecification in the radar data\nmodel, resulting in estimation performance degradation, which cannot be\nreliably predicted by conventional performance bounds. In this paper, the\nmisspecified Cram\\'er-Rao bound (MCRB), which accounts for model\nmisspecification, is derived for the problem of DOA estimation in the presence\nof multipath which is ignored by the estimator. Analytical relations between\nthe MCRB and the Cram\\'er-Rao bound are established, and the DOA estimation\nperformance degradation due to multipath is investigated. The results show that\nthe MCRB reliably predicts the asymptotic performance of the misspecified\nmaximum-likelihood estimator and therefore, can serve as an efficient tool for\nautomotive radar performance evaluation and system design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 19:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

One of the most extraordinary\ncharacteristics of QSL phases is their ability to support fractionalized,\nlow-energy quasiparticles known as spinons, which carry spin-1/2 but bear no\ncharge. Relaxometry based on color centers in crystalline materials -- of which\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a well-explored example --\nprovides an exciting new platform to probe the spin spectral functions of\nmagnetic materials with both energy and momentum resolution and to search for\nsignatures of these elusive, fractionalized excitations. In this work, we\ntheoretically investigate the color-center relaxometry of two archetypal QSLs:\nthe two-dimensional U(1) QSL with a spinon Fermi surface and the spin-1/2\nantiferromagnetic spin chain. The former is characterized by a metallic,\nspin-split ground state of mobile, interacting spinons, which closely resembles\na spin-polarized Fermi liquid ground state but with neutral quasiparticles. We\nshow that the observation of the Stoner continuum and the collective spin wave\nmode in the spin spectral function would provide a strong evidence for the\nexistence of spinons and fractionalization. In one dimension, mobile spinons\nform a Luttinger liquid ground state. We show that the spin spectral function\nexhibits strong features representing the collective density and spin-wave\nmodes, which are broadened in an algebraic fashion with an exponent\ncharacterized by the Luttinger parameter. The possibilities of measuring these\ncollective modes and detecting the power-law decay of the spectral weight using\nNV relaxometry are discussed.

The bed is operated just at and slightly above and\nbelow the minimum fluidization velocity and additional fluidization is provided\nby two high-speed gas located on the sides of the bed near the flat, front face\nof the unit. Two primary measurements are taken: high-speed video recording of\nthe front of the bed and bed pressure drop from a tap in the back of the bed.\nPIV is used to determine particle motion, characterized as a mean Froude\nnumber, from the high-speed video. A CFD-DEM model of the bed is presented\nusing the recently released MFIX-Exa code.

We propose a deep\nactive sensing framework in which two long short-term memory (LSTM) based\nneural networks are employed to learn the adaptive sensing strategies (i.e.,\nmeasurement vectors) and to produce the final aligned beamformers at both\nsides. In the proposed ping-pong protocol, the Tx and the Rx alternately send\npilots so that both sides can leverage local observations to sequentially\ndesign their respective sensing and data transmission beamformers. The proposed\nstrategy can be extended to scenarios with a reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(RIS) for designing, in addition, the reflection coefficients at the RIS for\nboth sensing and communications. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant\nand interpretable performance improvement. The proposed strategy works well\neven for the challenging multipath channel environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 20:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

Unfortunately, obtaining the annotations\nneeded to train machine learning models to identify and localize surgical tools\nis a difficult task.

Despite the fast-paced progress in robot\nperception, most existing methods either build purely geometric maps (as in\ntraditional SLAM) or flat metric-semantic maps that do not scale to large\nenvironments or large dictionaries of semantic labels. The first part of this\npaper is concerned with representations: we show that scalable representations\nfor spatial perception need to be hierarchical in nature. Hierarchical\nrepresentations are efficient to store, and lead to layered graphs with small\ntreewidth, which enable provably efficient inference. We then introduce an\nexample of hierarchical representation for indoor environments, namely a 3D\nscene graph, and discuss its structure and properties. The second part of the\npaper focuses on algorithms to incrementally construct a 3D scene graph as the\nrobot explores the environment. Our algorithms combine 3D geometry, topology\n(to cluster the places into rooms), and geometric deep learning (e.g., to\nclassify the type of rooms the robot is moving across). The third part of the\npaper focuses on algorithms to maintain and correct 3D scene graphs during\nlong-term operation. We propose hierarchical descriptors for loop closure\ndetection and describe how to correct a scene graph in response to loop\nclosures, by solving a 3D scene graph optimization problem. We conclude the\npaper by combining the proposed perception algorithms into Hydra, a real-time\nspatial perception system that builds a 3D scene graph from visual-inertial\ndata in real-time. We showcase Hydra's performance in photo-realistic\nsimulations and real data collected by a Clearpath Jackal robots and a Unitree\nA1 robot.

This situation\ncalls for learning more discriminative features that could capture even\nfine-grained mismatches between images and reports. To achieve this, this paper\nproposes a novel framework to learn discriminative image and report features by\ndistinguishing them from their closest peers, i.e., hard negatives. Especially,\nto attain more discriminative features, we gradually raise the difficulty of\nsuch a learning task by creating increasingly hard negative reports for each\nimage in the feature space during training, respectively. By treating the\nincreasingly hard negatives as auxiliary variables, we formulate this process\nas a min-max alternating optimisation problem. At each iteration, conditioned\non a given set of hard negative reports, image and report features are learned\nas usual by minimising the loss functions related to report generation. After\nthat, a new set of harder negative reports will be created by maximising a loss\nreflecting image-report alignment. By solving this optimisation, we attain a\nmodel that can generate more specific and accurate reports. It is noteworthy\nthat our framework enhances discriminative feature learning without introducing\nextra network weights. Also, in contrast to the existing way of generating hard\nnegatives, our framework extends beyond the granularity of the dataset by\ngenerating harder samples out of the training set. Experimental study on\nbenchmark datasets verifies the efficacy of our framework and shows that it can\nserve as a plug-in to readily improve existing medical report generation\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 23:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

These wormholes help describe a rich\nformalism to coarse grain pure states in 2d CFTs dual to the black hole\ngeometries because the wormhole amplitudes match with the Renyi entropies of\nCFT states obtained by decohering the pure states in a specific way. This\nformalism can be generalised to coarse grain pure states in several copies of\nthe dual CFT dual to multi-boundary black holes using wormhole solutions with\nhigher genus boundaries using which we illustrate that coarse graining away the\ninterior of multi-boundary black holes sets the mutual information between any\ntwo copies of the dual CFT to zero.

Typical methods use a speaker representation from a\npre-trained speaker verification (SV) model or learn speaker representation\nduring VC training to achieve zero-shot VC. However, existing speaker modeling\nmethods overlook the variation of speaker information richness in temporal and\nfrequency channel dimensions of speech. This insufficient speaker modeling\nhampers the ability of the VC model to accurately represent unseen speakers who\nare not in the training dataset. In this study, we present a robust zero-shot\nVC model with multi-level temporal-channel retrieval, referred to as MTCR-VC.\nSpecifically, to flexibly adapt to the dynamic-variant speaker characteristic\nin the temporal and channel axis of the speech, we propose a novel fine-grained\nspeaker modeling method, called temporal-channel retrieval (TCR), to find out\nwhen and where speaker information appears in speech. It retrieves\nvariable-length speaker representation from both temporal and channel\ndimensions under the guidance of a pre-trained SV model. Besides, inspired by\nthe hierarchical process of human speech production, the MTCR speaker module\nstacks several TCR blocks to extract speaker representations from\nmulti-granularity levels. Furthermore, to achieve better speech disentanglement\nand reconstruction, we introduce a cycle-based training strategy to simulate\nzero-shot inference recurrently. We adopt perpetual constraints on three\naspects, including content, style, and speaker, to drive this process.\nExperiments demonstrate that MTCR-VC is superior to the previous zero-shot VC\nmethods in modeling speaker timbre while maintaining good speech naturalness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 02:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

Multi-tenancy FPGAs, where multiple\nusers can share the same FPGA fabric with certain types of isolation to improve\nresource efficiency, have already been proved feasible.

FB\ncorrelation strengths are examined as a function of psedorapidity gap\n($\\eta_{gap}$), psedorapidity window-width ($\\delta\\eta$), centre-of-mass\nenergy ($\\sqrt{s}$), minimum transverse momentum ($p_{Tmin}$) and different\nmultiplicity classes following standard kinematical cuts used by the ALICE and\nthe ATLAS experiments at the LHC for all three EPOS3 event samples. EPOS3 model\nshows a similar trend of FB multiplicity and momentum correlation strengths for\nboth $pp$ \\& $pPb$ systems, though the correlation strengths are found to be\nlarger for $pPb$ system than $pp$ system. Moreover, $\\delta\\eta$-weighted\naverage of FB correlation strengths as a function of different center-of-mass\nenergies for $pp$ collisions delineates a tendency of saturation at very high\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 03:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

We argue that\ncentral to the success of ESC is the robust interpretation of conveyed\nsemantics at the receiver side, especially for security-critical applications\nsuch as automatic driving and smart healthcare. However, robustifying semantic\ninterpretation is challenging as ESC is extremely vulnerable to physical-layer\nadversarial attacks due to the openness of wireless channels and the\nfragileness of neural models. Toward ESC robustness in practice, we ask the\nfollowing two questions: Q1: For attacks, is it possible to generate\nsemantic-oriented physical-layer adversarial attacks that are imperceptible,\ninput-agnostic and controllable? Q2: Can we develop a defense strategy against\nsuch semantic distortions and previously proposed adversaries? To this end, we\nfirst present MobileSC, a novel semantic communication framework that considers\nthe computation and memory efficiency in wireless environments. Equipped with\nthis framework, we propose SemAdv, a physical-layer adversarial perturbation\ngenerator that aims to craft semantic adversaries over the air with the\nabovementioned criteria, thus answering the Q1. To better characterize the\nrealworld effects for robust training and evaluation, we further introduce a\nnovel adversarial training method SemMixed to harden the ESC against SemAdv\nattacks and existing strong threats, thus answering the Q2. Extensive\nexperiments on three public benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethods against various physical adversarial attacks. We also show some\ninteresting findings, e.g., our MobileSC can even be more robust than classical\nblock-wise communication systems in the low SNR regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 03:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

However, learning such\ncorrespondence faces two key challenges: (1) audio signals inherently exhibit a\nhigh degree of information density, as sounds produced by multiple objects are\nentangled within the same audio stream; (2) the frequency of audio signals from\nobjects with the same category tends to be similar, which hampers the\ndistinction of target object and consequently leads to ambiguous segmentation\nresults. Toward this end, we propose an Audio Unmixing and Semantic\nSegmentation Network (AUSS), which encourages unmixing complicated audio\nsignals and distinguishing similar sounds. Technically, our AUSS unmixs the\naudio signals into a set of audio queries, and interacts them with visual\nfeatures by masked attention mechanisms. To encourage these audio queries to\ncapture distinctive features embedded within the audio, two self-supervised\nlosses are also introduced as additional supervision at both class and mask\nlevels.

However, the extremely high operating frequency\ninevitably leads to significant Doppler shift effects, especially for\nhigh-mobility applications, causing the degradation of sensing performance with\nhigh false alarm rate. To this end, this paper proposes a parameter design\nmethodology of the well-known constant amplitude zero auto correlation (CAZAC)\nsequences, which aims at enhancing their resilience to Doppler shifts.\nSpecifically, we suppress the sidelobes incurred by Doppler shifts for the\npeak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) improvement within the range of interest (RoI) of\nthe radar range profile. The Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence, as a representative\nmember in the CAZAC family, is firstly considered. The impacts of its root\nindex on range sidelobes are investigated based on number theory. For an\narbitrary-length ZC sequence, a feasible range of the root index is derived to\nsatisfy the requirement of PSLR within the scope of RoI. Furthermore, these\ndesign guidelines are extended to a general form of CAZAC sequences, where a\nlow-complexity heuristic algorithm is developed for PSLR improvement.\nSimulation results demonstrate that under severe Doppler shifts, our proposed\nmethodology could enhance the sensing performance by lowering the false alarm\nrate while maintaining the same detection rate, compared with its classical\ncounterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 04:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

However, quantifying\nthe advantages and disadvantages of dynamic ride-sharing, particularly\nhigh-capacity ride-sharing, remains a challenge due to the complex dynamics\nthat depend on several factors, including matching algorithms, vehicle\ncapacity, transportation network topology, and spatiotemporal demand and supply\ndistribution.

Different from the previously reported linear feedback shift\nregister for challenge extension, the proposed scheme feeds the external random\nchallenges into the LFSR module to obfuscate the linear mapping relationship\nbetween the challenge and response. It can prevent attackers from obtaining\nvalid challenge-response pairs (CRPs), increasing its resistance to modeling\nattacks significantly. A 64-stage LFSR-APUF has been implemented on a field\nprogrammable gate array (FPGA) board. The experimental results reveal that the\nproposed design can effectively resist various modeling attacks such as\nlogistic regression (LR), evolutionary strategy (ES), Artificial Neuro Network\n(ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) with a prediction rate of 51.79% and a\nslight effect on the randomness, reliability, and uniqueness. Further, a\nlightweight authentication protocol is established based on the proposed\nLFSR-APUF. The protocol incorporates a low-overhead, ultra-lightweight, novel\nprivate bit conversion Cover function that is uniquely bound to each device in\nthe authentication network. A dynamic and timevariant obfuscation scheme in\ncombination with the proposed LFSR-APUF is implemented in the protocol. The\nproposed authentication protocol not only resists spoofing attacks, physical\nattacks, and modeling attacks effectively, but also ensures the security of the\nentire authentication network by transferring important information in\nencrypted form from the server to the database even when the attacker\ncompletely controls the server.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 05:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

Most existing transformer-based methods leverage both\nvisual and depth representations to explore valuable query points on objects,\nand the quality of the learned query points has a great impact on detection\naccuracy. Unfortunately, existing unsupervised attention mechanisms in\ntransformers are prone to generate low-quality query features due to inaccurate\nreceptive fields, especially on hard objects. To tackle this problem, this\npaper proposes a novel Supervised Scale-aware Deformable Attention (SSDA) for\nmonocular 3D object detection. Specifically, SSDA presets several masks with\ndifferent scales and utilizes depth and visual features to adaptively learn a\nscale-aware filter for object query augmentation. Imposing the scale awareness,\nSSDA could well predict the accurate receptive field of an object query to\nsupport robust query feature generation. Aside from this, SSDA is assigned with\na Weighted Scale Matching (WSM) loss to supervise scale prediction, which\npresents more confident results as compared to the unsupervised attention\nmechanisms. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that SSDA\nsignificantly improves the detection accuracy, especially on moderate and hard\nobjects, yielding state-of-the-art performance as compared to the existing\napproaches.

Such forecasts can be evaluated using proper scoring rules.\nProper scoring rules condense forecast performance into a single numerical\nvalue, allowing competing forecasters to be ranked and compared. To facilitate\nthe use of scoring rules in practical applications, the scoringRules package in\nR provides popular scoring rules for a wide range of forecast distributions.\nThis paper discusses an extension to the scoringRules package that additionally\npermits the implementation of popular weighted scoring rules. Weighted scoring\nrules allow particular outcomes to be targeted during forecast evaluation,\nrecognising that certain outcomes are often of more interest than others when\nassessing forecast quality. This introduces the potential for very flexible,\nuser-oriented evaluation of probabilistic forecasts.

This paper questions the ordinary kriging tool on the well-known\nproblem of the overoptimistic prediction variances due to not taking into\naccount uncertainties on the estimation of the kriging parameters (variance and\nrange). To overcome this issue, the practical use of the Bayesian kriging\nmethod, where the model parameters are considered as random variables, is\ndeepened. The usefulness of Bayesian kriging, whilst comparing its performance\nto that of ordinary kriging, is demonstrated in the small data context (which\nis often the case in decommissioning projects).

However and despite promising research-stage results, major challenges\npreventing the use of such methods in real-life missions still stand in the\nway. In particular, the deployment of such computation-intensive algorithms is\nstill under-investigated, while the performance drop when training on synthetic\nand testing on real images remains to mitigate. The primary goal of this survey\nis to describe the current DL-based methods for spacecraft pose estimation in a\ncomprehensive manner. The secondary goal is to help define the limitations\ntowards the effective deployment of DL-based spacecraft pose estimation\nsolutions for reliable autonomous vision-based applications. To this end, the\nsurvey first summarises the existing algorithms according to two approaches:\nhybrid modular pipelines and direct end-to-end regression methods.

In an honest world, reactions may\nbe informative to users when selecting on what to spend their attention:\nthrough the wisdom of crowds, summed reactions may help identifying relevant\nand high-quality content. This is nullified by coordinated inauthentic liking.\nTo restore wisdom-of-crowds effects, it is therefore desirable to separate the\ninauthentic agents from the wise crowd, and use only the latter as a voting\n*jury* on the relevance of a post. To this end, we design two *jury selection\nprocedures* (JSPs) that discard agents classified as inauthentic. Using machine\nlearning techniques, both cluster on binary vote data -- one using a Gaussian\nMixture Model (GMM JSP), one the k-means algorithm (KM JSP) -- and label agents\nby logistic regression. We evaluate the jury selection procedures with an\nagent-based model, and show that the GMM JSP detects more inauthentic agents,\nbut both JSPs select juries with vastly increased correctness of vote by\nmajority.

However, an experimental\ndemonstration of RSMA's benefits is missing in the literature. In this paper,\nwe address this gap by realizing an RSMA prototype using software-defined\nradios. For the two-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) scenario, we\nmeasure the throughput performance of SDMA and RSMA in nine different scenarios\nthat vary in terms of the channel pathloss and spatial correlation experienced\nby the users. Emulating perfect channel state information (CSI) at the\ntransmitter through unquantized CSI feedback, we observe that RSMA achieves a\nhigher sum throughput (upto 57%) and more fairness than SDMA when the user\nchannels have high spatial correlation. Similarly, emulating imperfect CSI\nthrough quantized feedback, RSMA - along with the above trend - also\nexperiences a smaller sum throughput loss, relative to the unquantized case\n(37%, on average, as opposed to 44% for SDMA). These outcomes are consistent\nwith theoretical predictions, and demonstrate the feasibility and potential of\nRSMA for next generation wireless networks (e.g., 6G).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 10:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

To avoid the post-processing via k-means during the bipartite graph\npartitioning, the constrained Laplacian rank (CLR) is often utilized for\nconstraining the number of connected components (i.e., clusters) in the\nbipartite graph, which, however, neglects the distribution (or normalization)\nof these connected components and may lead to imbalanced or even ill clusters.\nDespite the significant success of normalized cut (Ncut) in general graphs, it\nremains surprisingly an open problem how to enforce a one-step normalized cut\nfor bipartite graphs, especially with linear-time complexity. In this paper, we\nfirst characterize a novel one-step bipartite graph cut (OBCut) criterion with\nnormalized constraints, and theoretically prove its equivalence to a trace\nmaximization problem. Then we extend this cut criterion to a scalable subspace\nclustering approach, where adaptive anchor learning, bipartite graph learning,\nand one-step normalized bipartite graph partitioning are simultaneously modeled\nin a unified objective function, and an alternating optimization algorithm is\nfurther designed to solve it in linear time.

As such,\nunderrepresented varieties including regional dialects, minority-speakers, and\nlow-resource languages, see much higher word error rates (WERs) than those\nvarieties seen as 'prestigious', 'mainstream', or 'standard'. This can act as a\nbarrier to incorporating ASR technology into the annotation process for\nlarge-scale linguistic research since the manual correction of the erroneous\nautomated transcripts can be just as time and resource consuming as manual\ntranscriptions. A deeper understanding of the behaviour of an ASR system is\nthus beneficial from a speech technology standpoint, in terms of improving ASR\naccuracy, and from an annotation standpoint, where knowing the likely errors\nmade by an ASR system can aid in this manual correction. This work demonstrates\na method of probing an ASR system to discover how it handles phonetic variation\nacross a number of L2 Englishes. Specifically, how particular phonetic\nrealisations which were rare or absent in the system's training data can lead\nto phoneme level misrecognitions and contribute to higher WERs. It is\ndemonstrated that the behaviour of the ASR is systematic and consistent across\nspeakers with similar spoken varieties (in this case the same L1) and phoneme\nsubstitution errors are typically in agreement with human annotators. By\nidentifying problematic productions specific weaknesses can be addressed by\nsourcing such realisations for training and fine-tuning thus making the system\nmore robust to pronunciation variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 11:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

However, moving objects such as\ncars and trains usually violate the static scene assumption, leading to feature\ninconsistency deviation and misaligned cost values, which would mislead the\noptimization algorithm. In this work, we present CTA-Depth, a Context-aware\nTemporal Attention guided network for multi-frame monocular Depth estimation.\nSpecifically, we first apply a multi-level attention enhancement module to\nintegrate multi-level image features to obtain an initial depth and pose\nestimation. Then the proposed CTA-Refiner is adopted to alternatively optimize\nthe depth and pose.

Without a\ndriver who can act as a fallback solution in a critical failure scenario, the\nsystem has to be able to mitigate failures on its own and keep critical\napplications operational. To reduce redundancy cost, graceful degradation can\nbe applied by repurposing hardware resources at run-time. Critical applications\ncan be kept operational by starting passive backups and shutting down\nnon-critical applications instead to make sufficient resources available. In\norder to design such systems efficiently, the degradation effects on\nreliability and cost savings have to be analyzed. In this paper we present our\napproach to formally analyze the impact of graceful degradation on the\nreliability of critical and non-critical applications. We then quantify the\neffect of graceful degradation on the reliability of both critical and\nnon-critical applications in distributed automotive systems and compare the\nachieved cost reduction with conventional redundancy approaches.

Despite various proposed solutions, most of them overlook the\nmismatch between the knowledge gained from independent feature extraction\nprocesses and downstream recommendation tasks. Specifically, multimodal feature\nextraction processes do not incorporate prior knowledge relevant to\nrecommendation tasks, while recommendation tasks often directly use these\nmultimodal features as side information. This mismatch can lead to model\nfitting biases and performance degradation, which this paper refers to as the\n\\textit{curse of knowledge} problem. To address this issue, we propose using\nknowledge soft integration to balance the utilization of multimodal features\nand the curse of knowledge problem it brings about. To achieve this, we put\nforward a Knowledge Soft Integration framework for the multimodal\nrecommendation, abbreviated as KSI, which is composed of the Structure\nEfficiently Injection (SEI) module and the Semantic Soft Integration (SSI)\nmodule. In the SEI module, we model the modality correlation between items\nusing Refined Graph Neural Network (RGNN), and introduce a regularization term\nto reduce the redundancy of user/item representations. In the SSI module, we\ndesign a self-supervised retrieval task to further indirectly integrate the\nsemantic knowledge of multimodal features, and enhance the semantic\ndiscrimination of item representations. Extensive experiments on three\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of KSI and validate the\neffectiveness of its two modules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 12:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

There are three potential challenges awaiting\nthe solution to the audio source separation task. First, previous audio source\nseparation systems mainly focus on separating one or a limited number of\nspecific sources. There is a lack of research on building a unified system that\ncan separate arbitrary sources via a single model. Second, most previous\nsystems require clean source data to train a separator, while clean source data\nare scarce. Third, there is a lack of USS system that can automatically detect\nand separate active sound classes in a hierarchical level. To use large-scale\nweakly labeled/unlabeled audio data for audio source separation, we propose a\nuniversal audio source separation framework containing: 1) an audio tagging\nmodel trained on weakly labeled data as a query net; and 2) a conditional\nsource separation model that takes query net outputs as conditions to separate\narbitrary sound sources. We investigate various query nets, source separation\nmodels, and training strategies and propose a hierarchical USS strategy to\nautomatically detect and separate sound classes from the AudioSet ontology. By\nsolely leveraging the weakly labelled AudioSet, our USS system is successful in\nseparating a wide variety of sound classes, including sound event separation,\nmusic source separation, and speech enhancement.

A typical DRL\napplication on AVs is to train a neural network-based driving policy. However,\nthe black-box nature of neural networks can result in unpredictable decision\nfailures, making such AVs unreliable. To this end, this work proposes a method\nto identify and protect unreliable decisions of a DRL driving policy. The basic\nidea is to estimate and constrain the policy's performance uncertainty, which\nquantifies potential performance drop due to insufficient training data or\nnetwork fitting errors. By constraining the uncertainty, the DRL model's\nperformance is always greater than that of a baseline policy. The uncertainty\ncaused by insufficient data is estimated by the bootstrapped method. Then, the\nuncertainty caused by the network fitting error is estimated using an ensemble\nnetwork. Finally, a baseline policy is added as the performance lower bound to\navoid potential decision failures. The overall framework is called\nuncertainty-bound reinforcement learning (UBRL). The proposed UBRL is evaluated\non DRL policies with different amounts of training data, taking an unprotected\nleft-turn driving case as an example. The result shows that the UBRL method can\nidentify potentially unreliable decisions of DRL policy. The UBRL guarantees to\noutperform baseline policy even when the DRL policy is not well-trained and has\nhigh uncertainty. Meanwhile, the performance of UBRL improves with more\ntraining data. Such a method is valuable for the DRL application on real-road\ndriving and provides a metric to evaluate a DRL policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 13:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

Some safety-assurance planners solve this problem by being\nconservative in all possible cases, which may significantly affect driving\nmobility. To this end, this work proposes a method to automatically adjust the\nconservative level according to each case's \"long-tail\" rate, named dynamically\nconservative planner (DCP). We first define the \"long-tail\" rate as an SDV's\nconfidence to pass a driving case. The rate indicates the probability of\nsafe-critical events and is estimated using the statistics bootstrapped method\nwith historical data. Then, a reinforcement learning-based planner is designed\nto contain candidate policies with different conservative levels. The final\npolicy is optimized based on the estimated \"long-tail\" rate. In this way, the\nDCP is designed to automatically adjust to be more conservative in\nlow-confidence \"long-tail\" cases while keeping efficient otherwise. The DCP is\nevaluated in the CARLA simulator using driving cases with \"long-tail\"\ndistributed training data. The results show that the DCP can accurately\nestimate the \"long-tail\" rate to identify potential risks. Based on the rate,\nthe DCP automatically avoids potential collisions in \"long-tail\" cases using\nconservative decisions while not affecting the average velocity in other\ntypical cases. Thus, the DCP is safer and more efficient than the baselines\nwith fixed conservative levels, e.g., an always conservative planner. This work\nprovides a technique to guarantee SDV's performance in unexpected driving cases\nwithout resorting to a global conservative setting, which contributes to\nsolving the \"long-tail\" problem practically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 14:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

The PCA data, where the sampling is not uniform and shows many\nlarge gaps, provide supporting evidence at lower significance. This QPO is\npresent in both the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) and All-Sky Monitor (ASM)\nlight curves, however it is far more secure (32 sigma significance) in the ASM\ndata since much of the PCA data are from target-of-opportunity flare\nobservations and thus have substantial gaps.

The\ngoal is to decide where to place the facilities from a given finite set of\ncandidate locations so as to (a) approximately optimize desired social\nobjectives, and (b) incentivize the agents to truthfully report their private\npositions. We focus on the class of deterministic strategyproof mechanisms and\npinpoint the ones with the best possible approximation ratio in terms of the\nsocial cost (i.e., the total cost of the agents) and the max cost. In\nparticular, for the social cost, we show a tight bound of $1+\\sqrt{2}$ when the\npreferences of the agents are homogeneous (i.e., all agents approve both\nfacilities), and a tight bound of $3$ when the preferences might be\nheterogeneous. For the max cost, we show tight bounds of $2$ and $3$ for\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous preferences, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 14:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

As humans interact with AI in decision-making systems, multiple factors\nmay be present in a task including trust, interpretability, and explainability,\namongst others. In this context, this work proposes a retrospective method to\nsupport a more holistic understanding of how people interact with and connect\nmultiple AI models and combine multiple outputs in human-AI decision-making\nsystems. The method consists of employing a retrospective end-user walkthrough\nwith the objective of providing support to HCI practitioners so that they may\ngain an understanding of the higher order cognitive processes in place and the\nrole that AI model outputs play in human-AI decision-making. The method was\nqualitatively assessed with 29 participants (four participants in a pilot\nphase; 25 participants in the main user study) interacting with a human-AI\ndecision-making system in the context of financial decision-making. The system\ncombines visual analytics, three AI models for revenue prediction, AI-supported\nanalogues analysis, and hypothesis testing using external news and natural\nlanguage processing to provide multiple means for comparing companies. Beyond\nresults on tasks and usability problems, outcomes presented suggest that the\nmethod is promising in highlighting why AI models are ignored, used, or\ntrusted, and how future interactions are planned. We suggest that HCI\npractitioners researching human-AI interaction can benefit by adding this step\nto user studies in a debriefing stage as a retrospective Thinking-Aloud\nprotocol would be applied, but with emphasis on revisiting tasks and\nunderstanding why participants ignored or connected predictions while\nperforming a task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 14:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

The ~100\nnet-count 0.3-7 keV spectrum obtained from $\\sim 30$ ksec Chandra exposure is\nbest fit by a single power-law model with a photon index $\\Gamma=2.0\\pm0.2$ and\nno indication of an intrinsic absorber, implying a 3.6-72 keV rest-frame\nluminosity $L_{\\rm X}=(2.3^{+0.6}_{-0.5})\\times10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We\nidentify a second X-ray source at 30 arcsec, distance from J1429 position, with\na soft ($\\Gamma\\simeq 2.8$) and absorbed (equivalent hydrogen column density\n$N_{\\rm H} <13.4\\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$) spectrum, which likely contaminated\nJ1429 spectra obtained in lower angular resolution observations. Based on the\nanalysis of the Chandra image, the bulk of the X-ray luminosity is produced\nwithin the central $\\sim 3$ kpc region, either by the disk/corona system, or by\na moderately aligned jet. In this context, we discuss the source properties in\ncomparison with samples of low- and high-redshift quasars. We find indication\nof a possible excess of counts over the expectations for a point-like source in\na 0.5 arcsec-1.5 arcsec ($\\sim 3-8$ kpc) annular region. The corresponding\nX-ray luminosity at J1429 redshift is $4\\times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. If\nconfirmed, this emission could be related to either a large-scale X-ray jet, or\na separate X-ray source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 15:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

The use of a non-coplanar treatment trajectory significantly\nenhances the degree of freedom and flexibility but increases drastically the\ncomplexity of the optimization. In inverse planning optimization the dose\ncontribution for all potential beam directions is usually pre-calculates and\npre-loads into the Treatment Planning System (TPS). The size the dose matrix\nbecomes more critical when moving from coplanar IMRT to non-coplanar IMRT since\nthe number of beams increases drastically. A solution would be to calculate\n\"on-the-fly\" the dose contribution to each new candidate beam during\noptimization. This is only possible if a dose calculation engine is fast enough\nto be used online during optimization iterations, which is not the case in\nstandard method. Therefore, in this work we propose an IMRT optimization scheme\nusing deep learning based dose engine to compute the dose matrix on-line. The\nproposed deep learning approach will be combined into a\nsimulated-annealing-based optimization method for non-coplanar IMRT. Since the\ndose engine will compute the dose contribution on-line during the optimization,\nthe final main optimization method requires to keep in memory a very\nlightweight dose matrix.

Accurate and\neffortless diet logging is one of the significant bottlenecks for effective\ndiet management and calorie restriction. Dish detection from food platters is a\nchallenging problem due to a visually complex food layout. We present an\nend-to-end computational framework for diet management, from data compilation,\nannotation, and state-of-the-art model identification to its mobile app\nimplementation. As a case study, we implement the framework in the context of\nIndian food platters known for their complex presentation that poses a\nchallenge for the automated detection of dishes. Starting with the 61 most\npopular Indian dishes, we identify the state-of-the-art model through a\ncomparative analysis of deep-learning-based object detection architectures.\nRooted in a meticulous compilation of 68,005 platter images with 134,814 manual\ndish annotations, we first compare ten architectures for multi-label\nclassification to identify ResNet152 (mAP=84.51%) as the best model. YOLOv8x\n(mAP=87.70%) emerged as the best model architecture for dish detection among\nthe eight deep-learning models implemented after a thorough performance\nevaluation. By comparing with the state-of-the-art model for the IndianFood10\ndataset, we demonstrate the superior object detection performance of YOLOv8x\nfor this subset and establish Resnet152 as the best architecture for\nmulti-label classification. The models thus trained on richly annotated data\ncan be extended to include dishes from across global cuisines. The proposed\nframework is demonstrated through a proof-of-concept mobile application with\ndiverse applications for diet logging, food recommendation systems, nutritional\ninterventions, and mitigation of lifestyle disorders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 15:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

However, it is empirically known that the existence of ``outliers'',\ncombinations of the ordered categorical response and covariates that are\nheterogeneous compared to other pairs, makes the inference with the ordinal\nresponse model unreliable. In this article, we prove that the posterior\ndistribution in the ordinal response model does not satisfy the posterior\nrobustness with any link functions, i.e., the posterior cannot ignore the\ninfluence of large outliers. Furthermore, to achieve robust Bayesian inference\nin the ordinal response model, this article defines general posteriors in the\nordinal response model with two robust divergences (the density-power and\n$\\gamma$-divergences) based on the framework of the general posterior\ninference. We also provide an algorithm for generating posterior samples from\nthe proposed posteriors. The robustness of the proposed methods against\noutliers is clarified from the posterior robustness and the index of robustness\nbased on the Fisher-Rao metric.

This construction is\nsufficient to derive many measure-theoretical counterparts to information\nquantities such as the mutual information $I(X; Y) = \\mu(\\tilde{X} \\cap\n\\tilde{Y})$, the joint entropy $H(X,Y) = \\mu(\\tilde{X} \\cup \\tilde{Y})$, and\nthe conditional entropy $H(X|Y) = \\mu(\\tilde{X}\\, \\setminus \\, \\tilde{Y})$.

By quantifying the decoding complexity as a factor\nin the optimization goal, we are now able to precisely control the RDC\ntrade-off and then demonstrate how the rate-distortion performance of neural\nimage codecs could adapt to various complexity demands. Going beyond the\ninvestigation of RDC optimization, a variable-complexity neural codec is\ndesigned to leverage the spatial dependencies adaptively according to\nindustrial demands, which supports fine-grained complexity adjustment by\nbalancing the RDC tradeoff.

In this paper, we propose MM-Fi, the first\nmulti-modal non-intrusive 4D human dataset with 27 daily or rehabilitation\naction categories, to bridge the gap between wireless sensing and high-level\nhuman perception tasks. MM-Fi consists of over 320k synchronized frames of five\nmodalities from 40 human subjects. Various annotations are provided to support\npotential sensing tasks, e.g., human pose estimation and action recognition.\nExtensive experiments have been conducted to compare the sensing capacity of\neach or several modalities in terms of multiple tasks. We envision that MM-Fi\ncan contribute to wireless sensing research with respect to action recognition,\nhuman pose estimation, multi-modal learning, cross-modal supervision, and\ninterdisciplinary healthcare research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 05:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

In\nrecent years, several machine learning (ML) algorithms for automatic extraction\nof information in ECG have been proposed. Supervised learning methods have\nsuccessfully been used to identify specific aspects in the signal, like\ndetection of rhythm disorders (arrhythmias). Self-supervised learning (SSL)\nmethods, on the other hand, can be used to extract all the features contained\nin the data. The model is optimized without any specific goal and learns from\nthe data itself. By adapting state-of-the-art computer vision methodologies to\nthe signal processing domain, a few SSL approaches have been reported recently\nfor ECG processing. However, such SSL methods require either data augmentation\nor negative pairs, which limits the method to only look for similarities\nbetween two ECG inputs, either two versions of the same signal or two signals\nfrom the same subject. This leads to models that are very effective at\nextracting characteristics that are stable in a subject, such as gender or age.\nBut they are not successful at capturing changes within the ECG recording that\ncan explain dynamic aspects, like different arrhythmias or different sleep\nstages. In this work, we introduce the first SSL method that uses neither data\naugmentation nor negative pairs for understanding ECG signals, and still,\nachieves comparable quality representations. As a result, it is possible to\ndesign a SSL method that not only captures similarities between two inputs, but\nalso captures dissimilarities for a complete understanding of the data. In\naddition, a model based on transformer blocks is presented, which produces\nbetter results than a model based on convolutional layers (XResNet50) with\nalmost the same number of parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 13:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Traditional wireless network architectures have\ndifficulty flexibly obtaining and maintaining global network state information\nand cannot quickly respond to network state changes, thus affecting the\nthroughput, delay, and other QoS requirements of existing multicasting\nsolutions. Therefore, this paper proposes a new multicast routing method based\non multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL-MR) in a software-defined\nwireless networking (SDWN) environment. First, SDWN technology is adopted to\nflexibly configure the network and obtain network state information in the form\nof traffic matrices representing global network links information, such as link\nbandwidth, delay, and packet loss rate. Second, the multicast routing problem\nis divided into multiple subproblems, which are solved through multiagent\ncooperation. To enable each agent to accurately understand the current network\nstate and the status of multicast tree construction, the state space of each\nagent is designed based on the traffic and multicast tree status matrices, and\nthe set of AP nodes in the network is used as the action space. A novel\nsingle-hop action strategy is designed, along with a reward function based on\nthe four states that may occur during tree construction: progress, invalid,\nloop, and termination. Finally, a decentralized training approach is combined\nwith transfer learning to enable each agent to quickly adapt to dynamic network\nchanges and accelerate convergence. Simulation experiments show that MADRL-MR\noutperforms existing algorithms in terms of throughput, delay, packet loss\nrate, etc., and can establish more intelligent multicast routes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 14:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

This article\nintroduces an intelligent routing algorithm (DRL-PPONSA) based on proximal\npolicy optimization deep reinforcement learning with network situational\nawareness under a software-defined wireless networking architecture. First, a\nspecific data plane is designed for network topology construction and data\nforwarding. The control plane collects network traffic information, sends flow\ntables, and uses a GCN-GRU prediction mechanism to perceive future traffic\nchange trends to achieve network situational awareness. Second, a DRL-based\ndata forwarding mechanism is designed in the knowledge plane. The predicted\nnetwork traffic matrix and topology information matrix are treated as the\nenvironment for DRL agents, while next-hop adjacent nodes are treated as\nexecutable actions. Accordingly, action selection strategies are designed for\ndifferent network conditions to achieve more intelligent, flexible, and\nefficient routing control. The reward function is designed using network link\ninformation and various reward and penalty mechanisms. Additionally, importance\nsampling and gradient clipping techniques are employed during gradient updating\nto enhance convergence speed and stability. Experimental results show that\nDRL-PPONSA outperforms traditional routing methods in network throughput,\ndelay, packet loss rate, and wireless node distance. Compared to\nvalue-function-based Dueling DQN routing, the convergence speed is\nsignificantly improved, and the convergence effect is more stable.\nSimultaneously, its consumption of hardware storage space is reduced, and\nefficient routing decisions can be made in real-time using the current network\nstate information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 14:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Given the complexity of the problem, deep\ngenerative learning is a promising approach to overcome the limitations of\ntraditional geostatistical simulation models, in particular their lack of\nphysical realism. This research aims to investigate the application of\ngenerative adversarial networks and deep variational inference for\nconditionally simulating meandering channels in underground volumes. In this\npaper, we review the generative deep learning approaches, in particular the\nadversarial ones and the stabilization techniques that aim to facilitate their\ntraining. The proposed approach is tested on 2D and 3D simulations generated by\nthe stochastic process-based model Flumy. Morphological metrics are utilized to\ncompare our proposed method with earlier iterations of generative adversarial\nnetworks. The results indicate that by utilizing recent stabilization\ntechniques, generative adversarial networks can efficiently sample from target\ndata distributions. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability to simulate\nconditioned simulations through the latent variable model property of the\nproposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 14:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

The often\nlogarithmic nature of information in amplitude and frequency presented to\nbiosystems prevents simple encapsulation of the information contained in the\ninput. Criticality Analysis (CA) is a bio-inspired method of information\nrepresentation within a controlled self-organised critical system that allows\nscale-free representation. This is based on the concept of a reservoir of\ndynamic behaviour in which self-similar data will create dynamic nonlinear\nrepresentations. This unique projection of data preserves the similarity of\ndata within a multidimensional neighbourhood. The input can be reduced\ndimensionally to a projection output that retains the features of the overall\ndata, yet has much simpler dynamic response. The method depends only on the\nrate control of chaos applied to the underlying controlled models, that allows\nthe encoding of arbitrary data, and promises optimal encoding of data given\nbiological relevant networks of oscillators. The CA method allows for a\nbiologically relevant encoding mechanism of arbitrary input to biosystems,\ncreating a suitable model for information processing in varying complexity of\norganisms and scale-free data representation for machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 19:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

Heterogeneous integration, where dissimilar layers of\nmaterials and functionalities are unrestrictedly stacked at an atomic scale, is\nappealing to next-generation electronics, such as multi-functional,\nneuromorphic, spintronic and ultra-low power devices, because it unlocks\ntechnologically useful interfaces of distinct functionalities. Recently, the\ncombination of functional perovskite oxides and the two-dimensional layered\nmaterials (2DLMs) led to unexpected functionalities and enhanced device\nperformance. In this review, we review the recent progress of the heterogeneous\nintegration of perovskite oxides and 2DLMs from the perspectives of fabrication\nand interfacial properties, electronic applications, challenges as well as\noutlooks. In particular, we focus on three types of attractive applications,\nnamely field-effect transistors, memory, and neuromorphic electronics. The van\nder Waals integration approach is extendible to other oxides and 2DLMs, leading\nto almost unlimited combinations of oxides and 2DLMs and contributing to future\nhigh-performance electronic and spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 07:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

We\npresent three training paradigms for this algorithm and demonstrate its ability\nto achieve near-centralized performance.
