This result has two degenerated\ncases of interest: (i) In the single-source case, the Whittle index policy\nreproduces earlier threshold-based sampling policies for the remote estimation\nof Wiener and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. When the instantaneous estimation\nerror of the Gauss-Markov process crosses the optimal threshold, the Whittle\nindex is precisely equal to 0.

Specifically, in our series of experiments, we\ninvestigate different factors that can influence the spread of information in\nLLMs by comparing three degrees of information relevance (direct, indirect, and\nperipheral), four information source styles (Twitter, web blogs, news reports,\nand research papers) and two common knowledge injection paradigms (in-context\ninjection and learning-based injection).

The new method imposes only some\nconditions on the polynomial degree of numerical solutions to derive the\nmaximum principle and energy stability, and thus, differs substantially from\nexisting methods in the literature that often rely on strict conditions on the\ntime stepping size, Lipschitz property of the nonlinear term, or $L^{\\infty}$\nboundedness of numerical solutions.

Such joint phenomena are modeled by phylogenetic networks.\nNakkleh formulated the phylogenetic network reconstruction problem (PNRP) as\nfollows: Given a family of phylogenetic trees over a common set of taxa, is\nthere a unique minimal phylogenetic network whose set of spanning trees\ncontains the family? There are different answers to PNRP, since there are\ndifferent ways to define what a minimal network is (based on different\noptimization criteria). Inspired by ideas from topological data analysis (TDA),\nwe devise lattice-diagram models for the visualization of phylogenetic networks\nand of filtrations, called the cliquegram and the facegram, respectively, both\ngeneralizing the dendrogram model of phylogenetic trees. Both models allow us\nto solve the PNRP in a rigorous way and free of choosing optimization criteria.\nThe solution to the phylogenetic network and filtration reconstruction process\nis obtained by taking the join operation of the dendrograms on the lattice of\ncliquegrams, and of facegrams, respectively. Furthermore, we show that\ncomputing the join-facegram from a given set of dendrograms is polynomial in\nthe size and number of the input trees. We propose two novel invariants of\nfacegrams, (i) the face-Reeb graph and (ii) the mergegram of a facegram. We\nshow the mergegram is 1-Lipschitz stable, while the face-Reeb graph is not. In\nparticular, we show that the mergegram is invariant of weak equivalences of\nfiltrations (a stronger form of homotopy equivalence). This new TDA-signature,\nthe mergegram, can be used as a computable proxy for phylogenetic networks and\nalso, more broadly, for filtrations of datasets, which might be of independent\ninterest to TDA. To illustrate the utility of those new TDA-tools to\nphylogenetics, we provide experiments with artificial and benchmark biological\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 17:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

We find a dramatic\nchange in polarimetric behavior from visible to near-infrared for these\nobjects, including a change in the polarimetric inversion angle that is tied to\nthe index of refraction of the surface material. Our observations support a\ntwo-phase surface composition consisting of high albedo, high index of\nrefraction inclusions with a small optical size scale embedded in a dark matrix\nmaterial more closely related to C-complex asteroids. These results are\nconsistent with the interpretation that the Barbarians are remnants of a\npopulation of primitive bodies that formed shortly after CAIs. Near-infrared\npolarimetry provides a direct test of the constituent grains of asteroid\nsurfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 17:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

This suggests that it is critical to\ninclude the effect of the turbulence, heat conduction, and viscosity caused by\nPUIs to understand the dynamics of magnetic reconnection in the outer\nheliosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 17:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

One such data collection is the EU's Land Use\nCover Area frame Survey (LUCAS), and in particular, the recently published\nLUCAS Cover photos database. The aim of this paper is to select and publish a\nsubset of LUCAS Cover photos for 12 mature major crops across the EU, to\ndeploy, benchmark, and identify the best configuration of Mobile-net for the\nclassification task, to showcase the possibility of using entropy-based metrics\nfor post-processing of results, and finally to show the applications and\nlimitations of the model in a practical and policy relevant context. In\nparticular, the usefulness of automatically identifying crops on geo-tagged\nphotos is illustrated in the context of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.\nThe work has produced a dataset of 169,460 images of mature crops for the 12\nclasses, out of which 15,876 were manually selected as representing a clean\nsample without any foreign objects or unfavorable conditions. The best\nperforming model achieved a Macro F1 (M-F1) of 0.75 on an imbalanced test\ndataset of 8,642 photos. Using metrics from information theory, namely - the\nEquivalence Reference Probability, resulted in achieving an increase of 6%. The\nmost unfavorable conditions for taking such images, across all crop classes,\nwere found to be too early or late in the season. The proposed methodology\nshows the possibility for using minimal auxiliary data, outside the images\nthemselves, in order to achieve a M-F1 of 0.817 for labelling between 12 major\nEuropean crops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 19:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Research from biomechanics provides more detailed modeling for\nparts of the torso, but their models often operate in isolation and are not\nfast and robust enough to support computationally heavy applications and\nlarge-scale data generation for full-body digital humans. This paper proposes a\nnew torso model that aims to achieve high fidelity both in perception and in\nfunctionality, while being computationally feasible for simulation and optimal\ncontrol tasks. We build a detailed human torso model consisting of various\nanatomical components, including facets, ligaments, and intervertebral discs,\nby coupling efficient finite-element and rigid-body simulations. Given an\nexisting motion capture sequence without dense markers placed on the torso, our\nnew model is able to recover the underlying torso bone movements. Our method is\nremarkably robust that it can be used to automatically \"retrofit\" the entire\nMixamo motion database of highly diverse human motions without user\nintervention. We also show that our model is computationally efficient for\nsolving trajectory optimization of highly dynamic full-body movements, without\nrelying on any reference motion.

This\ngraph theoretical modeling allows us to develop two new efficient BD-RIS\narchitectures, denoted as tree-connected and forest-connected RIS.\nTree-connected RIS, whose corresponding graph is a tree, is proven to be the\nleast complex BD-RIS architecture able to achieve the performance upper bound\nin multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. Besides, forest-connected RIS\nallows us to strike a balance between performance and complexity, further\ndecreasing the complexity over tree-connected RIS. To optimize tree-connected\nRIS, we derive a closed-form global optimal solution, while forest-connected\nRIS is optimized through a low-complexity iterative algorithm. Numerical\nresults confirm that tree-connected (resp. forest-connected) RIS achieves the\nsame performance as fully-connected (resp. group-connected) RIS, while reducing\nthe complexity by up to 16.4 times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 19:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

To keep up with growing demands,\nDDR--the dominant processor interface to memory over the past two decades--has\noffered higher bandwidth with every generation. However, because each parallel\nDDR interface requires a large number of on-chip pins, the processor's memory\nbandwidth is ultimately restrained by its pin-count, which is a scarce\nresource. With limited bandwidth, multiple memory requests typically contend\nfor each memory channel, resulting in significant queuing delays that often\novershadow DRAM's service time and degrade performance.\n  We present CoaXiaL, a server design that overcomes memory bandwidth\nlimitations by replacing \\textit{all} DDR interfaces to the processor with the\nmore pin-efficient CXL interface. The widespread adoption and industrial\nmomentum of CXL makes such a transition possible, offering $4\\times$ higher\nbandwidth per pin compared to DDR at a modest latency overhead. We demonstrate\nthat, for a broad range of workloads, CXL's latency premium is more than offset\nby its higher bandwidth. As CoaXiaL distributes memory requests across more\nchannels, it drastically reduces queuing delays and thereby both the average\nvalue and variance of memory access latency. Our evaluation with a variety of\nworkloads shows that CoaXiaL improves the performance of manycore\nthroughput-oriented servers by $1.52\\times$ on average and by up to $3\\times$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 20:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Many\ntests have been developed to characterize the fracture behavior of AC. Accurate\ncrack detection during testing is crucial to describe AC fracture behavior.\nThis paper proposed a framework to detect surface cracks in AC specimens using\ntwo-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC). Two significant drawbacks in\nprevious research in this field were addressed. First, a multi-seed incremental\nreliability-guided DIC was proposed to solve the decorrelation issue due to\nlarge deformation and discontinuities. The method was validated using synthetic\ndeformed images. A correctly implemented analysis could accurately measure\nstrains up to 450\\%, even with significant discontinuities (cracks) present in\nthe deformed image. Second, a robust method was developed to detect cracks\nbased on displacement fields. The proposed method uses critical crack tip\nopening displacement ($\\delta_c$) to define the onset of cleavage fracture. The\nproposed method relies on well-developed fracture mechanics theory. The\nproposed threshold $\\delta_c$ has a physical meaning and can be easily\ndetermined from DIC measurement. The method was validated using an extended\nfinite element model. The framework was implemented to measure the crack\npropagation rate while conducting the Illinois-flexibility index test on two AC\nmixes. The calculated rates could distinguish mixes based on their cracking\npotential. The proposed framework could be applied to characterize AC cracking\nphenomenon, evaluate its fracture properties, assess asphalt mixture testing\nprotocols, and develop theoretical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 21:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

To gain a better understanding of the models' inner\nmechanisms, we analyze the hidden state and channel wave dynamics in a small\nGPT, focusing on the coherence of wave patterns in terms of cross-channel\ncorrelation and individual auto-correlation. Our findings suggest that wave\ndynamics offer consistent and repeatable intrinsic oscillation modes, along\nwith context-aware plasticity and expressiveness in language generation. By\nanalyzing wave patterns, coherence, and clustering, we provide a systematic way\nto identify and interpret the functionality of the hidden state channels,\npaving the way to understand and control higher-level language pattern\nformation. In addition, we investigate the Poisson statistics of spelling\nerrors in text sequence generation across various levels of model training and\nobserve a phase-transition-like process. As coherence builds up, there is a\ncompetition between the generation of correct and misspelled words. However,\nonce the model is adequately trained and significant coherence has emerged, the\ncoherent process becomes strong enough to effectively suppress spelling errors,\npreventing the cascade amplification of defects. The distribution of correct\nspellings transitions from Poissonian to Sub-Poissonian, while the distribution\nof misspellings shows the opposite trend. By leveraging concepts and techniques\nfrom quantum physics, we gain novel insights into the dynamics of the small\nGPT.

The optimal attacking strategy which minimizes\nthe Kullback-Leibler divergence is pursued. It can be shown that this\noptimization problem is nonconvex, and hence it is generally intractable to\nfind the globally optimal solution to such a problem. To overcome this issue,\nwe first propose a relaxation method that can convert the original nonconvex\noptimization problem into a convex optimization problem, and then the analytic\nexpression for the optimal solution to the relaxed convex optimization problem\nis derived. The optimal value of the relaxed convex optimization problem\nprovides a detection performance guarantee for the BIoT in the presence of\nattacks. In addition, we develop a coordinate descent algorithm which is based\non a capped water-filling method to solve the relaxed convex optimization\nproblem, and moreover, we show that the convergence of the proposed coordinate\ndescent algorithm can be guaranteed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 22:17:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

However, we contend that the traditional merge\npolicies are not optimized for reads. In this work, we present Autumn, a\nscalable and read optimized LSM-tree based key-value stores with minimal point\nand range read cost.

We create 1,010 tasks by evaluating 242\nhealthcare outcomes for temporal shift from 2015 to 2020 on a health insurance\nclaims dataset. 9.7% of the tasks show temporal shifts at the population level,\nand 93.0% have some sub-population affected by shifts.

To take into account the large sized cluster information in extreme\nvalue analysis, we incorporate the mixed effects model (MEM) into the\nregression technique in EVT instead of the traditional approach such as\nmultivariate extreme value distribution. The MEM has been recognized not only\nas a model for clustered data, but also as a tool for providing reliable\nestimates of large sized clusters with small sample sizes. In EVT for rare\nevent analysis, the effective sample size for each cluster is often small.\nTherefore, the MEM may also contribute to improving the predictive accuracy of\nextreme value analysis. However, to the best of our knowledge, the MEM has not\nyet been developed in the context of EVT. This motivates us to verify the\neffectiveness of the MEM in EVT through theoretical studies and numerical\nexperiments, including application to real data for risk assessment of heavy\nrainfall in Japan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 00:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Instead, we propose a new directed acyclic graph (DAG)\ndiffusion model to estimate the probability $x_i(t)$ of node $i$'s infection at\ntime $t$ given a source node $s$, where $x_i(\\infty)~=~1$. Specifically, given\nan undirected positive graph modeling node-to-node communication, we first\ncompute its graph embedding: a latent coordinate for each node in an assumed\nlow-dimensional manifold space from extreme eigenvectors via LOBPCG. Next, we\nconstruct a DAG based on Euclidean distances between latent coordinates.\nSpectrally, we prove that the asymmetric DAG Laplacian matrix contains real\nnon-negative eigenvalues, and that the DAG diffusion converges to the\nall-infection vector $\\x(\\infty) = \\1$ as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$.

Analyzing the conformance of such complex\nprocesses challenges traditional conformance-checking approaches because they\nassume a single-case identifier for a process. To create a single-case\nidentifier one has to flatten complex processes. This leads to information loss\nwhen separating the processes that interact on some objects. This paper\nintroduces an alignment approach that operates directly on these object-centric\nprocesses.

The contributions of this paper\ninclude a definition for object-centric alignments, an algorithm to compute\nthem, a publicly available implementation, and a qualitative and quantitative\nevaluation. The qualitative evaluation shows that object-centric alignments can\ngive better insights into object-centric processes because they correctly\nconsider inter-object dependencies. Findings from the quantitative evaluation\nshow that the run-time grows exponentially with the number of objects, the\nlength of the process execution, and the cost of the alignment.

Furthermore, as naive adversarial training may impede the\ngeneralization ability of the ego system, we design an attacker population\ngeneration approach based on evolutionary learning. Finally, the ego system is\npaired with an attacker population and then alternatively trained against the\ncontinuously evolving attackers to improve its robustness, meaning that both\nthe ego system and the attackers are adaptable.

The current paradigm for\ncomparing foundation models involves evaluating them with aggregate metrics on\nvarious benchmark datasets. This method of model comparison is heavily\ndependent on the chosen evaluation metric, which makes it unsuitable for\nsituations where the ideal metric is either not obvious or unavailable. In this\nwork, we present a methodology for directly comparing the embedding space\ngeometry of foundation models, which facilitates model comparison without the\nneed for an explicit evaluation metric. Our methodology is grounded in random\ngraph theory and enables valid hypothesis testing of embedding similarity on a\nper-datum basis. Further, we demonstrate how our methodology can be extended to\nfacilitate population level model comparison. In particular, we show how our\nframework can induce a manifold of models equipped with a distance function\nthat correlates strongly with several downstream metrics. We remark on the\nutility of this population level model comparison as a first step towards a\ntaxonomic science of foundation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 02:01:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 14:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

WNFAs admit\noptimal solutions to classic hard problems on labeled graphs and languages. The\nproblem of deciding whether a given NFA is Wheeler is known to be NP-complete.\nRecently, however, Alanko et al. showed how to side-step this complexity by\nswitching to preorders: letting $Q$ be the set of states, $E$ the set of\ntransitions, $|Q|=n$, and $|E|=m$, they provided a $O(mn^2)$-time algorithm\ncomputing a totally-ordered partition of the WNFA's states such that (1)\nequivalent states recognize the same regular language, and (2) the order of\nnon-equivalent states is consistent with any Wheeler order, when one exists.\nThen, the output is a preorder of the states as useful for pattern matching as\nstandard Wheeler orders. Further research generalized these concepts to\narbitrary NFAs by introducing co-lex partial preorders: any NFA admits a\npartial preorder of its states reflecting the co-lex order of their accepted\nstrings; the smaller the width of such preorder is, the faster regular\nexpression matching queries can be performed. To date, the fastest algorithm\nfor computing the smallest-width partial preorder on NFAs runs in\n$O(m^2+n^{5/2})$ time, while on DFAs the same can be done in $O(\\min(n^2\\log\nn,mn))$ time. In this paper, we provide much more efficient solutions to the\nproblem above.

In this paper, we establish a mathematical\ntheory of real price that determines the optimal global versus local spending\nof an agent which achieves the agent's optimal tradeoff between spending and\nobtained utility. Our theory of real price depends on the asymptotic analysis\nof a Markov chain transition probability matrix related to the network of\nproducers and consumers. We show that the real price of a product or service\ncan be determined from the involved Markov chain matrix, and can be\ndramatically different from the product's label price.

In the other hand, at a\nredshift of 0.151, the TeV spectrum of GRB 221009A undergoes significant\nabsorption by the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL). Therefore, the\nobservation of 18-TeV and 250-TeV photons in this event implies the presence of\nenormous photon fluxes at the source, which cannot be easily generated by the\nSynchrotron Self-Compton mechanism in external shocks.

In this paper, we propose a mountain-shaped\nsingle-stage design base on a simple U-Net architecture, which removes or\nreplaces unnecessary nonlinear activation functions to achieve the above\nbalance with low system complexity.

To tackle the above dilemma, we resort to the\noff-the-shelf and readily accessible saliency maps for directly obtaining\npseudo labels given the image-level class labels.

Our experiments in two domains --\neach populated by many agents -- reveal that the latent IA2C significantly\nimproves sample efficiency by reducing variance and converging faster.\nAdditionally, we introduce open versions of these domains where the agent\npopulation may change over time, and evaluate on these instances as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 04:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

The incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equations with surface tension and phase change are solved in\nconjunction with the energy equations of each phase. The sharp liquid-gas\ninterface is tracked using the geometric Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method and an\nimmersed Dirichlet boundary condition for temperature is imposed at the\ninterface. The simulation approach is validated by simulating water and acetone\ndrops at nearly-zero Weber numbers, and the simulation results are found to\nagree very well with the empirical relation for spherical drops. Parametric\nsimulations were conducted to investigate the aerodynamic breakup of vaporizing\ndrops at low to moderate Weber and Reynolds numbers. The range of Weber numbers\nconsidered has covered the vibrational and bag breakup regimes. Through the\nsimulation results, we have characterized the impact of drop deformation and\nbreakup on the drop vaporization rate. When the drop Weber number increases,\nthe windward surface area increases more rapidly over time. As a result, the\nrate of drop volume reduction also increases. The correlation between the\nvaporization rate and the windward surface area is examined for different Weber\nand Reynolds numbers. Based on the approximate correlation between the drop\nvaporization rate and the windward surface area and the TAB model for drop\ndeformation, a new time-dependent drop vaporization model is proposed. The\npresent model achieves a good agreement with simulation results and shows a\nsignificant improvement over the conventional model for spherical drops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 04:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Existing methods conduct\nmacro-level or simplified micro-level vaccine distribution by assuming the\nhomogeneous behavior within subgroup populations and lacking mobility dynamics\nintegration. Directly applying these models for micro-level vaccine allocation\nleads to sub-optimal solutions due to the lack of behavioral-related details.\nTo address the issue, we first incorporate the mobility heterogeneity in\ndisease dynamics modeling and mimic the disease evolution process using a\nTrans-vaccine-SEIR model. Then we develop a novel deep reinforcement learning\nto seek the optimal vaccine allocation strategy for the high-degree\nspatial-temporal disease evolution system.

In our evaluation, the proposed\nframework reduces 7% - 10% of infections and deaths than the baseline\nstrategies. Extensive evaluation shows that the proposed framework is robust to\nseek the optimal vaccine allocation with diverse mobility patterns in the\nmicro-level disease evolution system.

The model is\nevaluated in idealized terrestrial ecosystems, where disturbances are modeled\nas a reduction in available resources that triggers inter-species competition.\nThe resource-firing game is executed on a finite graph with nodes representing\nspecies in the community and a sink node that becomes active when every species\nis depleted of resources.

The initial on-sky\ntesting of the SPINA system was successfully performed on UT 2022 Jul 10, on\nthe 0.7-meter aperture Nazarbayev University Transient Telescope at the\nAssy-Turgen Astrophysical Observatory (NUTTelA-TAO). We measured stars with a\nwide range of brightness and a dark region of the sky without stars $< 18$ mag.\nWe measured the SPINA system's spatial resolution to be $<232\\mu m$ (full-width\nhalf-maximum, FWHM), limited by the unstable atmosphere. We measured the total\nbackground noise (detector dark counts and sky background) of 1914 counts per\nsecond (cps) within this resolution element. We also performed a crosstalk\nmapping of the detector, obtaining the crosstalk probability of $\\sim0.18$ near\nthe detector's center while reaching $\\sim 50\\%$ at the edges. We derived a\n$5\\sigma$ sensitivity of $17.45$ Gaia-BP magnitude in a 1s exposure with no\natmospheric extinction by comparing the received flux with Gaia-BP band data.\nFor a $10ms$ window and a false alarm rate of once per 100 nights, we derived a\ntransient sensitivity of 14.06 mag. For a $1\\mu s$ or faster time scale, we are\nlimited by crosstalk to a 15 P.E. detection threshold.

However, most\nattention has been focused on identifying features that have a linear or\nmonotonic impact on the response variable. Detecting a sparse set of variables\nthat have a nonlinear or non-monotonic relationship with the response variable\nis still a challenging task. To fill the gap, this paper proposed a robust\nmodel-free screening approach for right-censored survival data by providing a\nnew perspective of quantifying the covariate effect on the restricted mean\nsurvival time, rather than the routinely used hazard function. The proposed\nmeasure, based on the difference between the restricted mean survival time of\ncovariate-stratified and overall data, is able to identify comprehensive types\nof associations including linear, nonlinear, non-monotone, and even local\ndependencies like change points. This approach is highly interpretable and\nflexible without any distribution assumption. The sure screening property is\nestablished and an iterative screening procedure is developed to address\nmulticollinearity between high-dimensional covariates. Simulation studies are\ncarried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in selecting\nimportant features with a complex association with the response variable. The\npotential of applying the proposed method to handle interval-censored failure\ntime data has also been explored in simulations, and the results have been\npromising. The method is applied to a breast cancer dataset to identify\npotential prognostic factors, which reveals potential associations between\nbreast cancer and lymphoma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 06:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

We\nfind that the [OI]$_{\\rm 63\\mu m}$-to-HI and [OI]$_{\\rm 145\\mu m}$-to-HI\nconversion factors universally appears to be anti-correlated with the gas-phase\nmetallicity. The high-redshift GRB measurements further predict a mean ratio of\n$L_{\\rm [OI]-63\\mu m} / L_{\\rm [OI]-145\\mu m}=1.55\\pm 0.12$ and reveal\ngenerally less excited [CII]. The $z \\approx 0$ galaxy sample also shows\nsystematically higher $\\beta_{\\rm [OI]-63\\mu m}$ and $\\beta_{\\rm [OI]-145\\mu\nm}$ conversion factors than the GRB sample, indicating either suppressed [OI]\nemission in local galaxies or more extended, diffuse HI gas reservoirs traced\nby the HI 21-cm. Finally, we apply these empirical calibrations to the few\nhigh-redshift detections of [OI]-$63\\mu$m and [OI]-$145\\mu$m line transitions\nfrom the literature and further discuss the applicability of these conversion\nfactors to probe the HI gas content in the dense, star-forming ISM of galaxies\nat $z\\gtrsim 6$, well into the epoch of reionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 07:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Granular\nflows involve a dynamic rearrangement of particles exhibiting complex\ntransitions from solid-like to fluid-like responses. Traditional continuum and\ndiscrete numerical methods are limited by their computational cost in\nsimulating large-scale systems. Statistical or machine learning-based models\noffer an alternative. Still, they are largely empirical, based on a limited set\nof parameters. Due to their permutation-dependent learning, traditional machine\nlearning-based models require huge training data to generalize. To resolve\nthese problems, we use a graph neural network, a state-of-the-art machine\nlearning architecture that learns local interactions. Graphs represent the\nstate of dynamically changing granular flows and the interaction laws, such as\nenergy and momentum exchange between grains. We develop a graph neural\nnetwork-based simulator (GNS) that takes the current state of granular flow and\npredicts the next state using Euler explicit integration by learning the local\ninteraction laws. We train GNS on different granular trajectories. We then\nassess the performance of GNS by predicting granular column collapse. GNS\naccurately predicts flow dynamics for column collapses with different aspect\nratios unseen during training. GNS is hundreds of times faster than\nhigh-fidelity numerical simulators.

However, the capabilities of\nprevious deep forecasting models to generalize to new roads not seen in the\ntraining data (unseen roads) are rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel setup called a spatio-temporal (ST) split to evaluate the models'\ncapabilities to generalize to unseen roads. In this setup, the models are\ntrained on data from a sample of roads, but tested on roads not seen in the\ntraining data. Moreover, we also present a novel framework called Spatial\nContrastive Pre-Training (SCPT) where we introduce a spatial encoder module to\nextract latent features from unseen roads during inference time. This spatial\nencoder is pre-trained using contrastive learning. During inference, the\nspatial encoder only requires two days of traffic data on the new roads and\ndoes not require any re-training. We also show that the output from the spatial\nencoder can be used effectively to infer latent node embeddings on unseen roads\nduring inference time. The SCPT framework also incorporates a new layer, named\nthe spatially gated addition (SGA) layer, to effectively combine the latent\nfeatures from the output of the spatial encoder to existing backbones.\nAdditionally, since there is limited data on the unseen roads, we argue that it\nis better to decouple traffic signals to trivial-to-capture periodic signals\nand difficult-to-capture Markovian signals, and for the spatial encoder to only\nlearn the Markovian signals. Finally, we empirically evaluated SCPT using the\nST split setup on four real-world datasets. The results showed that adding SCPT\nto a backbone consistently improves forecasting performance on unseen roads.\nMore importantly, the improvements are greater when forecasting further into\nthe future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 07:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

To overcome this problem, numerous methods have been\nproposed, yet either was limited to the linear case or failed to achieve\nidentifiability. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based algorithm that\ncan identify the entire causal structure from subsampled time series, without\nany parametric constraint. Our observation is that the challenge of subsampling\narises mainly from hidden variables at the unobserved time steps. Meanwhile,\nevery hidden variable has an observed proxy, which is essentially itself at\nsome observable time in the future, benefiting from the temporal structure.\nBased on these, we can leverage the proxies to remove the bias induced by the\nhidden variables and hence achieve identifiability.

One of the\nreasons for using microfluidic channels is that their shape can be numerically\noptimized to control pressure drop (also known as rectifiers); thus, by\ncontrolling the pressure drop, it is possible the control the energy dissipated\nby the viscous effect. Upon impact, the fluid is forced to flow through the\nmicrochannel and experiences the typical entry flow until it reaches the fully\ndeveloped flow. It is well-known for Newtonian fluid that the entrance flow is\nresponsible for an important percentage of the pressure drop in the fluid. This\nanalysis has been numerically performed before for shear thickening fluids\nmodelled by a Power-Law model. However, as this constitutive model represents a\ncontinuously growing viscosity between end-viscosity plateau values, it is not\nrepresentative of the characteristic viscosity curve of shear thickening\nfluids, which typically exhibit a three-regions shape\n(thinning-thickening-thinning). This work analyzes for the very first time the\ninfluence of these three regions on the entry flow on a pipe. 2D numerical\nsimulations have been performed for four STFs consisting of four dispersions of\nfumed silica nanoparticles in polypropylene glycol varying concentration\n(7.5-20wt%) modelled by Khandavalli, et al.[1]. The simulations were carried\nout for low generalized Reynolds numbers, corresponding to the shear thickening\nregion of the shear viscosity curve for each formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 09:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Although we can find in the literature how\ntransition-based algorithms excel in dependency parsing in terms of accuracy\nand efficiency, all proposed attempts to tackle SSA following that approach\nwere based on graph-based models. In this article, we present the first\ntransition-based method to address SSA as dependency parsing.

The incremental functional is further spatially discretized\ninto finite particles, i.e., particles characterized by a fixed spatial profile\nof finite width, each carrying a fixed amount of mass. The motion of the\nparticles is then governed by a competition between the cost of transport, that\naims to keep the particles fixed, and entropy maximization, that aims to spread\nthe particles so as to increase the entropy of the system. We show how the\noptimal width of the particles can be determined variationally by minimization\nof the governing incremental functional.

The compression algorithms using tensor decompositions commonly\nminimize the approximation error on the weights. Recent work assumes the\napproximation error on the weights is a proxy for the performance of the model\nto compress multiple layers and fine-tune the compressed model. Surprisingly,\nlittle research has systematically evaluated which approximation errors can be\nused to make choices regarding the layer, tensor decomposition method, and\nlevel of compression. To close this gap, we perform an experimental study to\ntest if this assumption holds across different layers and types of\ndecompositions, and what the effect of fine-tuning is. We include the\napproximation error on the features resulting from a compressed layer in our\nanalysis to test if this provides a better proxy, as it explicitly takes the\ndata into account. We find the approximation error on the weights has a\npositive correlation with the performance error, before as well as after\nfine-tuning. Basing the approximation error on the features does not improve\nthe correlation significantly. While scaling the approximation error commonly\nis used to account for the different sizes of layers, the average correlation\nacross layers is smaller than across all choices (i.e. layers, decompositions,\nand level of compression) before fine-tuning. When calculating the correlation\nacross the different decompositions, the average rank correlation is larger\nthan across all choices. This means multiple decompositions can be considered\nfor compression and the approximation error can be used to choose between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 10:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

A motivation for this work resides in\nfinding cosmological models that undergo a transition from a decelerating epoch\ninto an accelerated one without the need of an exotic fluid with negative\npressure. More specifically, we study two classes of models of the\ngeometry-matter coupling in this theory, namely, in the first case, we consider\nan addition of an $R$-term with a $T$-term, and in the second case, we analyse\na stronger coupling that allows for the appearance of crossed $RT$ terms. Our\nresults indicate that both models feature a significant region of their phase\nspace corresponding to cosmological models with accelerated expansion, and\nseveral trajectories in the phase space can evolve into this region from a\ndecelerated phase. In particular, we verify that the first of these\ngeometry-matter couplings successfully models the cosmological evolution\ntowards a de-Sitter behaviour, without the necessity of recurring to a\ncosmological constant.

In this paper we present a novel method, RAM: Rapid\nAdvection Algorithm on Arbitrary Meshes. RAM is a time-explicit method to solve\nthe advection equation in problems with large bulk velocity on arbitrary\ncomputational grids. In comparison with standard up-wind algorithms, RAM\nenables advection with larger time steps and lower truncation errors. Our\nmethod is based on the operator splitting technique and conservative\ninterpolation. Depending on the bulk velocity and resolution, RAM can decrease\nthe numerical cost of hydrodynamics by more than one order of magnitude. To\nquantify the truncation errors and speed-up with RAM, we perform one and\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamics tests.

The sample spans a range in\n[Fe/H] from -2.5 to -3.6, with 44% having [Fe/H] <-2.9. We derived chemical\nabundances for 17 elements, including strontium and barium. We derive Li\nabundances for the sample, which are in good agreement with the ``Spite\nPlateau'' value. A dozen of stars are carbon-enhanced. The lighter elements\n(Z<30) generally agree well with those of other low-metallicity halo stars.\nThis broadly indicates chemically homogeneous gas at the earliest times. Of the\nneutron-capture elements, we only detected strontium and barium. We used the\n[Sr/Ba] vs. [Ba/Fe] diagram to classify metal-poor stars into five populations\nbased on their observed ratios. We find HE0232-3755 to be a likely main\nr-process star, and HE2214-6127 and HE2332-3039 to be limited-r stars.\nCS30302-145, HE2045-5057, and CD-24 17504 plausibly originated in\nlong-disrupted early dwarf galaxies as evidenced by their [Sr/Ba] and [Ba/Fe]\nratios. We also find that the derived [Sr/H] and [Ba/H] values for CD-24 17504\nare not inconsistent with the predicted yields of the s-process in massive\nrotating low-metallicity stars models. Further theoretical explorations will be\nhelpful to better understand the earliest mechanisms and time scales of heavy\nelement production for comparison with these and other observational abundance\ndata. Finally, we investigate the orbital histories of our sample stars. Most\ndisplay halo-like kinematics although three stars (CS29504-018, HE0223-2814,\nand HE2133-0421) appear to be disk-like in nature. This confirms the\nextragalactic origin for CS30302-145, HE2045-5057, and, in particular, CD-24\n17504 which likely originated from a small accreted stellar system as one of\nthe oldest stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 11:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Appealing\nuncritically to some version of the ``Principle of Mediocrity'' -- namely, the\nsupposed typicality of what transpired on Earth -- is problematic on empirical\nor logical grounds. In this paper, we adopt a Bayesian statistical approach to\nput on rigorous footing the inference of lower bounds for the probability of\nabiogenesis, based on current and future evidence. We demonstrate that the\nsingle datum that life has appeared at least once on Earth merely sets weak\nconstraints on the minimal probability of abiogenesis.

Instead, as delineated before, the choice of prior, which is\nsubject to uncertainty (i.e., admits multiple scenarios), strongly influences\nthe likelihood of life being common. If habitable worlds are uncommon, for an\nagnostic prior, a deterministic scenario for the origin of life might be\nfavoured over one where abiogenesis is a fluke event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 12:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Topological phenomena are intimately connected to the\ndistribution of information content - that, differently from ordinary matter,\nis now governed by non-local degrees of freedom. However, a precise\ncharacterization of how topological effects govern the complexity of a\nmany-body state - i.e., its partition function - is presently unclear. In this\nwork, we show how topology and complexity are directly intertwined concepts in\nthe context of classical statistical mechanics. In concrete, we present a\ntheory that shows how the \\emph{Kolmogorov complexity} of a classical partition\nfunction sampling carries unique, distinctive features depending on the\npresence of topological excitations in the system. We confront two-dimensional\nIsing and XY models on several topologies, and study the corresponding\nsamplings as high-dimensional manifolds in configuration space, quantifying\ntheir complexity via the intrinsic dimension. While for the Ising model the\nintrisic dimension is independent of the real-space topology, for the XY model\nit depends crucially on temperature: across the\nBerezkinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, complexity becomes topology\ndependent. In the BKT phase, it displays a characteristic dependence on the\nhomology of the real-space manifold, and, for $g$-torii, it follows a scaling\nthat is solely genus dependent. We argue that this behavior is intimately\nconnected to the emergence of an order parameter in data space, the conditional\nconnectivity, that displays scaling behavior.

Yet, in\npractice such an analysis suffers from a basic problem: how should we treat\nincomplete lineages that do not survive until the end of the experiment? Here,\nwe develop a model-independent theoretical framework to address this issue. We\nshow how to quantify fitness landscape, survivor bias and selection for\narbitrary cell traits from cell lineage statistics in the presence of death,\nand we test this method using an experimental data set in which a cell\npopulation is exposed to a drug that kills a large fraction of the population.\nThis analysis reveals that failing to properly account for dead lineages can\nlead to misleading fitness estimations. For simple trait dynamics, we prove and\nillustrate numerically that the fitness landscape and the survivor bias can in\naddition be used for the non-parametric estimation of the division and death\nrates, using only lineage histories. Our framework provides universal bounds on\nthe population growth rate, and a fluctuation-response relation which\nquantifies the reduction of population growth rate due to the variability in\ndeath rate. Further, in the context of cell size control, we obtain\ngeneralizations of Powell's relation that link the distributions of generation\ntimes with the population growth rate, and show that the survivor bias can\nsometimes conceal the adder property, namely the constant increment of volume\nbetween birth and division.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 12:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

As a consequence, they are subject to a\nwavevector independent damping, and they develop a finite pinning frequency,\nwhich destroy their acoustic linearly propagating dispersion. Under a few and\nsimple well-motivated assumptions, we compute the phason density of states, and\nwe derive the phason heat capacity as a function of the temperature. Finally,\nimagining a hypothetical s-wave pairing channel with electrons, we compute the\ncritical temperature $T_c$ of the corresponding superconducting state as a\nfunction of phason damping using the Eliashberg formalism. We find that for\nlarge phason damping, the heat capacity is linear in temperature, showing a\ndistinctive glass-like behavior.

Nevertheless, even its existence is\ncontroversial, and its theoretical study is difficult due to both its unbound\ncharacter and large number of interacting valence nucleons.

As the Gamow shell\nmodel includes both continuum coupling and inter-nucleon correlations, useful\ninformation can be obtained about poorly known unbound hydrogen isotopes. Our\npresent calculations indicate that {4,6}H ground states are fairly broad\nresonances, whereas those of {5,7}H are narrow, which is in accordance with\ncurrent experimental data.

The performance of the network trained on exclusively synthetic\nimages was evaluated on an unseen dataset of real images and yielded mean Dice\nscores of 88.5 $\\pm 6.0$ , 92.3 $\\pm 3.9$, 86.3 $\\pm 10.7$ \\% for left\nventricular endocardial, epicardial and left atrial segmentation respectively.\nThis represents an increase of $9.09$, $3.7$ and $15.0$ \\% in Dice scores\ncompared to the previous state-of-the-art.

Traditional iterative 3D\nreconstruction algorithms suffer from strong non-linearity, ill-posedness, and\nhigh computational cost. To tackle these issues, a 3D deep learning scheme,\ncalled 3DInvNet, is proposed to reconstruct 3D permittivity maps from GPR\nC-scans. The proposed scheme leverages a prior 3D convolutional neural network\nwith a feature attention mechanism to suppress the noise in the C-scans due to\nsubsurface heterogeneous soil environments. Then a 3D U-shaped encoder-decoder\nnetwork with multi-scale feature aggregation modules is designed to establish\nthe optimal inverse mapping from the denoised C-scans to 3D permittivity maps.\nFurthermore, a three-step separate learning strategy is employed to pre-train\nand fine-tune the networks.

A by now\nestablished line of work has shown that (stochastic) gradient descent tends to\nhave an implicit bias towards low rank and/or sparse solutions when used to\ntrain deep linear networks, explaining to some extent why overparameterized\nneural network models trained by gradient descent tend to have good\ngeneralization performance in practice. However, existing theory for\nsquare-loss objectives often requires very small initialization of the\ntrainable weights, which is at odds with the larger scale at which weights are\ninitialized in practice for faster convergence and better generalization\nperformance. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by incorporating and\nanalyzing gradient descent with weight normalization, where the weight vector\nis reparamterized in terms of polar coordinates, and gradient descent is\napplied to the polar coordinates. By analyzing key invariants of the gradient\nflow and using Lojasiewicz's Theorem, we show that weight normalization also\nhas an implicit bias towards sparse solutions in the diagonal linear model, but\nthat in contrast to plain gradient descent, weight normalization enables a\nrobust bias that persists even if the weights are initialized at practically\nlarge scale. Experiments suggest that the gains in both convergence speed and\nrobustness of the implicit bias are improved dramatically by using weight\nnormalization in overparameterized diagonal linear network models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 13:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

For assessing the influence on the ecosystem and possible\nsolution strategies, it is necessary to investigate the fate of microplastics\n(MP) in the environment. MPs are typically surrounded by natural organic\nmatter, which can cause them to aggregate. However, the effect of MP shape and\nflow conditions on this heteroaggregation is not well understood. To address\nthis gap, we perform simulations of heteroaggregation of different MP shapes\nwith smaller spherical organic matter. We demonstrate that the shape had a\nstrong impact on the aggregate structure. MPs with mostly smooth surfaces\nformed compact structures with a large number of neighbors with weak connection\nstrength and a higher fractal dimension. MPs with edges and corners aggregated\ninto more fractal structures with fewer neighbors, but with stronger\nconnections. Using MPCD, we investigated aggregates under shear flow. The\ncritical shear rate at which the aggregates break up is much larger for\nspherical and rounded cube MPs, i.e, the compact aggregate structure of spheres\noutweighs their weaker connection strength. Most notably, the rounded cube\nexhibited unexpectedly high resistance against breakup under shear. We\nattribute this to being fairly compact due to weaker, flexible neighbor\nconnections, which are still strong enough to prevent particles to break off\nduring shear flow. Irrespective of the stronger connections between\nneighbouring MPs, the fractal aggregates of cubes break up at lower shear\nrates. We find that cube aggregates reduced their radius of gyration\nsignificantly, indicating restructuring, while most neighbor connections were\nkept intact. Aggregates of spheres, however, kept their overall size while\nundergoing local rearrangements, that broke a significant portion of their\nneighbor interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 13:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

A central result in the area of property\ntesting, the Fischer--Newman theorem, gives an inverse statement: every\ntestable property is in fact estimable. The proof of Fischer and Newman was\nhighly ineffective, since it incurred a tower-type loss when transforming a\ntesting algorithm for $\\mathcal{P}$ into a distance estimator. This raised the\nnatural problem, studied recently by Fiat--Ron and by\nHoppen--Kohayakawa--Lang--Lefmann--Stagni, whether one can find a\ntransformation with a polynomial loss. We obtain the following results.\n  1. If $\\mathcal{P}$ is hereditary, then one can turn a tester for\n$\\mathcal{P}$ into a distance estimator with an exponential loss. This is an\nexponential improvement over the result of Hoppen et. al., who obtained a\ntransformation with a double exponential loss.\n  2. For every $\\mathcal{P}$, one can turn a testing algorithm for\n$\\mathcal{P}$ into a distance estimator with a double exponential loss. This\nimproves over the transformation of Fischer--Newman that incurred a tower-type\nloss. Our main conceptual contribution in this work is that we manage to turn\nthe approach of Fischer--Newman, which was inherently ineffective, into an\nefficient one. On the technical level, our main contribution is in establishing\ncertain properties of Frieze--Kannan Weak Regular partitions that are of\nindependent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 14:37:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Due to\natmospheric turbulence and variations in the operational conditions of the\nantennas these gains fluctuate. Thereby the gains do not only depend on time\nbut also on the spatial direction on the sky. To recover high quality radio\nmaps an accurate reconstruction of the direction and time-dependent individual\nantenna gains is required. Aims: This paper aims to improve the reconstruction\nof radio images, by introducing a novel joint imaging and calibration algorithm\nincluding direction-dependent antenna gains. Methods: Building on the\n\\texttt{resolve} framework, we designed a Bayesian imaging and calibration\nalgorithm utilizing the image domain gridding method for numerically efficient\napplication of direction-dependent antenna gains. Furthermore by approximating\nthe posterior probability distribution with variational inference, our\nalgorithm can provide reliable uncertainty maps.

Here, we investigate the variability of solar Balmer lines\n(H-$\\alpha$, -$\\beta$, -$\\gamma$, -$\\delta$) observed by space-borne\nradiometers (OSIRIS, SCIAMACHY, OMI, and GOME-2), combining these precise,\nlong-term observations with high-resolution data from the ground-based NSO/ISS\nspectrograph. We relate the detected variability to the appearance of magnetic\nfeatures on the solar disk. We find that on solar-rotational timescales (about\n1 month), the Balmer line activity indices (defined as line-core to line-wing\nratios) closely follow variations in the total solar irradiance (which is\npredominantly photospheric), thus frequently (specifically, during passages of\nsunspot groups) deviating from behavior of activity indices that track\nchromospheric activity levels. On longer timescales, the correlation with\nchromospheric indices increases, with periods of low- or even anti-correlation\nfound at intermediate timescales. Comparison of these observations with\nestimates from semi-empirical irradiance reconstructions helps quantify the\ncontributions of different magnetic and quiet features. We conclude that both\nthe lower sensitivity to network and in part the higher sensitivity to\nfilaments and prominences, may result in complex, time-dependent relationships\nbetween Balmer and other chromospheric indices observed for the Sun and\nsolar-like stars. The fact that core and wings contribute in similar manner to\nthe variability, and current knowledge of Balmer-lines formation in stellar\natmospheres, support the notion that Balmer lines core-to-wing ratios indices\nbehave more like photospheric rather than chromospheric indices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 14:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

In comparison to\noptical flow, phase provides more localized motion estimates, which are\nessential for ME spotting, resulting in higher performance.

One specific machine learning application that is of interest\nto us is that of software safety and security, especially in the context of\nparallel programs. The issue of being able to detect concurrency bugs\nautomatically has intrigued programmers for a long time, as the added layer of\ncomplexity makes concurrent programs more prone to failure. The development of\nsuch automatic detection tools provides considerable benefits to programmers in\nterms of saving time while debugging, as well as reducing the number of\nunexpected bugs. We believe machine learning may help achieve this goal by\nproviding additional advantages over current approaches, in terms of both\noverall tool accuracy as well as programming language flexibility. However, due\nto the presence of numerous challenges specific to the machine learning\napproach (correctly labelling a sufficiently large dataset, finding the best\nmodel types/architectures and so forth), we have to approach each issue of\ndeveloping such a tool separately. Therefore, the focus of this project is on\ncomparing both common and recent machine learning approaches. We abstract away\nthe complexity of procuring a labelled dataset of concurrent programs under the\nform of a synthetic dataset that we define and generate with the scope of\nsimulating real-life (concurrent) programs. We formulate hypotheses about\nfundamental limits of various machine learning model types which we then\nvalidate by running extensive tests on our synthetic dataset.

The goal of\nthis paper is to show that the topological information that defines generators\nfor Nakajima's representations can be encoded in the cup product for a Morse\ncomplex defined on the smooth space of representations of a quiver without\nrelations, and then pulling back to the subvariety of representations that do\nsatisfy a given set of relations.

We propose a topological mapping and localization system\nable to operate on real human colonoscopies. The map is a graph where each node\ncodes a colon location by a set of real images of that location. The edges\nrepresent traversability between two nodes.

To improve\nroad safety, Driving Behavior Detection (DBD) systems have been proposed in\nseveral studies to identify safe and unsafe driving behavior. Many of these\nstudies have utilized sensor data obtained from the Controller Area Network\n(CAN) bus to construct their models. However, the use of publicly available\nsensors is known to reduce the accuracy of detection models, while\nincorporating vendor-specific sensors into the dataset increases accuracy. To\naddress the limitations of existing approaches, we present a reliable DBD\nsystem based on Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (GConvLSTM)\nthat enhances the precision and practicality of DBD models using public\nsensors.

Unlike in-memory sorting, these algorithms need to work together\nwith the OS and the filesystem to efficiently utilize system resources and\nminimize disk I/O.\n  In this paper we describe ELSAR: a parallel external sorting algorithm that\nuses an innovative paradigm based on a learned data distribution model. The\nalgorithm leverages the model to arrange the input records into mutually\nexclusive, monotonic, and equi-depth partitions that, once sorted, can simply\nbe concatenated to form the output. This method completely eliminates the need\nfor multi-way file merging, which is typically used in external sorting.\n  We present thorough benchmarks for uniform and skewed datasets in various\nstorage media, where we measure the sorting rates, size scalability, and energy\nefficiency of ELSAR and other sorting algorithms. We observed that ELSAR has up\nto 1.65x higher sorting rates than the next-best external sort (Nsort) on SSD\ndrives and 5.31x higher than the GNU coreutils' sort utility on Intel Optane\nnon-volatile memory.

While these fields are often considered in isolation, they\nrely on complementary notions in their interpretation and implementation. In\nthis work, we detail this interdependence and motivate the necessary role of\ncollaborative governance tools in shaping a positive evolution of AI. We first\ncontrast notions of compliance in the ethical, legal, and technical fields; we\noutline both their differences and where they complement each other, with a\nparticular focus on the roles of ethical charters, licenses, and technical\ndocumentation in these interactions. We then focus on the role of values in\narticulating the synergies between the fields and outline specific mechanisms\nof interaction between them in practice. We identify how these mechanisms have\nplayed out in several open governance fora: an open collaborative workshop, a\nresponsible licensing initiative, and a proposed regulatory framework. By\nleveraging complementary notions of compliance in these three domains, we can\ncreate a more comprehensive framework for governing AI systems that jointly\ntakes into account their technical capabilities, their impact on society, and\nhow technical specifications can inform relevant regulations. Our analysis thus\nunderlines the necessity of joint consideration of the ethical, legal, and\ntechnical in AI ethics frameworks to be used on a larger scale to govern AI\nsystems and how the thinking in each of these areas can inform the others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 15:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}
