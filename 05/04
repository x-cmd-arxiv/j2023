To alleviate the problem, it might be possible to\ngenerate long-document QA pairs via unsupervised question answering (UQA)\nmethods. However, existing UQA tasks are based on short documents, and can\nhardly incorporate long-range information. To tackle the problem, we propose a\nnew task, named unsupervised long-document question answering (ULQA), aiming to\ngenerate high-quality long-document QA instances in an unsupervised manner.\nBesides, we propose AttenWalker, a novel unsupervised method to aggregate and\ngenerate answers with long-range dependency so as to construct long-document QA\npairs. Specifically, AttenWalker is composed of three modules, i.e., span\ncollector, span linker and answer aggregator. Firstly, the span collector takes\nadvantage of constituent parsing and reconstruction loss to select informative\ncandidate spans for constructing answers. Secondly, by going through the\nattention graph of a pre-trained long-document model, potentially interrelated\ntext spans (that might be far apart) could be linked together via an\nattention-walking algorithm. Thirdly, in the answer aggregator, linked spans\nare aggregated into the final answer via the mask-filling ability of a\npre-trained model. Extensive experiments show that AttenWalker outperforms\nprevious methods on Qasper and NarrativeQA. In addition, AttenWalker also shows\nstrong performance in the few-shot learning setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 16:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

This has recently been measured to be\nnon-zero at a statistical significance of $3.6\\sigma$ in the official Planck\nPR4 and 9-year WMAP data. In this work, we constrain $\\beta$ using the\nreprocessed BeyondPlanck LFI and Cosmoglobe DR1 WMAP polarization maps. These\nnovel maps have both lower systematic residuals and a more complete error\ndescription than the corresponding official products. Foreground $EB$\ncorrelations could bias measurements of $\\beta$, and while thermal dust $EB$\nemission has been argued to be statistically non-zero, no evidence for\nsynchrotron $EB$ power has been reported. Unlike the dust-dominated Planck HFI\nmaps, the majority of the LFI and WMAP polarization maps are instead dominated\nby synchrotron emission. Simultaneously constraining $\\beta$ and the\npolarization miscalibration angle, $\\alpha$, of each channel, we find a\nbest-fit value of $\\beta=0.35^{\\circ}\\pm0.70^{\\circ}$ with LFI and WMAP data\nonly.

This differs from zero with a\nstatistical significance of $1.9\\sigma$, and the main contribution to this\nvalue comes from the LFI 70 GHz channel. While the statistical significances of\nthese results are low on their own, the measurement derived from the LFI and\nWMAP synchrotron-dominated maps agrees with the previously reported\nHFI-dominated constraints, despite the very different astrophysical and\ninstrumental systematics involved in all these experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 16:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

These three factors are: observing\nefficiency during a visit, the amount of the transit captured by the telescope\nduring a visit, and how much of the transit captured is contaminated by a\ncoincidental passing of the observatory through the South Atlantic Anomaly. The\nimportance of each of these factors can be adjusted based on the needs or\npreferences of the science team. Utilizing this schedule optimizer, we develop\nand compare a few schedules with differing factor weights for the Pandora\nSmallSat mission, illustrating trade-offs that should be considered between the\nthree quality factors. We also find that under all scenarios probed, Pandora\nwill not only be able to achieve its observational requirements using the\nplanets on the notional target list but will do so with significant time\nremaining for ancillary science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 17:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Recently, BERT-based pre-trained\nmodels have been popularly explored for automatic relation classification.\nDespite significant progress, most of them were evaluated in different\nscenarios, which limits their comparability. Furthermore, existing methods are\nprimarily evaluated on clean texts, which ignores the digitization context of\nearly scholarly publications in terms of machine scanning and optical character\nrecognition (OCR). In such cases, the texts may contain OCR noise, in turn\ncreating uncertainty about existing classifiers' performances. To address these\nlimitations, we started by creating OCR-noisy texts based on three clean\ncorpora. Given these parallel corpora, we conducted a thorough empirical\nevaluation of eight Bert-based classification models by focusing on three\nfactors: (1) Bert variants; (2) classification strategies; and, (3) OCR noise\nimpacts.

The strategy of\npredicting a single relation each time outperforms the one simultaneously\nidentifying multiple relations in general.

To shed light\non the nature of these sources we started a multiwavelength programme based on\na sample of 18 HYPerluminous quasars at the Epoch of ReionizatION (HYPERION).\nThese are the luminous QSOs whose SMBH must have had the most rapid mass growth\nduring the Universe first Gyr. In this paper we present the HYPERION sample and\nreport on the first of the 3 years planned observations of the 2.4 Ms\nXMM-Newton Multi-Year Heritage programme on which HYPERION is based. The goal\nof this programme is to accurately characterise the X-ray nuclear properties of\nQSOs at the EoR. Through a joint X-ray spectral analysis of 10 sources,\ncovering the rest-frame $\\sim2-50$ keV range, we report a steep average photon\nindex ($\\Gamma\\sim2.4\\pm0.1$) which is inconsistent at $\\geq4\\sigma$ level with\nthe value measured in QSO at z<6. This spectral slope is also significantly\nsteeper than that reported in lower-z QSOs with similar luminosity or accretion\nrate, thus suggesting a genuine redshift evolution. Alternatively, we can\ninterpret this result as the presence of an unusually low-energy cutoff\n$E_{cut}\\sim20$ keV on a standard $\\Gamma=1.9$ power-law. We also report on\nmild indications that HYPERION QSOs show higher soft X-ray emission at 2 keV\ncompared to the UV one at 2500A than expected by lower-z luminous AGN. We\nspeculate that a redshift-dependent coupling between the X-ray corona and\naccretion disc or intrinsically different coronal properties may account for\nthe steep spectral slopes, especially in the presence of powerful winds. The\nreported slopes, if confirmed at lower luminosities, may have an important\nimpact on the design of future X-ray facilities and surveys aimed at the early\nUniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

We use this task to first investigate whether\nFlan-T5, GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 can track the state of entities, and find that only\nGPT-3.5 models, which have been pretrained on large amounts of code, exhibit\nthis ability. We then investigate whether smaller models pretrained primarily\non text can learn to track entities, through finetuning T5 on several\ntraining/evaluation splits. While performance degrades for more complex splits,\nwe find that even for splits with almost no lexical overlap between training\nand evaluation, a finetuned model can often perform non-trivial entity\ntracking. Taken together, these results suggest that language models can learn\nto track entities but pretraining on large text corpora alone does not make\nthis capacity surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 18:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

Hence, the exploration of the symptoms in relation to\nfunctional connectivity (FC) had great relevance in the field. FC can be\ninvestigated on different levels, going from global features to single edges\nbetween regions, revealing diffuse and localized dysconnection patterns. In\nthis context, SZ is characterized by a diverse global integration with reduced\nconnectivity in specific areas of the Default Mode Network (DMN). However, the\nassessment of FC presents various sources of uncertainty. This study proposes a\nmulti-level approach for more robust group-comparison. FC between 74 AAL brain\nareas of 15 healthy controls (HC) and 12 SZ subjects were used. Multi-level\nanalyses and graph topological indexes evaluation were carried out by the\npreviously published SPIDER-NET tool. Robustness was augmented by bootstrapped\n(BOOT) data and the stability was evaluated by removing one (RST1) or two\nsubjects (RST2). The DMN subgraph was evaluated, toegether with overall local\nindexes and connection weights to enhance common activations/deactivations. At\na global level, expected trends were found. The robustness assessment tests\nhighlighted more stable results for BOOT compared to the direct data testing.\nConversely, significant results were found in the analysis at lower levels.

One major concern is the involvement of\nthird party tools and hardware. Usage of untrusted hardware could present the\nrisk of intellectual property (IP) theft. For example the hybrid quantum\nclassical algorithms like QAOA encodes the graph properties e.g. number of\nnodes edges and connectivity in the parameterized quantum circuit to solve a\ngraph maxcut problem. QAOA employs a classical computer which optimizes the\nparameters of a parametric quantum circuit (which encodes graph structure)\niteratively by executing the circuit on a quantum hardware and measuring the\noutput. The graph properties can be readily retrieved by analyzing the QAOA\ncircuit by the untrusted quantum hardware provider. To mitigate this risk, we\npropose an edge pruning obfuscation method for QAOA along with a split\niteration methodology. The basic idea is to (i) create two flavors of QAOA\ncircuit each with few distinct edges eliminated from the problem graph for\nobfuscation (ii) iterate the circuits alternately during optimization process\nto uphold the optimization quality and (iii) send the circuits to two different\nuntrusted hardware provider so that the adversary has access to partial graph\nprotecting the IP.

Methods exist for calculating these spectra in\nradiation-hydrodynamic (\"hydro\") and Particle-in-Cell (\"PiC\") simulations. The\nspectra are particularly sensitive to the high energy tail of ion velocity\ndistribution functions since reaction cross sections increase rapidly with the\nkinetic energy of a reacting ion pair at the energies achieved in laboratory\nexperiments. This means both the hydro and PiC method may not be suitable in\ncertain plasma regimes. The hydro method assumes that the ion velocity\ndistribution is locally Maxwellian, while the PiC method is subject to\nstatistical noise that makes it challenging to accurately simulate finer\ndetails of the spectra. In this work, we present a complementary approach: a\nmethod for calculating the neutron spectra in ion Vlasov-Fokker-Planck\nsimulations in which the velocity distribution function is fully-resolved. The\nmethod is implemented in the spherically-symmetric code iFP which is used to\nsimulate laser-driven Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments.

Therefore, we focused on building a robust supervised\nmachine learning model to predict surface stellar rotation periods from\nstructured data sets built from the Kepler catalogue of K and M stars. We\nanalysed the set of independent variables extracted from Kepler light curves\nand investigated the relationships between them and the ground truth. Using the\nextreme gradient boosting method, we obtained a minimal set of variables that\ncan be used to build machine learning models for predicting stellar rotation\nperiods.

Previous interferometric\nmeasurements and modeling have ruled out the cavity being formed by dust\nsublimation and suggested that the cavity is due to a massive circumbinary\nplanet that traps the dust in the disk and produces the observed depletion of\nrefractory elements on the surface of the post-AGB star.

At temperatures below\napproximately half of the superconducting critical temperature, the development\nof magnetic flux avalanches manifests itself as jumps in the resonance\nfrequency of the coplanar resonators. A clear change in the rate of decreasing\nresonance frequency with magnetic field is observed when a magnetic perforation\nevent regime sets the transition between a Meissner-like phase in the ground\nplane and flux injection into the central feedline. These regimes are directly\nvisualized by magneto-optical imaging and the impact of avalanches in the\nground plane and the resonator is discerned.

This is an essential factor that leads to the instability of prompt\ntuning. Based on this observation, we introduce perturbation-based\nregularizers, which can smooth the loss landscape, into prompt tuning. We\npropose a new algorithm, called Prompt Tuning with Perturbation-based\nregularizer~(PTP), which can not only alleviate training instability\ndramatically but also boost the performance of prompt tuning.

However,\nthis method is constrained by the quality of the fixed corpus from which memory\nis retrieved. In this paper, by exploring the duality of the primal problem:\nbetter generation also prompts better memory, we propose a novel framework,\nselfmem, which addresses this limitation by iteratively employing a\nretrieval-augmented generator to create an unbounded memory pool and using a\nmemory selector to choose one output as memory for the subsequent generation\nround. This enables the model to leverage its own output, referred to as\nself-memory, for improved generation.

However, these models are extremely computationally\nexpensive, even at inference time, raising the natural question: when is the\nextra cost of deploying a larger model worth the anticipated boost in\ncapabilities? Better understanding this tradeoff fundamentally could benefit\nfrom an inference efficiency metric that is both (i) easily comparable across\nmodels from different providers, and (ii) representative of the true cost of\nrunning queries in an isolated performance environment. Unfortunately, access\nto LLMs today is largely restricted to black-box text generation APIs and raw\nruntimes measured through this interface do not satisfy these desiderata: model\nproviders can apply various software and hardware optimizations orthogonal to\nthe model, and models served on shared infrastructure are susceptible to\nperformance contention. To circumvent these problems, we propose a new metric\nfor comparing inference efficiency across models. This metric puts models on\nequal footing as though they were served (i) on uniform hardware and software,\nand (ii) without performance contention. We call this metric the\n\\emph{idealized runtime}, and we propose a methodology to efficiently estimate\nthis metric for autoregressive Transformer models.

To address this challenge, this work\nfocuses on clients who always maximize their individual cumulative rewards, and\nintroduces a novel idea of \"reward teaching\", where the server guides the\nclients towards global optimality through implicit local reward adjustments.\nUnder this framework, the server faces two tightly coupled tasks of bandit\nlearning and target teaching, whose combination is non-trivial and challenging.\nA phased approach, called Teaching-After-Learning (TAL), is first designed to\nencourage and discourage clients' explorations separately. General performance\nanalyses of TAL are established when the clients' strategies satisfy certain\nmild requirements. With novel technical approaches developed to analyze the\nwarm-start behaviors of bandit algorithms, particularized guarantees of TAL\nwith clients running UCB or epsilon-greedy strategies are then obtained. These\nresults demonstrate that TAL achieves logarithmic regrets while only incurring\nlogarithmic adjustment costs, which is order-optimal w.r.t. a natural lower\nbound. As a further extension, the Teaching-While-Learning (TWL) algorithm is\ndeveloped with the idea of successive arm elimination to break the non-adaptive\nphase separation in TAL. Rigorous analyses demonstrate that when facing clients\nwith UCB1, TWL outperforms TAL in terms of the dependencies on sub-optimality\ngaps thanks to its adaptive design.

We assess how the mode, skew, and scatter of the JAGB star\nluminosity function change throughout diverse stellar environments in M31's NE\ndisk from 13<d<18 kpc using data from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda\nTreasury (PHAT). As expected, the mode is found to be fainter in\nhigher-reddening regions. To cross-check this result, we also measure a\nfiducial J-band ground-based JAGB distance using data from the UKIRT/WFCam in\nM31's outermost disk (18<d<40 kpc) where internal reddening is minimal. We find\nthat this J-band distance modulus agrees well with the F110W distance moduli\nmeasured in the lowest reddening regions of the PHAT data, demonstrating the\nJAGB method is most accurate if measured in the low-reddening outer disks of\ngalaxies. On the other hand, the mode of the JAGB star luminosity function\nappears empirically to show no dependence on metallicity and age, disputing\ntheoretical predictions that the average luminosity of metal-rich carbon stars\nis brighter than for metal-poor carbon stars. In conclusion, the JAGB method\nproves to be a robust standard candle capable of calibrating the luminosities\nof type Ia supernovae and therefore providing a high-accuracy, high-precision\nmeasurement of the Hubble constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 22:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

Detecting maritime threats by means of\nfusing data purely related to physical movement (i.e., those generated by\nphysical sensors, or hard data) is not sufficient. This has led to research and\ndevelopment efforts aimed at combining hard data with other types of data\n(especially human-generated or soft data). Existing work often assumes that\ninput soft data is available in a structured format, or is focused on\nextracting certain relevant entities or concepts to accompany or annotate hard\ndata. Much less attention has been given to extracting the rich knowledge about\nthe situations of interest implicitly embedded in the large amount of soft data\nexisting in unstructured formats (such as intelligence reports and news\narticles). In order to exploit the potentially useful and rich information from\nsuch sources, it is necessary to extract not only the relevant entities and\nconcepts but also their semantic relations, together with the uncertainty\nassociated with the extracted knowledge (i.e., in the form of probabilistic\nknowledge graphs). This will increase the accuracy of and confidence in, the\nextracted knowledge and facilitate subsequent reasoning and learning. To this\nend, we propose Maritime DeepDive, an initial prototype for the automated\nconstruction of probabilistic knowledge graphs from natural language data for\nthe maritime domain. In this paper, we report on the current implementation of\nMaritime DeepDive, together with preliminary results on extracting\nprobabilistic events from maritime piracy incidents.

Clinical parameters measured from gated single-photon emission\ncomputed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT MPI) have value in\npredicting cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) patient outcomes, but still\nshow limitations. The purpose of this study is to combine clinical variables,\nfeatures from electrocardiogram (ECG), and parameters from assessment of\ncardiac function with polarmaps from gated SPECT MPI through deep learning (DL)\nto predict CRT response. Methods. 218 patients who underwent rest gated SPECT\nMPI were enrolled in this study. CRT response was defined as an increase in\nleft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 5% at a 6-month follow up. A DL\nmodel was constructed by combining a pre-trained VGG16 module and a multilayer\nperceptron. Two modalities of data were input to the model: polarmap images\nfrom SPECT MPI and tabular data from clinical features and ECG parameters.\nGradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to the VGG16\nmodule to provide explainability for the polarmaps. For comparison, four\nmachine learning (ML) models were trained using only the tabular features.\nResults. Modeling was performed on 218 patients who underwent CRT implantation\nwith a response rate of 55.5% (n = 121).

The\nDL model outperformed the ML models, showcasing the additional predictive\nbenefit of utilizing SPECT MPI polarmaps. Incorporating additional patient data\ndirectly in the form of medical imagery can improve CRT response prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 00:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

In this work, we aim to re-investigate the training\nprocess of residual networks from a novel social psychology perspective of\nloafing, and further propose a new training scheme as well as three improved\nstrategies for boosting residual networks beyond their performance limits.\nPrevious research has suggested that residual networks can be considered as\nensembles of shallow networks, which implies that the final performance of a\nresidual network is influenced by a group of subnetworks. We identify a\npreviously overlooked problem that is analogous to social loafing, where\nsubnetworks within a residual network are prone to exert less effort when\nworking as part of a group compared to working alone. We define this problem as\n\\textit{network loafing}. Similar to the decreased individual productivity and\noverall performance as demonstrated in society, network loafing inevitably\ncauses sub-par performance. Inspired by solutions from social psychology, we\nfirst propose a novel training scheme called stimulative training, which\nrandomly samples a residual subnetwork and calculates the KL divergence loss\nbetween the sampled subnetwork and the given residual network for extra\nsupervision. In order to unleash the potential of stimulative training, we\nfurther propose three simple-yet-effective strategies, including a novel KL-\nloss that only aligns the network logits direction, random smaller inputs for\nsubnetworks, and inter-stage sampling rules. Comprehensive experiments and\nanalysis verify the effectiveness of stimulative training as well as its three\nimproved strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 02:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

However, in existing methods,\nsuperpoints are generated with the offline clustering methods, which cannot\ncharacterize local regions with similar motions for complex 3D scenes well,\nleading to inaccurate scene flow estimation. To this end, we propose an\niterative end-to-end superpoint based scene flow estimation framework, where\nthe superpoints can be dynamically updated to guide the point-level flow\nprediction. Specifically, our framework consists of a flow guided superpoint\ngeneration module and a superpoint guided flow refinement module.

With the generated\nsuperpoints, we first reconstruct the flow for each point by adaptively\naggregating the superpoint-level flow, and then encode the consistency between\nthe reconstructed flow of pairwise point clouds.

Most previous methods fail to\ngive a complete treatment of these characteristics, and thus are prone to\nerrors. In this paper, we present a simple new criterion for scanpath\nprediction based on principles from lossy data compression. This criterion\nsuggests minimizing the expected code length of quantized scanpaths in a\ntraining set, which corresponds to fitting a discrete conditional probability\nmodel via maximum likelihood. Specifically, the probability model is\nconditioned on two modalities: a viewport sequence as the deformation-reduced\nvisual input and a set of relative historical scanpaths projected onto\nrespective viewports as the aligned path input. The probability model is\nparameterized by a product of discretized Gaussian mixture models to capture\nthe uncertainty and the diversity of scanpaths from different users. Most\nimportantly, the training of the probability model does not rely on the\nspecification of \"ground-truth\" scanpaths for imitation learning.

On the theoretical side, our\ncontribution is to develop a generalized theory of Taylor expansions for policy\nevaluation, which extends DQ theory to all major MDP formulations. On the\npractical side, we implement our estimator on Douyin's experimentation\nplatform, and in the process develop DQ into a truly \"plug-and-play\" estimator\nfor interference in real-world settings: one which provides robust, low-bias,\nlow-variance treatment effect estimates; admits computationally cheap,\nasymptotically exact uncertainty quantification; and reduces MSE by 99\\%\ncompared to the best existing alternatives in our applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 04:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

Roughly, gluing together any two shortest paths along a common\nterminal edge may not necessarily result in a shortest path but yields a\n``near-shortest'' path with defect at most $i$. It is known that\n$\\alpha_0$-metric graphs are exactly ptolemaic graphs, and that chordal graphs\nand distance-hereditary graphs are $\\alpha_i$-metric for $i=1$ and $i=2$,\nrespectively. We show that an additive $O(i)$-approximation of the radius, of\nthe diameter, and in fact of all vertex eccentricities of an $\\alpha_i$-metric\ngraph can be computed in total linear time.

The numerical results confirm the existence of\nYih mode and Marangoni mode in the longwave zone. For the clean/contaminated\nsurface of the film flow, the presence of an odd or Hall viscosity coefficient\nreduces the surface wave energy and delays the transition from laminar to\nperturbed flow.

The growth rate of both clean and contaminated liquid surfaces becomes\nmore/less when the stronger external shear acts along the downstream/upstream\ndirection of fluid flow. Further, the slip parameter leads to a lower critical\nReynolds number and makes the liquid surface more unstable. An increase in the\ncritical Reynolds number due to the stronger Marangoni force ensures that the\ninsoluble surfactant has the potential to dampen the Yih mode instability.\nMoreover, the unstable shear mode occurs in the finite wavenumber regime with\nvery high inertial force and a small angle of inclination.

Nevertheless, the performance of Video-based\nENF (V-ENF) estimation largely relies on the imaging quality and thus may\nsuffer from significant interference caused by non-ideal sampling, motion, and\nextreme lighting conditions. In this paper, we show that the ENF can be\nextracted without the above limitations from a new modality provided by the\nso-called event camera, a neuromorphic sensor that encodes the light intensity\nvariations and asynchronously emits events with extremely high temporal\nresolution and high dynamic range. Specifically, we first formulate and\nvalidate the physical mechanism for the ENF captured in events, and then\npropose a simple yet robust Event-based ENF (E-ENF) estimation method through\nmode filtering and harmonic enhancement. Furthermore, we build an Event-Video\nENF Dataset (EV-ENFD) that records both events and videos in diverse scenes.\nExtensive experiments on EV-ENFD demonstrate that our proposed E-ENF method can\nextract more accurate ENF traces, outperforming the conventional V-ENF by a\nlarge margin, especially in challenging environments with object motions and\nextreme lighting conditions.

Current theories of studying the\nillumination effects on defects usually have the assumption of unaffected\nformation energies of neutral defects as well as defect transition energy\nlevels, and use the quasi-Fermi levels to describe behaviors of excess carriers\nwith conclusions at variance. In this work, we first propose a method to\nsimulate steady illumination conditions, based on which we demonstrate that\nformation energies of neutral defects and defect transition energy levels are\ninsensitive to illumination. Then, we show that optical and thermal excitation\nof electrons can be seen equivalent with each other to reach a steady electron\ndistribution in a homogeneous semiconductor. Consequently, the electron\ndistribution can be characterized using just one effective temperature T' and\none universal Fermi level E_F' for a homogeneous semiconductor under continuous\nand steady illuminations, which can be seen as a combination of\nquasi-equilibrium electron system with T' and a lattice system with T. Using\nthe new concepts, we uncover the universal mechanisms of illumination effects\non charged defects by treating the band edge states explicitly in the same\nfooting as the defect states. We find that the formation energies of band edge\n'defect' states shift with increased T' of electrons, thus affecting the E_F',\nchanging defect ionic probabilities, and affecting concentrations of charged\ndefects. We apply our theory to study the illumination effects on the doping\nbehaviors in GaN:Mg and CdTe:Sb, obtaining results in accordance with\nexperimental observations. More interesting experimental defect-related\nphenomena under steady illuminations are expected to be understood from our\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 07:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our novel\nmethod significantly outperforms the SOTA baselines in six affect-related\ndatasets on the three tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 07:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

The key is that the basic assumption of these methods -- a\nsurface point is consistent when rendered from different views -- doesn't hold\nfor drawings. In a portrait drawing, the appearance of a facial point may\nchanges when viewed from different angles. Besides, portrait drawings usually\npresent little 3D information and suffer from insufficient training data. To\ncombat this challenge, in this paper, we propose a Semantic-Aware GEnerator\n(SAGE) for synthesizing multi-view portrait drawings. Our motivation is that\nfacial semantic labels are view-consistent and correlate with drawing\ntechniques. We therefore propose to collaboratively synthesize multi-view\nsemantic maps and the corresponding portrait drawings. To facilitate training,\nwe design a semantic-aware domain translator, which generates portrait drawings\nbased on features of photographic faces. In addition, use data augmentation via\nsynthesis to mitigate collapsed results. We apply SAGE to synthesize multi-view\nportrait drawings in diverse artistic styles.

It is however shown that the Landau and\ncyclotron resonance conditions which classically describe resonant\nenergy-momentum exchange between waves and particles are no longer valid in a\nrotating magnetized plasma column. In this case a new resonance condition which\ninvolves a resonant matching between the wave frequency, the cyclotron\nfrequency modified by inertial effects and the harmonics of the guiding center\nrotation is identified. A new quasilinear equation describing orbital and spin\nangular momentum exchanges through these new Brillouin resonances is then\nderived, and used to expose the wave driven radial current responsible for\nangular momentum absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 09:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

Humans can abstract away\nthe action from the appearance of the objects and their context which is\nreferred to as compositionality of actions. Compositional action recognition\ndeals with imparting human-like compositional generalization abilities to\naction-recognition models. In this regard, extracting the interactions between\nhumans and objects forms the basis of compositional understanding. These\ninteractions are not affected by the appearance biases of the objects or the\ncontext. But the context provides additional cues about the interactions\nbetween things and stuff. Hence we need to infuse context into the human-object\ninteractions for compositional action recognition. To this end, we first design\na spatial-temporal interaction encoder that captures the human-object (things)\ninteractions. The encoder learns the spatio-temporal interaction tokens\ndisentangled from the background context. The interaction tokens are then\ninfused with contextual information from the video tokens to model the\ninteractions between things and stuff. The final context-infused\nspatio-temporal interaction tokens are used for compositional action\nrecognition. We show the effectiveness of our interaction-centric approach on\nthe compositional Something-Else dataset where we obtain a new state-of-the-art\nresult of 83.8% top-1 accuracy outperforming recent important object-centric\nmethods by a significant margin. Our approach of explicit human-object-stuff\ninteraction modeling is effective even for standard action recognition datasets\nsuch as Something-Something-V2 and Epic-Kitchens-100 where we obtain comparable\nor better performance than state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 09:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

In\nagreement with previous results, our simulations show pattern-antipattern\noscillations of the overlaps with the stored patterns similar to those reported\nwithin a mean-field description of such a system, and which are due to\nmetastability originated by the quantum effect driven by the $s_x^i$ qubit\noperators. In simulations, we observe that such oscillations are stochastic due\nto the inherent metastability of the pattern attractors induced by the quantum\nterm and disappear in finite systems when one averages over many quantum\ntrajectories. In addition, we report the system behavior when the number of\nstored patterns enlarges, for the minimum temperature we can reach in\nsimulations (namely $T=0.005$). Our study reveals that the quantum term of the\nHamiltonian has a negative effect on storage capacity, decreasing the overlap\nwith the starting memory pattern for increased values of $\\Omega$ and the\nnumber of stored patterns.

A time-transformed explicit symplectic\nintegrator is used to show that the motion of neutral particles can be chaotic\nunder some circumstances.

The effect of\nvarying the black hole positive charge on the dynamical transition from order\nto chaos is associated with the electric charges of particles. The dynamical\ntransition of neutral particles has no sensitive dependence on a change of the\nblack hole charge.

This seemingly intractable\nissue can be resolved by using a recently introduced Schr\\\"odingerisation\nmethod (Jin et al. 2022) -- it converts any linear PDEs and ODEs with\nnon-Hermitian dynamics to a system of Schr\\\"odinger equations, via the\nso-called warped phase transformation that maps the equation into one higher\ndimension. We implement this method for several typical problems, including the\nlinear convection equation with inflow boundary conditions and the heat\nequation with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For interface\nproblems, we study the (parabolic) Stefan problem, linear convection, and\nlinear Liouville equations with discontinuous and even measure-valued\ncoefficients. We perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the validity of\nthis approach, which helps to bridge the gap between available quantum\nalgorithms and computational models for classical and quantum dynamics with\nboundary and interface conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 10:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

Personalisation provides a\nparticipation incentive when an FL model underperforms relative to one trained\nlocally. For situations where the federated model provides a lower accuracy\nthan a model trained entirely locally by a client, personalisation improves the\naccuracy of the pre-trained federated weights to be similar to or exceed those\nof the local client model.

The accurate classification of ECG\nsignals is crucial for the early detection and treatment of heart-related\ndiseases. This paper proposes a novel approach based on an improved\ndifferential evolution (DE) algorithm for ECG signal classification. To this\nend, after the preprocessing step, we extracted several features such as BPM,\nIBI, and SDNN. Then, the features are fed into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP).\nWhile MLPs are still widely used for ECG signal classification, using\ngradient-based training methods, the most widely used algorithm for the\ntraining process, has significant disadvantages, such as the possibility of\nbeing stuck in local optimums. Population-based metaheuristic techniques have\nbeen effectively used to address this. This paper employs an enhanced\ndifferential evolution (DE) algorithm for the training process as one of the\nmost effective population-based algorithms. To this end, we improved DE based\non a clustering-based strategy, opposition-based learning, and a local search.\nClustering-based strategies can act as crossover operators, while the goal of\nthe opposition operator is to improve the exploration of the DE algorithm. The\nweights and biases found by the improved DE algorithm are then fed into six\ngradient-based local search algorithms. In other words, the weights found by\nthe DE are employed as an initialization point. Therefore, we introduced six\ndifferent algorithms for the training process (in terms of different local\nsearch algorithms).

Conventional\napproaches emphasize domain-shared information extraction and domain-private\ninformation preservation, following the shared-private framework (SP models),\nwhich offers significant advantages over single-domain learning. However, the\nlimited availability of annotated data in each domain considerably hinders the\neffectiveness of conventional supervised MDL approaches in real-world\napplications. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called multi-domain\ncontrastive learning (MDCL) to alleviate the impact of insufficient annotations\nby capturing both semantic and structural information from both labeled and\nunlabeled data.Specifically, MDCL comprises two modules: inter-domain semantic\nalignment and intra-domain contrast.

Towards this\nresearch line, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has exhibited powerful\nperformance in addressing the supervision label shortage issue by learning\naugmented user and item representations. While many of them show their\neffectiveness, two key questions still remain unexplored: i) Most existing\nGCL-based CF models are still limited by ignoring the fact that user-item\ninteraction behaviors are often driven by diverse latent intent factors (e.g.,\nshopping for family party, preferred color or brand of products); ii) Their\nintroduced non-adaptive augmentation techniques are vulnerable to noisy\ninformation, which raises concerns about the model's robustness and the risk of\nincorporating misleading self-supervised signals. In light of these\nlimitations, we propose a Disentangled Contrastive Collaborative Filtering\nframework (DCCF) to realize intent disentanglement with self-supervised\naugmentation in an adaptive fashion. With the learned disentangled\nrepresentations with global context, our DCCF is able to not only distill\nfiner-grained latent factors from the entangled self-supervision signals but\nalso alleviate the augmentation-induced noise.

Nowadays, audio\ncodec models are increasingly utilized in generation fields as intermediate\nrepresentations. For instance, AudioLM is an audio generation model that uses\nthe discrete representation of SoundStream as a training target, while VALL-E\nemploys the Encodec model as an intermediate feature to aid TTS tasks. Despite\ntheir usefulness, two challenges persist: (1) training these audio codec models\ncan be difficult due to the lack of publicly available training processes and\nthe need for large-scale data and GPUs; (2) achieving good reconstruction\nperformance requires many codebooks, which increases the burden on generation\nmodels. In this study, we propose a group-residual vector quantization (GRVQ)\ntechnique and use it to develop a novel \\textbf{Hi}gh \\textbf{Fi}delity Audio\nCodec model, HiFi-Codec, which only requires 4 codebooks. We train all the\nmodels using publicly available TTS data such as LibriTTS, VCTK, AISHELL, and\nmore, with a total duration of over 1000 hours, using 8 GPUs. Our experimental\nresults show that HiFi-Codec outperforms Encodec in terms of reconstruction\nperformance despite requiring only 4 codebooks.

However, the acquisitions of some modalities, such as the\nT2-weighted modality, need a long time and they are always accompanied by\nmotion artifacts. On the other hand, the T1-weighted image (T1WI) shares the\nsame underlying information with T2-weighted image (T2WI), which needs a\nshorter scanning time. Therefore, in this paper we accelerate the acquisition\nof the T2WI by introducing the auxiliary modality (T1WI). Concretely, we first\nreconstruct high-quality T2WIs with under-sampled T2WIs. Here, we realize fast\nT2WI reconstruction by reducing the sampling rate in the k-space. Second, we\nestablish a cross-modal synthesis task to generate the synthetic T2WIs for\nguiding better T2WI reconstruction. Here, we obtain the synthetic T2WIs by\ndecomposing the whole cross-modal generation mapping into two OT processes, the\nspatial alignment mapping on the T1 image manifold and the cross-modal\nsynthesis mapping from aligned T1WIs to T2WIs. It overcomes the negative\ntransfer caused by the spatial misalignment. Then, we prove the reconstruction\nand the synthesis tasks are well complementary. Finally, we compare it with\nstate-of-the-art approaches on an open dataset FastMRI and an in-house dataset\nto testify the validity of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 12:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

Earthquake detection is\nan important scientific challenge, not only for its social impacts, but also\nsince it reflects the actual degree of understanding of the physical processes\ncontrolling seismic events. We propose an approach for evaluating and\nunderstanding the dynamics of seismic events. The approach is based on the\nphase between the waveform signals of many stations, enabling detecting the\nevolution of relatively small magnitudes, down to Mw 1.3. We constructed a\ntime-evolving network in which the network nodes are the stations, while the\nlinks are the level of correspondence between the stations' signals. The links'\nweights are quantified using the following statistical methods:\ncross-correlation, synchronization, mutual information, and coherence. Each of\nthese methods reflects a different aspect of the phase relations between the\nwaveforms of different stations in a given time window. We then developed\nglobal measures to study the properties of the time-evolving network of seismic\nactivity. The global measures include the leading eigenvalues of the network\nlinks, the number of links above a certain threshold, and k-means clustering.\nWe show that the network and its corresponding global measures vary\nsignificantly during seismic events. The results are based on detailed waveform\nstation data and detailed catalogs from Southern California; our analysis\nfocused on 27 mainshocks, during which we examined one-day data prior to the\noccurrence of the mainshock, as well as one hour of data following it.

Due to the heterogeneity of\nclients' local data distribution, recent studies explore the personalized FL\nthat learns and deploys distinct local models with the help of auxiliary global\nmodels. However, the clients can be heterogeneous in terms of not only local\ndata distribution, but also their computation and communication resources. The\ncapacity and efficiency of personalized models are restricted by the\nlowest-resource clients, leading to sub-optimal performance and limited\npracticality of personalized FL.

Recently, deep\nlearning-based approaches for image watermarking have made significant\nadvancements in robustness and invisibility. However, few studies focused on\nvideo watermarking using deep neural networks due to the high complexity and\ncomputational costs. Our paper aims to answer this research question: Can\nwell-designed deep learning-based image watermarking be efficiently adapted to\nvideo watermarking? Our answer is positive. First, we revisit the workflow of\ndeep learning-based watermarking methods that leads to a critical insight:\ntemporal information in the video may be essential for general computer vision\ntasks but not for specific video watermarking. Inspired by this insight, we\npropose a method named ItoV for efficiently adapting deep learning-based Image\nwatermarking to Video watermarking. Specifically, ItoV merges the temporal\ndimension of the video with the channel dimension to enable deep neural\nnetworks to treat videos as images. We further explore the effects of different\nconvolutional blocks in video watermarking. We find that spatial convolution is\nthe primary influential component in video watermarking and depthwise\nconvolutions significantly reduce computational cost with negligible impact on\nperformance. In addition, we propose a new frame loss to constrain that the\nwatermark intensity in each video clip frame is consistent, significantly\nimproving the invisibility.

A Latent\nfactorization of tensors (LFT) model efficiently extracts this time pattern,\nwhich can be established using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) solvers.\nHowever, LFT models based on SGD are often limited by training schemes and have\npoor tail convergence. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel\nnonlinear LFT model (MNNL) based on momentum-incorporated SGD, which extracts\nnon-negative latent factors from HDI tensors to make training unconstrained and\ncompatible with general training schemes, while improving convergence accuracy\nand speed. Empirical studies on two LDN datasets show that compared to existing\nmodels, the MNNL model has higher prediction accuracy and convergence speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 12:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

For general LTL, this kind of\nanalysis is impossible due to the complexity of determinization. Bypasses are\neither by enumerative handling of determinization or by restricting attention\nto fragments of the language. Here, we take the second approach and suggest a\nfragment combining a safety specification and a liveness part. The safety part\nis unrestricted but allows symbolic treatment due to the simplicity of\ndeterminization in the case of safety languages. The liveness part is very\ngeneral, allowing to define Emerson-Lei conditions on occurrences of letters.\nWe elaborate the construction of an Emerson-Lei game that captures the\nsynthesis problem. We also show how Emerson-Lei games can be analyzed\nsymbolically by providing a fixpoint-based characterization of the winning\nregion, which is obtained from an analysis of the Zielonka tree of the winning\ncondition. Our algorithm generalizes the solutions of games with known winning\nconditions such as B\\\"uchi, GR[1], parity, Streett, Rabin and Muller\nobjectives, and in the case of these conditions reproduces previously known\nalgorithms and complexity results; the algorithm solves unrestricted\nEmerson-Lei games with $n$ nodes, $m$ edges and $k$ colors in time\n$\\mathcal{O}(k!\\cdot m\\cdot n^k)$ and yields winning strategies with memory\n$\\mathcal{O}(k!)$.

However, in the context of semi-supervised multi-label learning\n(SSMLL), conventional pseudo-labeling methods encounter difficulties when\ndealing with instances associated with multiple labels and an unknown label\ncount. These limitations often result in the introduction of false positive\nlabels or the neglect of true positive ones.

To\nthis end, we present a novel paradigm that attempts to extract noise-resistant\nfeatures in its pipeline and introduces a noise-aware learning scheme to\neffectively improve the robustness of multimodal emotion understanding. Our new\npipeline, namely Noise-Resistant Multimodal Transformer (NORM-TR), mainly\nintroduces a Noise-Resistant Generic Feature (NRGF) extractor and a Transformer\nfor the multimodal emotion recognition task. In particular, we make the NRGF\nextractor learn a generic and disturbance-insensitive representation so that\nconsistent and meaningful semantics can be obtained. Furthermore, we apply a\nTransformer to incorporate Multimodal Features (MFs) of multimodal inputs based\non their relations to the NRGF. Therefore, the possible insensitive but useful\ninformation of NRGF could be complemented by MFs that contain more details. To\ntrain the NORM-TR properly, our proposed noise-aware learning scheme\ncomplements normal emotion recognition losses by enhancing the learning against\nnoises. Our learning scheme explicitly adds noises to either all the modalities\nor a specific modality at random locations of a multimodal input sequence. We\ncorrespondingly introduce two adversarial losses to encourage the NRGF\nextractor to learn to extract the NRGFs invariant to the added noises, thus\nfacilitating the NORM-TR to achieve more favorable multimodal emotion\nrecognition performance. In practice, on several popular multimodal datasets,\nour NORM-TR achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing\nmethods by a large margin, which demonstrates that the ability to resist noisy\ninformation is important for effective emotion recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 13:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

However, the highly dynamic environment of urban areas, where AVs are\nexpected to operate, poses a challenge, as non-line-of-sight (NLoS)\ncommunication can deteriorate the 5G mmWave positioning solution and lead to\nerroneous corrections to the INS. To address this challenge, we exploit 5G\nmultipath and LoS signals to improve positioning performance in dense urban\nenvironments.

However,\npure-helium atmospheres have Gaia magnitudes that are too close to the\npure-hydrogen case to explain this bifurcation. To reproduce the observed split\nin the cooling sequence, it has been shown that trace amounts of hydrogen\nand/or metals must be present in the helium-dominated atmospheres of\nhydrogen-deficient white dwarfs. Yet, a complete explanation of the Gaia\nbifurcation that takes into account known constraints on the spectral evolution\nof white dwarfs has thus far not been proposed. In this work, we attempt to\nprovide such a holistic explanation by performing population synthesis\nsimulations coupled with state-of-the-art model atmospheres and evolutionary\ncalculations that account for element transport in the envelopes of white\ndwarfs. By relying on empirically grounded assumptions, these simulations\nsuccessfully reproduce the bifurcation. We show that the convective dredge-up\nof optically undetectable traces of carbon from the deep interior is crucial to\naccount for the observations. Neither the convective dilution/mixing of\nresidual hydrogen nor the accretion of hydrogen or metals can be the dominant\ndrivers of the bifurcation. Finally, we emphasize the importance of improving\ntheoretical models for the average ionization level of carbon in warm dense\nhelium, which governs the shape of the diffusive tail of carbon and in turn the\npredicted amount of dredged-up carbon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 13:44:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 13:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

In the\n(2+1)-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal, a curved\nmomentum-spacetime arises as the critical spin fluctuations generate red shift\nthat dilates frequency of electron unevenly on the Fermi surface. As the\ndisparity of the momentum-dependent red shift is controlled by the shape of the\nFermi surface, the momentum-spacetime geometry that emerges at low energies\ndepends on the bare nesting angle of the Fermi surface. With increasing nesting\nangle, the region in which electron motion is slowed down by critical spin\nfluctuations shrinks. On the other hand, the increasing nesting angle makes the\nred shift stronger near the hot spots due to the weakened screening of the\ninteraction. These competing effects result in a non-monotonic dependence of\nthe cyclotron frequency of electron on the nesting angle of the Fermi surface.\nThe red shift that becomes more singular at the hot spots with increasing\nnesting angle creates a possibility of realizing a momentum-space black hole\nhorizon beyond a critical nesting angle : the electron motion becomes\n`perpetually' slowed down as it approaches a hot spot in the same way that the\nmotion of a free falling object freezes near the event horizon of a black hole\nwith respect to an asymptotic observer.

These models carry supersymmetric (SUSY) or SUSY-like structures. Namely,\nbosons and Majorana fermions are both present and each of them interacts with\n$(q-1)$ particles, but the model is not necessarily supersymmetric. It was\nfound that the chaos exponents in different models, no matter whether they\ncarry SUSY(-like) structures or not, all follow a universal single-parameter\nscaling law for large $q$, and by tuning that parameter continuously a flow\nfrom maximally chaotic to completely regular motion results. Here we report a\nstring-theoretical analog of this chaotic phenomenon. Specifically, we consider\nclosed string scattering near the two-sided AdS black hole, whose amplitude\ngrows exponentially in the Schwarzschild time, with a rate determined by the\nRegge spin of the Pomeron exchanged during string scattering. We calculate the\nPomeron Regge spin for strings of different types, including the bosonic\nstring, the type II superstring and the heterotic superstring. We find that the\nPomeron Regge spin also displays a single-parameter scaling behavior\nindependent of string types, with the parameter depending on the string length\nand the length scale characterizing the spacetime curvature; moreover, the\nscaling function has the same limiting behaviors as that for the chaos exponent\nof SYK-like models. Remarkably, the flow from maximally chaotic to completely\nregular motion in SYK-like models corresponds to the flow of the Pomeron Regge\nspin from $2$ to $1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 14:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

The proposed methods work as follows: snapshots of an ensemble of\nmodel realizations are taken at observation times, these snapshots are employed\nto build control spaces onto which analysis increments can be estimated. Via\nthe linearization of observation operators at observation times, a line-search\nbased optimization method is proposed to estimate optimal analysis increments.\nThe convergence of this method is theoretically proven as long as the dimension\nof control-spaces equals model one. In the first formulation, control spaces\nare given by full-rank square root approximations of background error\ncovariance matrices via the Bickel and Levina precision matrix estimator.

Previous adversaries primarily focus on graph\nmodifications or node injections to existing graphs, yielding promising results\nbut with notable limitations. Graph modification attack~(GMA) requires\nmanipulation of the original graph, which is often impractical, while graph\ninjection attack~(GIA) necessitates training a surrogate model in the black-box\nsetting, leading to significant performance degradation due to divergence\nbetween the surrogate architecture and the actual victim model.

However, effective\nidentification and quantification of defects remains a challenge even as\nhigh-throughput scanning tunneling electron microscopy (STEM) methods improve.\nThis study highlights the benefits of employing first principles calculations\nto produce digital twins for training deep learning segmentation models for\ndefect identification in monolayer MX2 phases.

This digital twin approach allows benchmarking different\ndeep learning architectures on a theory dataset, which enables the study of\ndefect classification under a broad array of finely controlled conditions.

Our approach is based on the following insights: (1)\npartitioning the circuit into blocks is beneficial for qubit mapping and\nrouting; (2) with PAS, any block can implement an arbitrary input-output qubit\nmapping that reduces the gate count; and (3) with PAM, for two adjacent blocks\nwe can select input-output permutations that optimize each block together with\nthe amount of communication required at the block boundary.

Ensemble data assimilation in geophysical\nmodels faces several well-documented issues. In this work we exploit the\nexpansion of the solution in DG basis functions to address some of these\nissues. Specifically, it is investigated whether a DA-DG combination 1)\nmitigates the need for observation thinning, 2) reduces errors in the field's\ngradients, 3) can be used to set up scale-dependent localisation. Numerical\nexperiments are carried out using stochastically generated ensembles of model\nstates, with different noise properties, and with Legendre polynomials as basis\nfunctions.

This is\nespecially the case when small scales dominate the background error. The DA\nimprovement in the 1st derivative is on the other hand marginal. We think this\nto be a counter-effect of the power of DG to fit the observations closely,\nwhich can deteriorate the estimates of the derivatives.

So we study it\nunder Repeated Exposure Optimality (REO), a condition motivated by the\nliterature on human physiology, which requires the existence of an action that\nwhen repetitively played will eventually yield smaller loss than any other\nsequence of actions. We study the minimization of the complete policy regret\n(CPR), which is the strongest notion of regret, in WTB under REO. Since $m$ is\ntypically unknown, we assume we only have access to an upper bound $M$ on $m$.\nWe show that for problems with $K$ actions and horizon $T$, a simple\nmodification of the successive elimination algorithm has $O \\left( \\sqrt{KT} +\n(m+M)K \\right)$ CPR. Interestingly, upto an additive (in lieu of\nmutliplicative) factor in $(m+M)K$, this recovers the classical guarantee for\nthe simpler stochastic multi-armed bandit with traditional regret. We\nadditionally show that in our setting, any algorithm will suffer additive CPR\nof $\\Omega \\left( mK + M \\right)$, demonstrating our result is nearly optimal.\nOur algorithm is computationally efficient, and we experimentally demonstrate\nits practicality and superiority over natural baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 15:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

The complexity of\nnatural language in describing situations has motivated researchers to leverage\nthe related visual context to improve event detection performance.

Furthermore,\nlimited access to the visual context at inference time negatively impacts the\nperformance of such models, which makes them practically ineffective in\nreal-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel domain-adaptive\nvisually-fused event detection approach that can be trained on a few labelled\nimage-text paired data points. Specifically, we introduce a visual imaginator\nmethod that synthesises images from text in the absence of visual context.\nMoreover, the imaginator can be customised to a specific domain. In doing so,\nour model can leverage the capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models\nand can be trained in a few-shot setting. This also allows for effective\ninference where only single-modality data (i.e. text) is available.

Meanwhile, RL has its shortcomings,\nparticularly requiring a large number of online samples for exploration, which\nis risky in real-world applications. One of the appealing ways to avoid the\nrisk is to build a simulator and learn the optimal recommendation policy in the\nsimulator. In LTE optimization, the simulator is to simulate multiple users'\ndaily feedback for given recommendations. However, building a user simulator\nwith no reality-gap, i.e., can predict user's feedback exactly, is unrealistic\nbecause the users' reaction patterns are complex and historical logs for each\nuser are limited, which might mislead the simulator-based recommendation\npolicy. In this paper, we present a practical simulator-based recommender\npolicy training approach, Simulation-to-Recommendation (Sim2Rec) to handle the\nreality-gap problem for LTE optimization. Specifically, Sim2Rec introduces a\nsimulator set to generate various possibilities of user behavior patterns, then\ntrains an environment-parameter extractor to recognize users' behavior patterns\nin the simulators. Finally, a context-aware policy is trained to make the\noptimal decisions on all of the variants of the users based on the inferred\nenvironment-parameters. The policy is transferable to unseen environments\n(e.g., the real world) directly as it has learned to recognize all various user\nbehavior patterns and to make the correct decisions based on the inferred\nenvironment-parameters.

Credit risk\nmodels focus on the financial conditions of borrowers and only marginally\nconsider other risks from the real economy, supply chains in particular. Recent\npandemics, geopolitical instabilities, and natural disasters demonstrated that\nsupply chain shocks do contribute to large financial losses. Based on a unique\nnation-wide micro-dataset, containing practically all supply chain relations of\nall Hungarian firms, together with their bank loans, we estimate how\nfirm-failures affect the supply chain network, leading to potentially\nadditional firm defaults and additional financial losses. Within a multi-layer\nnetwork framework we define a financial systemic risk index (FSRI) for every\nfirm, quantifying these expected financial losses caused by its own- and all\nthe secondary defaulting loans caused by supply chain network (SCN) shock\npropagation. We find a small fraction of firms carrying substantial financial\nsystemic risk, affecting up to 16% of the banking system's overall equity.\nThese losses are predominantly caused by SCN contagion. For every bank we\ncalculate the expected loss (EL), value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall\n(ES), with and without accounting for SCN contagion. We find that SCN contagion\namplifies the EL, VaR, and ES by a factor of 4.3, 4.5, and 3.2, respectively.\nThese findings indicate that for a more complete picture of financial stability\nand realistic credit risk assessment, SCN contagion needs to be considered.\nThis newly quantified contagion channel is of potential relevance for\nregulators' future systemic risk assessments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 09:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

However, current GM methods have limitations, such\nas low affinity towards the target, unknown ADME/PK properties, or the lack of\nsynthetic tractability. To improve the applicability domain of GM methods, we\nhave developed a workflow based on a variational autoencoder coupled with\nactive learning steps. The designed GM workflow iteratively learns from\nmolecular metrics, including drug likeliness, synthesizability, similarity, and\ndocking scores. In addition, we also included a hierarchical set of criteria\nbased on advanced molecular modeling simulations during a final selection step.\nWe tested our GM workflow on two model systems, CDK2 and KRAS. In both cases,\nour model generated chemically viable molecules with a high predicted affinity\ntoward the targets. Particularly, the proportion of high-affinity molecules\ninferred by our GM workflow was significantly greater than that in the training\ndata. Notably, we also uncovered novel scaffolds significantly dissimilar to\nthose known for each target. These results highlight the potential of our GM\nworkflow to explore novel chemical space for specific targets, thereby opening\nup new possibilities for drug discovery endeavors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 13:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}
