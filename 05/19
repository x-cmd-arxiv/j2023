In traditional\ncollaborative filtering approaches, both intent and preference factors are\nusually entangled in the modeling process, which significantly limits the\nrobustness and interpretability of recommendation performances. For example,\nthe low-rating items are always treated as negative feedback while they\nactually could provide positive information about user intent. To this end, in\nthis paper, we propose a two-fold representation learning approach, namely\nDouble Disentangled Collaborative Filtering (DDCF), for personalized\nrecommendations. The first-level disentanglement is for separating the\ninfluence factors of intent and preference, while the second-level\ndisentanglement is performed to build independent sparse preference\nrepresentations under individual intent with limited computational complexity.\nSpecifically, we employ two variational autoencoder networks, intent\nrecognition network and preference decomposition network, to learn the intent\nand preference factors, respectively. In this way, the low-rating items will be\ntreated as positive samples for modeling intents while the negative samples for\nmodeling preferences. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets and four evaluation metrics clearly validate the effectiveness and the\ninterpretability of DDCF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 16:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

While two of our circuit constructions draw upon\nalgebraic techniques such as isometric extension and block encoding, the third\napproach breaks down the recovery map into a sequence of two-outcome POVMs. In\neach of the three cases we improve upon the resource requirements that\ncurrently exist in the literature. Apart from Petz recovery circuits, we also\npresent circuits that can directly estimate the fidelity between the encoded\nstate and the recovered state. As a concrete example of our circuit\nconstructions, we implement Petz recovery circuits corresponding to the\n$4$-qubit QEC code tailored to protect against amplitude-damping noise. The\nefficacy of our noise-adapted recovery circuits is then demonstrated through\nideal and noisy simulations on the IBM quantum processors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 16:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Most existing work\nconsiders how to combine existing logical and statistical systems. However,\nthere is no theory of inference so far explaining how basic approaches to\nstatistical learning and logical reasoning stem from a common principle.\nInspired by the fact that much empirical work in neuroscience suggests Bayesian\n(or probabilistic generative) approaches to brain function including learning\nand reasoning, we here propose a simple Bayesian model of logical reasoning and\nstatistical learning. The theory is statistically correct as it satisfies\nKolmogorov's axioms, is consistent with both Fenstad's representation theorem\nand maximum likelihood estimation and performs exact Bayesian inference with a\nlinear-time complexity. The theory is logically correct as it is a data-driven\ngeneralisation of uncertain reasoning from consistency, possibility,\ninconsistency and impossibility. The theory is correct in terms of machine\nlearning as its solution to generation and prediction tasks on the MNIST\ndataset is not only empirically reasonable but also theoretically correct\nagainst the K nearest neighbour method. We simply model how data causes\nsymbolic knowledge in terms of its satisfiability in formal logic. Symbolic\nreasoning emerges as a result of the process of going the causality forwards\nand backwards. The forward and backward processes correspond to an\ninterpretation and inverse interpretation in formal logic, respectively. The\ninverse interpretation differentiates our work from the mainstream often\nreferred to as inverse entailment, inverse deduction or inverse resolution.

The performance of LES is comprehensively examined through\nthe prediction of the flow statistics including the velocity spectrum, the\nprobability density functions (PDFs) of the SGS stress, the PDF of the strain\nrate and the PDF of the SGS energy flux. The structure functions, the evolution\nof turbulent kinetic energy, the mean flow and the Reynolds stress profile, and\nthe iso-surface of the Q-criterion are also examined to evaluate the spatial\ntemporal predictions by different SGS models. The results of the EnKF-MM\nframework are consistently more satisfying compared to the traditional SGS\nmodels, including the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM), the dynamic mixed model\n(DMM) and the velocity gradient model (VGM), demonstrating its great potential\nin the optimization of SGS models for LES of turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 16:53:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 12:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Traditional\napproaches to this question have focused on verbal reasoning or simple\n(low-dimensional) quantitative models. In the real world, however, social\npreferences emerge when high-dimensional learning systems (brains and bodies)\ninteract with high-dimensional sensory inputs during an animal's embodied\ninteractions with the world. A deep understanding of social grouping will\ntherefore require embodied models that learn directly from sensory inputs using\nhigh-dimensional learning mechanisms. To this end, we built artificial neural\nnetworks (ANNs), embodied those ANNs in virtual fish bodies, and raised the\nartificial fish in virtual fish tanks that mimicked the rearing conditions of\nreal fish. We then compared the social preferences that emerged in real fish\nversus artificial fish. We found that when artificial fish had two core\nlearning mechanisms (reinforcement learning and curiosity-driven learning),\nartificial fish developed fish-like social preferences. Like real fish, the\nartificial fish spontaneously learned to prefer members of their own group over\nmembers of other groups. The artificial fish also spontaneously learned to\nself-segregate with their in-group, akin to self-segregation behavior seen in\nnature. Our results suggest that social grouping can emerge from three\ningredients: (1) reinforcement learning, (2) intrinsic motivation, and (3)\nearly social experiences with in-group members. This approach lays a foundation\nfor reverse engineering animal-like social behavior with image-computable\nmodels, bridging the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and social\npreferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 17:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

The integration of such controls, which can accommodate various\nvisual conditions in a single unified model, remains an unaddressed challenge.\nIn response, we introduce UniControl, a new generative foundation model that\nconsolidates a wide array of controllable condition-to-image (C2I) tasks within\na singular framework, while still allowing for arbitrary language prompts.\nUniControl enables pixel-level-precise image generation, where visual\nconditions primarily influence the generated structures and language prompts\nguide the style and context. To equip UniControl with the capacity to handle\ndiverse visual conditions, we augment pretrained text-to-image diffusion models\nand introduce a task-aware HyperNet to modulate the diffusion models, enabling\nthe adaptation to different C2I tasks simultaneously. Trained on nine unique\nC2I tasks, UniControl demonstrates impressive zero-shot generation abilities\nwith unseen visual conditions. Experimental results show that UniControl often\nsurpasses the performance of single-task-controlled methods of comparable model\nsizes. This control versatility positions UniControl as a significant\nadvancement in the realm of controllable visual generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 17:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 17:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

The accompanying symmetry protection leads\nto different kinds of topological edge-channels which include, for instance,\nthe quantum spin Hall phase, and the spin quantum anomalous Hall phase. To\nmodel realistic devices, it is important to ratify the robustness of the\ndissipationless edge-channels, which should typically exhibit a perfect quantum\nof conductance, against various disorder and dephasing. This work is hence\ndevoted to a computational exploration of topological robustness against\nvarious forms of dephasing. For this, we employ phenomenological dephasing\nmodels under the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism using a\nmodel topological device setup on a 2D-Xene platform. Concurrently, we also\nexplicitly add disorder via impurity potentials in the channel and averaging\nover hundreds of configurations. To describe the extent of robustness, we\nquantify the decay of the conductance quantum with increasing disorder under\ndifferent conditions. Our analysis shows that these topological phases are\nrobust to experimentally relevant regimes of momentum dephasing and random\ndisorder potentials. We note that Rashba mixing worsens the performance of the\nQSH phase and point out a mechanism for the same. Further, we observe that the\nquantum spin Hall phase break downs due to spin dephasing, but the spin quantum\nanomalous Hall phase remains robust. The spin quantum anomalous Hall phase\nshows stark robustness under all the dephasing regimes, and shows promise for\nrealistic device structures for topological electronics applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 17:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Working with programs enables us to precisely define\nconcepts relevant to meaning in language (e.g., correctness and semantics),\nmaking program synthesis well-suited as an intermediate testbed for\ncharacterizing the presence (or absence) of meaning in language models.\n  We first train a Transformer model on the corpus of programs, then probe the\ntrained model's hidden states as it completes a program given a specification.\nDespite providing no inductive bias toward learning the semantics of the\nlanguage, we find that a linear probe is able to extract abstractions of both\ncurrent and future program states from the model states. Moreover, there is a\nstrong, statistically significant correlation between the accuracy of the probe\nand the model's ability to generate a program that implements the\nspecification. To evaluate whether the semantics are represented in the model\nstates rather than learned by the probe, we design a novel experimental\nprocedure that intervenes on the semantics of the language while preserving the\nlexicon and syntax. We also demonstrate that the model learns to generate\ncorrect programs that are, on average, shorter than those in the training set,\nwhich is evidence that language model outputs may differ from the training\ndistribution in semantically meaningful ways.

A common practice for\nprompting generalist models, often referred to as in-context learning, is to\nappend a few examples (demonstrations) to the prompt to help the model better\nunderstand the task. While effective, in-context learning can be inefficient\nbecause it makes the input prompt much longer, consuming valuable space in the\ncontext window and leading to larger computational costs. In this paper, we\npropose DynaICL, a recipe for efficient prompting with black-box generalist\nmodels that dynamically allocate in-context examples according to the input\ncomplexity and the computational budget. To achieve this, we train a meta\ncontroller that predicts the number of in-context examples suitable for the\ngeneralist model to make a good prediction based on the performance-efficiency\ntrade-off for a specific input. We then dynamically allocate the number of\ndemonstrations for an input according to predictions from the meta controller\nand the given computation budget. Experimental results show that dynamic\nexample allocation helps achieve a better performance-efficiency trade-off in\ntwo practical settings where computational resources or the required\nperformance is constrained. Specifically, DynaICL saves up to 46% token budget\ncompared to the common practice that allocates the same number of in-context\nexamples to each input.

To\nbridge this gap, we introduce a general framework for studying energy\nconsumption of quantum and classical computation based on a computational model\nwith a black-box oracle, as conventionally used for studying query complexity\nin computational complexity theory. With this framework, we derive an upper\nbound of energy consumption of quantum computation with covering all costs,\nincluding those of initialization, control, and quantum error correction; in\nparticular, our analysis shows an energy-consumption bound for a finite-step\nLandauer-erasure protocol, progressing beyond the existing asymptotic bound.

We find that LaMDA generates appropriate\nresponses that are similar to those of children in experiments involving social\nunderstanding, perhaps providing evidence that knowledge of these domains is\ndiscovered through language. On the other hand, LaMDA's responses in early\nobject and action understanding, theory of mind, and especially causal\nreasoning tasks are very different from those of young children, perhaps\nshowing that these domains require more real-world, self-initiated exploration\nand cannot simply be learned from patterns in language input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 18:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

To address this limitation, this paper takes a step\ntowards collaborative plan acquisition, where humans and agents strive to learn\nand communicate with each other to acquire a complete plan for joint tasks.\nSpecifically, we formulate a novel problem for agents to predict the missing\ntask knowledge for themselves and for their partners based on rich perceptual\nand dialogue history.

To this end, machine learning techniques can\nbe an extremely useful tool though the cost of generating highly accurate\ntraining datasets still remains a severe challenge. To overcome this hurdle,\nthis work proposes the use of multi-fidelity machine learning where very little\ntraining data from high accuracies is combined with cheaper and less accurate\ndata to achieve the accuracy of the costlier level.

Counterfactuals are\nhypothetical situations that can lead to a different decision or choice. In\nthis paper, the authors frame the counterfactual search problem as a design\nrecommendation tool that can help identify modifications to a design, leading\nto better functional performance. MCD improves upon existing counterfactual\nsearch methods by supporting multi-objective queries, which are crucial in\ndesign problems, and by decoupling the counterfactual search and sampling\nprocesses, thus enhancing efficiency and facilitating objective tradeoff\nvisualization. The paper demonstrates MCD's core functionality using a\ntwo-dimensional test case, followed by three case studies of bicycle design\nthat showcase MCD's effectiveness in real-world design problems. In the first\ncase study, MCD excels at recommending modifications to query designs that can\nsignificantly enhance functional performance, such as weight savings and\nimprovements to the structural safety factor. The second case study\ndemonstrates that MCD can work with a pre-trained language model to suggest\ndesign changes based on a subjective text prompt effectively. Lastly, the\nauthors task MCD with increasing a query design's similarity to a target image\nand text prompt while simultaneously reducing weight and improving structural\nperformance, demonstrating MCD's performance on a complex multimodal query.\nOverall, MCD has the potential to provide valuable recommendations for\npractitioners and design automation researchers looking for answers to their\n``What if'' questions by exploring hypothetical design modifications and their\nimpact on multiple design objectives.

In\ntypical implementations of an SNN classifier, decisions are produced after the\nentire input sequence has been processed, resulting in latency and energy\nconsumption levels that are fairly uniform across inputs. Recently introduced\ndelay-adaptive SNNs tailor the inference latency -- and, with it, the energy\nconsumption -- to the difficulty of each example, by producing an early\ndecision when the SNN model is sufficiently ``confident''. In this paper, we\nstart by observing that, as an SNN processes input samples, its classification\ndecisions tend to be first under-confident and then over-confident with respect\nto the decision's ground-truth, unknown, test accuracy. This makes it difficult\nto determine a stopping time that ensures a desired level of accuracy. To\naddress this problem, we introduce a novel delay-adaptive SNN-based inference\nmethodology that, wrapping around any pre-trained SNN classifier, provides\nguaranteed reliability for the decisions produced at input-dependent stopping\ntimes. The approach entails minimal added complexity as compared to the\nunderlying SNN, requiring only thresholding and counting operations at run\ntime, and it leverages tools from conformal prediction (CP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 22:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

The pair of observed responses (one from each population) at the\nsame value of the covariate is known as a \"matched pair\" (with the matching\nbased on the value of the covariate). A graph of cumulative differences between\nthe two populations reveals differences in responses as a function of the\ncovariate. Indeed, the slope of the secant line connecting two points on the\ngraph becomes the average difference over the wide interval of values of the\ncovariate between the two points; i.e., slope of the graph is the average\ndifference in responses. (\"Average\" refers to the weighted average if the\nsamples are weighted.) Moreover, a simple statistic known as the Kuiper metric\nsummarizes into a single scalar the overall differences over all values of the\ncovariate. The Kuiper metric is the absolute value of the total difference in\nresponses between the two populations, totaled over the interval of values of\nthe covariate for which the absolute value of the total is greatest. The total\nshould be normalized such that it becomes the (weighted) average over all\nvalues of the covariate when the interval over which the total is taken is the\nentire range of the covariate (i.e., the sum for the total gets divided by the\ntotal number of observations, if the samples are unweighted, or divided by the\ntotal weight, if the samples are weighted). This cumulative approach is fully\nnonparametric and uniquely defined (with only one right way to construct the\ngraphs and scalar summary statistics), unlike traditional methods such as\nreliability diagrams or parametric or semi-parametric regressions, which\ntypically obscure significant differences due to their parameter settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 22:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

The main challenge of the task lies in the\nultra-high redundancy in the long recipe and the large variation reflected in\nboth food item combination and food item appearance. A de-facto idea to address\nthis task is to learn a shared feature embedding space in which a food image is\naligned better to its paired recipe than other recipes. However, such\nsupervised global matching is prone to supervision collapse, i.e., only partial\ninformation that is necessary for distinguishing training pairs can be\nidentified, while other information that is potentially useful in\ngeneralization could be lost. To mitigate such a problem, we propose a\nmask-augmentation-based local matching network (MALM), where an image-text\nmatching module and a masked self-distillation module benefit each other\nmutually to learn generalizable cross-modality representations. On one hand, we\nperform local matching between the tokenized representations of image and text\nto locate fine-grained cross-modality correspondence explicitly. We involve\nrepresentations of masked image patches in this process to alleviate\noverfitting resulting from local matching especially when some food items are\nunderrepresented. On the other hand, predicting the hidden representations of\nthe masked patches through self-distillation helps to learn general-purpose\nimage representations that are expected to generalize better. And the\nmulti-task nature of the model enables the representations of masked patches to\nbe text-aware and thus facilitates the lost information reconstruction.\nExperimental results on Recipe1M dataset show our method can clearly outperform\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

We offer the community a new spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) library, hereinafter [GoMar23] model, which is based\non the two-phase torus model developed before with the inclusion of the grain\nsize as a model parameter, parameterized by the maximum grain size Psize or\nequivalently the mass-weighted average grain size < P >. We created 691,200\nSEDs using the SKIRT code, where the maximum grain size can vary within the\nrange Psize = 0.01 - 10.0um ( < P >= 0.007 - 3.41um). We fit this new and\nseveral existing libraries to a sample of 68 nearby and luminous AGNs with\nSpitzer/IRS spectra dominated by AGN-heated dust. We find that the [GoMar23]\nmodel can adequately reproduce up to 85-88% of the spectra. The dust grain size\nparameter significantly improves the final fit in up to 90% of these spectra.\nStatistical tests indicate that the grain size is the third most important\nparameter in the fitting procedure (after the size and half opening angle of\nthe torus). The requirement of a foreground extinction by our model is lower\ncompared to purely clumpy models. We find that 41% of our sample requires that\nthe maximum dust grain size is as large as Psize =10um (< P >= 3.41um).\nNonetheless, we also remark that disk+wind and clumpy torus models are still\nrequired to reproduce the spectra of a non-negligible fraction of objects,\nsuggesting the need for several dust geometries to explain the infrared\ncontinuum of AGN.

We instead suggest that planet formation can\noccur early in massive discs, through the gravitational collapse of dust which\ncan form the seeds of giant planets. This is different from the usual picture\nof self-gravitating discs, in which planet formation is considered through the\ngravitational collapse of the gas disc into a gas giant precursor. It is\nfamiliar in the sense that the core is formed first, and gas is accreted\nthereafter, as is the case in the core accretion scenario.

The accretion of\npebbles is most efficient with centimetre-sized dust, but the accretion of\nmillimetre sizes can also result in formation within a Myr.

Unlike existing image synthesis methods, our work addresses\nthe challenge of synthesizing both geometry and texture aligned to the input\nscene structure and prompt simultaneously. The key insight is that a scene\nshould be treated as a whole, taking into account both scene texture and\ngeometry. The proposed framework consists of two significant components:\nGeometry Guided Diffusion and Mesh Optimization. Geometry Guided Diffusion for\n3D Scene guarantees the consistency of the scene style by applying the 2D prior\nto the entire scene simultaneously. Mesh Optimization improves the geometry and\ntexture jointly and eliminates the artifacts in the scanned scene. To validate\nthe proposed method, real indoor scenes scanned with smartphones are used for\nextensive experiments, through which the effectiveness of our method is\ndemonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 22:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

To\naddress the computational inability challenge, we propose a novel\nposition-aware and sample-aware central loss. Specifically, our central loss\ncan absorb position information, enabling accurate evaluation of the heatmap\ndistribution. More advanced is that our central loss is sample-aware, which can\nadaptively distinguish easy and hard samples and make the model more focused on\nhard samples while solving the challenge of extreme imbalance between landmarks\nand non-landmarks. To address the challenge of ignoring structure information,\na Coordinated Transformer, called CoorTransformer, is proposed, which\nestablishes long-range dependencies under the guidance of landmark coordination\ninformation, making the attention more focused on the sparse landmarks while\ntaking advantage of global spatial structure. Furthermore, CoorTransformer can\nspeed up convergence, effectively avoiding the defect that Transformers have\ndifficulty converging in sparse representation learning. Using the advanced\nCoorTransformer and central loss, we propose a generalized detection model that\ncan handle various scenarios, inherently exploiting the underlying relationship\nbetween landmarks and incorporating rich structural knowledge around the target\nlandmarks. We analyzed and evaluated CoorTransformer and central loss on three\nchallenging landmark detection tasks. The experimental results show that our\nCoorTransformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and the central loss\nsignificantly improves the performance of the model with p-values< 0.05.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 23:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

This pattern is difficult to\nreconcile with economic factors but can be explained by minimum payment\ninformation presented to consumers acting as an anchor that weighs payments\ndown. Building on Stewart (2009), we conduct a hypothetical credit card payment\nexperiment to test an intervention to de-anchor payment choices. This\nintervention effectively stops consumers selecting payments at the contractual\nminimum. It also increases their average payments, as well as shifting the\ndistribution of payments. By de-anchoring choices from the minimum, consumers\nincreasingly choose the full payment amount - which potentially seems to act as\na target payment for consumers. We innovate by linking the experimental\nresponses to survey responses on financial distress and to actual credit card\npayment behaviours. We find that the intervention largely increases payments\nmade by less financially-distressed consumers. We are also able to evaluate the\npotential external validity of our experiment and find that hypothetical\nresponses are closely related to consumers' actual credit card payments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 01:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

But the driving mechanism that generates and shapes\nthis feature in lake systems remains unclear. Moreover, the power law itself\nwas found inadequate for fully describing the size distribution of lakes, due\nto deviations at the two ends of size range. Based on observed and simulated\nlakes in 11 hydro-climatic zones of China, we established a conceptual model\nfor lake systems, which covers the whole size range of lake size distribution\nand reveals the underlying driving mechanism. The full lake size distribution\nis composed of three components, with three phases featured by exponential,\nstretched-exponential and power law distribution. The three phases represent\nsystem states with successively increasing degrees of heterogeneity and\norderliness, and more importantly, indicate the dominance of exogenic and\nendogenic forces, respectively. As the dominant driving force changes from\nendogenic to exogenic, a phase transition occurs with lake size distribution\nshifted from power law to stretched-exponential and further to exponential\ndistribution. Apart from compressing the power law phase, exogenic force also\nincreases its scaling exponent, driving the corresponding lake size power\nspectrum into the regime of blue noise. During this process, the\nautocorrelation function of the lake system diverges with a possibility of\ngoing to infinity, indicating the loss of system resilience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 01:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

Therefore, forecasting future poses based on the history of the\nprevious motions is a challenging task. This paper presents an innovative\nauxiliary-memory-powered deep neural network framework for the improved\nmodelling of historical knowledge. Specifically, we disentangle\nsubject-specific, task-specific, and other auxiliary information from the\nobserved pose sequences and utilise these factorised features to query the\nmemory. A novel Multi-Head knowledge retrieval scheme leverages these\nfactorised feature embeddings to perform multiple querying operations over the\nhistorical observations captured within the auxiliary memory. Moreover, our\nproposed dynamic masking strategy makes this feature disentanglement process\ndynamic. Two novel loss functions are introduced to encourage diversity within\nthe auxiliary memory while ensuring the stability of the memory contents, such\nthat it can locate and store salient information that can aid the long-term\nprediction of future motion, irrespective of data imbalances or the diversity\nof the input data distribution. With extensive experiments conducted on two\npublic benchmarks, Human3.6M and CMU-Mocap, we demonstrate that these design\nchoices collectively allow the proposed approach to outperform the current\nstate-of-the-art methods by significant margins: $>$ 17\\% on the Human3.6M\ndataset and $>$ 9\\% on the CMU-Mocap dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 02:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

To improve label efficiency, LATTE constructs highly\ninformative longitudinal silver-standard labels from large-scale unlabeled\npatients to perform unsupervised pre-training and semi-supervised joint\ntraining. Finally, LATTE enhances cross-site portability via contrastive\nrepresentation learning. LATTE is evaluated on three analyses: the onset of\ntype-2 diabetes, heart failure, and the onset and relapses of multiple\nsclerosis. We use various evaluation metrics present in the literature\nincluding the $ABC_{gain}$, the proportion of reduction in the area between the\nobserved event indicator and the predicted cumulative incidences in reference\nto the prediction per incident prevalence. LATTE consistently achieves\nsubstantial improvement over benchmark methods such as SAMGEP and RETAIN in all\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 03:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

Despite these advancements, there has been no systematic and\ncomprehensive evaluation of fusing RGB-D and thermal modalities to date. While\nautonomous driving using LiDAR, radar, RGB, and other sensors has garnered\nsubstantial research interest, along with the fusion of RGB and depth\nmodalities, the integration of thermal cameras and, specifically, the fusion of\nRGB-D and thermal data, has received comparatively less attention. This might\nbe partly due to the limited number of publicly available datasets for such\napplications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of both,\nstate-of-the-art and traditional methods used in fusing RGB-D and thermal\ncamera data for various applications, such as site inspection, human tracking,\nfault detection, and others. The reviewed literature has been categorised into\ntechnical areas, such as 3D reconstruction, segmentation, object detection,\navailable datasets, and other related topics. Following a brief introduction\nand an overview of the methodology, the study delves into calibration and\nregistration techniques, then examines thermal visualisation and 3D\nreconstruction, before discussing the application of classic feature-based\ntechniques as well as modern deep learning approaches. The paper concludes with\na discourse on current limitations and potential future research directions. It\nis hoped that this survey will serve as a valuable reference for researchers\nlooking to familiarise themselves with the latest advancements and contribute\nto the RGB-DT research field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 04:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

Facing such demanding requirements of gaze data\ncollection and annotation, several image synthesis methods were proposed, which\nsuccessfully redirected gaze directions precisely given the assigned\nconditions. However, these methods focused on changing gaze directions of the\nimages that only include eyes or restricted ranges of faces with low resolution\n(less than $128\\times128$) to largely reduce interference from other attributes\nsuch as hairs, which limits application scenarios. To cope with this\nlimitation, we proposed a portable network, called ReDirTrans, achieving\nlatent-to-latent translation for redirecting gaze directions and head\norientations in an interpretable manner. ReDirTrans projects input latent\nvectors into aimed-attribute embeddings only and redirects these embeddings\nwith assigned pitch and yaw values. Then both the initial and edited embeddings\nare projected back (deprojected) to the initial latent space as residuals to\nmodify the input latent vectors by subtraction and addition, representing old\nstatus removal and new status addition. The projection of aimed attributes only\nand subtraction-addition operations for status replacement essentially mitigate\nimpacts on other attributes and the distribution of latent vectors. Thus, by\ncombining ReDirTrans with a pretrained fixed e4e-StyleGAN pair, we created\nReDirTrans-GAN, which enables accurately redirecting gaze in full-face images\nwith $1024\\times1024$ resolution while preserving other attributes such as\nidentity, expression, and hairstyle.

Previous works adopt the conventional\nclassification architecture, which consists of a feature extractor and a\nclassifier. The feature extractor is shared across sequentially arrived tasks\nor classes, but one specific group of weights of the classifier corresponding\nto one new class should be incrementally expanded. Consequently, the parameters\nof a continual learner gradually increase. Moreover, as the classifier contains\nall historical arrived classes, a certain size of the memory is usually\nrequired to store rehearsal data to mitigate classifier bias and catastrophic\nforgetting. In this paper, we propose a non-incremental learner, named\nAttriCLIP, to incrementally extract knowledge of new classes or tasks.\nSpecifically, AttriCLIP is built upon the pre-trained visual-language model\nCLIP. Its image encoder and text encoder are fixed to extract features from\nboth images and text. Text consists of a category name and a fixed number of\nlearnable parameters which are selected from our designed attribute word bank\nand serve as attributes. As we compute the visual and textual similarity for\nclassification, AttriCLIP is a non-incremental learner. The attribute prompts,\nwhich encode the common knowledge useful for classification, can effectively\nmitigate the catastrophic forgetting and avoid constructing a replay memory. We\nevaluate our AttriCLIP and compare it with CLIP-based and previous\nstate-of-the-art continual learning methods in realistic settings with\ndomain-shift and long-sequence learning.

Existing\nmethods use coarse-grained feedback (e.g., whether the answer is correct) to\nimprove factual consistency. In this work, we propose RCoT (Reversing\nChain-of-Thought), a novel method to improve LLMs' reasoning abilities by\nautomatically detecting and rectifying factual inconsistency in LLMs' generated\nsolutions. To detect factual inconsistency, RCoT first asks LLMs to reconstruct\nthe problem based on generated solutions. Then fine-grained comparisons between\nthe original problem and the reconstructed problem expose the factual\ninconsistency in the original solutions. To rectify the solution, RCoT\nformulates detected factual inconsistency into fine-grained feedback to guide\nLLMs in revising solutions. Experimental results demonstrate consistent\nimprovements of RCoT over standard CoT across seven arithmetic datasets.\nMoreover, we find that manually written fine-grained feedback can dramatically\nimprove LLMs' reasoning abilities (e.g., ChatGPT reaches 94.6% accuracy on\nGSM8K), encouraging the community to further explore the fine-grained feedback\ngeneration methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 08:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

In\nthis work, we investigate the polarization of optically-pumped alkali-metal\natoms in a millimeter-sized cell heated to $% 150 $ Celsius. We consider two\nextreme boundary conditions: fully depolarizing and nondepolarizing boundaries,\nand we provide an analytical estimation of the polarization difference between\nthem. In the nondepolarizing case, the pump beam's absorption is proportional\nto the average atomic polarization. However, for fully depolarizing walls, the\nabsorption peak may correspond to a polarization minimum. To mitigate the wall\neffect, we propose reducing the pump beam's diameter while maintaining the pump\npower to prevent illumination of the cell wall and increase the pump intensity\nin the central area. This is crucial for compact vapor-cell devices where the\nlaser frequency can not be detuned since it is locked to the absorption peaks.\nAdditionally, we analyze the wall-depolarizing effect on the performance of an\nalkali-metal atomic magnetometer operating in the spin-exchange relaxation-free\nregime.

To address these two challenges, we first propose a unified\ntopic encoder, which jointly discovers latent topics from the document and\nvarious kinds of side information.

Existing studies mostly adopt a single\nencoder architecture with partially noising processes for conditional text\ngeneration, but its degree of flexibility for conditional modeling is limited.\nIn fact, the encoder-decoder architecture is naturally more flexible for its\ndetachable encoder and decoder modules, which is extensible to multilingual and\nmultimodal generation tasks for conditions and target texts. However, the\nencoding process of conditional texts lacks the understanding of target texts.\nTo this end, a spiral interaction architecture for encoder-decoder text\ndiffusion (DiffuSIA) is proposed. Concretely, the conditional information from\nencoder is designed to be captured by the diffusion decoder, while the target\ninformation from decoder is designed to be captured by the conditional encoder.\nThese two types of information flow run through multilayer interaction spirally\nfor deep fusion and understanding. DiffuSIA is evaluated on four text\ngeneration tasks, including paraphrase, text simplification, question\ngeneration, and open-domain dialogue generation. Experimental results show that\nDiffuSIA achieves competitive performance among previous methods on all four\ntasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization ability of the\nproposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 08:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

These models may not fully satisfy user need, as normal users or\nartists intend to control the synthesized images with specific guidance, like\noverall layout, color, structure, object shape, and so on. To adapt diffusion\nmodels for controllable image synthesis, several methods have been proposed to\nincorporate the required conditions as regularization upon the intermediate\nfeatures of the diffusion denoising network. These methods, known as\nearly-constraint ones in this paper, have difficulties in handling multiple\nconditions with a single solution. They intend to train separate models for\neach specific condition, which require much training cost and result in\nnon-generalizable solutions. To address these difficulties, we propose a new\napproach namely late-constraint: we leave the diffusion networks unchanged, but\nconstrain its output to be aligned with the required conditions. Specifically,\nwe train a lightweight condition adapter to establish the correlation between\nexternal conditions and internal representations of diffusion models. During\nthe iterative denoising process, the conditional guidance is sent into\ncorresponding condition adapter to manipulate the sampling process with the\nestablished correlation. We further equip the introduced late-constraint\nstrategy with a timestep resampling method and an early stopping technique,\nwhich boost the quality of synthesized image meanwhile complying with the\nguidance.

The\nstate-of-the-art 3DMM-based method, directly regresses the model's\ncoefficients, underutilizing the low-level 2D spatial and semantic information,\nwhich can actually offer cues for face shape and orientation. In this work, we\ndemonstrate how modeling 3D facial geometry in image and model space jointly\ncan solve the occlusion and view angle problems. Instead of predicting the\nwhole face directly, we regress image space features in the visible facial\nregion by dense prediction first. Subsequently, we predict our model's\ncoefficients based on the regressed feature of the visible regions, leveraging\nthe prior knowledge of whole face geometry from the morphable models to\ncomplete the invisible regions.

However, the type of information posted significantly varies across\ndisasters depending on several factors like the location, type, severity, etc.\nVerification of the effectiveness of disaster summarization approaches still\nsuffer due to the lack of availability of good spectrum of datasets along with\nthe ground-truth summary. Existing approaches for ground-truth summary\ngeneration (ground-truth for extractive summarization) relies on the wisdom and\nintuition of the annotators.

Recent in-context learning paradigm\nalleviates these issues, but the limited context length only allows for a few\nshots of demonstrations, leading to suboptimal understandings of the tools.\nMoreover, when there are numerous tools to choose from, in-context learning\ncould completely fail to work. In this paper, we propose an alternative\napproach, $\\textbf{ToolkenGPT}$, which combines the benefits of both sides. Our\napproach represents each $\\underline{tool}$ as a to$\\underline{ken}$\n($\\textit{toolken}$) and learns an embedding for it, enabling tool calls in the\nsame way as generating a regular word token. Once a toolken is triggered, the\nLLM is prompted to complete arguments for the tool to execute. ToolkenGPT\noffers the flexibility to plug in an arbitrary number of tools by expanding the\nset of toolkens on the fly. In addition, it improves tool use by allowing\nextensive demonstration data for learning the toolken embeddings. In diverse\ndomains, including numerical reasoning, knowledge-based question answering, and\nembodied plan generation, our approach effectively augments LLMs with tools and\nsubstantially outperforms various latest baselines. ToolkenGPT demonstrates the\npromising ability to use relevant tools from a large tool set in complex\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 09:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

To assess the efficacy of such techniques researchers\ntypically perform controlled experiments. Conducting these experiments,\nhowever, is particularly challenging given the complexity of the space of\nvariables involved, from specialized and intricate architectures and algorithms\nto a large number of training hyper-parameters and choices of evolving\ndatasets, all compounded by how rapidly the machine learning technology is\nadvancing, and the inherent sources of randomness in the training process.

Our\nstudy reveals that most of the experiments, including those that have received\nACM artifact badges, have fundamental limitations that raise doubts about the\nreliability of their findings. More specifically, we find: weak analyses to\ndetermine that there is a true relationship between independent and dependent\nvariables (87% of the experiments); limited control over the space of DNN\nrelevant variables, which can render a relationship between dependent variables\nand treatments that may not be causal but rather correlational (100% of the\nexperiments); and lack of specificity in terms of what are the DNN variables\nand their values utilized in the experiments (86% of the experiments) to define\nthe treatments being applied, which makes it unclear whether the techniques\ndesigned are the ones being assessed, or how the sources of extraneous\nvariation are controlled.

First, the knowledge is neither editable nor\nscalable once the model is trained, which is especially problematic in that\nknowledge is consistently evolving.

However, there is a growing interest in exploring the potential of\nthese models for more diverse reference-based image manipulation tasks that\nrequire spatial understanding and visual context. Previous approaches have\nachieved this by incorporating additional control modules or fine-tuning the\ngenerative models specifically for each task until convergence. In this paper,\nwe propose a different perspective. We conjecture that current large-scale T2I\ngenerative models already possess the capability to perform these tasks but are\nnot fully activated within the standard generation process. To unlock these\ncapabilities, we introduce a unified Prompt-Guided In-Context inpainting (PGIC)\nframework, which leverages large-scale T2I models to re-formulate and solve\nreference-guided image manipulations. In the PGIC framework, the reference and\nmasked target are stitched together as a new input for the generative models,\nenabling the filling of masked regions as producing final results. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that the self-attention modules in T2I models are well-suited\nfor establishing spatial correlations and efficiently addressing challenging\nreference-guided manipulations. These large T2I models can be effectively\ndriven by task-specific prompts with minimal training cost or even with frozen\nbackbones. We synthetically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed PGIC\nframework across various tasks, including reference-guided image inpainting,\nfaithful inpainting, outpainting, local super-resolution, and novel view\nsynthesis. Our results show that PGIC achieves significantly better performance\nwhile requiring less computation compared to other fine-tuning based\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 10:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

Hence, we propose a level set\nalignment loss to evaluate the parallelism of level sets, which can be\nminimized to achieve better gradient consistency. Our novelty lies in that we\ncan align all level sets to the zero level set by constraining gradients at\nqueries and their projections on the zero level set in an adaptive way.

However, they frequently exhibit unfair behaviors in\nsensitive application domains, raising severe fairness concerns. To evaluate\nand test fairness, engineers often generate individual discriminatory instances\nto expose unfair behaviors before model deployment. However, existing baselines\nignore the naturalness of generation and produce instances that deviate from\nthe real data distribution, which may fail to reveal the actual model fairness\nsince these unnatural discriminatory instances are unlikely to appear in\npractice. To address the problem, this paper proposes a framework named Latent\nImitator (LIMI) to generate more natural individual discriminatory instances\nwith the help of a generative adversarial network (GAN), where we imitate the\ndecision boundary of the target model in the semantic latent space of GAN and\nfurther samples latent instances on it. Specifically, we first derive a\nsurrogate linear boundary to coarsely approximate the decision boundary of the\ntarget model, which reflects the nature of the original data distribution.\nSubsequently, to obtain more natural instances, we manipulate random latent\nvectors to the surrogate boundary with a one-step movement, and further conduct\nvector calculation to probe two potential discriminatory candidates that may be\nmore closely located in the real decision boundary. Extensive experiments on\nvarious datasets demonstrate that our LIMI outperforms other baselines largely\nin effectiveness ($\\times$9.42 instances), efficiency ($\\times$8.71 speeds),\nand naturalness (+19.65%) on average.

The existence of truly isolated stars\nmay efficiently probe the possibility that individual massive stars can be born\nin isolation. Aims: We observed WR67a (hereafter Sapaki), an O3If* star that\nappears to be isolated close to the center of a well-developed giant cavity\nthat is aptly traced by 8.0 $\\mu$m hot dust emission. Methods: We acquired\nmedium-resolution ($R=4100$) and moderate signal-to-noise ($S/N = 95$ at 4500\n\\r{A}) spectra for Sapaki in the range of 3800-10500 \\r{A} with the Magellan\nEchellette (MagE) at Las Campanas Observatory.

Moreover, we measured its radial\nvelocity from several lines in its spectrum. Finally, we analyzed its proper\nmotions from Gaia to examine its possible runaway status. Results: The star has\nbeen classified as having the spectral type O3If* given its resemblance to\nstandard examples of the class. In addition, we found that Sapaki is highly\nobscured, reaching a line-of-sight extinction value of $A_{V} = 7.87$. We\nestimated the heliocentric distance to be in the range of $d = 4-7$ kpc.

Furthermore,\nby analyzing proper motions and parallaxes provided by Gaia, we found only one\nother star with compatible measurements.

Our technique is based on directly modifying the pixel values in\nthe patch which gives higher flexibility and larger space to incorporate\nmultiple transformations compared to the GAN-based techniques. Furthermore,\nmost clothing-based physical attacks assume static objects and ignore the\npossible transformations caused by non-rigid deformation due to changes in a\nperson's pose.

However, such impressive capability typically\ncomes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in\nboth the deployment, inference, and training stages. With LLM being a\ngeneral-purpose task solver, we explore its compression in a task-agnostic\nmanner, which aims to preserve the multi-task solving and language generation\nability of the original LLM. One challenge to achieving this is the enormous\nsize of the training corpus of LLM, which makes both data transfer and model\npost-training over-burdensome. Thus, we tackle the compression of LLMs within\nthe bound of two constraints: being task-agnostic and minimizing the reliance\non the original training dataset. Our method, named LLM-Pruner, adopts\nstructural pruning that selectively removes non-critical coupled structures\nbased on gradient information, maximally preserving the majority of the LLM's\nfunctionality. To this end, the performance of pruned models can be efficiently\nrecovered through tuning techniques, LoRA, in merely 3 hours, requiring only\n50K data. We validate the LLM-Pruner on three LLMs, including LLaMA, Vicuna,\nand ChatGLM, and demonstrate that the compressed models still exhibit\nsatisfactory capabilities in zero-shot classification and generation.

As in\nthat paper, our approach applies to (polynomial) lattice point sets, but also\nto digital nets (we are currently not aware of any approach which allows one to\napply the fast method from the aforementioned paper of Dick, Kuo, Le Gia, and\nSchwab to digital nets).\n  Our method does not use FFT, instead we use repeated values in the quadrature\npoints to derive a reduction in the computation time. This arises from the\nreduced CBC construction of lattice rules and polynomial lattice rules. The\nreduced CBC construction has been shown to reduce the computation time for the\nCBC construction. Here we show that it can also be used to also reduce the\ncomputation time of the QMC rule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 12:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

Using a dataset describing actions\nperformed by fictional characters interacting with machine vision technologies\nin 500 artworks, movies, novels and videogames, I trained a simple machine\nlearning algorithm (using the kNN algorithm in R) to predict whether or not an\naction was active or passive using only information about the fictional\ncharacters. Predictable actions were generally unemotional and unambiguous\nactivities where machine vision technologies were treated as simple tools.\nUnpredictable actions, that is, actions that the algorithm could not correctly\npredict, were more ambivalent and emotionally loaded, with more complex power\nrelationships between characters and technologies. The results thus support\nMunk et al.'s theory that failed predictions can be productively used to\nidentify rich cases for qualitative analysis.

However, complex urban\nscenarios, limited situational awareness, and network delay increase the\ncognitive workload of human operators and degrade teleoperation performance. To\naddress this, the successive reference pose tracking (SRPT) approach was\nintroduced in earlier work, which transmits successive reference poses to the\nremote vehicle instead of steering commands. The operator generates reference\nposes online with the help of a joystick steering and an augmented display,\npotentially mitigating the detrimental effects of delays. However, it is not\nclear which minimal set of sensors is essential for the SRPT vehicle\nteleoperation control loop.\n  This paper tests the robustness of the SRPT approach in the presence of state\nestimation inaccuracies, environmental disturbances, and measurement noises.\nThe simulation environment, implemented in Simulink, features a 14-dof vehicle\nmodel and incorporates difficult maneuvers such as tight corners, double-lane\nchanges, and slalom. Environmental disturbances include low adhesion track\nregions and strong cross-wind gusts. The results demonstrate that the SRPT\napproach, using either estimated or actual states, performs similarly under\nvarious worst-case scenarios, even without a position sensor requirement.\nAdditionally, the designed state estimator ensures sufficient performance with\njust an inertial measurement unit, wheel speed encoder, and steer encoder,\nconstituting a minimal set of essential sensors for the SRPT vehicle\nteleoperation control loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 13:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

In this paper, We determine $ex(n, P_9 \\bigcup\nP_7)$ for all $n\\geq 16$ and characterize all extremal graphs, which partially\nconfirms a conjecture proposed by Yuan and Zhang [L.T. Yuan, X.D. Zhang, J.\nGraph. Theory 98(3) (2021) 499--524]. And we determine the Tur\\'an numbers of\n$\\bigcup\\limits _{i=1}^{k_1} P_{\\ell _i} \\bigcup\\limits _{j=1}^{k_2} S_{a _j}$\nfor $n$ appropriately large, where $a_j\\leq 2k_2+2 \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{k_1}\n\\lfloor\\frac{\\ell_i}{2}\\rfloor-2j$ for any $j\\in [k_2]$, which generalizes the\nresults of Fang and Yuan. The corresponding extremal graphs are also completely\ncharacterized\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 13:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

Due to its non-parametric\nand recursive nature, calculating the probability of each individual being\nselected by lexicase selection has been proven to be an NP-hard problem, which\ndiscourages deeper theoretical understanding and practical improvements to the\nalgorithm. In this work, we introduce probabilistic lexicase selection\n(plexicase selection), a novel parent selection algorithm that efficiently\napproximates the probability distribution of lexicase selection. Our method not\nonly demonstrates superior problem-solving capabilities as a semantic-aware\nselection method, but also benefits from having a probabilistic representation\nof the selection process for enhanced efficiency and flexibility. Experiments\nare conducted in two prevalent domains in genetic programming: program\nsynthesis and symbolic regression, using standard benchmarks including PSB and\nSRBench. The empirical results show that plexicase selection achieves\nstate-of-the-art problem-solving performance that is competitive to the\nlexicase selection, and significantly outperforms lexicase selection in\ncomputation efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 13:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

A puzzling\nfeature of the solar corona, besides the heating, is its EUV filamentary\nstructure and variability. We aim to identify observable features of the TNE-TI\nscenario underlying coronal rain at small and large spatial scales, to\nunderstand the role it plays in the solar corona. We use EUV datasets at\nunprecedented spatial resolution of ~240 km from EUI/HRIEUV and SPICE of Solar\nOrbiter from the spring 2022 perihelion. EUV absorption features produced by\ncoronal rain are detected at scales as small as 260 km. As the rain falls,\nheating and compression is produced immediately downstream, leading to a small\nEUV brightening accompanying the fall and producing a \"fireball\" phenomenon.\nJust prior to impact, a flash-like EUV brightening downstream of the rain,\nlasting a few minutes is observed for the fastest events. For the first time,\nwe detect the atmospheric response to the rain's impact on the chromosphere and\nconsists of upward propagating rebound shocks and flows partly reheating the\nloop. The observed widths of the rain clumps are 500 +- 200 km. They exhibit a\nbroad velocity distribution of 10 - 150 km s^-1, peaking below 50 km s^-1.\nCoronal strands of similar widths are observed along the same loops co-spatial\nwith cool filamentary structure, which we interpret as the CCTR. Matching with\nthe expected cooling, prior to the rain appearance sequential loop brightenings\nare detected in gradually cooler lines from corona to chromospheric\ntemperatures. Despite the large rain showers, most cannot be detected in AIA\n171 in quadrature, indicating that LOS effects play a major role in coronal\nrain visibility. Still, AIA 304 and SPICE observations reveal that only a small\nfraction of the rain can be captured by HRIEUV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 14:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

However, expert surgeons are often overloaded with clinical and\nacademic workloads and limit their time in answering. For this purpose, we\ndevelop a surgical question-answering system to facilitate robot-assisted\nsurgical scene and activity understanding from recorded videos. Most of the\nexisting VQA methods require an object detector and regions based feature\nextractor to extract visual features and fuse them with the embedded text of\nthe question for answer generation. However, (1) surgical object detection\nmodel is scarce due to smaller datasets and lack of bounding box annotation;\n(2) current fusion strategy of heterogeneous modalities like text and image is\nnaive; (3) the localized answering is missing, which is crucial in complex\nsurgical scenarios. In this paper, we propose Visual Question\nLocalized-Answering in Robotic Surgery (Surgical-VQLA) to localize the specific\nsurgical area during the answer prediction. To deal with the fusion of the\nheterogeneous modalities, we design gated vision-language embedding (GVLE) to\nbuild input patches for the Language Vision Transformer (LViT) to predict the\nanswer. To get localization, we add the detection head in parallel with the\nprediction head of the LViT. We also integrate GIoU loss to boost localization\nperformance by preserving the accuracy of the question-answering model. We\nannotate two datasets of VQLA by utilizing publicly available surgical videos\nfrom MICCAI challenges EndoVis-17 and 18. Our validation results suggest that\nSurgical-VQLA can better understand the surgical scene and localize the\nspecific area related to the question-answering. GVLE presents an efficient\nlanguage-vision embedding technique by showing superior performance over the\nexisting benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 14:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

The bipolaron model has traditionally\nbeen the dominant attempt to explain the electronic structure of PEDOT. Though\nrecent theoretical studies have begun to move away from this model, some\naspects remain commonplace, such as the concepts of bipolarons or polaron\npairs. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the\nelectronic structure of undoped and AlCl4- doped PEDOT oligomers. By\nconsidering the influence of oligomer length, oxidation or doping level and\nspin state, we find no evidence for self-localisation of positive charges in\nPEDOT as predicted by the bipolaron model. Instead, we find that a single or\ntwin peak structural distortion can occur at any oxidation or doping level.\nRather than representing bipolarons or polaron pairs, these are electron\ndistributions driven by a range of factors, which also disproves the concept of\npolaron pairs. Localisation of distortions does occur in the doped case,\nalthough distortions can span an arbitrary number of nearby anions.\nFurthermore, conductivity in conducting polymers has been experimentally\nobserved to reduce at very high doping levels. We show that at high anion\nconcentrations, the non-bonding orbitals of the anions cluster below the\nHOMO-LUMO gap and begin to mix into the HOMO of the overall system.

Typically, this is done with linear spherical harmonics (SH)\nbeamforming. In this paper, we explore deep-learning-based source separation on\nstatic Ambisonics mixtures. In contrast to most source separation approaches,\nwhich separate a fixed number of sources of specific sound types, we focus on\nseparating arbitrary sound from specific directions. Specifically, we propose\nthree operating modes that combine a source separation neural network with SH\nbeamforming: refinement, implicit, and mixed mode. We show that a neural\nnetwork can implicitly associate conditioning directions with the spatial\ninformation contained in the Ambisonics scene to extract specific sources. We\nevaluate the performance of the three proposed approaches and compare them to\nSH beamforming on musical mixtures generated with the musdb18 dataset, as well\nas with mixtures generated with the FUSS dataset for universal source\nseparation, under both anechoic and room conditions.

We observe that\nvanilla training on long-tailed data with cross-entropy loss makes the\ninstance-rich head classes severely squeeze the spatial distribution of the\ntail classes, which leads to difficulty in classifying tail class samples.\nFurthermore, the original cross-entropy loss can only propagate gradient\nshort-lively because the gradient in softmax form rapidly approaches zero as\nthe logit difference increases. This phenomenon is called softmax saturation.\nIt is unfavorable for training on balanced data, but can be utilized to adjust\nthe validity of the samples in long-tailed data, thereby solving the distorted\nembedding space of long-tailed problems. To this end, this paper proposes the\nGaussian clouded logit adjustment by Gaussian perturbation of different class\nlogits with varied amplitude. We define the amplitude of perturbation as cloud\nsize and set relatively large cloud sizes to tail classes. The large cloud size\ncan reduce the softmax saturation and thereby making tail class samples more\nactive as well as enlarging the embedding space.

We first generalize the\nstandard voting model to capture this public-spirited voting behavior.

Quantum classical circuits, a key type of quantum\ncircuits, have been previously studied with the aim of enhancing reliability by\nreusing ancilla-qubits and employing a variety of strategies to optimize the\nsize and depth of the circuit.

In\naddition, DC can deliver reliable output for quantum classical circuits of any\ndepth on any NISQ system.

Despite this, the origins of these fields remain unresolved, with\nleading propositions advocating fossil fields, mergers, and shear-driven\ndynamos as the main mechanism. A potential key for further insight could lie in\nthe connection with binarity: notably, magnetism can play a role in the\nlong-term orbital and rotational dynamics of binaries. In gravitational wave\nastronomy, the advanced sensitivity of upcoming detectors such as LISA and the\nEinstein Telescope will enable the characterisation of the orbital inspirals of\ncompact systems, including their magnetic properties. A comprehensive\nunderstanding of the dynamics of magnetism in these systems is required for the\ninterpretation of the gravitational wave signals and to avoid calibration\nbiases. Furthermore, this knowledge can be used to create new magnetic\npopulation models and to provide insight into the nature of their internal\nfields. The aim of this study is to investigate the secular spin precession\ndynamics of binary systems under pure magnetic dipole interactions, focusing on\nstars with strong, stable, dipolar fields. We employ an orbit-averaging\nprocedure for the spin equations and obtain an effective secular description.\nBy minimising the magnetic energy, we derive the configurations of equilibrium.\nWe show that among the four states, only one is stable, consisting of the spin\nand magnetic axes of one star reversed with respect to the companions', and\northogonal to the orbital plane. Our long-term stability results disagree with\nusual methods, which tend to neglect orbital motion. Finally, we provide\nanalytical solutions for the system out of equilibrium, which can be used to\nderive secular orbital evolution in the context of gravitational wave\nastronomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 12:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}
