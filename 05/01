This paper presents a survey on recent advances and\nfuture prospects on interpretability of ML, with several application examples\npertinent to multimedia computing, including text-image cross-modal\nrepresentation learning, face recognition, and the recognition of objects.

As a key driver,\nmillimeterwave (mmWave) communication largely boosts speed, capacities, and\nconnectivity. In order to maximize the potential of mmWave communication,\nprecise and fast beam acquisition (BA) is crucial, since it compensates for a\nhigh pathloss and provides a large beamforming gain. Practically, the\nangle-of-departure (AoD) remains almost constant over numerous consecutive time\nslots, the backscatter signal experiences some delay, and the hardware is\nrestricted under the peak power constraint. This work captures these main\nfeatures by a simple binary beam-pointing (BBP) channel model with in-block\nmemory (iBM) [1], peak cost constraint, and one unit-delayed feedback. In\nparticular, we focus on the sensing capabilities of such a model and\ncharacterize the performance of the BA process in terms of the Hamming\ndistortion of the estimated channel state. We encode the position of the AoD\nand derive the minimum distortion of the BBP channel under the peak cost\nconstraint with no communication constraint. Our previous work [2] proposed a\njoint communication and sensing (JCAS) algorithm, which achieves the capacity\nof the same channel model.

However, operations on logical qubits are\nonly performed through universal gate sets consisting of finite-sized gates\nsuch as Clifford+T. Although these logical gate sets allow for universal\nquantum computation, the finite gate sizes present a problem for quantum\nsensing, since in sensing protocols, such as the Ramsey measurement protocol,\nthe signal must act continuously. The difficulty in constructing a continuous\nlogical operator comes from the Eastin-Knill theorem, which prevents a\ncontinuous signal from being both fault tolerant to local errors and\ntransverse. Since error correction is needed to approach the Heisenberg Limit\nin a noisy environment, it is important to explore how to construct\nfault-tolerant continuous operators. In this paper, a protocol to design\ncontinuous logical z-rotations is proposed and applied to the Steane Code. The\nfault tolerance of the designed operator is investigated using the\nKnill-Laflamme conditions. The Knill-Laflamme conditions indicate that the\ndiagonal unitary operator constructed cannot be fault tolerant solely due to\nthe possibilities of X errors on the middle qubit. The approach demonstrated\nthroughout this paper may, however, find success in codes with more qubits such\nas the Shor code, distance 3 surface code, [15,1,3] code, or codes with a\nlarger distance such as the [11,1,5] code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2023 18:22:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 23:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

Atomic filters come in two flavors: a filter\nbased on the absorption of light by the Doppler broadened atomic vapor, i.e., a\nnotch filter, and a bandpass filter based on the transmission of resonant light\ncaused by the Faraday effect. The notch filter uses the absorption of resonant\nphotons to filter out a small spectral band around the atomic transition. The\noff-resonant part of the spectrum is fully transmitted. Atomic vapors based on\nthe Faraday effect allow for suppression of the detuned spectral fraction.\nTransmission of light originates from the magnetically induced rotation of\nlinear polarized light close to an atomic resonance. This filter constellation\nallows selective acceptance of specific light frequencies. In this manuscript,\nwe discuss these two types of filters and elucidate the specialties of atomic\nline filters.

We particularly focus on the impact of bipolar active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) jet feedback as implemented in SIMBA, which quenches galaxies and\nhas a dramatic effect on large-scale gas properties. We show that jet feedback\nat low redshifts is most common in the stellar mass range $(1-5)\\times\n10^{10}M_\\odot$, so we focus on galaxies with active jets in this mass range.\nIn comparison to runs without jet feedback, jets cause lower densities and\nhigher temperatures along the galaxy minor axis (SIMBA jet direction) at radii\n>=$0.5r_{200c}-4r_{200c}$ and beyond. This effect is less apparent at higher or\nlower stellar masses, and is strongest within green valley galaxies.

Finally, we explore\nanisotropy in the bulk radial motion of the gas, finding that both star\nformation and AGN wind feedback contribute to pushing the gas outwards along\nthe minor axis at <=1 Mpc, but AGN jet feedback further causes bulk outflow\nalong the minor axis out to several Mpc, which drives quenching via gas\nstarvation.

However, the success of vision transformers largely owes to their\ncapacity to accommodate numerous parameters. As a result, new challenges for\nadapting large models to downstream tasks arise. On the one hand, classic\nfine-tuning tunes all parameters in a huge model for every task and thus easily\nfalls into overfitting, leading to inferior performance. On the other hand, on\nresource-limited devices, fine-tuning stores a full copy of parameters and thus\nis usually impracticable for the shortage of storage space. However, few works\nhave focused on how to efficiently and effectively transfer knowledge in a\nvision transformer. Existing methods did not dive into the properties of visual\nfeatures, leading to inferior performance. Moreover, some of them bring heavy\ninference cost though benefiting storage. To tackle these problems, we propose\nconsolidator to modify the pre-trained model with the addition of a small set\nof tunable parameters to temporarily store the task-specific knowledge while\nfreezing the backbone model. Motivated by the success of group-wise\nconvolution, we adopt grouped connections across the features extracted by\nfully connected layers to construct tunable parts in a consolidator.

We demonstrate that the expectation values of entropy\nflow, heat, and work can all be determined via Hermitian observables of the\ninitial state. These Hermitian operators encapsulate the breadth of behavior\nand the ideal inputs for common thermodynamic objectives. We show how to\nconstruct these Hermitian operators from measurements of thermodynamic output\nfrom a finite number of effectively arbitrary inputs. Behavior of a small\nnumber of test inputs thus determines the full range of thermodynamic behavior\nfrom all inputs. For any process, entropy flow, heat, and work can all be\nextremized by pure input states -- eigenstates of the respective operators. In\ncontrast, the input states that minimize entropy production or maximize the\nchange in free energy are non-pure mixed states obtained from the operators as\nthe solution of a convex optimization problem. To attain these, we provide an\neasily implementable gradient descent method on the manifold of density\nmatrices, where an analytic solution yields a valid direction of descent at\neach iterative step. Ideal inputs within a limited domain, and their associated\nthermodynamic operators, are obtained with less effort. This allows analysis of\nideal thermodynamic inputs within quantum subspaces of infinite-dimensional\nquantum systems; it also allows analysis of ideal inputs in the classical\nlimit.

A range of quantum\nerror mitigation techniques has been proposed to address this issue. Zero-noise\nextrapolation (ZNE) stands out as a promising one. ZNE involves increasing the\nnoise levels in a circuit and then using extrapolation to infer the zero noise\ncase from the noisy results obtained. This paper presents a novel ZNE approach\nthat does not require circuit folding or noise scaling to mitigate depolarizing\nand/or decoherence noise.\n  To mitigate depolarizing noise, we propose leveraging the extreme/infinite\nnoisy case, which allows us to avoid circuit folding. Specifically, the circuit\noutput with extreme noise becomes the maximally mixed state. We show that using\ncircuit-reliability metrics, simple linear extrapolation can effectively\nmitigate depolarizing noise. With decoherence noise, different states decay\ninto the all-zero state at a rate that depends on the number of excited states\nand time. Therefore, we propose a state- and latency-aware exponential\nextrapolation that does not involve folding or scaling. When dealing with a\nquantum system affected by both decoherence and depolarizing noise, we propose\nto use our two mitigation techniques in sequence: first applying decoherence\nerror mitigation, followed by depolarizing error mitigation.\n  A common limitation of ZNE schemes is that if the circuit of interest suffers\nfrom high noise, scaling-up noise levels could not provide useful data for\nextrapolation. We propose using circuit-cut techniques to break a large quantum\ncircuit into smaller sub-circuits to overcome this limitation. This way, the\nnoise levels of the sub-circuits are lower than the original circuit, and ZNE\ncan become more effective in mitigating their noises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 01:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Similar exchanges about the role of\np-values have occurred with some regularity every 10 to 15 years since their\nformal introduction in statistical practice. The apparent contradiction between\nthe repeated failures in interpretation and continuous use of p-values suggest\nthat there is an inferential value in the computation of these values.

Furthermore, as approaching these FPs, we\ndemonstrate that the spinful fermion-fermion interactions can induce a number\nof favorable instabilities accompanied by certain phase transitions.\nSpecifically, the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH), quantum spin Hall (QSH), and\nnematic (Nem.) site(bond) states are dominant for $\\mathrm{FP}_{1}^{\\pm}$,\n$\\mathrm{FP}_{2}^{\\pm}$, and $\\mathrm{FP}_{3}^{\\pm}$, respectively.

This paper proposes an attention-based\ncontrastive learning framework for skeleton representation learning, called\nSkeAttnCLR, which integrates local similarity and global features for\nskeleton-based action representations. To achieve this, a multi-head attention\nmask module is employed to learn the soft attention mask features from the\nskeletons, suppressing non-salient local features while accentuating local\nsalient features, thereby bringing similar local features closer in the feature\nspace. Additionally, ample contrastive pairs are generated by expanding\ncontrastive pairs based on salient and non-salient features with global\nfeatures, which guide the network to learn the semantic representations of the\nentire skeleton. Therefore, with the attention mask mechanism, SkeAttnCLR\nlearns local features under different data augmentation views.

Flavor mixing for quarks is mediated by the square-root mass eigenstates,\nand the mass ratios used have been derived in earlier work from a left-right\nsymmetric extension of the standard model. This permits a construction of the\nCKM matrix from first principles. There exist only four normed division\nalgebras, they can be listed as follows - the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, the\ncomplex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$, the quaternions $\\mathbb{H}$ and the octonions\n$\\mathbb{O}$.

The main advantage of this\napproach is that the spinor representations of the fundamental fermions can be\nconstructed easily here as the left ideals of the algebra. Also the action of\nvarious Spin Groups on these representations too can be studied easily.

Both experiments and theory of jammed soft\nmaterials have revealed that the complex modulus measured by conventional\nmacrorheology exhibits a characteristic frequency dependence. Microrheology is\na new type of method to obtain the complex modulus, which transforms the\nmicroscopic motion of probes to the complex modulus through the generalized\nStokes relation (GSR). Although microrheology has been applied to jammed soft\nmaterials, its theoretical understanding is limited.

Then, we apply our\nformalism to a numerical model of jammed particles and find that the storage\nand loss modulus follow characteristic scaling laws near the jamming\ntransition. Importantly, the observed scaling law coincides with that in\nmacrorheology, which indicates that the GSR holds even near the jamming\ntransition.

We study this question in a general framework for\ninteractive decision making with multiple agents, encompassing Markov games\nwith function approximation and normal-form games with bandit feedback. We\nfocus on equilibrium computation, in which a centralized learning algorithm\naims to compute an equilibrium by controlling multiple agents that interact\nwith an unknown environment. Our main contributions are:\n  - We provide upper and lower bounds on the optimal sample complexity for\nmulti-agent decision making based on a multi-agent generalization of the\nDecision-Estimation Coefficient, a complexity measure introduced by Foster et\nal. (2021) in the single-agent counterpart to our setting. Compared to the best\nresults for the single-agent setting, our bounds have additional gaps. We show\nthat no \"reasonable\" complexity measure can close these gaps, highlighting a\nstriking separation between single and multiple agents.\n  - We show that characterizing the statistical complexity for multi-agent\ndecision making is equivalent to characterizing the statistical complexity of\nsingle-agent decision making, but with hidden (unobserved) rewards, a framework\nthat subsumes variants of the partial monitoring problem. As a consequence, we\ncharacterize the statistical complexity for hidden-reward interactive decision\nmaking to the best extent possible.\n  Building on this development, we provide several new structural results,\nincluding 1) conditions under which the statistical complexity of multi-agent\ndecision making can be reduced to that of single-agent, and 2) conditions under\nwhich the so-called curse of multiple agents can be avoided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 06:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Thus, we\ndo not vary any parameters to reach a better agreement with the data. The\nresulting cross-sections are compared with data for 20 reactions with the\nproduct of the charge numbers Z_P*Z_T ranging from 216 up to 2576. We discuss\nthe opinion met in the literature that the M3Y NN forces provide a poorer\ndescription of the capture cross-sections in heavy-ion collisions in comparison\nto the NN forces coming from the relativistic mean-field approach. Our\ncalculations show that the M3Y NN forces give an agreement with the data which\nis not perfect yet is not worse than the one resulting from the RMF NN forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 07:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

An event camera reports the change in pixel\nintensity and is analogous to rods. Event and color cameras in computer vision\nare like rods and cones in human vision. Humans can notice objects moving in\nthe peripheral vision (far right and left), but we cannot classify them (think\nof someone passing by on your far left or far right, this can trigger your\nattention without knowing who they are). Thus, rods act as a region proposal\nnetwork (RPN) in human vision. Therefore, an event camera can act as a region\nproposal network in deep learning Two-stage object detectors in deep learning,\nsuch as Mask R-CNN, consist of a backbone for feature extraction and a RPN.\nCurrently, RPN uses the brute force method by trying out all the possible\nbounding boxes to detect an object. This requires much computation time to\ngenerate region proposals making two-stage detectors inconvenient for fast\napplications. This work replaces the RPN in Mask-RCNN of detectron2 with an\nevent camera for generating proposals for moving objects. Thus, saving time and\nbeing computationally less expensive. The proposed approach is faster than the\ntwo-stage detectors with comparable accuracy\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 08:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Federated\nlearning (FL) addresses the former by enabling different medical clients to\ncollaboratively train a deep model without sharing data. However, the class\nimbalance problem persists due to inter-client class distribution variations.\nTo overcome this, we propose federated classifier anchoring (FCA) by adding a\npersonalized classifier at each client to guide and debias the federated model\nthrough consistency learning. Additionally, FCA debiases the federated\nclassifier and each client's personalized classifier based on their respective\nclass distributions, thus mitigating divergence. With FCA, the federated\nfeature extractor effectively learns discriminative features suitably globally\nfor federation as well as locally for all participants. In clinical practice,\nthe federated model is expected to be both generalized, performing well across\nclients, and specialized, benefiting each individual client from collaboration.\nAccording to this, we propose a novel evaluation metric to assess models'\ngeneralization and specialization performance globally on an aggregated public\ntest set and locally at each client. Through comprehensive comparison and\nevaluation, FCA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with large margins for\nfederated long-tailed skin lesion classification and intracranial hemorrhage\nclassification, making it a more feasible solution in clinical settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 09:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Recent conversational recommender systems (CRSs) tackle those\nlimitations by enabling recommender systems to interact with the user to obtain\nher/his current preference through a sequence of clarifying questions. Despite\nthe progress achieved in CRSs, existing solutions are far from satisfaction in\nthe following two aspects: 1) current CRSs usually require each user to answer\na quantity of clarifying questions before reaching the final recommendation,\nwhich harms the user experience; 2) there is a semantic gap between the learned\nrepresentations of explicitly mentioned attributes and items. To address these\ndrawbacks, we introduce the knowledge graph (KG) as the auxiliary information\nfor comprehending and reasoning a user's preference, and propose a new CRS\nframework, namely Knowledge Enhanced Conversational Reasoning (KECR) system. As\na user can reflect her/his preference via both attribute- and item-level\nexpressions, KECR closes the semantic gap between two levels by embedding the\nstructured knowledge in the KG. Meanwhile, KECR utilizes the connectivity\nwithin the KG to conduct explicit reasoning of the user demand, making the\nmodel less dependent on the user's feedback to clarifying questions. KECR can\nfind a prominent reasoning chain to make the recommendation explainable and\nmore rationale, as well as smoothen the conversation process, leading to better\nuser experience and conversational recommendation accuracy.

A PV-based receiver features large signal output, easy optical\nalignment, and self-powered operation. However, PV modules usually have a\nsevere bandwidth limitation when used as passive photodetectors. In this paper,\nwe systematically investigate the internal impedance dynamic of PV modules and\nhow that affects their frequency response characteristics under different\nilluminances. We propose a simplified yet accurate dynamic PV mode AC detection\nmodel to capture the frequency response characteristics of a PVLC receiver. The\nmodel is validated with the impedance spectroscopy characterization\nmethodologies. Experimental results show that a PV module's internal resistance\nand capacitance depend on incident illuminance, affecting PV's frequency\nresponse. The bandwidth is exacerbated under indoor environments with low\nilluminance levels due to the increment of internal resistance for PV modules.\nThe RC constant can be reduced for PVLC receivers working near open-circuit\nvoltage conditions by adding a moderate local light to decrease the internal\nresistance value. For practical implementation, PVLC receivers will employ a\nload for data recovery. We show that adjusting the forward bias conditions can\nsimultaneously reduce the resistance and capacitance values. With the\noptimization of equivalent trans-impedance, the data rate of a Cadmium\ntelluride (CdTe) PV module achieves a 3.8 times enhancement under 200 lux.

First, we show that cooler stars are more\nefficient at converting pebbles into planetary cores at short orbital periods.\nSecond, when disks are massive enough to nucleate a heavy core at 5 AU, more\nthan enough dust can drift in to assemble inner planets, establishing the\ncorrelation between inner planets and outer giants.

In the present work we use a functional renormalisation group (fRG)\napproach for the effective action which includes general scale-dependent\nreparametrisations of the theory [1]. This approach is used in an O(N)-theory\nto set up adaptive RG-flows that correspond to an optimal systematic expansion\nof the theory about the ground state or rather its full covariance or\npropagator. These parametrisations are induced by flowing fields that encode\nthe differential reparametrisation steps.

In support,\nthis study provides an extensive taxonomic review of research on racial bias\nwithin face recognition exploring every aspect and stage of the face\nrecognition processing pipeline. Firstly, we discuss the problem definition of\nracial bias, starting with race definition, grouping strategies, and the\nsocietal implications of using race or race-related groupings. Secondly, we\ndivide the common face recognition processing pipeline into four stages: image\nacquisition, face localisation, face representation, face verification and\nidentification, and review the relevant corresponding literature associated\nwith each stage.

This study proposes a MaaS\nplatform equilibrium model based on many-to-many assignment games incorporating\nboth fixed-route transit services and mobility-on-demand (MOD) services. The\nmatching problem is formulated as a multicommodity flow network design problem\nunder congestion. The local stability conditions reflect a generalization of\nWardrop's principles that include operator decisions. A subsidy mechanism from\nthe platform is proposed to guarantee local stability. An exact solution\nalgorithm is proposed based on a branch and bound framework with a Frank-Wolfe\nalgorithm integrated with Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient optimization,\nwhich guarantees the optimality of the matching problem but not stability. A\nheuristic which integrates stability conditions and subsidy design is proposed,\nwhich reaches either the optimal MaaS platform equilibrium solution with global\nstability, or a feasible locally stable solution that may require subsidy. A\nworst-case bound and condition for obtaining an exact solution are both\nidentified. Two sets of reproducible numerical experiments are conducted. The\nfirst, on a toy network, verifies the model and algorithm, and illustrates the\ndifferences between local and global stability. The second, on an expanded\nSioux Falls network with 82 nodes and 748 links, derives generalizable insights\nabout the model for coopetitive interdependencies between operators sharing the\nplatform, handling congestion effects in MOD services, effects of local\nstability on investment impacts, and illustrating inequities that may arise\nunder heterogeneous populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 13:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

We confirm the observed trends between the obliquity and physical\nquantities directly connected to tides, namely the stellar effective\ntemperature, the planet-to-star mass ratio, and the scaled orbital distance. We\nfurther devised a tidal efficiency factor combining critical parameters that\ncontrol the strength of tidal effects and used it to corroborate the strong\nlink between the spin-orbit angle distribution and tidal interactions. In\nparticular, we developed a readily usable formula to estimate the probability\nthat a system is misaligned, which will prove useful in global population\nstudies.

This\nrealistic distribution maintains the sky-projected trends, and additionally\nhints toward a striking pileup of truly aligned systems. The comparison between\nthe full population and a pristine subsample unaffected by tidal interactions\nsuggests that perpendicular architectures are resilient toward tidal\nrealignment, providing evidence that orbital misalignments are sculpted by\ndisruptive dynamical processes that preferentially lead to polar orbits.

On the\nrepulsive side at strong couplings, theoretical approaches predict two distinct\npolaron branches corresponding to attractive and repulsive polarons, but it\nremains unclear how the two are related. This is partly due to the challenges\nresulting from a competition of strongly attractive (destabilizing)\nimpurity-boson interactions with weakly repulsive (stabilizing) boson-boson\ninteractions, whose interplay is difficult to describe with contemporary\ntheoretical methods. Here we develop a powerful variational framework that\ncombines Gaussian correlations among impurity-boson scattering states,\nincluding up to an infinite number of bosonic excitations, with exact\nnon-Gaussian correlations among bosons occupying an impurity-boson bound state.\nThis variational scheme enables a full treatment of strong nonlinearities\narising in the Feshbach molecule on the repulsive side of the resonance. Within\nthis framework, we demonstrate that the interplay of impurity-induced\ninstability and stabilization by repulsive boson-boson interactions results in\na discrete set of metastable many-body bound states at intermediate energies\nbetween the attractive and repulsive polaron branches. These states exhibit\nstrong quantum statistical characteristics in the form of non-Gaussian quantum\ncorrelations, requiring non-perturbative beyond mean-field treatments for their\ncharacterization. Furthermore, these many-body bound states have sizable\nmolecular spectral weights, accessible via molecular spectroscopy techniques.\nThis work provides a unified theory of attractive and repulsive Bose polarons\non the repulsive side of the Feshbach resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 14:05:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 15:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

In these games, agents select available resources and their utility\nthen depends on the number of agents using the same resources. This implies\nthat there is no distinction between the agents, i.e., they are anonymous.\n  We depart from this very general setting by proposing Resource Selection\nGames with heterogeneous agents that strive for joint resource usage with\nsimilar agents. So, instead of the number of other users of a given resource,\nour model considers agents with different types and the decisive feature is the\nfraction of same-type agents among the users. More precisely, similarly to\nSchelling Games, there is a tolerance threshold $\\tau \\in [0,1]$ which\nspecifies the agents' desired minimum fraction of same-type agents on a\nresource. Agents strive to select resources where at least a $\\tau$-fraction of\nthose resources' users have the same type as themselves. For $\\tau=1$, our\nmodel generalizes Hedonic Diversity Games with a peak at $1$.\n  For our general model, we consider the existence and quality of equilibria\nand the complexity of maximizing social welfare. Additionally, we consider a\nbounded rationality model, where agents can only estimate the utility of a\nresource, since they only know the fraction of same-type agents on a given\nresource, but not the exact numbers. Thus, they cannot know the impact a\nstrategy change would have on a target resource. Interestingly, we show that\nthis type of bounded rationality yields favorable game-theoretic properties and\nspecific equilibria closely approximate equilibria of the full knowledge\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 14:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

RCTs are limited to a small number of\ncomparator arms and often compare a new therapeutic to a standard of care which\nhas already proven efficacious. It is sometimes of interest to estimate the\nefficacy of the new therapy relative to a treatment that was not evaluated in\nthe same trial, such as a placebo or an alternative therapy that was evaluated\nin a different trial. Such multi-study comparisons are challenging because of\npotential differences between trial populations that can affect the outcome. In\nthis paper, two bridging estimators are considered that allow for comparisons\nof treatments evaluated in different trials using data fusion methods to\naccount for measured differences in trial populations. A \"multi-span''\nestimator leverages a shared arm between two trials, while a \"single-span''\nestimator does not require a shared arm. A diagnostic statistic that compares\nthe outcome in the standardized shared arms is provided. The two estimators are\ncompared in simulations, where both estimators demonstrate minimal empirical\nbias and nominal confidence interval coverage when the identification\nassumptions are met. The estimators are applied to data from the AIDS Clinical\nTrials Group 320 and 388 to compare the efficacy of two-drug versus four-drug\nantiretroviral therapy on CD4 cell counts among persons with advanced HIV. The\nsingle-span approach requires fewer identification assumptions and was more\nefficient in simulations and the application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 14:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Such data suffers from presentation bias. Much work in\nunbiased learning to rank (ULTR) focuses on position bias, i.e., items at\nhigher ranks are more likely to be examined and clicked. Inter-item\ndependencies also influence examination probabilities, with outlier items in a\nranking as an important example. Outliers are defined as items that observably\ndeviate from the rest and therefore stand out in the ranking. In this paper, we\nidentify and introduce the bias brought about by outlier items: users tend to\nclick more on outlier items and their close neighbors. To this end, we first\nconduct a controlled experiment to study the effect of outliers on user clicks.\nNext, to examine whether the findings from our controlled experiment generalize\nto naturalistic situations, we explore real-world click logs from an e-commerce\nplatform. We show that, in both scenarios, users tend to click significantly\nmore on outlier items than on non-outlier items in the same rankings. We show\nthat this tendency holds for all positions, i.e., for any specific position, an\nitem receives more interactions when presented as an outlier as opposed to a\nnon-outlier item. We conclude from our analysis that the effect of outliers on\nclicks is a type of bias that should be addressed in ULTR. We therefore propose\nan outlier-aware click model that accounts for both outlier and position bias,\ncalled outlier-aware position-based model ( OPBM). We estimate click\npropensities based on OPBM ; through extensive experiments performed on both\nreal-world e-commerce data and semi-synthetic data, we verify the effectiveness\nof our outlier-aware click model. Our results show the superiority of OPBM\nagainst baselines in terms of ranking performance and true relevance\nestimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 14:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

We aim to constrain the disk regions where these processes\nare fully coupled, and develop a flexible modelling approach that is able to\npredict the effects of these processes acting simultaneously on the CHNOS\nbudgets of the dust in these regions. We compared timescales associated with\nthese disk processes to constrain the disk regions where this approach is\nnecessary, and developed the SHAMPOO code, which tracks the CHNOS abundances in\nthe ice mantle of a single monomer dust particle, embedded in a larger\naggregate and undergoing these processes simultaneously. The adsorption and\nphotodesorption of monomer ices depend on the depth of the monomer in the\naggregate. We investigated the effect of fragmentation velocity and aggregate\nfilling factor on the amount of ice on monomers residing at r = 10 AU. The\nlocations where disk processes are fully coupled depend on both grain size and\nice species. Monomers embedded in aggregates with fragmentation velocities of 1\nm/s are able to undergo adsorption and photodesorption more often compared to a\nfragmentation velocity of 5 m/s or 10 m/s. Aggregates with a filling factor of\n$10^{-3}$ are able to accumulate ice 22 times faster on average than aggregates\nwith a filling factor of 1. As different grain sizes are coupled through\ncollisions and the grain ice consists of multiple ice species, it is difficult\nto isolate the locations where disk processes are fully coupled, necessitating\nthe development of the SHAMPOO code.

In this work, we show that the state-of-the-art density ratio\nestimators perform poorly on well-separated cases and demonstrate that this is\ndue to distribution shifts between training and evaluation time.

Specifically, DP-FedSAM integrates\nSharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer to generate local flatness models\nwith improved stability and weight perturbation robustness, which results in\nthe small norm of local updates and robustness to DP noise, thereby improving\nthe performance. To further reduce the magnitude of random noise while\nachieving better performance, we propose DP-FedSAM-$top_k$ by adopting the\nlocal update sparsification technique. From the theoretical perspective, we\npresent the convergence analysis to investigate how our algorithms mitigate the\nperformance degradation induced by DP. Meanwhile, we give rigorous privacy\nguarantees with R\\'enyi DP, the sensitivity analysis of local updates, and\ngeneralization analysis. At last, we empirically confirm that our algorithms\nachieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared with existing SOTA\nbaselines in DPFL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 15:19:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 04:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

They enable single-qubit control, entangling\nlogical operations, as well as qubit readout. However, their presence can lead\nto deleterious effects such as large ac-Stark shifts and unwanted qubit\ntransitions ultimately reflected into reduced control or readout fidelities.\nQubit cloaking was introduced in Lled\\'o, Dassonneville, et al.\n[arXiv:2022.05758] to temporarily decouple the qubit from the coherent photon\npopulation of a driven cavity, allowing for the application of arbitrary\ndisplacements to the cavity field while avoiding the deleterious effects on the\nqubit. For qubit readout, cloaking permits to prearm the cavity with an, in\nprinciple, arbitrarily large number of photons, in anticipation to the\nqubit-state-dependent evolution of the cavity field, allowing for improved\nreadout strategies. Here we take a closer look at two of them. First,\narm-and-release readout, introduced together with qubit cloaking, where after\narming the cavity the cloaking mechanism is released and the cavity field\nevolves under the application of a constant drive amplitude. Second, an\narm-and-longitudinal readout scheme, where the cavity drive amplitude is slowly\nmodulated after the release. We show that the two schemes complement each\nother, offering an improvement over the standard dispersive readout for any\nvalues of the dispersive interaction and cavity decay rate, as well as any\ntarget measurement integration time.

More importantly, we propose a\nnovel semantic-aware annealing schedule that makes the search-space navigation\nmuch more efficient than existing annealing heuristics. With experimental\nanalyses, we show that such an Augmented Ising Machine for SAT (AIMS),\noutperforms state-of-the-art software-based, GPU-based and conventional\nhardware SAT solvers by orders of magnitude. We also demonstrate AIMS to be\nrelatively robust against device variation and noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 02:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

In the\npast few years, learning-based IM methods have emerged to achieve stronger\ngeneralization ability to unknown graphs than traditional ones. However, the\ndevelopment of learning-based IM methods is still limited by fundamental\nobstacles, including 1) the difficulty of effectively solving the objective\nfunction; 2) the difficulty of characterizing the diversified underlying\ndiffusion patterns; and 3) the difficulty of adapting the solution under\nvarious node-centrality-constrained IM variants.

They are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with positive definite maps called kernels. Stable RKHSs enjoy\nthe additional property of containing only functions and absolutely integrable.\nNecessary and sufficient conditions for RKHS stability are known in the\nliterature: the integral operator induced by the kernel must be bounded as map\nbetween $\\mathcal{L}_{\\infty}$, the space of essentially bounded (test)\nfunctions, and $\\mathcal{L}_1$, the space of absolutely integrable functions.\nConsidering Mercer (continuous) kernels in continuous-time and the entire\ndiscrete-time class, we show that the stability test can be reduced to the\nstudy of the kernel operator over test functions which assume (almost\neverywhere) only the values $\\pm 1$. They represent the same functions needed\nto investigate stability of any single element in the RKHS.

Electric power was the representative\nenergy source that can be collected by AMI; most existing studies to detect\nabnormal energy consumption have focused on a single energy source, i.e.,\npower. Recently, other energy sources such as water, gas, and heating have also\nbeen actively collected. As a result, it is necessary to develop a unified\nmethodology for anomaly detection across multiple energy sources; however,\nresearch efforts have rarely been made to tackle this issue. The inherent\ndifficulty with this issue stems from the fact that anomalies are not usually\nannotated. Moreover, existing works of anomaly definition depend on only\nindividual energy sources. In this paper, we first propose a method for\ndefining anomalies considering not only individual energy sources but also\ncorrelations between them. Then, we propose a new Correlation-driven\nMulti-Level Multimodal Learning model for anomaly detection on multiple energy\nsources. The distinguishing property of the model incorporates multiple energy\nsources in multi-levels based on the strengths of the correlations between\nthem. Furthermore, we generalize the proposed model in order to integrate\narbitrary new energy sources with further performance improvement, considering\nnot only correlated but also non-correlated sources. Through extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets consisting of three to five energy sources,\nwe demonstrate that the proposed model clearly outperforms the existing\nmultimodal learning and recent time-series anomaly detection models, and we\nobserve that our model makes further the performance improvement as more\ncorrelated or non-correlated energy sources are integrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2023 13:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

The Health\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal law\ndesigned to protect sensitive health information by defining regulations for\nprotected health information (PHI). However, it does not provide efficient\ntools for detecting or removing PHI before data sharing. One of the challenges\nin this area of research is the heterogeneous nature of PHI fields in data\nacross different parties. This variability makes rule-based sensitive variable\nidentification systems that work on one database fail on another. To address\nthis issue, our paper explores the use of machine learning algorithms to\nidentify sensitive variables in structured data, thus facilitating the\nde-identification process. We made a key observation that the distributions of\nmetadata of PHI fields and non-PHI fields are very different. Based on this\nnovel finding, we engineered over 30 features from the metadata of the original\nfeatures and used machine learning to build classification models to\nautomatically identify PHI fields in structured Electronic Health Record (EHR)\ndata.

More recently the performance improvements in Graphics Processing\nUnits (GPUs) have enabled developers to exploit sufficient computing power to\nbuild a fair amount of ray tracing applications with the ability to run in\nreal-time. Typically, real-time ray tracing is achieved by utilizing high\nperformance kernels written in CUDA, OpenCL, and Vulkan which can be invoked by\nhigh-level languages via native bindings; a technique that fragments\napplication code bases as well as limits portability.\n  This paper presents a hardware-accelerated ray tracing rendering engine,\nfully written in Java, that can seamlessly harness the performance of\nunderlying GPUs via the TornadoVM framework.

Given an $A$-torsor (respectively a gerbe banded by\n$A$), we would like to know under what conditions it is induced from an\n$A^G$-torsor (respectively a gerbe banded by $A^G$). It is necessary for the\ntorsor or the gerbe to admit a lift of the group action. Given such a\n$G$-action, we define an obstruction class which is a cohomology class in\n$H^2(G,A(X))$ for torsors and in $H^3(G,A(X))$ for gerbes. We prove that if a\ntorsor or a gerbe is induced from the invariants, then the obstruction class is\nzero. Moreover, the vanishing of the obstruction class is sufficient for the\nreverse conclusion assuming the group cohomology classes locally vanish. The\nfirst two sheaf cohomology groups $H^i(X,A)$ can be realized concretely as the\ngroup of $A$-torsors and the group of abelian gerbes banded by $A$. Using this\nrealization and the notion of obstruction classes, we describe morphisms of\ncohomologies in low degrees which come from a certain spectral sequence.
