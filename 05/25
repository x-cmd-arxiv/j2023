Therefore, various\nmasking strategies (e.g., entity-level masking) are proposed, but most of them\nrequire expensive prior knowledge and generally train from scratch without\nreusing existing model weights. In this paper, we present Self-Evolution\nlearning (SE), a simple and effective token masking and learning method to\nfully and wisely exploit the knowledge from data. SE focuses on learning the\ninformative yet under-explored tokens and adaptively regularizes the training\nby introducing a novel Token-specific Label Smoothing approach.

Existing estimators\nface two critical challenges in this setting. First, they are limited by a\nconjectured computational-statistical tradeoff, implying that any\ncomputationally efficient algorithm needs $\\tilde\\Omega(k^2)$ samples, while\nits statistically-optimal counterpart only requires $\\tilde O(k)$ samples.\nSecond, the existing estimators fall short of practical use as they scale\npoorly with the ambient dimension. This paper presents a simple mean estimator\nthat overcomes both challenges under moderate conditions: it runs in\nnear-linear time and memory (both with respect to the ambient dimension) while\nrequiring only $\\tilde O(k)$ samples to recover the true mean. At the core of\nour method lies an incremental learning phenomenon: we introduce a simple\nnonconvex framework that can incrementally learn the top-$k$ nonzero elements\nof the mean while keeping the zero elements arbitrarily small. Unlike existing\nestimators, our method does not need any prior knowledge of the sparsity level\n$k$. We prove the optimality of our estimator by providing a matching\ninformation-theoretic lower bound. Finally, we conduct a series of simulations\nto corroborate our theoretical findings.

In this work, we expand current\nFokker-Planck approaches to account for the concurrent influence of colored and\nmultiplicative noise terms on generic conductance-based integrate-and-fire\nneurons. We reduce the resulting stochastic system from the application of the\ndiffusion approximation to a one-dimensional Langevin equation. An effective\nFokker-Planck is then constructed using Fox Theory, which is solved numerically\nto obtain the transfer function. The solution is capable of reproducing the\ntransfer function behavior of simulated neurons across a wide range of\nparameters. The method can also be easily extended to account for different\nsources of noise with various multiplicative terms, and it can be used in other\ntypes of problems in principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 16:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

This paper includes the design concept and test results\nfrom prototype devices in radiation beams that include heavy ions, low energy\nprotons at nA currents, FLASH level dose per pulse electron beams, and in a\nhospital radiotherapy clinic with electron beams. Results include image\nquality, response linearity, radiation hardness, spatial resolution, and\nreal-time data processing.

Both the zero and finite temperature phase\ndiagrams are obtained using the cluster mean field theory, which includes the\neffect of correlations systematically. We also compute the low-energy\nexcitations which capture the characteristic features of such paired states and\ntheir transitions. Apart from the gapless sound mode due to the PSF order, a\ngapped mode also appears in the PSF phase, similar to the Higgs mode of the\nusual atomic superfluid (ASF). The PSF to ASF transition exhibits an intriguing\nbehavior due to the existence of a `tri-critical' point, where the nature of\ntransition changes. As a consequence of the continuous PSF-ASF transition, the\ngapped mode of both the phases becomes gapless at the critical point. For\nsufficiently strong NNN interaction strength, a PSS phase appears with\ncoexisting pair superfluidity and stripe density order. The softening of the\nroton mode as a precursor of density ordering and the appearance of a\nlow-energy gapped mode serve as robust features related to the formation of the\nPSS phase. We also investigate the melting of PSF and PSS phases to normal\nfluid at finite temperatures, particularly the melting pathway of PSS which\noccurs in atleast two steps due to the coexisting orders.

Under these conditions, we provide a meta-algorithm called\nPersonalized Matching and Averaging (PerMA) that can recover both global and\nlocal dictionaries from heterogeneous datasets. PerMA is highly efficient; it\nconverges to the ground truth at a linear rate under suitable conditions.\nMoreover, it automatically borrows strength from strong learners to improve the\nprediction of weak learners. As a general framework for extracting global and\nlocal dictionaries, we show the application of PerDL in different learning\ntasks, such as training with imbalanced datasets and video surveillance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 16:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

Although the research field of active matter has been expanding\nwider and wider, most research is conducted in classical systems; on the\ncontrary, there is no universal theoretical framework for quantum active\nmatter. We here propose a truly quantum active-matter model with a\nnon-Hermitian quantum walk and show numerical results in one- and\ntwo-dimensional systems. We aim to reproduce similar results that Schweitzer\n\\textit{et al.} obtained with their classical active Brownian particle; that\nis, the Brownian particle, with a finite energy take-up, becomes active and\nclimbs up a potential wall. We realize such a system with non-Hermitian quantum\nwalks. We introduce new internal states, the ground state and the excited\nstate, and a new non-Hermitian operator $N(g)$ for an asymmetric transition\nbetween both states. The non-Hermiticity parameter $g$ promotes transition to\nthe excited state and hence the particle takes up energy from the environment.\nWe realize a system without momentum conservation by manipulating a parameter\n$\\theta$ for the coin operator for a discrete-time quantum walk; we utilize the\nproperty that the continuum limit of a one-dimensional discrete-time quantum\nwalk gives the Dirac equation with its mass proportional to the parameter\n$\\theta$. With our quantum active particle, we successfully observe that the\nmovement of the quantum walker becomes more active in a non-trivial way as we\nincrease the non-Hermiticity parameter $g$, which is similar to the classical\nactive Brownian particle. Meanwhile, we also observe unique features of quantum\nwalks, namely, ballistic propagation of peaks (1D) and the walker staying on\nthe constant energy plane (2D).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 16:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

First, we introduce VPGen, an interpretable\nstep-by-step T2I generation framework that decomposes T2I generation into three\nsteps: object/count generation, layout generation, and image generation. We\nemploy an LM to handle the first two steps (object/count generation and layout\ngeneration), by finetuning it on text-layout pairs. Our step-by-step T2I\ngeneration framework provides stronger spatial control than end-to-end models,\nthe dominant approach for this task. Furthermore, we leverage the world\nknowledge of pretrained LMs, overcoming the limitation of previous\nlayout-guided T2I works that can only handle predefined object classes.

However, their potential to effectively use\ntools via API calls remains unfulfilled. This is a challenging task even for\ntoday's state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, largely due to their inability to\ngenerate accurate input arguments and their tendency to hallucinate the wrong\nusage of an API call. We release Gorilla, a finetuned LLaMA-based model that\nsurpasses the performance of GPT-4 on writing API calls. When combined with a\ndocument retriever, Gorilla demonstrates a strong capability to adapt to\ntest-time document changes, enabling flexible user updates or version changes.\nIt also substantially mitigates the issue of hallucination, commonly\nencountered when prompting LLMs directly. To evaluate the model's ability, we\nintroduce APIBench, a comprehensive dataset consisting of HuggingFace,\nTorchHub, and TensorHub APIs. The successful integration of the retrieval\nsystem with Gorilla demonstrates the potential for LLMs to use tools more\naccurately, keep up with frequently updated documentation, and consequently\nincrease the reliability and applicability of their outputs.

These observations present an intriguing puzzle as\nto the cause of this discrepancy, with a true anisotropy breaking with the\nassumptions of the cosmological principle, invalidating the most common\ncosmological models that are built on these assumptions. We present a novel set\nof Bayesian estimators to determine the cosmic radio dipole and compare the\nresults with commonly used methods on the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS)\nand the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) radio surveys. In addition, we adapt the\nBayesian estimators to take into account systematic effects known to affect\nsuch large radio surveys, folding information such as the local noise floor or\narray configuration directly into the parameter estimation. The enhancement of\nthese estimators allows us to greatly increase the amount of sources used in\nthe parameter estimation, yielding tighter constraints on the cosmic radio\ndipole estimation than previously achieved with NVSS and RACS. We extend the\nestimators further to work on multiple catalogues simultaneously, leading to a\ncombined parameter estimation using both NVSS and RACS. The result is a dipole\nestimate that perfectly aligns with the CMB dipole in terms of direction but\nwith an amplitude that is three times as large, and a significance of\n4.8$\\sigma$.

However, predictive models can be biased and produce\nunfair outcomes, leading to potential discrimination against some students and\npossible harmful long-term implications. This has prompted research on fairness\nmetrics meant to capture and quantify such biases. Nonetheless, so far,\nexisting fairness metrics used in education are predictive\nperformance-oriented, focusing on assessing biased outcomes across groups of\nstudents, without considering the behaviors of the models nor the severity of\nthe biases in the outcomes. Therefore, we propose a novel metric, the Model\nAbsolute Density Distance (MADD), to analyze models' discriminatory behaviors\nindependently from their predictive performance. We also provide a\ncomplementary visualization-based analysis to enable fine-grained human\nassessment of how the models discriminate between groups of students. We\nevaluate our approach on the common task of predicting student success in\nonline courses, using several common predictive classification models on an\nopen educational dataset. We also compare our metric to the only predictive\nperformance-oriented fairness metric developed in education, ABROCA. Results on\nthis dataset show that: (1) fair predictive performance does not guarantee fair\nmodels' behaviors and thus fair outcomes, (2) there is no direct relationship\nbetween data bias and predictive performance bias nor discriminatory behaviors\nbias, and (3) trained on the same data, models exhibit different discriminatory\nbehaviors, according to different sensitive features too. We thus recommend\nusing the MADD on models that show satisfying predictive performance, to gain a\nfiner-grained understanding on how they behave and to refine models selection\nand their usage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 16:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

They\nalso learn broad semantic categories without any labeled examples and learn to\nlocalize semantic categories in an image without any location supervision.\nHowever, these models are less object-centric and more background-sensitive\nthan comparable ImageNet-trained models. Generative models trained with the\nsame data successfully extrapolate simple properties of partially masked\nobjects, such as their texture, color, orientation, and rough outline, but\nstruggle with finer object details.

The semi-end-to-end model maps the input\nfeatures to the optimal var decisions via prediction, decision-making, and\ndecision-evaluating layers.

With the\ncharacteristic of CAN, there exists many vulnerabilities including lacks of\nintegrity and confidentiality, and hence CAN is vulnerable to various attacks\nsuch as impersonation attack, replay attack, etc. In order to implement the\nauthentication and encryption, secret key derivation is necessary. In this\nwork, we proposed an efficient key management scheme for in-vehicle network. In\nparticular, the scheme has five phases. In the first and second phase, we\nutilize elliptic curve cryptography-based key encapsulation mechanism(KEM) to\nderive a pairwise secret between each ECU and a central secure ECU in the same\ngroup.

In this work, we investigate\nthe dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits,\nwhere $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are\nindividually measured with a fixed probability at each time step.

The ozone layer formed with\nthe early Proterozoic oxygenation. While oxygen itself has only minor radiative\nand climatic effects, the accompanying ozone has important consequences for\nEarth climate. Using the Community Earth System Model (CESM), a 3-D general\ncirculation model, we test the effects of various levels of ozone on Earth's\nclimate. When CO2 is held constant, the global mean surface temperature\ndecreases with decreasing ozone, with a maximum drop of ~3.5 K at near total\nozone removal. By supplementing our GCM results with 1-D radiative flux\ncalculations, we are able to test which changes to the atmosphere are\nresponsible for this temperature change. We find that the surface temperature\nchange is caused mostly by the stratosphere being much colder when ozone is\nabsent; this makes it drier, substantially weakening the greenhouse effect. We\nalso examine the effect of the structure of the upper troposphere and lower\nstratosphere on the formation of clouds, and on the global circulation. At low\nozone, both high and low clouds become more abundant, due to changes in the\ntropospheric stability.

Specifically, we tackle the problem of optimizing\nthe confidence estimator of a fixed classifier, aiming to enhance its\nmisclassification detection performance, i.e., its ability to discriminate\nbetween correct and incorrect predictions by assigning higher confidence values\nto the correct ones. Previous work has found that different classifiers exhibit\nvarying levels of misclassification detection performance, particularly when\nusing the maximum softmax probability (MSP) as a measure of confidence.\nHowever, we argue that these findings are mainly due to a sub-optimal\nconfidence estimator being used for each model. To overcome this issue, we\npropose a simple and efficient post-hoc confidence estimator, named\n$p$-NormSoftmax, which consists of transforming the logits through $p$-norm\nnormalization and temperature scaling, followed by taking the MSP, where $p$\nand the temperature are optimized based on a hold-out set. This estimator can\nbe easily applied on top of an already trained model and, in many cases, can\nsignificantly improve its selective classification performance. When applied to\n84 pretrained Imagenet classifiers, our method yields an average improvement of\n16% in the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC), exceeding 40% for some\nmodels. Furthermore, after applying $p$-NormSoftmax, we observe that these\nmodels exhibit approximately the same level of misclassification detection\nperformance, implying that a model's selective classification performance is\nalmost entirely determined by its accuracy at full coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 18:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

We find that (i)\nconstraining the physics in the architecture improves interpolation whilst\nrequiring smaller network sizes, (ii) extrapolation in time is achieved by\nperiodic activations, and (iii) velocity can be reconstructed accurately from\nonly pressure measurements with a combination of physics-based hard and soft\nconstraints. In and beyond acoustics, this work opens strategies for\nconstraining the physics in the architecture, rather than the training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 19:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

For\nthis approach, temporally highly resolved measurements of wind speed and power\noutput are used to obtain the drift and diffusion coefficients of the energy\nconversion process. These coefficients fully determine a Langevin stochastic\ndifferential equation with Gaussian white noise. The drift term specifies the\ndeterministic behavior of the system whereas the diffusion term describes the\nstochastic behavior of the system. A precise estimation of these coefficients\nis essential to understand the dynamics of the power conversion process of the\nwind turbine. We show that the dynamics of the power output of a wind turbine\nhave a hidden dependency on turbine's different operational states. Here, we\nuse an approach based on clustering Pearson correlation matrices for different\nobservables on a moving time window to identify different operational states.\nWe have identified five operational states in total, for example the state of\nrated power. Those different operational states distinguish non-stationary\nbehavior in the mutual dependencies and represent different turbine control\nsettings. As a next step, we condition our Langevin analysis on these different\nstates to reveal distinctly different behaviors of the power conversion process\nfor each operational state. Moreover, in our new representation hysteresis\neffects which have typically appeared in the Langevin dynamics of wind turbines\nseem to be resolved. We assign these typically observed hysteresis effects\nclearly to the change of the wind energy system between our estimated different\noperational states. In this contribution, we discuss further consequences for\nthe meaning of hysteric switching and detection of malbehaviors in wind\nturbines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 19:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

While prior works mostly rely on conventional heuristics or\ngraph traversal methods like breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search\n(DFS) to convert graphs to sequences, the impact of ordering on graph\ngeneration has largely been unexplored.

We illustrate the\nproposed algorithm with simulation experiments, in which we assess the\ncalibration accuracy in the case of calibration of a system consisting of 12\nsingle-axis gyroscopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 21:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

In this work, we explore a well-known Deep\nLearning architecture called Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These\narchitectures have been used in many areas for generating latent spaces where\ndata points are organized so that similar data points locate closer to each\nother. Previously, VAEs have been used for generating latent timbre spaces or\nlatent spaces of symbolic music excepts. Applying VAE to audio features of\ntimbre requires a vocoder to transform the timbre generated by the network to\nan audio signal, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we apply\nVAEs to raw audio data directly while bypassing audio feature extraction. This\napproach allows the practitioners to use any audio recording while giving\nflexibility and control over the aesthetics through dataset curation. The lower\ncomputation time in audio signal generation allows the raw audio approach to be\nincorporated into real-time applications.

However, their inference\nprocess characteristically requires numerous, potentially hundreds, of\niterative steps, which could lead to the problem of exposure bias due to the\naccumulation of prediction errors over iterations. Previous work has attempted\nto mitigate this issue by perturbing inputs during training, which consequently\nmandates the retraining of the DDPM. In this work, we conduct a systematic\nstudy of exposure bias in diffusion models and, intriguingly, we find that the\nexposure bias could be alleviated with a new sampling method, without\nretraining the model. We empirically and theoretically show that, during\ninference, for each backward time step $t$ and corresponding state $\\hat{x}_t$,\nthere might exist another time step $t_s$ which exhibits superior coupling with\n$\\hat{x}_t$. Based on this finding, we introduce an inference method named\nTime-Shift Sampler.

After\nlearning their respective tasks, agents share and consolidate their knowledge\nover a decentralized communication network, so that, in the end, all agents can\nmaster all tasks. We present one solution to SKILL which uses Lightweight\nLifelong Learning (LLL) agents, where the goal is to facilitate efficient\nsharing by minimizing the fraction of the agent that is specialized for any\ngiven task. Each LLL agent thus consists of a common task-agnostic immutable\npart, where most parameters are, and individual task-specific modules that\ncontain fewer parameters but are adapted to each task. Agents share their\ntask-specific modules, plus summary information (\"task anchors\") representing\ntheir tasks in the common task-agnostic latent space of all agents. Receiving\nagents register each received task-specific module using the corresponding\nanchor. Thus, every agent improves its ability to solve new tasks each time new\ntask-specific modules and anchors are received. On a new, very challenging\nSKILL-102 dataset with 102 image classification tasks (5,033 classes in total,\n2,041,225 training, 243,464 validation, and 243,464 test images), we achieve\nmuch higher (and SOTA) accuracy over 8 LL baselines, while also achieving near\nperfect parallelization.

However, the\nsensitivity of data contained in prompts raises privacy concerns. Our work\nfirst shows that these concerns are valid: we instantiate a simple but highly\neffective membership inference attack against the data used to prompt LLMs. To\naddress this vulnerability, one could forego prompting and resort to\nfine-tuning LLMs with known algorithms for private gradient descent. However,\nthis comes at the expense of the practicality and efficiency offered by\nprompting. Therefore, we propose to privately learn to prompt. We first show\nthat soft prompts can be obtained privately through gradient descent on\ndownstream data. However, this is not the case for discrete prompts. Thus, we\norchestrate a noisy vote among an ensemble of LLMs presented with different\nprompts, i.e., a flock of stochastic parrots. The vote privately transfers the\nflock's knowledge into a single public prompt. We show that LLMs prompted with\nour private algorithms closely match the non-private baselines. For example,\nusing GPT3 as the base model, we achieve a downstream accuracy of 92.7% on the\nsst2 dataset with ($\\epsilon=0.147, \\delta=10^{-6}$)-differential privacy vs.\n95.2% for the non-private baseline.

The\nclassical version of this problem assumes a central computational server that\nobserves the entire state of the system perfectly and directs individual agents\naccording to a centralized control scheme. In contrast, we assume that there is\nno centralized server and that each agent is an individual processor with no a\npriori knowledge of the underlying network (including task and agent\nlocations). Moreover, our agents possess strictly local communication and\nsensing capabilities (restricted to a fixed radius around their respective\nlocations), aligning more closely with several real-world multiagent\napplications. These restrictions introduce many challenges that are overcome\nthrough local information sharing and direct coordination between agents. We\npresent a fully distributed, online, and scalable reinforcement learning\nalgorithm for this problem whereby agents self-organize into local clusters and\nindependently apply a multiagent rollout scheme locally to each cluster.

Instead, our approach requires only the\nrough information of individual semantic class proportions, shortened as\nsemantic proportions. It greatly simplifies the data annotation process and\nthus will significantly reduce the annotation time and cost, making it more\nfeasible for large-scale applications. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities\nfor semantic segmentation tasks where obtaining the full ground-truth\nsegmentation maps may not be feasible or practical. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach can achieve comparable and sometimes even\nbetter performance against the benchmark method that relies on the ground-truth\nsegmentation maps. Utilising semantic proportions suggested in this work offers\na promising direction for future research in the field of semantic\nsegmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 22:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

In this\nwork, we check whether such degeneracies persist in the case of well-covered\nsignals by analyzing the lensing event KMT-2021-BLG-1150, for which the light\ncurve exhibits a densely and continuously covered short-term anomaly. In order\nto identify degenerate solutions, we thoroughly investigate the parameter space\nby conducting dense grid searches for the lensing parameters. We then check the\nseverity of the degeneracy among the identified solutions. We identify a pair\nof planetary solutions resulting from the well-known inner-outer degeneracy,\nand find that interpreting the anomaly is not subject to any degeneracy other\nthan the inner-outer degeneracy. The measured parameters of the planet\nseparation (normalized to the Einstein radius) and mass ratio between the lens\ncomponents are $(s, q)_{\\rm in}\\sim (1.297, 1.10\\times 10^{-3})$ for the inner\nsolution and $(s, q)_{\\rm out}\\sim (1.242, 1.15\\times 10^{-3})$ for the outer\nsolution.

The\nreduced-order model is defined as the solution of a residual minimization\nproblem over the nonlinear manifold. An online-efficient method is obtained by\nusing empirical quadrature to approximate the optimality system such that it\ncan be solved with mesh-independent operations. The proposed reduced-order\nmodel is trained using a greedy procedure to systematically sample the\nparameter domain.

We consider the brane parallel to the anti-de Sitter boundary\nand the cosmic string orthogonal to them. Moreover, we assume that the field\nobeys the Robin boundary condition on the brane. Because the brane divides the\nspace into two regions with different properties of the quantum vacuum, we\ncalculate the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the field squared and the\nenergy-momentum tensor (EMT) in each region. To develop these analyses, we have\nconstructed the positive frequency Wightman function for both regions.

In this paper, we\nconsider a risk-sensitive version of the problem and propose a generic\nalgorithm design paradigm called predict-then-calibrate. The idea is to first\ndevelop a prediction model without concern for the downstream risk profile or\nrobustness guarantee, and then utilize calibration (or recalibration) methods\nto quantify the uncertainty of the prediction. While the existing methods\nsuffer from either a restricted choice of the prediction model or strong\nassumptions on the underlying data, we show the disentangling of the prediction\nmodel and the calibration/uncertainty quantification has several advantages.\nFirst, it imposes no restriction on the prediction model and thus fully\nunleashes the potential of off-the-shelf machine learning methods.

With the limitation in the\nscale of egocentric data collection, learning robust deep learning-based action\nrecognition models remains difficult. Transferring knowledge learned from the\nlarge-scale exocentric data to the egocentric data is challenging due to the\ndifference in videos across views. Our work introduces a novel cross-view\nlearning approach to action recognition (CVAR) that effectively transfers\nknowledge from the exocentric to the egocentric view. First, we introduce a\nnovel geometric-based constraint into the self-attention mechanism in\nTransformer based on analyzing the camera positions between two views.

One of the biggest challenges in FL lies in the non-IID (not identical\nand independently distributed) data (a.k.a., data heterogeneity) distributed on\nclients. To address this challenge, various personalized FL (pFL) methods are\nproposed such as similarity-based aggregation and model decoupling. The former\none aggregates models from clients of a similar data distribution. The later\none decouples a neural network (NN) model into a feature extractor and a\nclassifier.

We first finetune a series\nof LMs that imitate ChatGPT using varying base model sizes (1.5B--13B), data\nsources, and imitation data amounts (0.3M--150M tokens). We then evaluate the\nmodels using crowd raters and canonical NLP benchmarks. Initially, we were\nsurprised by the output quality of our imitation models -- they appear far\nbetter at following instructions, and crowd workers rate their outputs as\ncompetitive with ChatGPT. However, when conducting more targeted automatic\nevaluations, we find that imitation models close little to none of the gap from\nthe base LM to ChatGPT on tasks that are not heavily supported in the imitation\ndata. We show that these performance discrepancies may slip past human raters\nbecause imitation models are adept at mimicking ChatGPT's style but not its\nfactuality. Overall, we conclude that model imitation is a false promise: there\nexists a substantial capabilities gap between open and closed LMs that, with\ncurrent methods, can only be bridged using an unwieldy amount of imitation data\nor by using more capable base LMs. In turn, we argue that the highest leverage\naction for improving open-source models is to tackle the difficult challenge of\ndeveloping better base LMs, rather than taking the shortcut of imitating\nproprietary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 05:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

In this work, we propose a new training\nframework, Pareto Mutual Distillation (Pareto-MD), towards pushing the Pareto\nfrontier outwards rather than making trade-offs. Specifically, Pareto-MD\ncollaboratively trains two Pareto optimal solutions that favor different\nlanguages and allows them to learn from the strengths of each other via\nknowledge distillation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel strategy to enable\nstronger communication between Pareto optimal solutions and broaden the\napplicability of our approach.

These limitations\nmainly come from the necessity of 3D models, closed-category detection, and a\nlarge number of densely annotated support views. To mitigate this issue, we\npropose a general paradigm for object pose estimation, called Promptable Object\nPose Estimation (POPE). The proposed approach POPE enables zero-shot 6DoF\nobject pose estimation for any target object in any scene, while only a single\nreference is adopted as the support view. To achieve this, POPE leverages the\npower of the pre-trained large-scale 2D foundation model, employs a framework\nwith hierarchical feature representation and 3D geometry principles. Moreover,\nit estimates the relative camera pose between object prompts and the target\nobject in new views, enabling both two-view and multi-view 6DoF pose estimation\ntasks. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that POPE exhibits\nunrivaled robust performance in zero-shot settings, by achieving a significant\nreduction in the averaged Median Pose Error by 52.38% and 50.47% on the LINEMOD\nand OnePose datasets, respectively. We also conduct more challenging testings\nin causally captured images (see Figure 1), which further demonstrates the\nrobustness of POPE.

Based on the analysis, two controller\ntuning procedures are developed for the three-term DMC, one for closed-loop\nstep response and one for disturbance reduction. Finally, it will be proven\nthat the three-term DMC can achieve a higher performance and robustness than\nthe two-term DMC can. Simulation studies are used to demonstrate the findings\nand the tuning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 05:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

To address this challenge, we propose training Latent\nDiffusion Models (LDMs) with differential privacy.

Although the existing multi-scale vision Transformer has\nshown its effectiveness for learning multi-scale image representation, it still\ncannot work well on the gigapixel WSIs due to their extremely large image\nsizes. To this end, we propose a novel Multi-scale Efficient Graph-Transformer\n(MEGT) framework for WSI classification. The key idea of MEGT is to adopt two\nindependent Efficient Graph-based Transformer (EGT) branches to process the\nlow-resolution and high-resolution patch embeddings (i.e., tokens in a\nTransformer) of WSIs, respectively, and then fuse these tokens via a\nmulti-scale feature fusion module (MFFM). Specifically, we design an EGT to\nefficiently learn the local-global information of patch tokens, which\nintegrates the graph representation into Transformer to capture spatial-related\ninformation of WSIs. Meanwhile, we propose a novel MFFM to alleviate the\nsemantic gap among different resolution patches during feature fusion, which\ncreates a non-patch token for each branch as an agent to exchange information\nwith another branch by cross-attention. In addition, to expedite network\ntraining, a novel token pruning module is developed in EGT to reduce the\nredundant tokens. Extensive experiments on TCGA-RCC and CAMELYON16 datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MEGT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 06:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

The model leads to RVM type\ninflation without external inflatons, arising from the quartic powers of the\nHubble parameter that characterise the vacuum energy density due to\nprimordial-gravitational-wave-induced anomaly CS condensates, and dominate the\ninflationary era. In modern eras, of relevance to this work, the gravitational\nanomalies are cancelled by chiral matter, generated at the end of the RVM\ninflationary era, but cosmic radiation and other matter fields are still\nresponsible for a RVM energy density with terms exhibiting a\nquadratic-power-of-Hubble-parameter dependence, but also products of the latter\nwith logarithmic $H$-dependencies, arising from potential quantum-gravity and\nquantum-matter loop effects. In this work, such terms are examined\nphenomenologically from the point of view of the potential alleviation of the\naforementioned current tensions in Cosmology.

In particular, attention scores over input\nregions or concrete image features can be used to measure how much the attended\nelements contribute to the model inference. The recently proposed Concept\nTransformer (CT) generalizes the Transformer attention mechanism from such\nlow-level input features to more abstract, intermediate-level latent concepts\nthat better allow human analysts to more directly assess an explanation for the\nreasoning of the model about any particular output classification. However, the\nconcept learning employed by CT implicitly assumes that across every image in a\nclass, each image patch makes the same contribution to concepts that\ncharacterize membership in that class. Instead of using the CT's\nimage-patch-centric concepts, object-centric concepts could lead to better\nclassification performance as well as better explainability. Thus, we propose\nConcept-Centric Transformers (CCT), a new family of concept transformers that\nprovides more robust explanations and performance by integrating a novel\nconcept-extraction module based on object-centric learning. We test our\nproposed CCT against the CT and several other existing approaches on\nclassification problems for MNIST (odd/even), CIFAR100 (super-classes), and\nCUB-200-2011 (bird species).

In the literature, the\nrelative measurements are difficult to deal with, and the SMFs highly rely on\nspecific set descriptions. As a result, establishing the general distributed\nSMFing framework having relative measurements is still an open problem. To\nsolve this problem, first, we provide the set description based on uncertain\nvariables determined by the relative measurements between two agents as the\nfoundation. Surprisingly, the accurate description requires only a single\ncalculation step rather than multiple iterations, which can effectively reduce\ncomputational complexity. Based on the derived set description, called the\nuncertain range, we propose two distributed SMFing frameworks: one calculates\nthe joint uncertain range of the agent itself and its neighbors, while the\nother only computes the marginal uncertain range of each local system.\nFurthermore, we compare the performance of our proposed two distributed SMFing\nframeworks and the benchmark -- centralized SMFing framework. A rigorous set\nanalysis reveals that the distributed SMF can be essentially considered as the\nprocess of computing the marginal uncertain range to outer bound the projection\nof the uncertain range obtained by the centralized SMF in the corresponding\nsubspace.

The learner aims to maximize the cumulative rewards while ensuring\nthat the cumulative costs are lower than some predetermined cost constraints.\nWe assume that contexts come from a continuous set, that costs can be signed,\nand that the expected reward and cost functions, while unknown, may be\nuniformly estimated -- a typical assumption in the literature. In this setting,\ntotal cost constraints had so far to be at least of order $T^{3/4}$, where $T$\nis the number of rounds, and were even typically assumed to depend linearly on\n$T$.

To address the above problem, this paper\npresents decoupled denoising diffusion models (DDDMs) with disentangled\nrepresentations, which can control the style for each attribute in generative\nmodels. We apply DDDMs to voice conversion (VC) tasks to address the challenges\nof disentangling and controlling each speech attribute (e.g., linguistic\ninformation, intonation, and timbre).

Existing\nmethods often rely on empirical label selection strategies, such as confidence\nthresholding, to generate beneficial pseudo-labels for model training. This\napproach may, however, hinder the comprehensive exploitation of unlabeled data\npoints. We hypothesize that this selective usage arises from the noise in\npseudo-labels generated on unlabeled data. The noise in pseudo-labels may\nresult in significant discrepancies between pseudo-labels and model\npredictions, thus confusing and affecting the model training greatly. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel learning strategy to regularize the\ngenerated pseudo-labels and effectively narrow the gaps between pseudo-labels\nand model predictions. More specifically, our method introduces an Entropy\nRegularization loss and a Distribution Alignment loss for weakly supervised\nlearning in 3D segmentation tasks, resulting in an ERDA learning strategy.\nInterestingly, by using KL distance to formulate the distribution alignment\nloss, it reduces to a deceptively simple cross-entropy-based loss which\noptimizes both the pseudo-label generation network and the 3D segmentation\nnetwork simultaneously. Despite the simplicity, our method promisingly improves\nthe performance. We validate the effectiveness through extensive experiments on\nvarious baselines and large-scale datasets. Results show that ERDA effectively\nenables the effective usage of all unlabeled data points for learning and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance under different settings.

In this paper, we\npropose to investigate generalization from a Partial Differential Equation\n(PDE) perspective, aiming to enhance it directly through the underlying\nfunction of neural networks, rather than focusing on adjusting input data.\nSpecifically, we first establish the connection between neural network\ngeneralization and the smoothness of the solution to a specific PDE, namely\n``transport equation''.

Contrary to previous works, that relied on parameters determined through\noptical observations, the new timing solution could be derived using only X-ray\ndata. We confirm that the compact object is steadily spinning up with Pdot =\n-2.28(2)x10^-15 s/s and obtain a refined measure of the projected semi-major\naxis of the compact object aX sini = 9.60(5) lightsec. This allows us to\ndetermine the inclination and masses of the system as i = 84.5(7) deg, MX =\n1.220(8) Msun and Mopt = 1.41(2) Msun. We also study possible long term (~year)\nand orbital variations of the soft X-ray pulsed flux, without finding evidence\nfor variability. In the light of the new findings, we discuss the nature of the\ncompact object, concluding that the possibility of a neutron star in the\nsubsonic propeller regime is unlikely, while accretion of the subdwarf wind\nonto a massive white dwarf can explain the observed luminosity and spin-up rate\nfor a wind velocity of ~800 km/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 08:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Most applications require sampling from a DPP, and given\ntheir quantum origin, it is natural to wonder whether sampling a DPP on a\nquantum computer is easier than on a classical one. We focus here on DPPs over\na finite state space, which are distributions over the subsets of\n$\\{1,\\dots,N\\}$ parametrized by an $N\\times N$ Hermitian kernel matrix.

To effectively trigger\nself-contradictions, we design a framework that constrains LMs to generate\nappropriate sentence pairs.

Since domain labels, i.e., which domain each\ndata point is sampled from, naturally exist, most DG algorithms treat them as a\nkind of supervision information to improve the generalization performance.\nHowever, the original domain labels may not be the optimal supervision signal\ndue to the lack of domain heterogeneity, i.e., the diversity among domains. For\nexample, a sample in one domain may be closer to another domain, its original\nlabel thus can be the noise to disturb the generalization learning. Although\nsome methods try to solve it by re-dividing domains and applying the newly\ngenerated dividing pattern, the pattern they choose may not be the most\nheterogeneous due to the lack of the metric for heterogeneity. In this paper,\nwe point out that domain heterogeneity mainly lies in variant features under\nthe invariant learning framework. With contrastive learning, we propose a\nlearning potential-guided metric for domain heterogeneity by promoting learning\nvariant features. Then we notice the differences between seeking variance-based\nheterogeneity and training invariance-based generalizable model. We thus\npropose a novel method called Heterogeneity-based Two-stage Contrastive\nLearning (HTCL) for the DG task. In the first stage, we generate the most\nheterogeneous dividing pattern with our contrastive metric. In the second\nstage, we employ an invariance-aimed contrastive learning by re-building pairs\nwith the stable relation hinted by domains and classes, which better utilizes\ngenerated domain labels for generalization learning. Extensive experiments show\nHTCL better digs heterogeneity and yields great generalization performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 09:42:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

In the radial direction, peculiar velocities cause\nredshift space distortions, an established cosmological probe, and can be\nmeasured individually in the presence of an independent distance indicator. In\nthe transverse direction, peculiar velocities cause proper motions. In this\ncase, however, the proper motions are too small to detect on a galaxy-by-galaxy\nbasis for any realistic experiment in the foreseeable future, but could be\ndetected statistically in cross-correlation with other tracers of the density\nfluctuations. We forecast the sensitivity for a detection of transverse\npeculiar velocities through the cross-correlation of a proper motion survey,\nmodelled after existing extragalactic samples measured by Gaia, and an\noverlaping galaxy survey. In particular, we consider a low-redshift galaxy\nsample, and a higher-redshift quasar sample. We find that, while the expected\ncosmological signal is below the expected statistical uncertainties from\ncurrent data using cross-correlations, the sensitivity can improve fast with\nfuture experiments, and the threshold for detection may not be too far away in\nthe future. Quantitatively, we find that the signal-to-noise ratio for\ndetection is in the range $S/N\\sim0.3$, with most of the signal concentrated at\nlow redshifts $z\\lesssim0.3$. If detected, this signal is sensitive to the\nproduct of the expansion and growth rates at late times, and thus would\nconstitute an independent observable, sensitive to both background expansion\nand large-scale density fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 09:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

In this paper, to overcome this\nissue, we propose a fully transformer tracking framework, coined as\n\\emph{MixFormerV2}, without any dense convolutional operation and complex score\nprediction module. Our key design is to introduce four special prediction\ntokens and concatenate them with the tokens from target template and search\nareas.

To address the containment and exclusion relationships\namong various anatomical structures, we reformulate the topological interaction\n(TI) module based on the nature of binary trees, rapidly encoding the\ntopological constraints into NexToU. Extensive experiments conducted on three\ndatasets (including distinct imaging dimensions, disease types, and imaging\nmodalities) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) architectures.

However, core-level\n$GW$ calculations with CD face the challenge of higher scaling with respect to\nsystem size $N$ compared to the conventional quartic scaling in valence state\nalgorithms. In this work, we present the CD-WAC method (CD with $W$ Analytic\nContinuation), which reduces the scaling of CD applied to the inner shells from\n$O(N^5)$ to $O(N^4)$ by employing an analytic continuation of the screened\nCoulomb interaction $W$.

Scheduled\nsampling (SS) is a technique to train autoregressive model robustly to past\nerrors by randomly replacing some ground-truth tokens with actual outputs\ngenerated from a model.

The results show good agreement\nfor the experimental dielectric constant and mass density with a percentage\nerror less than 1%, whereas for the surface tension the error is up to 4%. For\nthe short amines, methylamine and ethylamine, the new charges were obtained\nfrom a fitting function calculated from the long amines results. For these\nmolecules, the values of the dielectric constant and the surface tension\npresent errors of the order of 10% with the experimental data. Miscibility of\nthe amines was also tested with the new parameters and the results show\nreasonable agreement with experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 12:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

A MPNN is a function that takes a graph and a signal on the graph (a\ngraph-signal) and returns some value. Since the input space of MPNNs is\nnon-Euclidean, i.e., graphs can be of any size and topology, properties such as\ngeneralization are less well understood for MPNNs than for Euclidean neural\nnetworks. We claim that one important missing ingredient in past work is a\nmeaningful notion of graph-signal similarity measure, that endows the space of\ninputs to MPNNs with a regular structure. We present such a similarity measure,\ncalled the graphon-signal cut distance, which makes the space of all\ngraph-signals a dense subset of a compact metric space -- the graphon-signal\nspace. Informally, two deterministic graph-signals are close in cut distance if\nthey ``look like'' they were sampled from the same random graph-signal model.\nHence, our cut distance is a natural notion of graph-signal similarity, which\nallows comparing any pair of graph-signals of any size and topology. We prove\nthat MPNNs are Lipschitz continuous functions over the graphon-signal metric\nspace. We then give two applications of this result: 1) a generalization bound\nfor MPNNs, and, 2) the stability of MPNNs to subsampling of graph-signals. Our\nresults apply to any regular enough MPNN on any distribution of graph-signals,\nmaking the analysis rather universal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 12:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Inverse intensity weighting is a\nuseful approach to addressing such selection bias when the visiting at random\nassumption is satisfied, i.e., visiting at time $t$ is independent of the\nlongitudinal outcome at $t$, given the observed covariate and outcome histories\nup to $t$. However, the visiting at random assumption is unverifiable from the\nobserved data, and informative visit times often arise in practice, e.g., when\npatients' visits to clinics are driven by ongoing disease activities.\nTherefore, it is necessary to perform sensitivity analyses for inverse\nintensity weighted estimators (IIWEs) when the visit times are likely\ninformative. However, research on such sensitivity analyses is limited in the\nliterature. In this paper, we propose a new sensitivity analysis approach to\naccommodating informative visit times in marginal regression analysis of\nirregular longitudinal data. Our sensitivity analysis is anchored at the\nvisiting at random assumption and can be easily applied to existing IIWEs using\nstandard software such as the coxph function of the R package Survival.\nMoreover, we develop novel balancing weights estimators of regression\ncoefficients by exactly balancing the covariate distributions that drive the\nvisit and outcome processes to remove the selection bias after weighting.\nSimulations show that, under both correct and incorrect model specifications,\nour balancing weights estimators perform better than the existing IIWEs using\nweights estimated by maximum partial likelihood.

In this work, we first generalize this notion to\nthe Lieb-Liniger model, which is a prototype of integrable non-relativistic\nmany-body systems. We then show that the defined crosscap state preserves\nintegrability. We derive the exact overlap formula of the crosscap state and\nthe on-shell Bethe states. As a byproduct, we prove the conjectured overlap\nformula for integrable spin chains rigorously by coordinate Bethe ansatz. It\nturns out that the overlap formula for both models take the same form as a\nratio of Gaudin-like determinants with a trivial prefactor. Finally we study\nquench dynamics of the crosscap state, which turns out to be surprisingly\nsimple. The stationary density distribution is simply a constant.

However, the existing knowledge bases heavily\nrely on manual annotation which unavoidably causes deficiency in coverage of\nworld-wide commonsense knowledge. Accordingly, the knowledge bases fail to be\nflexible enough to support the reasoning over diverse questions. Recently,\nlarge-scale language models (LLMs) have dramatically improved the intelligence\nin capturing and leveraging knowledge, which opens up a new way to address the\nissue of eliciting knowledge from language models. We propose a Unified Facts\nObtaining (UFO) approach. UFO turns LLMs into knowledge sources and produces\nrelevant facts (knowledge statements) for the given question. We first develop\na unified prompt consisting of demonstrations that cover different aspects of\ncommonsense and different question styles. On this basis, we instruct the LLMs\nto generate question-related supporting facts for various commonsense questions\nvia prompting. After facts generation, we apply a dense retrieval-based fact\nselection strategy to choose the best-matched fact. This kind of facts will be\nfed into the answer inference model along with the question. Notably, due to\nthe design of unified prompts, UFO can support reasoning in various commonsense\naspects (including general commonsense, scientific commonsense, and social\ncommonsense). Extensive experiments on CommonsenseQA 2.0, OpenBookQA, QASC, and\nSocial IQA benchmarks show that UFO significantly improves the performance of\nthe inference model and outperforms manually constructed knowledge sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 13:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Many existing enhancement methods using physical\nlighting models or deep-learning techniques often lead to unnatural results.\nThis is mainly because: 1) the assumptions and priors made by the physical\nlighting model (PLM) based approaches are often violated in most natural\nscenes, and 2) the training datasets or loss functions used by deep-learning\ntechnique based methods cannot handle the various lighting scenarios in the\nreal world well. In this paper, we propose a novel vision-based exploratory\ndata analysis model (VEDA) for uneven light image enhancement. Our method is\nconceptually simple yet effective. A given image is first decomposed into a\ncontrast image that preserves most of the perceptually important scene details,\nand a residual image that preserves the lighting variations. After achieving\nthis decomposition at multiple scales using a retinal model that simulates the\nneuron response to light, the enhanced result at each scale can be obtained by\nmanipulating the two images and recombining them. Then, a weighted averaging\nstrategy based on the residual image is designed to obtain the output image by\ncombining enhanced results at multiple scales. A similar weighting strategy can\nalso be leveraged to reconcile noise suppression and detail preservation.\nExtensive experiments on different image datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod can achieve competitive results in its simplicity and effectiveness\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods. It does not require any explicit\nassumptions and priors about the scene imaging process, nor iteratively solving\nany optimization functions or any learning procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 14:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

The calculus can encode both the call-by-name and\ncall-by-value semantics of these effects. This is enabled by two independent\ngeneralisations, both natural from the perspective of the FMC's operational\nsemantics, which is given by a simple multi-stack machine.\n  The first generalization decomposes the syntax of the lambda-calculus in a\nway that allows for sequential composition of terms and the encoding of\nreduction strategies. Specifically, there exist translations of the\ncall-by-name and call-by-value lambda-calculus which preserve operational\nsemantics. The second parameterizes application and abstraction in terms of\n'locations' (corresponding to the multiple stacks of the machine), which gives\na unification of the operational semantics, syntax, and reduction rules of the\ngiven effects with those of the lambda-calculus. The FMC further comes equipped\nwith a simple type system which restricts and captures the behaviour of\neffects.\n  This thesis makes two main contributions, showing that two fundamental\nproperties of the lambda-calculus are preserved by the FMC. The first is to\nshow that the categorical semantics of the FMC, modulo an appropriate\nequational theory, is given by the free Cartesian closed category. The\nequational theory is validated by a notion of observational equivalence. The\nsecond contribution is a proof that typed FMC-terms are strongly normalising.\nThis is an extension (and small simplification) of Gandy's proof for the\nlambda-calculus, which additionally emphasizes its latent operational\nintuition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 14:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Therefore, learning to segment the speech\ninputs at those moments that are beneficial for the translation model to\nproduce high-quality translation is the key to SimulST.

However, since the wireless channels vary\ndynamically, the transmit power for ensuring the QoS requirements of URLLC may\nbe very high, which conflicts with the power limitation of a real system. To\nfulfill the successful URLLC transmission with finite transmit power, we\npropose an energy-efficient packet delivery mechanism incorparated with\nfrequency-hopping and proactive dropping in this paper. To reduce uplink outage\nprobability, frequency-hopping provides more chances for transmission so that\nthe failure hardly occurs. To avoid downlink outage from queue clearing,\nproactive dropping controls overall reliability by introducing an extra error\ncomponent. With the proposed packet delivery mechanism, we jointly optimize\nbandwidth allocation and power control of uplink and downlink, antenna\nconfiguration, and subchannel assignment to minimize the average total power\nunder the constraint of URLLC transmission requirements. Via theoretical\nanalysis (e.g., the convexity with respect to bandwidth, the independence of\nbandwidth allocation, the convexity of antenna configuration with inactive\nconstraints), the simplication of finding the global optimal solution for\nresource allocation is addressed. A three-step method is then proposed to find\nthe optimal solution for resource allocation.

This fact is of uttermost importance for the chemistry in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) because the condensation reaction is barrierless and\nthe subsequent species formed are still reactive given their open-shell\ncharacter. Carbon condensation on CO-rich ices forms the \\ch{C=C=O}\n($^3$$\\Sigma$$^-$) species, which can be easily hydrogenated twice to form\nketene (H$_2$CCO). Ketene is very reactive in terrestrial conditions, usually\nfound as an intermediate hard to be isolated in chemical synthesis\nlaboratories. These characteristics suggest that ketene can be a good candidate\nto form interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) via a two-step process,\ni.e., its activation followed by a radical-radical coupling. In this work,\nreactions between ketene and atomic H, and the OH and NH$_2$ radicals on a\nCO-rich ice model have been explored by means of quantum chemical calculations\ncomplemented by kinetic calculations to evaluate if they are favourable in the\nISM. Results indicate that H addition to ketene (helped by tunneling) to form\nthe acetyl radical (CH$_3$CO) is the most preferred path, as the reactions with\nOH and NH$_2$ possess activation energies ($\\geq$ 9kJ/mol) hard to surmount in\nthe ISM conditions, unless external processes provide energy to the system.\nThus, acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO) and, probably, ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH)\nformation via further hydrogenations are the possible unique operating\nsynthetic routes. Moreover, from the computed relatively large binding energies\nof OH and NH$_2$ on CO ice, slow diffusion is expected, hampering possible\nradical-radical couplings with CH$_3$CO.

The massive number of parameters necessitates the\nuse of tensor model parallelism (TMP) in foundation model training.

In this paper, we present Oases, an automated TMP method\nwith overlapped communication to accelerate foundation model training. Oases\nproposes a fine-grained training schedule to maximize overlapping communication\nand computation operations that have data dependence. Additionally, we design\nthe Oases planner that searches for the best model parallel strategy to achieve\nfurther accelerations. Unlike existing methods, Oases planner is specifically\ntailored to model the cost of overlapped communication-computation operations.\nWe evaluate Oases on various model settings and train environments, and compare\nOases to four stat-of-the-art implementations.

The EW measure is most conservative and seems\nunavoidable; it is also model independent in that its value is fixed only by\nthe weak scale spectra which ensues, no matter which model is used to generate\nit. The EENZ/BG measure is ambiguous depending on which ``parameters of\nignorance'' one includes in the low energy effective field theory (LE-EFT). For\nmodels with calculable soft breaking terms, then the EENZ/BG measure reduces to\nthe tree-level EW measure. The HS measure began life as a figurative expression\nand probably shouldn't be taken more seriously than that. SN is closely related\nto EW naturalness via the atomic principle, although it is also sensitive to\nthe distribution of soft terms on the landscape. If the landscape favors large\nsoft terms, as in a power law distribution, then it favors m(h) ~ 125 GeV along\nwith sparticles beyond present LHC reach.

Compared to the within-domain task, the variance of different\ndomains makes the cross-domain performance drop severely, preventing gaze\nestimation deployment in real-world applications. Among all the factors, ranges\nof head pose and gaze are believed to play a significant role in the final\nperformance of gaze estimation, while collecting large ranges of data is\nexpensive. This work proposes an effective model training pipeline consisting\nof a training data synthesis and a gaze estimation model for unsupervised\ndomain adaptation. The proposed data synthesis leverages the single-image 3D\nreconstruction to expand the range of the head poses from the source domain\nwithout requiring a 3D facial shape dataset. To bridge the inevitable gap\nbetween synthetic and real images, we further propose an unsupervised domain\nadaptation method suitable for synthetic full-face data.

Through comprehensive\nexperiments, we show that the model only using monocular-reconstructed\nsynthetic training data can perform comparably to real data with a large label\nrange.

This finding pointed out the importance of the apparently small\ninterlayer exchange, yet, existing literature addresses only its isotropic\npart. To fill this gap, we combine the density functional theory with\nHamiltonian modeling to examine the anisotropic interlayer exchange in bilayer\nCrI$_3$ - Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) and the Kitaev interaction (KI). We\ndevelop and apply a novel computational procedure that yields the off-diagonal\nexchange matrix elements with $\\mu$eV accuracy.

We show how these anisotropic interactions depend on the interlayer\ndistance, stacking sequence, and the spin-orbit coupling strength and suggest\nthe dominant superexchange processes at play. In addition, we demonstrate that\nthe single-ion anisotropy largely depends on stacking, increasing by 50% from\nmonoclinic to rhombohedral structure. Remarkably, our findings prove that\niodines, owing to their spatially extended 5p orbitals featuring strong\nspin-orbit coupling, are extremely efficient in mediating DMI across the van\nder Waals gap in two-dimensional magnetic heterostructures. Given that similar\nfindings were previously demonstrated only in metallic multilayers where the\nDMI shows a much longer range, our study gives promise that the chiral control\nof spin textures can be achieved in two-dimensional semiconducting magnetic\nbilayers whose ligands feature strong spin-orbit coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 15:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

This can be addressed by replaying previous tasks'\ndata stored in a memory, which however is usually prone to size limits and\nprivacy leakage. Recent studies store only class centroids as prototypes and\naugment them with Gaussian noises to create synthetic data for replay. However,\nthey cannot effectively avoid class interference near their margins that leads\nto forgetting. Moreover, the injected noises distort the rich structure between\nreal data and prototypes, hence even detrimental to IL. In this paper, we\npropose YONO that You Only Need to replay One condensed prototype per class,\nwhich for the first time can even outperform memory-costly exemplar-replay\nmethods. To this end, we develop a novel prototype learning method that (1)\nsearches for more representative prototypes in high-density regions by an\nattentional mean-shift algorithm and (2) moves samples in each class to their\nprototype to form a compact cluster distant from other classes. Thereby, the\nclass margins are maximized, which effectively reduces interference causing\nfuture forgetting. In addition, we extend YONO to YONO+, which creates\nsynthetic replay data by random sampling in the neighborhood of each prototype\nin the representation space. We show that the synthetic data can further\nimprove YONO.

Existing methods typically rely on a\npreselected window size that limits their capacity to handle multi-scale\nsources. To address this issue, instead of operating in the time domain, we\npropose an unsupervised multi-scale clustering and source separation framework\nby leveraging wavelet scattering covariances that provide a low-dimensional\nrepresentation of stochastic processes, capable of distinguishing between\ndifferent non-Gaussian stochastic processes.

To do so,\nPandaGPT combines the multimodal encoders from ImageBind and the large language\nmodels from Vicuna. Notably, only aligned image-text pairs are required for the\ntraining of PandaGPT. Thanks to the strong capability of ImageBind in embedding\ndata from different modalities into the same space, PandaGPT displays emergent,\ni.e. zero-shot, cross-modal behaviors for data other than image and text (e.g.,\nvideo, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU).

The mitigation of radio frequency\ninterference (RFI) is the important step for the search, especially for the\nmost sensitive Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST),\nwhich can detect more weak RFI. In this paper, we propose our procedure of RFI\nmitigation using several new methods, and use the procedure to perform a search\nfor ETI signals from the data of FAST's first SETI commensal sky survey. We\ndetect the persistent narrowband RFI by setting a threshold of the signals' sky\nseparation, and detect the drifting RFI (and potentially other types of RFI)\nusing the Hough transform method. We also use the clustering algorithms to\nremove more RFI and select candidates. The results of our procedure are\ncompared to the earlier work on the same FAST data. We find that our methods,\nthough relatively simpler in computation, remove more RFI, but preserve the\nsimulated ETI signals except those severely affected by the RFI. We also report\nmore interesting candidate signals, about a dozen of which are new candidates\nthat are not previously reported. In addition, we find that the proposed Hough\ntransform method, with suitable parameters, also has the potential to remove\nthe broadband RFI. We conclude that our methods can effectively remove the vast\nmajority of the RFI while preserving and finding the candidate signals that we\nare interested in.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 05:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

In addition, airborne\ninfectious microorganism can spread dangerous diseases, further elevating the\nproblem. A common way to mitigate the risks of airborne particles is by air\nfiltration. However, conventional air filters usually do not provide any\nfunctionality beyond particle removal. They are unable to inactivate\naccumulated contaminants and therefore need periodic maintenance and\nreplacement to remain operational and safe. This work presents a\nmultifunctional, self-cleaning air filtration system which utilizes a novel\ngraphene-enhanced air filter medium (GeFM). The hybrid network of the GeFM\ncombines the passive structure-based air filtration properties of an underlying\nceramic network with additional active features based on the functional\nproperties of a graphene thin film. The GeFM is able to capture >95 % of\nmicroorganisms and particles larger than 1 $\\mu$m and can be repetitively\nJoule-heated to >300 {\\deg}C for several hours without signs of degradation.\nHereby, built-up organic particulate matter and microbial contaminants are\neffectively decomposed, regenerating the GeFM. Additionally, the GeFM provides\nunique options to monitor the filter's air troughput and loading status during\noperation. The active features of the GeFM can drastically improve filter\nlife-time and safety, offering great potential for the development of safer and\nmore sustainable air filtration solutions to face the future challenges of air\npollution and pandemics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 14:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}
