In order to solve this vector-valued optimization problem,\npractitioners often appeal to the use of scalarization functions in order to\ntransform the multi-objective problem into a collection of single-objective\nproblems. This set of scalarized problems can then be solved using traditional\nsingle-objective optimization techniques. In this work, we formalise this\nconvention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategy\neffectively recasts the original multi-objective optimization problem into a\nsingle-objective optimization problem defined over sets. An appropriate class\nof objective functions for this new problem is the R2 utility function, which\nis defined as a weighted integral over the scalarized optimization problems. We\nshow that this utility function is a monotone and submodular set function,\nwhich can be optimised effectively using greedy optimization algorithms. We\nanalyse the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically and\nempirically. Our analysis largely focusses on Bayesian optimization, which is a\npopular probabilistic framework for black-box optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 16:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

It is well-known\nthat static analysis does not rely on any input packets and can achieve high\ncoverage by scanning every piece of code.

We revisit planet-disk interaction in\nsuch context, with a focus on the planet's ability to open a gap and produce\nmeridional flows. Accretion, magnetic field and wind torque in the gap are also\nexplored, as well as the gravitational torque exerted by the disk onto the\nplanet. We carry out high-resolution 3D global non-ideal MHD simulations of a\ngaseous disk threaded by a large-scale vertical magnetic field harboring a\nplanet in a fixed circular orbit using the GPU-accelerated code Idefix.

To limit the use of such\nmodels to benign applications, though, it is necessary that tools to\nconclusively detect whether an image has been generated synthetically or not\nare developed. For this reason, several detectors have been developed providing\nexcellent performance in computer vision applications, however, they can not be\napplied as they are to multispectral satellite images, and hence new models\nmust be trained. In general, two-class classifiers can achieve very good\ndetection accuracies, however they are not able to generalise to image domains\nand generative models architectures different than those used during training.\nFor this reason, in this paper, we propose a one-class classifier based on\nVector Quantized Variational Autoencoder 2 (VQ-VAE 2) features to overcome the\nlimitations of two-class classifiers. First, we emphasize the generalization\nproblem that binary classifiers suffer from by training and testing an\nEfficientNet-B4 architecture on multiple multispectral datasets. Then we show\nthat, since the VQ-VAE 2 based classifier is trained only on pristine images,\nit is able to detect images belonging to different domains and generated by\narchitectures that have not been used during training. Last, we compare the two\nclassifiers head-to-head on the same generated datasets, highlighting the\nsuperiori generalization capabilities of the VQ-VAE 2-based detector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 16:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

The\nphysical mechanism(s) driving the onset of fueling and ignition in these active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) are still largely unknown for many galaxies and\nAGN-selection criteria. Attention has focused on AGN triggering by means of\nmajor galaxy mergers gravitationally funneling gas towards the galactic center,\nwith evidence both for and against this scenario. However, several recent\nstudies have found that radio-loud AGN overwhelmingly reside in ongoing or\nrecent major galaxy mergers. In this study, we test the hypothesis that major\ngalaxy mergers are important triggers for radio-loud AGN activity in powerful\nquasars during cosmic noon (1 < z < 2). To this end, we compare Hubble Space\nTelescope WFC3/IR observations of the z > 1 3CR radio-loud broad-lined quasars\nto three matched radio-quiet quasar control samples. We find strong evidence\nfor major-merger activity in nearly all radio-loud AGN, in contrast to the much\nlower merger fraction in the radio-quiet AGN.

Several concepts are being investigated to reduce these\nlosses, such as the classical vertical multijunction cells, 'lateral' tandem\ncells, and multi-exciton generation in the form of photon up- and\ndown-conversion. While in theory, efficiencies exceeding 90% are possible\n(Landsberg or thermodynamic limit), there are severe practical limitations in\nterms of processability, cost, and spectral sensitivity. Here, we present a\nsimulation environment based on Bayesian Optimization that is able to predict\nand optimize the electrical performance of multi-junction architectures, both\nvertical and lateral, in combination with multi-exciton materials. With respect\nto vertical stacks, we show that by optimizing bandgap energies of\nmulti-exciton generation (MEG) layers, double junctions can reach efficiencies\nbeyond those of five-junction tandem devices (57%). Moreover, such combinations\nof MEG and double junction devices would be highly resilient against spectral\nchanges of the incoming sunlight. We point out three main challenges for PV\nmaterial science to realize such devices. With respect to lateral\narchitectures, we show that MEG layers might allow reducing nonradiative\nvoltage losses following the Energy Gap Law. Finally, we show that the\nsimulation environment is able to use machine learned quantitative\nstructure-property relationships obtained from high-throughput experiments to\nvirtually optimise the active layer (such as, the film thickness and the\ndonor-acceptor ratio) for a given architecture. The simulation environment thus\nrepresents an important building block towards a digital twin of PV materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 16:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

It comes about as a\nvariation of the ponderomotive force model for the First Ionization Potential\n(FIP) Effect, i.e. the increase in coronal abundance of elements like Fe, Mg,\nand Si that are ionized in the solar chromosphere relative to those that are\nneutral. In this way, the fractionation region is placed in the chromosphere,\nand is connected to the solar envelope allowing the huge abundance variations\nto occur, that might otherwise be problematic with a coronal fractionation\nsite. The principal mechanism behind the mass-independent FIP fractionation\nbecoming the mass dependent impulsive SEP fractionation is the suppression of\nacoustic waves in the chromosphere. The ponderomotive force causing the\nfractionation must be due to torsional Alfven waves, which couple much less\neffectively to slow modes than do shear waves, and upward propagating acoustic\nwaves deriving from photospheric convection must be effectively mode converted\nto fast modes at the chromospheric layer where Alfven and sound speeds are\nequal, and subsequently totally internally reflected.

In this work, a dynamic wave drag model is developed for Large Eddy\nSimulation to quantify the effects of multiscale dynamically rough surfaces on\nthe atmospheric boundary layer. The waves are vertically unresolved, and the\ntotal drag due to the horizontally resolved portion of the wave spectrum is\ncomputed through a superposition of the force from each mode. As LES can only\nresolve the horizontal wind-wave interactions to the filter scale $\\Delta$, the\neffects of the horizontally unresolved, subfilter waves are modeled by\nspecifying a roughness length scale characterizing the unresolved wave energy\nspectrum. This subfilter roughness is set proportional to the subfilter\nroot-mean-square of the height distribution, and the constant of\nproportionality is evaluated dynamically during the simulation based on the\nassumption that the total drag force at the wave surface is independent of the\nfilter scale. The dynamic approach is used to simulate the airflow over a\nspectrum of moving waves and the results are validated against high-fidelity\nphase-resolved simulations. The dynamic approach combined with the wave\nspectrum drag model is then used to study flow through a fixed-bottom offshore\nwind farm. The dynamic model accurately adapts to the changing velocity field\nand accurately predicts the mean velocity profiles and power produced from the\noffshore wind farm. Further, the effect of the wind-wave interactions on the\nmean velocity profiles, power production, and kinetic energy budget are\nquantified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 16:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

To mitigate this, existing methods incorporate the extra cue as a\nguidance for image completion. Despite improvements, these approaches are often\nrestricted to employing a single modality (e.g., segmentation or sketch maps),\nwhich lacks scalability in leveraging multi-modality for more plausible\ncompletion. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple yet effective method for\nMulti-modal Guided Image Completion, dubbed MaGIC, which not only supports a\nwide range of single modality as the guidance (e.g., text, canny edge, sketch,\nsegmentation, reference image, depth, and pose), but also adapts to arbitrarily\ncustomized combination of these modalities (i.e., arbitrary multi-modality) for\nimage completion. For building MaGIC, we first introduce a modality-specific\nconditional U-Net (MCU-Net) that injects single-modal signal into a U-Net\ndenoiser for single-modal guided image completion. Then, we devise a consistent\nmodality blending (CMB) method to leverage modality signals encoded in multiple\nlearned MCU-Nets through gradient guidance in latent space. Our CMB is\ntraining-free, and hence avoids the cumbersome joint re-training of different\nmodalities, which is the secret of MaGIC to achieve exceptional flexibility in\naccommodating new modalities for completion.

We find that coordinated accounts\nretweet other coordinated accounts far more than expected by chance, while\nbeing exceptionally active just before the second round of voting.\nConcurrently, socio-linguistic characteristics reveal that coordinated accounts\nshare tweets promoting a candidate at three times the rate of non-coordinated\naccounts. Coordinated account tactics also varied in time to reflect news\nevents and rounds of voting. Our analysis highlights the utility of\nsocio-linguistic characteristics to inform researchers about tactics of\ncoordinated accounts and how these may feed into online social manipulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 17:58:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 20:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

To capture this, we introduce a quantitative\nmetric for quantum chaos which utilizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence to\ncompare the microcanonical distribution of entanglement entropy (EE) of\nmidspectrum eigenstates with a reference RMT distribution generated by pure\nrandom states (with appropriate constraints). The metric compares not just the\naverages of the distributions, but also higher moments. The differences in\nmoments are compared on a highly-resolved scale set by the standard deviation\nof the RMT distribution, which is exponentially small in system size. This\ndistinguishes between chaotic and integrable behavior, and also quantifies the\ndegree of chaos in systems assumed to be chaotic. We study this metric in local\nminimally structured Floquet random circuits, as well as a canonical family of\nmany-body Hamiltonians, the mixed field Ising model (MFIM). For Hamiltonian\nsystems, the reference random distribution must be constrained to incorporate\nthe effect of energy conservation.

The detection of concept drifts typically involves analyzing the\nerror rates produced by an underlying OL algorithm in order to identify if a\nconcept drift occurred or not, such that the OL algorithm can adapt\naccordingly. Current concept-drift detectors perform very well, i.e., with low\nfalse negative rates, but they still tend to exhibit high false positive rates\nin the concept-drift detection. This may impact the performance of the learner\nand result in an undue amount of computational resources spent on retraining a\nmodel that actually still performs within its expected range. In this paper, we\npropose OPTWIN, our \"OPTimal WINdow\" concept drift detector. OPTWIN uses a\nsliding window of events over an incoming data stream to track the errors of an\nOL algorithm. The novelty of OPTWIN is to consider both the means and the\nvariances of the error rates produced by a learner in order to split the\nsliding window into two provably optimal sub-windows, such that the split\noccurs at the earliest event at which a statistically significant difference\naccording to either the $t$- or the $f$-tests occurred. We assessed OPTWIN over\nthe MOA framework, using ADWIN, DDM, EDDM, STEPD and ECDD as baselines over 7\nsynthetic and real-world datasets, and in the presence of both sudden and\ngradual concept drifts. In our experiments, we show that OPTWIN surpasses the\nF1-score of the baselines in a statistically significant manner while\nmaintaining a lower detection delay and saving up to 21% of time spent on\nretraining the models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 18:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

This study\nexamines differences in interaction patterns between public and private sharing\nof news articles on Facebook, focusing on articles with varying bias and\nreliability, as well as the depth of interactions. To analyze these patterns,\nwe employed two complementary data collection methods using the CrowdTangle\nbrowser extension. We collected interaction data across all Facebook posts\n(private + public) referencing a manually labeled collection of over 30K news\narticles, as well as interaction data on public posts posted in the forums\ntracked by CrowdTangle. Our empirical findings, backed by rigorous statistical\nanalysis, reveal significant differences in interaction patterns between public\nand private sharing across different classes of news in terms of bias and\nreliability, highlighting the role of user preferences and privacy settings in\nshaping the spread of news articles. Notably, we find that irrespective of news\nclass, users tend to engage more deeply in private discussions compared to\npublic ones. Additionally, Facebook users engage more deeply with content from\nthe Right-biased class, and exhibit higher deep interaction ratio levels with\ncontent from the Most-unreliable class. This study is the first to directly\ncompare the dynamics of public and private sharing of news articles on\nFacebook, specifically examining the interactions and depth of engagement with\narticles of varying bias and reliability. By providing new insights and\nshedding light on these aspects, our findings have significant implications for\nunderstanding the influence of social media on shaping public discourse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 18:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

However, in specialized domains such as e-commerce\nand healthcare, the viability of this approach is limited by the dearth of\nlarge in-domain data. To address this paucity, recent methods leverage these\npowerful models to generate high-quality task and domain-specific synthetic\ndata. Prior work has largely explored synthetic data generation or query\ngeneration (QGen) for Question-Answering (QA) and binary (yes/no) relevance\nprediction, where for instance, the QGen models are given a document, and\ntrained to generate a query relevant to that document. However in many\nproblems, we have a more fine-grained notion of relevance than a simple yes/no\nlabel. Thus, in this work, we conduct a detailed study into how QGen approaches\ncan be leveraged for nuanced relevance prediction. We demonstrate that --\ncontrary to claims from prior works -- current QGen approaches fall short of\nthe more conventional cross-domain transfer-learning approaches. Via empirical\nstudies spanning 3 public e-commerce benchmarks, we identify new shortcomings\nof existing QGen approaches -- including their inability to distinguish between\ndifferent grades of relevance. To address this, we introduce label-conditioned\nQGen models which incorporates knowledge about the different relevance. While\nour experiments demonstrate that these modifications help improve performance\nof QGen techniques, we also find that QGen approaches struggle to capture the\nfull nuance of the relevance label space and as a result the generated queries\nare not faithful to the desired relevance label.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 18:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Various methods for constructing compact shape representations have\nbeen proposed, but they involve laborious and costly steps. We propose\nImage2SSM, a novel deep-learning-based approach for SSM that leverages\nimage-segmentation pairs to learn a radial-basis-function (RBF)-based\nrepresentation of shapes directly from images. This RBF-based shape\nrepresentation offers a rich self-supervised signal for the network to estimate\na continuous, yet compact representation of the underlying surface that can\nadapt to complex geometries in a data-driven manner. Image2SSM can characterize\npopulations of biological structures of interest by constructing statistical\nlandmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes while requiring\nminimal parameter tuning and no user assistance. Once trained, Image2SSM can be\nused to infer low-dimensional shape representations from new unsegmented\nimages, paving the way toward scalable approaches for SSM, especially when\ndealing with large cohorts.

The expansion,\ncharacterized by the Hubble constant, H0, is confused locally by peculiar\nvelocities caused by gravitational interactions, so observers must obtain\naccurate distances at significant redshifts. Very nearby in our Galaxy,\naccurate distances can be determined through stellar parallaxes. There is no\ngood method for obtaining galaxy distances that is applicable from the near\ndomain of stellar parallaxes to the far domain free from velocity anomalies.\nThe recourse is the distance ladder involving multiple methods with overlapping\ndomains. Good progress is being made on this project, with satisfactory\nprocedures and linkages identified and tested across the necessary distance\nrange. Best values of H0 from the distance ladder lie in the range 73 - 75\nkm/s/Mpc. On the other hand, from detailed information available from the power\nspectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, coupled with\nconstraints favoring the existence of dark energy from distant supernova\nmeasurements, there is the precise prediction that H0 = 67.4 to 1%.

In primary visual\ncortex, it is hotly debated whether such variation is a direct tuning shift\nthat would corrupt decoding or if it can be explained by changes in behavioral\nor internal state, which could be compensated by joint encoding of the stimulus\nand the state. We estimate the effects of stimulus-relevant representational\ndrift on decoding using a publicly accessible dataset of mouse V1 responses to\na natural movie. Because the only invariant component of the sensory experience\nacross all 24 animals is that they all watch the same natural movie, we can\nlearn a subject-invariant efficient neural representation that retains only\nstimulus-relevant components. We use contrastive learning between the neural\nresponse and the stimulus to learn a neural representation for\nstimulus-relevant features. This learned representation minimizes decoding\nerror as quantified by Bayes risk. We show that it can be used to read out\nbehaviorally relevant stimulus features (time, static scene, optic flow, and\njoint spatio-temporal features) at 33ms resolution accurately, a finer\ntimescale than what has previously been explored. When we use the model trained\non one recording session to derive feature activations on another, decoding\nperformance is reduced by approximately $40\\%$. Motion encoding is most\nsusceptible to representational drift. In addition, when we enlarge the error\ntolerance window to 1sec, we recover stable stimulus encoding across sessions,\nechoing previous findings. This shows that decoding stimulus features that vary\non fast timescales may require complex computation downstream of V1 to\ncompensate for representational drift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 18:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Then we analyze two decoding\nschemes, the two-stage decoding scheme consisting of zero-forcing and Message\nPassing Algorithm (MPA), and the Joint Message Passing Algorithm (JMPA)\nenhanced by constructing a virtual factor graph. Simulation results indicate\nthat although the two-stage decoding performance is inferior to both BIA and\nSCMA, it has low decoding complexity. On the other hand, the JMPA decoding\nscheme achieves the same diversity gain as STBC-based SCMA while gaining even\nhigher multiplexing gain, which makes the CIAMA with JMPA decoding scheme an\nattractive MA scheme in future wireless communication networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 18:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Coresets became\nprevalent in machine learning as they have shown to be advantageous for many\napplications. While coreset research is an active research area, unfortunately,\ncoresets are constructed in a problem-dependent manner, where for each problem,\na new coreset construction algorithm is usually suggested, a process that may\ntake time or may be hard for new researchers in the field. Even the generic\nframeworks require additional (problem-dependent) computations or proofs to be\ndone by the user. Besides, many problems do not have (provable) small coresets,\nlimiting their applicability. To this end, we suggest an automatic practical\nframework for constructing coresets, which requires (only) the input data and\nthe desired cost function from the user, without the need for any other\ntask-related computation to be done by the user. To do so, we reduce the\nproblem of approximating a loss function to an instance of vector summation\napproximation, where the vectors we aim to sum are loss vectors of a specific\nsubset of the queries, such that we aim to approximate the image of the\nfunction on this subset. We show that while this set is limited, the coreset is\nquite general. An extensive experimental study on various machine learning\napplications is also conducted. Finally, we provide a ``plug and play\" style\nimplementation, proposing a user-friendly system that can be easily used to\napply coresets for many problems.

In\nthis work, we introduce a mathematical abstraction termed\n\\emph{naturally-occurring} model change, which allows for arbitrary changes in\nthe parameter space such that the change in predictions on points that lie on\nthe data manifold is limited. Next, we propose a measure -- that we call\n\\emph{Stability} -- to quantify the robustness of counterfactuals to potential\nmodel changes for differentiable models, e.g., neural networks. Our main\ncontribution is to show that counterfactuals with sufficiently high value of\n\\emph{Stability} as defined by our measure will remain valid after potential\n``naturally-occurring'' model changes with high probability (leveraging\nconcentration bounds for Lipschitz function of independent Gaussians).

The native oxide of niobium-based devices is thought to\nconsist of a thin normal conducting layer. To improve understanding on the\nimportance of this layer, it was replaced with a more easily controlled gold\nfilm. A niobium sample host microwave cavity was used to measure the surface\nresistance in continuous wave operation at 4.0 GHz and 5.2 GHz. Sample\nconditions studied include temperatures ranging from 1.6 K to 4.2 K with RF\nmagnetic fields on the sample surface ranging from 1 mT to the maximum field\nbefore the superconducting properties were lost (quench field). The nominal\nfilm thickness of the gold layer was increased from 0.1 nm to 2.0 nm in five\nsteps to study the impact of the normal layer thickness on surface resistance\non a single niobium substrate. The 0.1 nm film was found to reduce the surface\nresistance of the sample and to enhance the quench field.

Some Markov chains and random walks on finite\ngroups are known to exhibit the non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary\ndistribution, called the cutoff phenomenon. Here, we examine how quickly a\nrandom quantum circuit could transform a quantum state to a Haar-measure random\nquantum state. We find that random quantum states, as stationary states of\nrandom walks on a unitary group, are invariant under the quantum Fourier\ntransform. Thus the entropic uncertainty of random quantum states has balanced\nShannon entropies for the computational bases and the quantum Fourier transform\nbases. By calculating the Shannon entropy for random quantum states and the\nWasserstein distances for the eigenvalues of random quantum circuits, we show\nthat the cutoff phenomenon occurs for the random quantum circuit.

We\naim to have the best of both worlds by optimizing an objective subject to a\nbinary fairness constraint. As the fairness constraint we adopt the geometric\ntarget, which requires the number of seats won by each party to be at least the\naverage (rounded down) of its outcomes under the worst and best partitions of\nthe state.\n  To study the feasibility of this approach, we introduce a new model of\nredistricting that closely mirrors the classic model of cake-cutting. This\nmodel has two innovative features. First, in any part of the state there is an\nunderlying 'density' of voters with political leanings toward any given party,\nmaking it impossible to finely separate voters for different parties into\ndifferent districts. This captures a realistic constraint that previously\nexisting theoretical models of redistricting tend to ignore. Second, parties\nmay disagree on the distribution of voters - whether by genuine disagreement or\nattempted strategic behavior. In the absence of a 'ground truth' distribution,\na redistricting algorithm must therefore aim to simultaneously be fair to each\nparty with respect to its own reported data. Our main theoretical result is\nthat, surprisingly, the geometric target is always feasible with respect to\narbitrarily diverging data sets on how voters are distributed.\n  Any standard for fairness is only useful if it can be readily satisfied in\npractice. Our empirical results, which use real election data and maps of six\nUS states, demonstrate that the geometric target is always feasible, and that\nimposing it as a fairness constraint comes at almost no cost to three\nwell-studied optimization objectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 03:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

One challenging problem of text-to-image\ngenerative models is the generation of Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content, e.g.,\nthose related to violence and adult. Therefore, a common practice is to deploy\na so-called safety filter, which blocks NSFW content based on either text or\nimage features. Prior works have studied the possible bypass of such safety\nfilters. However, existing works are largely manual and specific to Stable\nDiffusion's official safety filter. Moreover, the bypass ratio of Stable\nDiffusion's safety filter is as low as 23.51% based on our evaluation.\n  In this paper, we propose the first automated attack framework, called\nSneakyPrompt, to evaluate the robustness of real-world safety filters in\nstate-of-the-art text-to-image generative models. Our key insight is to search\nfor alternative tokens in a prompt that generates NSFW images so that the\ngenerated prompt (called an adversarial prompt) bypasses existing safety\nfilters. Specifically, SneakyPrompt utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to\nguide an agent with positive rewards on semantic similarity and bypass success.\n  Our evaluation shows that SneakyPrompt successfully generated NSFW content\nusing an online model DALL$\\cdot$E 2 with its default, closed-box safety filter\nenabled.

Hence,\nsevere interference leaked from the transmitter to the receiver, which can\ndisrupt the system's operation completely. For interference reduction, the\ntransceiver tries to estimate the interfering symbols to remove their effects.\nA typical method is to use the Hammerstein model. In this method, nonlinear\npower amplifier (PA) and multipath channel are modeled with a successive\nnonlinear system and a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. Then, the model\nparameters are adjusted, and interference symbols are estimated from the\ntransmitted symbols. In the Hammerstein method, the interference symbols are\nestimated directly from the transmitted symbols. But practically, the\ntransmitted symbols first pass through the pulse-shaping filter and become a\nsignal. Then, this signal passes through the nonlinear PA and communication\nchannel. Finally, the received signal is filtered by the matched filter (MF) at\nthe receiver and converted to the symbols again. In this procedure, the\namplifier and the communication channel affect the transmitted signal directly\nand distort transmitted symbols indirectly. Therefore, in the practical\nsituation, when we consider the transmitter's pulse-shaping filter and the\nreceiver's MF, the estimated symbols with the Hammerstein method are erroneous.\nTo solve this problem, a new MF at the receiver is proposed and adjusted\naccording to the interfering signal.

In this work, we use scanning transmission\nelectron microscopy (STEM) to investigate cross-section lamella of the VO2\nfilms deposited using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on three substrates: c-cut\nsapphire, TiO2(101) and TiO2(001). Advanced STEM imaging is performed in which\nalso the oxygen atom columns are resolved. We link the overall film quality and\nstructures on atomic and nanoscale to the electrical transition\ncharacteristics. We observe poor MIT characteristics on c-sapphire due to the\npresence of very small domains with six orientation variants, and on TiO2 (001)\ndue to the presence of cracks induced by stress relaxation. However, the MIT on\nTiO2 (101) behaves favourably, despite similar stress relaxation which,\nhowever, only lead to domain boundaries but no cracks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 05:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Real-time data is\nemployed to identify uncertainties in the remaining external dynamics,\nincluding both known-unpredictable and unknown aspects. To address these\nuncertainties and maintain optimal performance, stability, and robustness, the\nauthors propose a framework known as Sequential Data-Assisted Control (SDAC).\nThis framework involves using a model-based nonlinear controller for the\ninternal dynamics to provide the desired momentum to a data-based controller\nresponsible for the external dynamics.

At 10% noise, the uncertainty of the end time of the\nplateau, its correspondent flux, and the temporal decay index after the plateau\ndecreases, on average, by 33.3% 35.03%, and 43.32%, respectively for the W07,\nand by 33.3%, 30.78%, 43.9% for the BPL. The slope of the plateau decreases by\n14.76% in the BPL. After using the Gaussian Process technique, we see similar\ntrends of a decrease in uncertainty for all model parameters for both the W07\nand BPL models. These improvements are essential for the application of GRBs as\nstandard candles in cosmology, for the investigation of theoretical models and\nfor inferring the redshift of GRBs with future machine learning analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 07:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 03:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Different from previous studies that focus on\nstationary environments, this paper investigates the delayed OCO in\nnon-stationary environments, and aims to minimize the dynamic regret with\nrespect to any sequence of comparators. To this end, we first propose a simple\nalgorithm, namely DOGD, which performs a gradient descent step for each delayed\ngradient according to their arrival order. Despite its simplicity, our novel\nanalysis shows that DOGD can attain an $O(\\sqrt{dT}(P_T+1)$ dynamic regret\nbound in the worst case, where $d$ is the maximum delay, $T$ is the time\nhorizon, and $P_T$ is the path length of comparators. More importantly, in case\ndelays do not change the arrival order of gradients, it can automatically\nreduce the dynamic regret to $O(\\sqrt{S}(1+P_T))$, where $S$ is the sum of\ndelays. Furthermore, we develop an improved algorithm, which can reduce those\ndynamic regret bounds achieved by DOGD to $O(\\sqrt{dT(P_T+1)})$ and\n$O(\\sqrt{S(1+P_T)})$, respectively.

Inspired by the success of diffusion models on generating\nnatural-looking images, we propose a novel method DiffCap to apply continuous\ndiffusions on image captioning. Unlike image generation where the output is\nfixed-size and continuous, image description length varies with discrete\ntokens. Our method transforms discrete tokens in a natural way and applies\ncontinuous diffusion on them to successfully fuse extracted image features for\ndiffusion caption generation. Our experiments on COCO dataset demonstrate that\nour method uses a much simpler structure to achieve comparable results to the\nprevious non-autoregressive works. Apart from quality, an intriguing property\nof DiffCap is its high diversity during generation, which is missing from many\nautoregressive models.

Once trained by minimizing a variational\nobjective, the learnt map provides an approximate generative model of the\ntarget distribution. Since standard NF implement differentiable maps, they may\nsuffer from pathological behaviors when targeting complex distributions. For\ninstance, such problems may appear for distributions on multi-component\ntopologies or characterized by multiple modes with high probability regions\nseparated by very unlikely areas. A typical symptom is the explosion of the\nJacobian norm of the transformation in very low probability areas.

Overall, our proposed approach offers an effective\nsolution to automated DSIC auction design, with improved scalability and strong\nrevenue performance in various settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 10:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

We examine this phenomenon in the case of waves scattered by a\nlocalised current feature, assuming (i) the smallness of the ratio between\ncurrent velocity and wave group speed, and (ii) a swell-like, highly\ndirectional wave spectrum.\n  We apply matched asymptotics to the equation governing the conservation of\nwave action in the four-dimensional position--wavenumber space. The resulting\nexplicit formulas show that the modulations in wave action and significant wave\nheight past the localised current are controlled by the vorticity of the\ncurrent integrated along the primary direction of the swell.\n  We assess the asymptotic predictions against numerical simulations using\nWAVEWATCH III for a Gaussian vortex.

However, a persistent gap exists between the need to execute a\nmeaningful right to explanation vs. the ability of Machine Learning systems to\ndeliver on such a legal requirement. The regulatory appeal towards \"a right to\nexplanation\" of AI systems can be attributed to the significant role of\nexplanations, part of the notion called reason-giving, in law. Therefore, in\nthis work we examine reason-giving's purposes in law to analyze whether reasons\nprovided by end-user Explainability can adequately fulfill them.\n  We find that reason-giving's legal purposes include: (a) making a better and\nmore just decision, (b) facilitating due-process, (c) authenticating human\nagency, and (d) enhancing the decision makers' authority. Using this\nmethodology, we demonstrate end-user Explainabilty's inadequacy to fulfil\nreason-giving's role in law, given reason-giving's functions rely on its impact\nover a human decision maker. Thus, end-user Explainability fails, or is\nunsuitable, to fulfil the first, second and third legal function. In contrast\nwe find that end-user Explainability excels in the fourth function, a quality\nwhich raises serious risks considering recent end-user Explainability research\ntrends, Large Language Models' capabilities, and the ability to manipulate\nend-users by both humans and machines. Hence, we suggest that in some cases the\nright to explanation of AI systems could bring more harm than good to end\nusers.

There are\ntwo main challenges of blind SR in RSIs: 1) the accu-rate estimation of\ndegradation kernels; 2) the realistic image generation in the ill-posed\nproblem. To rise to the challenge, we propose a novel blind SR framework based\non dual conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDSR).

Using\nthe symbolic model of cryptography, protocols are proven correct against an\nidealized cryptographic model, which abstracts away from the algebraic\nproperties of cryptographic schemes and thus misses attacks. On the other hand,\nexisting computational models of cryptography only support interactive proofs\nand/or are limited to stateless protocols. A promising approach is given by the\ncomputationally complete symbolic attacker (CCSA) model, formalized in the BC\nlogic, which aims at bridging and getting the best of the two worlds, obtaining\ncryptographic guarantees by symbolic protocol analysis. While machine-checked\nsecurity proofs are provided in this domain, such efforts require expert\nknowledge both in the cryptographic space as well as on the reasoning side.\n  In this paper, we present the CryptoVampire framework, providing the first\nfully automated setting for deriving proofs of trace properties in the BC\nlogic. CryptoVampire brings a first-order formalization of protocol properties,\nby proposing tailored handling of subterm relations. In addition, CryptoVampire\nimplements specialized reasoning techniques, saturation algorithms, and\nheuristics, allowing the direct integration of CryptoVampire within the\nlandscape of automated theorem proving. Our experimental results showcase the\neffectiveness of CryptoVampire, providing also automation support for existing\napproaches in the area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 11:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

Recent approaches to tackle this problem\nlearn a latent code (i.e., representation) through disentangled representation\nlearning and then discard the latent code dimensions correlated with sensitive\nattributes (e.g., gender). Nevertheless, these approaches may suffer from\nincomplete disentanglement and overlook proxy attributes (proxies for sensitive\nattributes) when processing real-world data, especially for unstructured data,\ncausing performance degradation in fairness and loss of useful information for\ndownstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel fairness framework that\nperforms debiasing with regard to both sensitive attributes and proxy\nattributes, which boosts the prediction performance of downstream task models\nwithout complete disentanglement. The main idea is to, first, leverage\ngradient-based explanation to find two model focuses, 1) one focus for\npredicting sensitive attributes and 2) the other focus for predicting\ndownstream task labels, and second, use them to perturb the latent code that\nguides the training of downstream task models towards fairness and utility\ngoals.

In this work, we show that the normalized iterates of\nrandomized coordinate-update fixed-point iterations (RC-FPI) converge to the\ninfimal displacement vector and use this result to design an efficient\ninfeasibility detection method.

However, these methods either neglect the\nnecessity of providing the model with relevant external knowledge, or the\nretrieved external knowledge suffers from high redundancy. To address these\nproblems, we propose a conceptually simple two-stage framework called Prompt\nChatGPT In MNER (PGIM) in this paper. We leverage ChatGPT as an implicit\nknowledge engine to acquire auxiliary refined knowledge, thereby bolstering the\nmodel's performance in MNER tasks. Specifically, we first utilize a Multimodal\nSimilar Example Awareness module to select suitable examples from a small\nnumber of manually annotated samples. These examples are then integrated into a\nformatted prompt template tailored to the MNER task, guiding ChatGPT to\ngenerate auxiliary refined knowledge. Finally, the acquired knowledge is\nintegrated with the raw text and inputted into the downstream model for further\nprocessing.

In this case, we establish a series of effective integral\ncriteria of the type of BMO, FMO, Calderon-Zygmund, Lehto and Orlicz on\nsingularities of the equations at the boundary for existence, representation\nand regularity of solutions in arbitrary bounded domains $D$ of the complex\nplane $\\mathbb C$ with no boun\\-da\\-ry component degenerated to a single point\nfor sources $\\sigma$ in $L_p(D)$, $p>2$, with compact support in $D$.

Such problems\nare found in, e.g., engineering, law or economics.\n  We study this class of problems in a context where some of the relevant\ninformation about the environment is not known by the user at the start of the\nsearch. During the search, the user may consider tentative solutions that make\nimplicit hypotheses about these unknowns. To ensure that the solution is\nappropriate, these hypotheses must be verified by observing the environment.\nFurthermore, we assume that, in addition to knowledge of what constitutes a\nsolution, knowledge of general laws of the environment is also present. We\nformally define partial solutions with enough verified facts to guarantee the\nexistence of complete and appropriate solutions.\n  Additionally, we propose an interactive system to assist the user in their\nsearch by determining 1) which hypotheses implicit in a tentative solution must\nbe verified in the environment, and 2) which observations can bring useful\ninformation for the search. We present an efficient method to over-approximate\nthe set of relevant information, and evaluate our implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 11:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

However, texts produced in the context of\nlegal practice make references to entities that are not trivially recognized by\nthe currently available NERs. There is a lack of categorization of legislation,\njurisprudence, evidence, penalties, the roles of people in a legal process\n(judge, lawyer, victim, defendant, witness), types of locations (crime\nlocation, defendant's address), etc. In this sense, there is still a need for a\nrobust golden collection, annotated with fine-grained entities of the legal\ndomain, and which covers various documents of a legal process, such as\npetitions, inquiries, complaints, decisions and sentences. In this article, we\ndescribe the development of the Golden Collection of the Brazilian Judiciary\n(CDJUR-BR) contemplating a set of fine-grained named entities that have been\nannotated by experts in legal documents. The creation of CDJUR-BR followed its\nown methodology that aimed to attribute a character of comprehensiveness and\nrobustness. Together with the CDJUR-BR repository we provided a NER based on\nthe BERT model and trained with the CDJUR-BR, whose results indicated the\nprevalence of the CDJUR-BR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2023 00:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

To investigate this relationship, we\npropose a Mixed Poisson Hidden Markov approach to model the number of payday\nloans a borrower obtains in each period. Given the lack of agreement in the\nliterature on financial vulnerability, we introduce financial distress as an\nunobserved binary variable using a hidden Markov process (vulnerable and\nnon-vulnerable). Using data from 90,523 anonymised transactions for 1,817 UK\nconsumers, we find that the effect of certain time-varying covariates depends\ngreatly on the borrower's hidden state. For instance, luxury expenses and\nnon-recurring income increase the need for payday loans when financially\nvulnerable, but the opposite is true when not vulnerable. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that almost 60\\% of payday loan borrowers remain vulnerable for 12\nor more consecutive weeks, with two-thirds experiencing consistent financial\ndifficulties. Finally, our analysis underscores the need for a nuanced approach\nto payday lending that recognises the varying levels of vulnerability among\nborrowers, which can prove helpful for policymakers and lenders to enhance\nresponsible lending practices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 16:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}
