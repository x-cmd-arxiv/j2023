Additionally, it is common to\nhave a large amount of training data that have a better diversity coverage but\nCoT annotations are not available, which limits the use of supervised learning\ntechniques. To address these issues, we investigate two approaches to leverage\nthe training data in a few-shot prompting scenario: dynamic program prompting\nand program distillation. Our approach is largely inspired by Gao et al.,\n(2022), where they proposed to replace the CoT with the programs as the\nintermediate reasoning step. Such a prompting strategy allows us to accurately\nverify the answer correctness through program execution in MWP solving. Our\ndynamic program prompting involves annotating the training data by sampling\ncorrect programs from a large language model, while program distillation\ninvolves adapting a smaller model to the program-annotated training data. Our\nexperiments on three standard MWP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthese approaches, yielding significant improvements over previous baselines for\nprompting and fine-tuning. Our results suggest that leveraging a large amount\nof training data can improve the generalization ability of prompts and boost\nthe performance of fine-tuned small models in MWP solving\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 16:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

However, the existing probabilistic ITM approach encounters two key\nshortcomings; the burden of heavy computations due to the Monte Carlo\napproximation, and the loss saturation issue in the face of abundant false\nnegatives. To overcome the issues, this paper presents an improved\nProbabilistic Cross-Modal Embeddings (named PCME++) by introducing a new\nprobabilistic distance with a closed-form solution. In addition, two\noptimization techniques are proposed to enhance PCME++ further; first, the\nincorporation of pseudo-positives to prevent the loss saturation problem under\nmassive false negatives; second, mixed sample data augmentation for\nprobabilistic matching. Experimental results on MS-COCO Caption and two\nextended benchmarks, CxC and ECCV Caption, demonstrate the effectiveness of\nPCME++ compared to state-of-the-art ITM methods.

Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which\ncharacterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked\ndefaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate\npersonas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group\nalongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that\nsignificantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding\nunmarked ones. We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4\ncontain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using\nthe same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white,\nnon-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these\ndemographics.

In this study,\nface embeddings serve two purposes: pre-selecting images for large-scale\nMorphing Attack generation and detecting potential Morphing Attacks. We build\nupon previous embedding studies in both use cases using the MagFace model. For\nthe first objective, we employ an pre-selection algorithm that pairs\nindividuals based on face embedding similarity. We quantify the attack\npotential of differently morphed face images to compare the usability of\npre-selection in automatically generating numerous successful Morphing Attacks.\nRegarding the second objective, we compare embeddings from two state-of-the-art\nface recognition systems in terms of their ability to detect Morphing Attacks.\nOur findings demonstrate that ArcFace and MagFace provide valuable face\nembeddings for image pre-selection. Both open-source and COTS face recognition\nsystems are susceptible to generated attacks, particularly when pre-selection\nis based on embeddings rather than random pairing which was only constrained by\nsoft biometrics. More accurate face recognition systems exhibit greater\nvulnerability to attacks, with COTS systems being the most susceptible.\nAdditionally, MagFace embeddings serve as a robust alternative for detecting\nmorphed face images compared to the previously used ArcFace embeddings. The\nresults endorse the advantages of face embeddings in more effective image\npre-selection for face morphing and accurate detection of morphed face images.\nThis is supported by extensive analysis of various designed attacks. The\nMagFace model proves to be a powerful alternative to the commonly used ArcFace\nmodel for both objectives, pre-selection and attack detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 17:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

Existing\nworks usually transform gaze information into visual attention maps (VAMs) to\nsupervise the learning process.

In GazeGNN, we create a unified\nrepresentation graph that models both the image and gaze pattern information.\nHence, the eye-gaze information is directly utilized without being converted\ninto VAMs. With this benefit, we develop a real-time, real-world, end-to-end\ndisease classification algorithm for the first time and avoid the noise and\ntime consumption introduced during the VAM preparation.

Most previous works\nendeavor to meet these requirements by fitting a text-to-image (T2I) model on a\nset of videos in the same style and with the same characters, e.g., the\nFlintstonesSV dataset. However, the learned T2I models typically struggle to\nadapt to new characters, scenes, and styles, and often lack the flexibility to\nrevise the layout of the synthesized images. This paper proposes a system for\ngeneric interactive story visualization, capable of handling multiple novel\ncharacters and supporting the editing of layout and local structure. It is\ndeveloped by leveraging the prior knowledge of large language and T2I models,\ntrained on massive corpora. The system comprises four interconnected\ncomponents: story-to-prompt generation (S2P), text-to-layout generation (T2L),\ncontrollable text-to-image generation (C-T2I), and image-to-video animation\n(I2V). First, the S2P module converts concise story information into detailed\nprompts required for subsequent stages. Next, T2L generates diverse and\nreasonable layouts based on the prompts, offering users the ability to adjust\nand refine the layout to their preference. The core component, C-T2I, enables\nthe creation of images guided by layouts, sketches, and actor-specific\nidentifiers to maintain consistency and detail across visualizations. Finally,\nI2V enriches the visualization process by animating the generated images.\nExtensive experiments and a user study are conducted to validate the\neffectiveness and flexibility of interactive editing of the proposed system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 17:11:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 08:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

It is quite\nstraightforward to build an accurate tight-binding model of any crystalline\nsystem using the maximally localized Wannier functions of the crystal as a\nbasis. In 1D and 2D photonic crystals, it is possible to express the wave\nequation as two decoupled scalar eigenproblems where finding a basis of\nmaximally localized Wannier functions is feasible using standard Wannierization\nmethods. Unfortunately, in 3D photonic crystals, the vectorial nature of the\nelectromagnetic solutions cannot be avoided. This precludes the construction of\na basis of maximally localized Wannier functions via usual techniques. In this\nwork, we show how to overcome this problem by using topological quantum\nchemistry which will allow us to express the band structure of the photonic\ncrystal as a difference of elementary band representations. This can be\nachieved by the introduction of a set of auxiliary modes, as recently proposed\nby Solja\\v{c}i\\'c et. al., which regularize the $\\Gamma$-point obstruction\narising from transversality constraint of the Maxwell equations. The\ndecomposition into elementary band representations allows us to isolate a set\nof pseudo-orbitals that permit us to construct an accurate\ntransversality-enforced tight-binding model (TETB) that matches the dispersion,\nsymmetry content, and topology of the 3D photonic crystal under study.\nMoreover, we show how to introduce the effects of a gyrotropic bias in the\nframework, modeled via non-minimal coupling to a static magnetic field. Our\nwork provides the first systematic method to analytically model the photonic\nbands of the lowest transverse modes over the entire BZ via a TETB model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 17:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

In particular, measurements of $\\rm\n^{14}N/^{15}N$ in diazenylium revealed high levels of anti-fractionation in\ncold cores.\n  Aims. Furuya & Aikawa (2018), using astrophysical simulations coupled with a\ngas-grain chemical code, concluded that the $^{15}$N-depletion in prestellar\ncores could be inherited from the initial stages, when $\\rm ^{14}N^{15}N$ is\nselectively photodissociated and 15N atoms deplete onto the dust grain, forming\nammonia ices. We aim to test this hypothesis.\n  Methods. We targeted three sources (the prestellar core L1544, the\nprotostellar envelope IRAS4A, and the shocked region L1157-B1) with distinct\ndegrees of desorption or sputtering of the ammonia ices.

Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels\nof the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM\nto align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first\nfitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then\nfine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize\nthis estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this\npaper, we leverage a mapping between reward functions and optimal policies to\nshow that this constrained reward maximization problem can be optimized exactly\nwith a single stage of policy training, essentially solving a classification\nproblem on the human preference data. The resulting algorithm, which we call\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant and computationally\nlightweight, eliminating the need for fitting a reward model, sampling from the\nLM during fine-tuning, or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our\nexperiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as\nwell as or better than existing methods.

The main reason is to avoid training a convolution encoder\nalongside a policy network, which is known to have issues related to sample\nefficiency, degenerated feature representations, and catastrophic\nself-overfitting. However, this paradigm can lead to representations of the\nenvironment that are not aligned with the downstream task, which may result in\nsuboptimal performances. To address this limitation, this paper proposes RLAD,\nthe first Reinforcement Learning from Pixels (RLfP) method applied in the urban\nAD domain. We propose several techniques to enhance the performance of an RLfP\nalgorithm in this domain, including: i) an image encoder that leverages both\nimage augmentations and Adaptive Local Signal Mixing (A-LIX) layers; ii)\nWayConv1D, which is a waypoint encoder that harnesses the 2D geometrical\ninformation of the waypoints using 1D convolutions; and iii) an auxiliary loss\nto increase the significance of the traffic lights in the latent representation\nof the environment.

To address this issue, we introduce a new\ntool called SlimFit that reduces the memory requirements of these models by\ndynamically analyzing their training dynamics and freezing less-contributory\nlayers during fine-tuning. The layers to freeze are chosen using a runtime\ninter-layer scheduling algorithm. SlimFit adopts quantization and pruning for\nparticular layers to balance the load of dynamic activations and to minimize\nthe memory footprint of static activations, where static activations refer to\nthose that cannot be discarded regardless of freezing.

The most studied approximation is the Hartle-Thorne metric that\nrepresents slowly-rotating compact objects, like massive stars, white dwarfs\nand neutron stars. Recent investigations of photon orbits and shadows of such\nmetric revealed that it exhibits chaos close to resonances. Here, we thoroughly\ninvestigate particle orbits around the Hartle-Thorne spacetime. We perform an\nexhaustive analysis of bound motion, by varying all parameters involved in the\nsystem. We demonstrate that chaotic regions, known as Birkhoff islands, form\naround resonances, where the ratio of the radial and polar frequency of\ngeodesics, known as the rotation number, is shared throughout the island. This\nleads to the formation of plateaus in rotation curves during the most prominent\n$2/3$ resonance, which designate nonintegrability. We measure their width and\nshow how each parameter affects it. The nonintegrability of Hartle-Thorne\nmetric may affect quasiperiodic oscillations of low-mass X-ray binaries, when\nchaos is taken into account, and improve estimates of mass, angular momentum\nand multipole moments of astrophysical compact objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

This makes it difficult to accurately measure the brightness of blended\nobjects because the contributions from adjacent objects are mixed in a\ntime-variable manner due to changes in the atmospheric conditions. However,\nthis effect can be corrected by characterizing the Point Spread Function (PSF),\nwhich describes how a point source is blurred on a detector. This function can\nbe estimated from the stars in the field of view, which provides a natural\nsampling of the PSF across the entire field of view.\n  Once the PSF is estimated, it can be removed from the data through the\nso-called deconvolution process, leading to images of improved spatial\nresolution. The deconvolution operation is an ill-posed inverse problem due to\nnoise and pixelization of the data. To solve this problem, regularization is\nnecessary to guarantee the robustness of the solution. Regularization can take\nthe form of a sparse prior, meaning that the recovered solution can be\nrepresented with only a few basis eigenvectors.\n  STARRED is a Python package developed in the context of the COSMOGRAIL\ncollaboration and applies to a vast variety of astronomical problems. It\nproposes to use an isotropic wavelet basis, called Starlets, to regularize the\nsolution of the deconvolution problem. This family of wavelets has been shown\nto be well-suited to represent astronomical objects. STARRED provides two\nmodules to first reconstruct the PSF, and then perform the deconvolution. It is\nbased on two key concepts: i) the image is reconstructed in two separate\nchannels, one for the point sources and one for the extended sources, and ii)\nthe code relies on the deliberate choice of not completely removing the effect\nof the PSF, but rather bringing the image to a higher resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 18:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

When\norientability is broken, the circuit falls into the universality class of\nclosely packed loops with crossings (CPLC) and features a Goldstone phase with\na peculiar, universal $\\log^2(L)$-scaling of the entanglement entropy. In turn,\nwhen orientability is preserved, the long-wavelength behavior of the circuit\nmimics that of (coupled) two-dimensional Potts models. We demonstrate the\nstrength of the loop model approach by numerically simulating a variety of\nmeasurement-only Clifford circuits. Upon varying the set of measured operators,\na rich circuit dynamics is observed, ranging from CPLC to the $1$-state Potts\nmodel (percolation), the $2$-state Potts model (Ising) and coupled Potts models\n(BKT) universality class. Loop models thus provide a handle to access a large\nclass of measurement-only circuits and yield a blueprint on how to realize\ndesired entanglement phases by measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 18:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Five LOs are articulated at each of three levels of cognitive\ncomplexity (low/med/high), and a set of assignment features that can be adapted\nrepeatedly over a term are given supporting these LOs. These features can\nsupport authentic development of the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are\nthe target of ethical reasoning instruction in math and quantitative courses at\nthe tertiary level. Three contexts by which these can be integrated are\nAssumption (what if the assumption fails?), Approximation (what if the\napproximation does not hold?), and Application (is the application appropriate?\nwhat if it is not?).

Continual learning (CL)\naims to address this limitation and enable DNNs to accumulate knowledge\nincrementally, similar to human learning. Inspired by how our brain\nconsolidates memories, a powerful strategy in CL is replay, which involves\ntraining the DNN on a mixture of new and all seen classes. However, existing\nreplay methods overlook two crucial aspects of biological replay: 1) the brain\nreplays processed neural patterns instead of raw input, and 2) it prioritizes\nthe replay of recently learned information rather than revisiting all past\nexperiences. To address these differences, we propose SHARP, an efficient\nneuro-inspired CL method that leverages sparse dynamic connectivity and\nactivation replay. Unlike other activation replay methods, which assume layers\nnot subjected to replay have been pretrained and fixed, SHARP can continually\nupdate all layers. Also, SHARP is unique in that it only needs to replay few\nrecently seen classes instead of all past classes. Our experiments on five\ndatasets demonstrate that SHARP outperforms state-of-the-art replay methods in\nclass incremental learning. Furthermore, we showcase SHARP's flexibility in a\nnovel CL scenario where the boundaries between learning episodes are blurry.\nThe SHARP code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/BurakGurbuz97/SHARP-Continual-Learning}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 18:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Decoding the original signal (i.e., hidden chain) from the noisy\nobservations is one of the main goals in nearly all HMM based data analyses.\nExisting decoding algorithms such as the Viterbi algorithm have computational\ncomplexity at best linear in the length of the observed sequence, and\nsub-quadratic in the size of the state space of the Markov chain. We present\nQuick Adaptive Ternary Segmentation (QATS), a divide-and-conquer procedure\nwhich decodes the hidden sequence in polylogarithmic computational complexity\nin the length of the sequence, and cubic in the size of the state space, hence\nparticularly suited for large scale HMMs with relatively few states. The\nprocedure also suggests an effective way of data storage as specific cumulative\nsums. In essence, the estimated sequence of states sequentially maximizes local\nlikelihood scores among all local paths with at most three segments. The\nmaximization is performed only approximately using an adaptive search\nprocedure. The resulting sequence is admissible in the sense that all\ntransitions occur with positive probability. To complement formal results\njustifying our approach, we present Monte-Carlo simulations which demonstrate\nthe speedups provided by QATS in comparison to Viterbi, along with a precision\nanalysis of the returned sequences.

While previous research has separately addressed the\nrobustness of these models under adversarial attacks and their\ninterpretability, there has been no comprehensive study exploring their\nintersection.

We show\nthat a word in subject position is interpreted as more agentive than the very\nsame word in object position, and that the nouns in the AANN construction are\ninterpreted as more measurement-like than when in the canonical alternation.\nOur method can probe the distributional meaning of syntactic constructions at a\ntemplatic level, abstracted away from specific lexemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 20:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

The nondetection of CH_4 reinforces a previously observed trend of\nweaker CH_4 with younger ages among L dwarfs, which has been attributed to\nenhanced non-equilibrium chemistry among young objects. The weakness of CO may\nreflect an additional atmospheric property that varies with age, such as the\ntemperature gradient or cloud thickness. We are able to reproduce the broad\nshape of the spectrum with an ATMO cloudless model that has T=1300 K,\nnon-equilibrium chemistry, and a temperature gradient reduction caused by\nfingering convection.

In this work, we introduce\nGlobal-QSGD, a novel family of quantization operators, engineered to accelerate\ndistributed training based on global scaling. We demonstrate that Global-QSGD\nis the first theoretically rigorous Allreduce-compatible compression mechanism\nthat achieves a provable speed-up by striking a balance between compression\nerror and communication savings.

For the\nempirical component of our work, we carry out a performance modeling analysis\nto determine if Global-QSGD can enhance training throughput under specific\nhardware configurations.

This is\nprimarily due to the relevance of functions that are solutions to parametric\ndifferential equations in various fields, e.g. chemistry, economics,\nengineering, and physics. While acquiring accurate and reliable approximations\nof such functions is inherently difficult, current benchmark methods exploit\nthe fact that such functions often belong to certain classes of holomorphic\nfunctions to get algebraic convergence rates in infinite dimensions with\nrespect to the number of (potentially adaptive) samples $m$. Our work focuses\non providing theoretical approximation guarantees for the class of\n$(\\boldsymbol{b},\\varepsilon)$-holomorphic functions, demonstrating that these\nalgebraic rates are the best possible for Banach-valued functions in infinite\ndimensions. We establish lower bounds using a reduction to a discrete problem\nin combination with the theory of $m$-widths, Gelfand widths and Kolmogorov\nwidths. We study two cases, known and unknown anisotropy, in which the relative\nimportance of the variables is known and unknown, respectively. A key\nconclusion of our paper is that in the latter setting, approximation from\nfinite samples is impossible without some inherent ordering of the variables,\neven if the samples are chosen adaptively. Finally, in both cases, we\ndemonstrate near-optimal, non-adaptive (random) sampling and recovery\nstrategies which achieve close to same rates as the lower bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 22:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Although the latter is computationally less\nexpensive, it still takes a significant amount of time for per-video adaption.\nTo address this issue, we propose SAVE, a novel spectral-shift-aware adaptation\nframework, in which we fine-tune the spectral shift of the parameter space\ninstead of the parameters themselves. Specifically, we take the spectral\ndecomposition of the pre-trained T2I weights and only control the change in the\ncorresponding singular values, i.e. spectral shift, while freezing the\ncorresponding singular vectors. To avoid drastic drift from the original T2I\nweights, we introduce a spectral shift regularizer that confines the spectral\nshift to be more restricted for large singular values and more relaxed for\nsmall singular values. Since we are only dealing with spectral shifts, the\nproposed method reduces the adaptation time significantly (approx. 10 times)\nand has fewer resource constrains for training. Such attributes posit SAVE to\nbe more suitable for real-world applications, e.g. editing undesirable content\nduring video streaming.

Intriguingly, the observed outgassing rate (300 kg/s) is\nsimilar to that derived from close-up observations with Cassini 15 years ago,\nand the torus density is consistent with previous spatially unresolved\nmeasurements with Herschel 13 years ago, suggesting that the vigor of gas\neruption from Enceladus has been relatively stable over decadal timescales.\nThis level of activity is sufficient to maintain a derived column density of\n4.5x1017 m-2 for the embedding equatorial torus, and establishes Enceladus as\nthe prime source of water across the Saturnian system.

Based on the identities, we numerically evaluate the topological\nsusceptibility at finite quark chemical potential using the linear sigma model\nwith the approximate Pauli-Gursey $SU(4)$ symmetry.

Specifically, our ShuffleMix method\nfavors a simple linear shuffle of randomly selected feature channels for\nfeature mixup in-between training samples to leverage semantic interpolated\nsupervision signals, which can be extended to a generalized shuffle operation\nvia additionally combining linear interpolations of intra-channel features.\nCompared to its direct competitor of feature augmentation -- the Manifold\nMixup, the proposed ShuffleMix can gain superior generalization, owing to\nimposing more flexible and smooth constraints on generating samples and\nachieving regularization effects of channel-wise feature dropout.

This work investigates these effects using strain\nmapping with nanobeam electron diffraction and a continuum elastic model of\nstrain in simple core-shell particles. We find that surface strain is relaxed\nboth by lattice defects at the core-shell interface and by relaxation across\nparticle shells caused by Poisson expansion in the spherical geometry. The\ncontinuum elastic model finds that in the absence of lattice dislocations,\ngeometric relaxation results in a surface strain that scales with the average\ncomposition of the particle, regardless of the shell thickness. We investigate\nthe impact of these strain effects on catalytic activity for a series of Pt-Co\ncatalysts treated to vary their shell thickness and core-shell lattice\nmismatch. For catalysts with the thinnest shells, the activity is consistent\nwith an Arrhenius dependence on the surface strain expected for coherent strain\nin dislocation-free particles, while catalysts with thicker shells showed\ngreater activity losses indicating strain relaxation caused by dislocations as\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 01:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Recently, neural network approximation of PDEs has received\nincreasing attention due to its flexible meshless discretization and its\npotential for high-dimensional problems. One fundamental numerical difficulty\nis that random samples in the training set introduce statistical errors into\nthe discretization of loss functional which may become the dominant error in\nthe final approximation, and therefore overshadow the modeling capability of\nthe neural network. In this work, we propose a new minmax formulation to\noptimize simultaneously the approximate solution, given by a neural network\nmodel, and the random samples in the training set, provided by a deep\ngenerative model. The key idea is to use a deep generative model to adjust\nrandom samples in the training set such that the residual induced by the\napproximate PDE solution can maintain a smooth profile when it is being\nminimized. Such an idea is achieved by implicitly embedding the Wasserstein\ndistance between the residual-induced distribution and the uniform distribution\ninto the loss, which is then minimized together with the residual. A nearly\nuniform residual profile means that its variance is small for any normalized\nweight function such that the Monte Carlo approximation error of the loss\nfunctional is reduced significantly for a certain sample size.

In addition, the process of mapping\nfrom a low-resolution feature space to a high-resolution feature space is a\none-to-many problem that may have multiple solutions.

To highlight the\nareas of semantic changes, previous effort mostly pays attention to learning\nrepresentative feature descriptors of a single image, while the difference\ninformation is either modeled with simple difference operations or implicitly\nembedded via feature interactions. Nevertheless, such difference modeling can\nbe noisy since it suffers from non-semantic changes and lacks explicit guidance\nfrom image content or context. In this paper, we revisit the importance of\nfeature difference for change detection in RSI, and propose a series of\noperations to fully exploit the difference information: Alignment, Perturbation\nand Decoupling (APD). Firstly, alignment leverages contextual similarity to\ncompensate for the non-semantic difference in feature space. Next, a difference\nmodule trained with semantic-wise perturbation is adopted to learn more\ngeneralized change estimators, which reversely bootstraps feature extraction\nand prediction. Finally, a decoupled dual-decoder structure is designed to\npredict semantic changes in both content-aware and content-agnostic manners.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on benchmarks of LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD and\nDSIFN-CD, demonstrating our proposed operations bring significant improvement\nand achieve competitive results under similar comparative conditions.

Specifically,\nwe demonstrate that step-wise latent distribution alignment is essential for\ngenerating high-quality variations. To attain this, we design a cross-image\nself-attention injection for feature interaction and a step-wise distribution\nnormalization to align the latent features. Incorporating these alignment\nprocesses into a diffusion model allows RIVAL to generate high-quality image\nvariations without further parameter optimization. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods with\nrespect to semantic-condition similarity and perceptual quality. Furthermore,\nthis generalized inference pipeline can be easily applied to other\ndiffusion-based generation tasks, such as image-conditioned text-to-image\ngeneration and example-based image inpainting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 04:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Thus it is very\nattractive to extend hybrid learning for the computer vision tasks by\nseamlessly integrating structured knowledge with data samples to achieve more\neffective representation learning. However, such a hybrid learning approach\nremains a great challenge due to the huge gap between the structured knowledge\nand the deep features (learned from data samples) on both dimensions and\nknowledge granularity.

Many of these applications have inequality\nconstraints, usually encoded as penalization terms in the QUBO formulation\nusing additional variables known as slack variables. The slack variables have\ntwo disadvantages: (i) these variables extend the search space of optimal and\nsuboptimal solutions, and (ii) the variables add extra qubits and connections\nto the quantum algorithm. Recently, a new method known as unbalanced\npenalization has been presented to avoid using slack variables. This method\noffers a trade-off between additional slack variables to ensure that the\noptimal solution is given by the ground state of the Ising Hamiltonian, and\nusing an unbalanced heuristic function to penalize the region where the\ninequality constraint is violated with the only certainty that the optimal\nsolution will be in the vicinity of the ground state.

Specifically, consider a set of $n$ events $S=\\{x_1, \\ldots,\nx_n\\}$, where each event $x_i$ has an associated probability $p(x_i)$. The\nsubset sampling problem aims to sample a subset $T \\subseteq S$, such that\nevery $x_i$ is independently included in $S$ with probability $p_i$. A naive\nsolution is to flip a coin for each event, which takes $O(n)$ time. However,\nthe specific goal is to develop data structures that allow drawing a sample in\ntime proportional to the expected output size $\\mu=\\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)$, which\ncan be significantly smaller than $n$ in many applications. The subset sampling\nproblem serves as an important building block in many tasks and has been the\nsubject of various research for more than a decade. However, most of the\nexisting subset sampling approaches are conducted in a static setting, where\nthe events or their associated probability in set $S$ is not allowed to be\nchanged over time. These algorithms incur either large query time or update\ntime in a dynamic setting despite the ubiquitous time-evolving events with\nchanging probability in real life. Therefore, it is a pressing need, but still,\nan open problem, to design efficient dynamic subset sampling algorithms. In\nthis paper, we propose ODSS, the first optimal dynamic subset sampling\nalgorithm.

This class of dynamics is based on the\nframework of mass action kinetics, which models the evolution of systems of\nentities under pairwise interactions, and captures a number of important\nnonlinear models from various fields, including chemical reaction networks,\nBoltzmann's model of an ideal gas, recombination in population genetics and\ngenetic algorithms. In the context of spin systems, it is a natural\ngeneralization of linear dynamics based on Markov chains, such as Glauber\ndynamics and block dynamics, which are by now well understood. However, the\ninherent nonlinearity makes the dynamics much harder to analyze, and rigorous\nquantitative results so far are limited to processes which converge to\nessentially trivial stationary distributions that are product measures. In this\npaper we provide the first quantitative convergence analysis for natural\nnonlinear dynamics in a combinatorial setting where the stationary distribution\ncontains non-trivial correlations, namely the Ising model at high temperatures.\nWe prove that nonlinear versions of both the Glauber dynamics and the block\ndynamics converge to the Gibbs distribution of the Ising model (with given\nexternal fields) in times $O(n\\log n)$ and $O(\\log n)$ respectively, where $n$\nis the size of the underlying graph (number of spins).

This lack of precision presents a\nfundamental limitation when studying brain-behaviour associations. Previously,\nwe developed a novel modelling approach that leverages continuous performance\nrecordings from large-cohort studies to achieve an iterative decomposition of\ncognitive tasks (IDoCT), which outputs data-driven estimates of cognitive\nabilities, and device and visuomotor latencies, whilst recalibrating\ntrial-difficulty scales. Here, we further validate the IDoCT approach with UK\nBioBank imaging data.

The method can be interpreted as approximating a classification rule\nbased on Gaussian Process posterior variance. PEC offers several practical\nadvantages, including sample efficiency, ease of tuning, and effectiveness even\nwhen data are presented one class at a time. Our empirical results show that\nPEC performs strongly in single-pass-through-data CIL, outperforming other\nrehearsal-free baselines in all cases and rehearsal-based methods with moderate\nreplay buffer size in most cases across multiple benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 07:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Current mainstream neural-network speaker\nanonymization systems disentangle speech into prosody-related, content, and\nspeaker representations. The speaker representation is then anonymized by a\nselection-based speaker anonymizer that uses a mean vector over a set of\nrandomly selected speaker vectors from an external pool of English speakers.\nHowever, the resulting anonymized vectors are subject to severe privacy leakage\nagainst powerful attackers, reduction in speaker diversity, and language\nmismatch problems for unseen language speaker anonymization. To generate\ndiverse, language-neutral speaker vectors, this paper proposes an anonymizer\nbased on an orthogonal Householder neural network (OHNN). Specifically, the\nOHNN acts like a rotation to transform the original speaker vectors into\nanonymized speaker vectors, which are constrained to follow the distribution\nover the original speaker vector space.

Trained and tested on over 300,000\ndistinct features across three imaging types, the model shows promising\nresults, achieving an accuracy of 95.4% and outperforming metrics of current\ngold standard diagnostics. 32 optimal features from the imaging data were\nidentified and classified as candidate biomarkers using an independent samples\nt-test, in which functional features such as neural activity and connectivity\nin various brain regions exhibited the highest differences in the mean values\nbetween individuals with autism and typical control subjects. The p-values of\nthese biomarkers were < 0.001, proving the statistical significance of the\nresults and indicating that this research could pave the way towards the usage\nof neuroimaging in conjunction with behavioral criteria in clinics.\nFurthermore, the salient features discovered in the brain structure of\nindividuals with autism could lead to a more profound understanding of the\nunderlying neurobiological mechanisms of the disorder, which remains one of the\nmost substantial enigmas in the field even today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 08:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose SUbgraph Retrieval-augmented GEneration (SURGE), a\nframework for generating context-relevant and knowledge-grounded dialogues with\nthe KG. Specifically, our SURGE framework first retrieves the relevant subgraph\nfrom the KG, and then enforces consistency across facts by perturbing their\nword embeddings conditioned by the retrieved subgraph. Then, we utilize\ncontrastive learning to ensure that the generated texts have high similarity to\nthe retrieved subgraphs.

In the majority of\ncases, these described systems propose a method based on the result of a single\ntest performed on either the executable code, the process under investigation,\nits behaviour, or its output. In a small subset of ransomware detection\nsystems, the concept of a scorecard is employed where multiple tests are\nperformed on various aspects of a process under investigation and their results\nare then analysed using machine learning. The purpose of this paper is to\npropose a new majority voting approach to ransomware detection by developing a\nmethod that uses a cumulative score derived from discrete tests based on\ncalculations using algorithmic rather than heuristic techniques. The paper\ndescribes 23 candidate tests, as well as 9 Windows API tests which are\nvalidated to determine both their accuracy and viability for use within a\nransomware detection system. Using a cumulative score calculation approach to\nransomware detection has several benefits, such as the immunity to the\noccasional inaccuracy of individual tests when making its final classification.\nThe system can also leverage multiple tests that can be both comprehensive and\ncomplimentary in an attempt to achieve a broader, deeper, and more robust\nanalysis of the program under investigation. Additionally, the use of multiple\ncollaborative tests also significantly hinders ransomware from masking or\nmodifying its behaviour in an attempt to bypass detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 08:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

These species are usually assumed to be formed\nin chemical equilibrium. The time-dependent effects of hydrodynamics can affect\nthe formation and dissociation of these species and may lead to deviations from\nchemical equilibrium. We aim to model departures from chemical equilibrium in\ndwarf stellar atmospheres by considering time-dependent chemical kinetics\nalongside hydrodynamics and radiation transfer. We examine the effects of a\ndecreasing metallicity and an altered C/O ratio on the chemistry when compared\nto the equilibrium state. We used the radiation-(magneto)hydrodynamics code\nCO5BOLD, and its own chemical solver to solve for the chemistry of 15 species\nand 83 reactions. The species were treated as passive tracers and were advected\nby the velocity field. The steady-state chemistry was also computed to isolate\nthe effects of hydrodynamics.\n  In most of the photospheres in the models we present, the mean deviations are\nsmaller than $0.2$ dex, and they generally appear above $\\log{\\tau} = -2$. The\ndeviations increase with height because the chemical timescales become longer\nwith decreasing density and temperature. A reduced metallicity similarly\nresults in longer chemical timescales and in a reduction in yield that is\nproportional to the drop in metallicity; a decrease by a factor $100$ in\nmetallicity loosely corresponds to an increase by factor $100$ in chemical\ntimescales. As both CH and OH are formed along reaction pathways to CO, the C/O\nratio means that the more abundant element gives faster timescales to the\nconstituent molecular species. Overall, the carbon enhancement phenomenon seen\nin very metal-poor stars is not a result of an improper treatment of molecular\nchemistry for stars up to a metallicity as low as [Fe/H] = $-3.0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 08:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

With the rise of large MoD systems and the availability of open\ntravel demand datasets for many US cities, there is now an opportunity to\nevaluate these algorithms on standardized, realistic, and representative\ninstances.

In this\nsetting, we reveal that the success of CoT can be attributed to breaking down\nin-context learning of a compositional function into two distinct phases:\nfocusing on data related to each step of the composition and in-context\nlearning the single-step composition function. Through both experimental and\ntheoretical evidence, we demonstrate how CoT significantly reduces the sample\ncomplexity of in-context learning (ICL) and facilitates the learning of complex\nfunctions that non-CoT methods struggle with. Furthermore, we illustrate how\ntransformers can transition from vanilla in-context learning to mastering a\ncompositional function with CoT by simply incorporating an additional layer\nthat performs the necessary filtering for CoT via the attention mechanism. In\naddition to these test-time benefits, we highlight how CoT accelerates\npretraining by learning shortcuts to represent complex functions and how\nfiltering plays an important role in pretraining.

Furthermore, we developed a virtual projection-based\nfiltered backprojection (V-FBP) algorithm to address truncated projection,\nalbeit with a trade-off in acquisition efficiency (high resolution\nreconstruction typically requires thousands of source samplings). In this\npaper, we present a new algorithm for mSTCT reconstruction,\nbackprojection-filtration (BPF), which enables reconstructions of\nhigh-resolution images with a low source sampling ratio. Additionally, we found\nthat implementing derivatives in BPF along different directions (source and\ndetector) yields two distinct BPF algorithms (S-BPF and D-BPF), each with its\nown reconstruction performance characteristics. Through simulated and real\nexperiments conducted in this paper, we demonstrate that achieving same\nhigh-resolution reconstructions, D-BPF can reduce source sampling by 75%\ncompared with V-FBP. S-BPF shares similar characteristics with V-FBP, where the\nspatial resolution is primarily influenced by the source sampling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 09:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

In the training of cross-lingual models, we employ knowledge\ndistillation techniques to fit two semantic spaces into a mixed semantic space.\nWe abandon traditional static clustering methods like K-Means and AGNES in\nfavor of the incremental clustering algorithm Single-Pass, which we further\nmodify to better suit cross-lingual news clustering scenarios. Our main\ncontributions are as follows: (1) We adopt the English standard BERT as the\nteacher model and XLM-Roberta as the student model, training a cross-lingual\nmodel through knowledge distillation that can represent sentence-level\nbilingual texts in both Chinese and English. (2) We use the LDA topic model to\nrepresent news as a combina-tion of cross-lingual vectors for headlines and\ntopic probability distributions for con-tent, introducing concepts such as\ntopic similarity to address the cross-lingual issue in news content\nrepresentation.

Even though Petschek-like reconnection\noccurred with the current density-proportional resistivity while the other two\ncases mainly followed plasmoid-mediated reconnection, the large-scale evolution\nof thermodynamical quantities such as temperature and density are quite similar\nbetween the three cases. For the 1D experiment, some recalibration of the\ndiffusion parameters is needed to obtain comparable results. Specifically the\nhyper-diffusion and the drift velocity-dependent resistivity model needed only\nminor adjustments, while the current density-proportional model needed a\nrescaling of several orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 09:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

To conduct a comprehensive evaluation, we collect\ndata in a variety of driving environments and perceptual conditions and show\nthat our method produces reliable estimations in various environments.

Moreover, since the goal of motion retargeting\nis to abstract and transfer motion dynamics, effective solutions might coincide\nwith expressive and powerful human motion models in which operations such as\ncleaning or editing are easier. In this article, we present a novel abstract\nrepresentation of human motion agnostic to skeleton topology and morphology.\nBased on transformers, our model is able to encode and decode motion sequences\nwith variable morphology and topology -- extending the scope of retargeting --\nwhile supporting skeleton topologies not seen during the training phase.

Existing approaches relieve this challenge by adopting an open-loop\nparadigm decomposing high-level instructions into simple sub-task plans, and\nexecuting them step-by-step using low-level control models. However, these\napproaches are short of instant observations in multi-step reasoning, leading\nto sub-optimal results.

However, they typically achieve lower sample quality compared to\nstate-of-the-art score-based diffusion models (DMs). This paper provides a\nsignificant step in the direction of addressing this limitation. The idea is to\nborrow one of the strengths of score-based DMs, which is the ability to perform\naccurate density estimation in low-density regions and to address manifold\noverfitting by means of data mollification. We connect data mollification\nthrough the addition of Gaussian noise to Gaussian homotopy, which is a\nwell-known technique to improve optimization. Data mollification can be\nimplemented by adding one line of code in the optimization loop, and we\ndemonstrate that this provides a boost in generation quality of\nlikelihood-based GMs, without computational overheads.

In a way similar to several recent\nexperimental works, non-linearities develop through the establishment of a set\nof internal wave modes at discrete frequencies, when the forcing amplitude is\nincreased. We show that the most energetic of these modes are resonant\neigenmodes of the fluid domain. The discretization of the energy in frequency\nand wavenumber associated to the emergence of these modes prevents the flow\nfrom approaching a regime described by the Weak/Wave Turbulence Theory, in\nwhich a forward cascade carried by a statistical ensemble of weakly non-linear\nwaves in an infinite domain forms an energy continuum in the frequency and\nwavenumber spaces.

Existing research shows\nthat applicants \"play the system\" by submitting school rankings strategically.\nWe investigate whether applicants also play the system by manipulating their\neligibility at schools. We analyze this applicant deception in a theoretical\nmodel and provide testable predictions for commonly-used admission procedures.\nWe confirm these model predictions empirically by analyzing the implementation\nof two reforms. First, we find that the introduction of a residence-based\nschool-admission criterion in Denmark caused address changes to increase by\nmore than 100% before the high-school application deadline. This increase\noccurred only in areas where the incentive to manipulate is high-powered.\nSecond, to assess whether this behavior reflects actual address changes, we\nstudy a second reform that required applicants to provide additional proof of\nplace of residence to approve an address change. The second reform\nsignificantly reduced address changes around the school application deadline,\nsuggesting that the observed increase in address changes mainly reflects\nmanipulation. The manipulation is driven by applicants from more affluent\nhouseholds and their behavior affects non-manipulating applicants.\nCounter-factual simulations show that among students not enrolling in their\nfirst listed school, more than 25% would have been offered a place in the\nabsence of address manipulation and their peer GPA is 0.2SD lower due to the\nmanipulative behavior of other applicants. Our findings show that popular\nschool choice systems give applicants the incentive to play the system with\nreal implications for non-strategic applicants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 11:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

In this work, we propose a novel setup for\nmorphology-agnostic RL, dubbed Subequivariant Graph RL in 3D environments\n(3D-SGRL). Specifically, we first introduce a new set of more practical yet\nchallenging benchmarks in 3D space that allows the agent to have full\nDegree-of-Freedoms to explore in arbitrary directions starting from arbitrary\nconfigurations.

Factors such as electrical conductivity's\nimpact on forward modeling accuracy, complex vessel networks, data acquisition\nlimitations (especially in MRI), and blood flow phenomena are considered.\nMethods: The Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) govern the non-Newtonian flow model\nused in this study. The solver comprises two stages: the first solves the\npressure field using a dynamical pressure-Poisson equation derived from NSEs,\nand the second updates the velocity field using Leray regularization and the\npressure distribution from the first stage. The Carreau-Yasuda model\nestablishes the connection between blood velocity and viscosity. Blood\nconcentration in microvessels is approximated using Fick's law of diffusion,\nand conductivity mapping is obtained via Archie's law.

Results: The results suggest the establishment of a\ndynamic model of cerebral blood flow for arterial and microcirculation.

Our\nresults quantify the costs of heavy-tailedness on the fundamental difficulty of\nchange point testing problems for high-dimensional data by comparing to the\nprevious results under Gaussian assumptions.\n  To be specific, when the error vectors follow sub-Weibull distributions, a\nCUSUM-type statistic is shown to achieve a minimax testing rate up to\n$\\sqrt{\\log\\log(8n)}$. When the error distributions have polynomially-decaying\ntails, admitting bounded $\\alpha$-th moments for some $\\alpha \\geq 4$, we\nintroduce a median-of-means-type test statistic that achieves a near-optimal\ntesting rate in both dense and sparse regimes. In particular, in the sparse\nregime, we further propose a computationally-efficient test to achieve the\nexact optimality. Surprisingly, our investigation in the even more challenging\ncase of $2 \\leq \\alpha < 4$, unveils a new phenomenon that the minimax testing\nrate has no sparse regime, i.e. testing sparse changes is\ninformation-theoretically as hard as testing dense changes. This phenomenon\nimplies a phase transition of the minimax testing rates at $\\alpha = 4$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 12:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Existing prevalent tuning methods can be\ngenerally categorized into three genres: 1) prompt engineering by creating\nsuitable prompt texts, which is time-consuming and requires domain expertise;\n2) or simply fine-tuning the whole model, which is extremely inefficient; 3)\nprompt tuning through parameterized prompt embeddings with the text encoder.\nNevertheless, all methods rely on the text encoder for bridging the modality\ngap between vision and language. In this work, we question the necessity of the\ncumbersome text encoder for a more lightweight and efficient tuning paradigm as\nwell as more representative prompt embeddings closer to the image\nrepresentations. To achieve this, we propose a Concept Embedding Search (ConES)\napproach by optimizing prompt embeddings -- without the need of the text\nencoder -- to capture the 'concept' of the image modality through a variety of\ntask objectives.

Extensive experiments show that our approach can beat the\nprompt tuning and textual inversion methods in a variety of downstream tasks\nincluding objection detection, instance segmentation, and image generation.

In this paper, we address the\nproblem of uplink wideband channel estimation for IRS aided multiuser\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with hybrid architectures.\nCombining the structure of model driven and data driven deep learning\napproaches, a hybrid driven learning architecture is devised for joint\nestimation and learning the properties of the channels.

An arc\n$uv$ models a road segment connecting the two vertices $u$ and $v$. The cost\n$c(uv)$ of an arc $uv$ is the amount of energy the car needs to traverse the\narc. This amount may be positive, zero or negative. To make the problem\nrealistic, we assume there are no negative cycles.\n  The car has a battery that can store up to $B$ units of energy. It can\ntraverse an arc $uv\\in A$ only if it is at $u$ and the charge $b$ in its\nbattery satisfies $b\\ge c(uv)$. If it traverses the arc, it reaches $v$ with a\ncharge of $\\min(b-c(uv),B)$. Arcs with positive costs deplete the battery, arcs\nwith negative costs charge the battery, but not above its capacity of $B$.\n  Given $s,t\\in V$, can the car travel from $s$ to $t$, starting at $s$ with an\ninitial charge $b$, where $0\\le b\\le B$? If so, what is the maximum charge with\nwhich the car can reach $t$?

The solution of total least squares problems, i.e., solving\n$\\min_{E,f} \\| [E, f]\\|_F$ subject to $(A+E)x=b+f$, arises in numerous\napplication areas.

We use personas\nmethodology and self-determination theory to articulate their public engagement\nmotivation, challenges, and needs. We present our set of three personas: the\nphysicist who engages in informal physics for self-reflection, the physicist\nwho wants to spark interest and understanding in physics, and the physicist who\nwants to provide diverse role models to younger students and inspire them to\npursue a STEM career. Needs covered a range of resources including science\ncommunication training, community building among informal physics\npractitioners, and mechanisms to recognize, elevate and value informal physics.\nBy bringing user-centered design methodology to a new topical area of physics\neducation research, we expand our understanding of motivations and needs of\npractitioners in physics public engagement.

As one of the feasible processing-in-memory(PIM) architectures,\n3D-stacked-DRAM-based PIM(DRAM-PIM) architecture enables large-capacity memory\nand low-cost memory access, which is a promising solution for DNN accelerators\nwith better performance and energy efficiency. However, the low-cost\ncharacteristics of stacked DRAM and the distributed manner of memory access and\ndata storing require us to rebalance the hardware design and DNN mapping. In\nthis paper, we propose NicePIM to efficiently explore the design space of\nhardware architecture and DNN mapping of DRAM-PIM accelerators, which consists\nof three key components: PIM-Tuner, PIM-Mapper and Data-Scheduler. PIM-Tuner\noptimizes the hardware configurations leveraging a DNN model for classifying\narea-compliant architectures and a deep kernel learning model for identifying\nbetter hardware parameters. PIM-Mapper explores a variety of DNN mapping\nconfigurations, including parallelism between branches of DNN, DNN layer\npartitioning, DRAM capacity allocation and data layout pattern in DRAM to\ngenerate high-hardware-utilization DNN mapping schemes for various hardware\nconfigurations. The Data-Scheduler employs an integer-linear-programming-based\ndata scheduling algorithm to alleviate the inter-PIM-node communication\noverhead of data-sharing brought by DNN layer partitioning. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that NicePIM can optimize hardware configurations for\nDRAM-PIM systems effectively and can generate high-quality DNN mapping schemes\nwith latency and energy cost reduced by 37% and 28% on average respectively\ncompared to the baseline method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 13:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

In this regard, we propose a multi-source adversarial transfer\nlearning method based on local feature similarity to the source domain to\nhandle transfer scenarios where the source and target domains have only local\nsimilarities. This method extracts transferable local features between a single\nsource domain and the target domain through a sub-network. Specifically, the\nfeature extractor of the sub-network is induced by the domain discriminator to\nlearn transferable knowledge between the source domain and the target domain.\nThe extracted features are then weighted by an attention module to suppress\nnon-transferable local features while enhancing transferable local features. In\norder to ensure that the data from the target domain in different sub-networks\nin the same batch is exactly the same, we designed a multi-source domain\nindependent strategy to provide the possibility for later local feature fusion\nto complete the key features required. In order to verify the effectiveness of\nthe method, we made the dataset \"Local Carvana Image Masking Dataset\". Applying\nthe proposed method to the image segmentation task of the proposed dataset\nachieves better transfer performance than other multi-source transfer learning\nmethods.

Querying logically from an\nEVentuality-centric KG (EVKG) can naturally provide references to such kind of\nintuitive and logical inference. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new\nframework to leverage neural methods to answer complex logical queries based on\nan EVKG, which can satisfy not only traditional first-order logic constraints\nbut also implicit logical constraints over eventualities concerning their\noccurrences and orders.

Although there is a\nlarge amount of ultrasound image data in medical centers and other places,\nlabeled ultrasound datasets are a scarce resource, and it is likely that no\ndatasets are available for new tissues/organs. Transfer learning provides the\npossibility to solve this problem, but there are too many features in natural\nimages that are not related to the target domain. As a source domain, redundant\nfeatures that are not conducive to the task will be extracted. Migration\nbetween ultrasound images can avoid this problem, but there are few types of\npublic datasets, and it is difficult to find sufficiently similar source\ndomains. Compared with natural images, ultrasound images have less information,\nand there are fewer transferable features between different ultrasound images,\nwhich may cause negative transfer.

To alleviate the lack of knowledge in a\nsingle source domain, multi-source transfer learning is adopted to fuse\nknowledge from multiple source domains.

We propose DeepCCG, an empirical Bayesian approach to\nsolve this problem. DeepCCG works by updating the posterior of a class\nconditional Gaussian classifier such that the classifier adapts instantly to\nrepresentation shift. The use of a class conditional Gaussian classifier also\nenables DeepCCG to use a log conditional marginal likelihood loss to update the\nrepresentation, which can be seen as a new type of replay. To perform the\nupdate to the classifier and representation, DeepCCG maintains a fixed number\nof examples in memory and so a key part of DeepCCG is selecting what examples\nto store, choosing the subset that minimises the KL divergence between the true\nposterior and the posterior induced by the subset. We demonstrate the\nperformance of DeepCCG on a range of settings, including those with overlapping\ntasks which thus far have been under-explored. In the experiments, DeepCCG\noutperforms all other methods, evidencing its potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 14:40:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Although\nexisting SDN intelligent solution methods, which are based on deep\nreinforcement learning, can dynamically adapt to complex network link state\nchanges, these methods are plagued by problems such as redundant branches,\nlarge action space, and slow agent convergence. In this paper, an SDN\nintelligent multicast routing algorithm based on deep hierarchical\nreinforcement learning is proposed to circumvent the aforementioned problems.\nFirst, the multicast tree construction problem is decomposed into two\nsub-problems: the fork node selection problem and the construction of the\noptimal path from the fork node to the destination node. Second, based on the\ninformation characteristics of SDN global network perception, the multicast\ntree state matrix, link bandwidth matrix, link delay matrix, link packet loss\nrate matrix, and sub-goal matrix are designed as the state space of intrinsic\nand meta controllers. Then, in order to mitigate the excessive action space,\nour approach constructs different action spaces at the upper and lower levels.\nThe meta-controller generates an action space using network nodes to select the\nfork node, and the intrinsic controller uses the adjacent edges of the current\nnode as its action space, thus implementing four different action selection\nstrategies in the construction of the multicast tree. To facilitate the\nintelligent agent in constructing the optimal multicast tree with greater\nspeed, we developed alternative reward strategies that distinguish between\nsingle-step node actions and multi-step actions towards multiple destination\nnodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 14:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

The\ndefender must balance inhibiting the attacker against any negative effects of\nthe defense on benign users. Specifically, the defender's goals are: (a) to\nrecommend the shortest paths possible to users, (b) for the lengths of the\nshortest paths in the published graph to be close to those of the same paths in\nthe true graph, and (c) to minimize the probability of an attack.

Despite only being\ntrained for classification, PAGs cause robust models to have rudimentary\ngenerative capabilities, including image generation, denoising, and\nin-painting. However, the underlying mechanisms behind these phenomena remain\nunknown. In this work, we provide a first explanation of PAGs via\n\\emph{off-manifold robustness}, which states that models must be more robust\noff- the data manifold than they are on-manifold. We first demonstrate\ntheoretically that off-manifold robustness leads input gradients to lie\napproximately on the data manifold, explaining their perceptual alignment. We\nthen show that Bayes optimal models satisfy off-manifold robustness, and\nconfirm the same empirically for robust models trained via gradient norm\nregularization, noise augmentation, and randomized smoothing. Quantifying the\nperceptual alignment of model gradients via their similarity with the gradients\nof generative models, we show that off-manifold robustness correlates well with\nperceptual alignment. Finally, based on the levels of on- and off-manifold\nrobustness, we identify three different regimes of robustness that affect both\nperceptual alignment and model accuracy: weak robustness, bayes-aligned\nrobustness, and excessive robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 15:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

However, to harness this energy, organisms must transform matter from one\nchemical (redox) state to another. For example, photosynthetic organisms can\ncapture light energy by carrying out a pair of electron donor and acceptor\ntransformations (e.g., water to oxygen, CO$_2$ to organic carbon). Closure of\necosystems to matter requires that all such transformations are ultimately\nbalanced, i.e., other organisms must carry out corresponding reverse\ntransformations, resulting in cycles that are coupled to each other. A\nsustainable closed ecosystem thus requires self-organized cycles of matter, in\nwhich every transformation has sufficient thermodynamic favorability to\nmaintain an adequate number of organisms carrying out that process. Here, we\npropose a new conceptual model that explains the self-organization and emergent\nfeatures of closed ecosystems. We study this model with varying levels of\nmetabolic diversity and energy input, finding that several thermodynamic\nfeatures converge across ecosystems. Specifically, irrespective of their\nspecies composition, large and metabolically diverse communities self-organize\nto extract roughly 10% of the maximum extractable energy, or 100 fold more than\nrandomized communities. Moreover, distinct communities implement energy\nextraction in convergent ways, as indicated by strongly correlated fluxes\nthrough nutrient cycles. As the driving force from light increases, however,\nthese features -- fluxes and total energy extraction -- become more variable\nacross communities, indicating that energy limitation imposes tight\nthermodynamic constraints on collective metabolism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 15:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Along this direction, one representative\nstrategy is self-reflection, which asks an LLM to refine the solution with the\nfeedback generated by itself iteratively. However, our study shows that such\nreflection-style methods suffer from the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem:\nonce the LLM has established confidence in its solutions, it is unable to\ngenerate novel thoughts later through reflection even if its initial stance is\nincorrect. To address the DoT problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD)\nframework, in which multiple agents express their arguments in the state of\n\"tit for tat\" and a judge manages the debate process to obtain a final\nsolution. Clearly, our MAD framework encourages divergent thinking in LLMs\nwhich would be helpful for tasks that require deep levels of contemplation.\nExperiment results on two challenging datasets, commonsense machine translation\nand counter-intuitive arithmetic reasoning, demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour MAD framework. Extensive analyses suggest that the adaptive break of debate\nand the modest level of \"tit for tat\" state are required for MAD to obtain good\nperformance. Moreover, we find that LLMs might not be a fair judge if different\nLLMs are used for agents.

Empirically, we show that ELSA can achieve\nstate-of-the-art estimation performances without post-prediction calibrations,\nthus, gaining computational efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 15:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Indeed,\nsuch structures guarantee a better integration with a variety of other quantum\nmaterials or devices, which can aid the development of diamond-based quantum\ntechnologies, from nanophotonics to quantum sensing. A common approach for\nmembrane production is what is known as \"smart-cut\", a process where membranes\nare exfoliated from a diamond substrate after the creation of a thin\nsub-surface amorphous carbon layer by He$^+$ implantation. Due to the high ion\nfluence required, this process can be time-consuming. In this work, we\ndemonstrated the production of thin diamond membranes by neon implantation of\ndiamond substrates. With the target of obtaining membranes of $\\sim$ 200 nm\nthickness and finding the critical damage threshold, we implanted different\ndiamonds with 300 keV Ne$^+$ ions at different fluences. We characterized the\nstructural properties of the implanted diamonds and the resulting membranes\nthrough SEM, Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy.

We discuss a novel model that highlights the augmented value of\nprivate order flow for integrated builder searchers. We show that private order\nflow is complementary to top-of-block opportunities, and therefore integrated\nbuilder-searchers are more likely to participate in OFAs and outbid non\nintegrated builders.

Individual-level\ndiversity and system-level diversity are both important for industrial\nrecommender systems. The former focus on each single user's experience, while\nthe latter focus on the difference among users. Graph-based retrieval\nstrategies are inevitably hijacked by heavy users and popular items, leading to\nthe convergence of candidates for users and the lack of system-level diversity.\nMeanwhile, in the reranking phase, Determinantal Point Process (DPP) is\ndeployed to increase individual-level diverisity. Heavily relying on the\nsemantic information of items, DPP suffers from clickbait and inaccurate\nattributes. Besides, most studies only focus on one of the two levels of\ndiversity, and ignore the mutual influence among different stages in real\nrecommender systems. We argue that individual-level diversity and system-level\ndiversity should be viewed as an integrated problem, and we provide an\nefficient and deployable solution for web-scale recommenders. Generally, we\npropose to employ the retrieval graph information in diversity-based reranking,\nby which to weaken the hidden similarity of items exposed to users, and\nconsequently gain more graph explorations to improve the system-level\ndiveristy.

GraphCleaner combines the novel ideas of 1) Synthetic\nMislabel Dataset Generation, which seeks to generate realistic mislabels; and\n2) Neighborhood-Aware Mislabel Detection, where neighborhood dependency is\nexploited in both labels and base classifier predictions. Empirical evaluations\non 6 datasets and 6 experimental settings demonstrate that GraphCleaner\noutperforms the closest baseline, with an average improvement of 0.14 in F1\nscore, and 0.16 in MCC. On real-data case studies, GraphCleaner detects real\nand previously unknown mislabels in popular graph benchmarks: PubMed, Cora,\nCiteSeer and OGB-arxiv; we find that at least 6.91% of PubMed data is\nmislabelled or ambiguous, and simply removing these mislabelled data can boost\nevaluation performance from 86.71% to 89.11%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 10:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

DCMs are formed as random utility models (RUM), with their\nkey advantage of interpretability. However, a core requirement for the\nestimation of these models is a priori specification of the associated utility\nfunctions, making them sensitive to modelers' subjective beliefs. Recently,\nmachine learning (ML) approaches have emerged as a promising avenue for\nlearning unobserved non-linear relationships in DCMs. However, ML models are\nconsidered \"black box\" and may not correspond with expected relationships. This\npaper proposes a framework that expands the potential of data-driven approaches\nfor DCM by supporting the development of interpretable models that incorporate\ndomain knowledge and prior beliefs through constraints. The proposed framework\nincludes pseudo data samples that represent required relationships and a loss\nfunction that measures their fulfillment, along with observed data, for model\ntraining. The developed framework aims to improve model interpretability by\ncombining ML's specification flexibility with econometrics and interpretable\nbehavioral analysis.

Analogously, in monoclinic polar\ncrystals a nontrivial angle between non-degenerate dipolar phonon resonances\ncan naturally emerge due to asymmetries in their crystal lattice, and its\nvariations are associated with intriguing polaritonic phenomena, including\naxial dispersion, i.e., a rotation of the optical axis with frequency, and\nmicroscopic shear effects that result in asymmetric loss distributions. So far\nthese phenomena were restricted to specific mid-infrared frequencies, difficult\nto access with conventional lasers, and fundamentally limited by the degree of\nasymmetry and the strength of light-matter interactions available in natural\ncrystals. Here, we leverage twistronics to demonstrate giant axial dispersion\nand loss asymmetry of hyperbolic waves in elastic metasurfaces, by tailoring\nthe angle between coupled pairs of anisotropic metasurfaces.
