As information may\nbe eventually transmitted with efficiency stored in the phase and amplitude of\nspin waves, a topic of interest within Magnonics is the propagation of SW\nmodes. Thus, understanding mechanisms that may influence SW propagation is of\ninterest. Here the effect of localized surface geometric defects on\nmagnetostatic surface modes propagation is studied in ferromagnetic films and\nsemi-infinite media. Theoretical results are developed that allow to calculate\nthe scattering of these surface or Damon-Eshbach (DE) modes. A Green-Extinction\ntheorem is used to determine the scattering of incident surface modes, through\nthe determination of phase shifts of associated modes that are symmetric and\nanti-symmetric under inversion in the same geometry with geometric defects.\nChoosing localized symmetric depressions as geometric defects, scattering\ntransmission coefficients are determined that show perfect transmission at\nspecific frequencies or wave-lengths, that we associate with resonances in the\nsystem. Interestingly the system shows the appearance of localized modes in the\ndepression regions, with associated discrete frequencies immersed in the\ncontinuum spectrum of these surface DE modes. These localized modes have a\nshort wave-length content, and appear similarly in semi-infinite surfaces with\ndepressions. The latter indicates that these types of scattering effects should\nappear in all surfaces with roughness or more pronounced geometric defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 16:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

It is\nshown that by generalizing the entropic contribution to the free energy to\nallow for independent representations in each spectral domain, the free energy\nbecomes an upper bound to the exact one, attaining this limit as\nrepresentations approach Kohn-Sham eigenfunctions. A numerical procedure is\ndevised for effective calculation of the generalized entropy associated with\nspectral partitioning of the density matrix. The result is a powerful framework\nfor Kohn-Sham calculations of systems whose occupied subspaces span multiple\nenergy regimes.

As a result, these systems allow power utility\ncompanies to respond promptly to demands in the electricity market. Deep\nlearning (DL) models have been commonly employed in load forecasting problems\nsupported by adaptation mechanisms to cope with the changing pattern of\nconsumption by customers, known as concept drift. A drift magnitude threshold\nshould be defined to design change detection methods to identify drifts. While\nthe drift magnitude in load forecasting problems can vary significantly over\ntime, existing literature often assumes a fixed drift magnitude threshold,\nwhich should be dynamically adjusted rather than fixed during system evolution.\nTo address this gap, in this paper, we propose a dynamic drift-adaptive Long\nShort-Term Memory (DA-LSTM) framework that can improve the performance of load\nforecasting models without requiring a drift threshold setting.

Coronal rain is known to be deeply linked to\ncoronal heating, but its origin, dynamics, and morphology are still not well\nunderstood. The leading theory for its origin is thermal instability (TI)\noccurring in coronal loops in a state of thermal non-equilibrium (TNE), the\nTNE-TI scenario. Under steady heating conditions, TNE-TI repeats in cycles,\nleading to long-period EUV intensity pulsations and periodic coronal rain. In\nthis study, we investigate coronal rain on the large spatial scales of an\nactive region (AR) and over the long temporal scales of EUV intensity\npulsations to elucidate its distribution at such scales. We conduct a\nstatistical study of coronal rain observed over an AR off-limb with IRIS and\nSDO imaging data, spanning chromospheric to transition region (TR)\ntemperatures. The rain is widespread across the AR, irrespective of the loop\ninclination, and with minimal variation over the 5.45-hour duration of the\nobservation.

By allowing user-supplied eBPF programs to be\nexecuted directly in the kernel, it greatly increases the flexibility and\nefficiency of deploying customized logic. However, eBPF also introduces a new\nand wide attack surface: malicious eBPF programs may try to exploit the\nvulnerabilities in the eBPF subsystem in the kernel.\n  Fuzzing is a promising technique to find such vulnerabilities. Unfortunately,\nour experiments with the state-of-the-art kernel fuzzer, Syzkaller, shows that\nit cannot effectively fuzz the eBPF runtime, those components that are in\ncharge of executing an eBPF program, for two reasons. First, the eBPF verifier\n(which is tasked with verifying the safety of eBPF programs) rejects many\nfuzzing inputs because (1) they do not comply with its required semantics or\n(2) they miss some dependencies, i.e., other syscalls that need to be issued\nbefore the program is loaded. Second, Syzkaller fails to attach and trigger the\nexecution of eBPF programs most of the times.\n  This paper introduces the BPF Runtime Fuzzer (BRF), a fuzzer that can satisfy\nthe semantics and dependencies required by the verifier and the eBPF subsystem.\nOur experiments show, in 48-hour fuzzing sessions, BRF can successfully execute\n8x more eBPF programs compared to Syzkaller. Moreover, eBPF programs generated\nby BRF are much more expressive than Syzkaller's. As a result, BRF achieves\n101% higher code coverage.

Layden, et al., arXiv:2203.12497 (2022)] which uses outputs\nfrom quantum circuits as the proposal distributions. In this work, we propose\nthe use of Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) for quantum-enhanced MCMC\nand provide a strategy to optimize its parameter to improve convergence speed\nwhile keeping its depth shallow. The proposed QAOA-type circuit is designed to\nsatisfy the specific constraint which quantum-enhanced MCMC requires with\narbitrary parameters. Through our extensive numerical analysis, we find a\ncorrelation in certain parameter range between an experimentally measurable\nvalue, acceptance rate of MCMC, and the spectral gap of the MCMC transition\nmatrix, which determines the convergence speed. This allows us to optimize the\nparameter in the QAOA circuit and achieve quadratic speedup in convergence.\nSince MCMC is used in various areas such as statistical physics and machine\nlearning makes, this work represents an important step toward realizing\npractical quantum advantage with currently available quantum computers through\nquantum-enhanced MCMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 16:47:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

The\nMultivariate Bayesian Autoregressive Decomposition (MBMARD) is proposed as an\nintuitive and novel Bayesian non-parametric model to represent high-dimensional\nsignals as a low-dimensional mixture of univariate uncorrelated latent\noscillations. Each latent oscillation captures a specific underlying\noscillatory activity and hence will be modeled as a unique second-order\nautoregressive process due to a compelling property that its spectral density\nhas a shape characterized by a unique frequency peak and bandwidth, which are\nparameterized by a location and a scale parameter.

Influence maximiza-\ntion (IM) algorithms aim to identify individuals who will generate the greatest\nspread through the social network if provided with information, and have been\nlargely devel- oped with marketing in mind. In social networks with community\nstructure, which are very common, IM algorithms focused solely on maximizing\nspread may yield signifi- cant disparities in information coverage between\ncommunities, which is problematic in settings such as public health messaging.\nWhile some IM algorithms aim to remedy disparity in information coverage using\nnode attributes, none use the empirical com- munity structure within the\nnetwork itself, which may be beneficial since communities directly affect the\nspread of information. Further, the use of empirical network struc- ture allows\nus to leverage community detection techniques, making it possible to run\nfair-aware algorithms when there are no relevant node attributes available, or\nwhen node attributes do not accurately capture network community structure. In\ncontrast to other fair IM algorithms, this work relies on fitting a model to\nthe social network which is then used to determine a seed allocation strategy\nfor optimal fair information spread. We develop an algorithm to determine\noptimal seed allocations for expected fair coverage, defined through maximum\nentropy, provide some theoretical guarantees under appropriate conditions, and\ndemonstrate its empirical accuracy on both simu- lated and real networks.\nBecause this algorithm relies on a fitted network model and not on the network\ndirectly, it is well-suited for partially observed and noisy social networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 16:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

However, it is just as important that\nour interpretability methods are faithful to the causal dynamics underlying\nmodel behavior and able to robustly generalize to unseen inputs. Distributed\nAlignment Search (DAS) is a powerful gradient descent method grounded in a\ntheory of causal abstraction that uncovered perfect alignments between\ninterpretable symbolic algorithms and small deep learning models fine-tuned for\nspecific tasks. In the present paper, we scale DAS significantly by replacing\nthe remaining brute-force search steps with learned parameters -- an approach\nwe call DAS. This enables us to efficiently search for interpretable causal\nstructure in large language models while they follow instructions. We apply DAS\nto the Alpaca model (7B parameters), which, off the shelf, solves a simple\nnumerical reasoning problem. With DAS, we discover that Alpaca does this by\nimplementing a causal model with two interpretable boolean variables.\nFurthermore, we find that the alignment of neural representations with these\nvariables is robust to changes in inputs and instructions. These findings mark\na first step toward deeply understanding the inner-workings of our largest and\nmost widely deployed language models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 17:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Those flows are in-turn thought to sustain both the Sun's\nturbulent EMF and the large-scale flows of differential rotation and meridional\ncirculation suspected of influencing the dynamo's organization and timing.\nContinued progress in this area is complicated by (i) inconsistencies between\nhelioseismic measurements of convective and meridional flow made with different\ntechniques and instruments, and (ii) a lack of high-latitude data for\nconvection, differential rotation, and meridional flow.

This issue\nbecomes more challenging in medical images since the abnormalities related to\ndiseases can be tiny, and are easy to be corrupted (e.g., being cropped out) in\nthe current scheme of random augmentation. In this work, we first demonstrate\nthat, for widely-used X-ray images, the conventional augmentation prevalent in\ncontrastive pre-training can affect the performance of the downstream diagnosis\nor classification tasks. Then, we propose a novel augmentation method, i.e.,\nFocusContrast, to learn from radiologists' gaze in diagnosis and generate\ncontrastive views for medical images with guidance from radiologists' visual\nattention. Specifically, we track the gaze movement of radiologists and model\ntheir visual attention when reading to diagnose X-ray images. The learned model\ncan predict visual attention of the radiologists given a new input image, and\nfurther guide the attention-aware augmentation that hardly neglects the\ndisease-related abnormalities.

We find that the energy\nand radius of a dark energy halo are approximately given by $E_{\\rm halo} \\sim\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^2 \\varphi \\, m$ and $r_{\\rm halo} \\sim\n\\sqrt{\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\,\\varphi ({R}/{H})}$, where $\\varphi=Gm/(R c^2)$, $m$\nand $R$ are, respectively, the mass and radius of the associated dark matter\nobject, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = -(8\\pi G)^{-1/2} d \\ln m/d \\phi$ is the\nnonminimal coupling strength parameter, $H$ is the Hubble parameter, $G$ is the\ngravitational constant, and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. We further\nshow that current observational limits on $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ over a wide\nredshift range lead to stringent constraints on $E_{\\rm halo}/m$ and,\ntherefore, on the impact of dark energy halos on the value of the dark energy\nequation of state parameter.

We\npreviously argued that such corrections cannot be considered consistently\nwithout taking all the terms at the same order of approximation, which due to\nthe unconventional power counting originating from the large gauge field,\ninvolve also higher covariant derivative terms. Here we confirm this,\nexplicitly computing subleading terms. To the order we explore, the theory is\nelegantly determined by the gauge field and frame, both given by the hopping\nfunctions, the torsion free spin connection of the frame, together with\ncoefficients for the higher derivative terms derived from lattice invariants.\nFor the first time we compute the metric that the Dirac field sees - the\n'electrometric' - to quadratic order in the deformation allowing us to describe\nthe subleading corrections to the dispersion relation for inhomogeneous\ndeformations originating from corrections to the frame.

At zeroth order in a binary's mass ratio, the smaller body moves on a\ngeodesic of the larger body's spacetime. Post-geodesic corrections describing\nforces driving the small body's worldline away from geodesics must be\nincorporated to model the system accurately. An important post-geodesic effect\nis the gravitational self-force, which describes the small body's interaction\nwith its own spacetime curvature. This effect includes the backreaction due to\ngravitational-wave emission that leads to the inspiral of the small body into\nthe black hole. When a spinning body orbits a black hole, its spin couples to\nspacetime curvature. This introduces another post-geodesic correction known as\nthe spin-curvature force. An osculating geodesic integrator that includes both\nthe backreaction due to gravitational waves and spin-curvature forces can be\nused to generate a spinning-body inspiral. In this paper, we use an osculating\ngeodesic integrator to combine the leading backreaction of gravitational waves\nwith the spin-curvature force. Our analysis only includes the leading\norbit-averaged dissipative backreaction, and examines the spin-curvature force\nto leading order in the small body's spin.

Firstly, the DopUS-Net combines the\nDoppler images with B-mode images to increase the segmentation accuracy and\nrobustness of small blood vessels.

Often, the microscopic system-bath coupling gives rise to a counter\nterm which adds to the bare Hamiltonian, exactly compensating for such\npotential distortion. On the other hand, when describing quantum dissipative\ndynamics with weak-coupling master equations, a number of `Lamb-shift terms'\nappear which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be neglected. And yet, the\npractice of vanishing both the counter term and Lamb-shift contributions is\nalmost universal; and, surprisingly, it gives excellent results. In this paper\nwe use a damped quantum harmonic oscillator to analytically show that\nsubtracting the reorganisation energy from the Hamiltonian and then suppressing\nthe Lamb-shift terms from the resulting master equation, does indeed yield an\nexcellent approximation to the exact steady state and long-time dynamics.

This unique strength holds a potential for\naccurate pose estimation of agile-legged robots, which has been a challenging\nproblem to tackle. Our framework leverages the benefits of both RGB-D and event\ncameras to achieve robust and accurate pose estimation, even during dynamic\nmaneuvers such as jumping and landing a quadruped robot, the Mini-Cheetah.

However, this transport is dramatically sensitive to anharmonic\ninteractions, including the unavoidable interaction with acoustic phonons\nresponsible for the transport decoherence, suppressing ballistic transport at\nlong distances. Here we show that this decoherence is substantially suppressed\nif the group velocity of optical phonons is less than the sound velocity of\nacoustic phonons; otherwise ballistic transport is substantially suppressed by\na Cherenkov's like emission of acoustic phonons. This conclusion is justified\nconsidering energy and momentum conservation during phonon absorption or\nemission and supported by the numerical evaluation of lifetimes of the optical\nphonons. It is also consistent with the recent experimental investigations of\nballistic optical phonon transport in oligomers with minor exception of\nrelatively short oligophenylenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 19:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

In this article, we introduce a new classifier, Jet Flow\nNetworks (JFNs), in an effort to address the question of whether IRC unsafe\ninformation provides additional discriminating power in jet classification.\nJFNs are permutation-invariant neural networks (deep sets) that take as input\nthe kinematic information of reconstructed subjets. The subjet radius serves as\na tunable hyperparameter, enabling the sensitivity to soft emissions and\nnonperturbative effects to be gradually increased as the subjet radius is\ndecreased. We demonstrate the performance of JFNs for quark vs. gluon and QCD\nvs. $Z$ jet tagging. For small subjet radii, the performance of JFNs is\nequivalent to the IRC-unsafe Particle Flow Networks (PFNs), demonstrating that\ninfrared-collinear unsafe information is not necessary to achieve strong\ndiscrimination for both cases. As the subjet radius is increased, the\nperformance of the JFNs remains essentially unchanged until physical thresholds\nthat we identify are crossed. For relatively large subjet radii, we show that\nthe JFNs may offer an increased model independence with a modest tradeoff in\nperformance compared to classifiers that use the full particle information of\nthe jet.

Traditional signature-based malware detection\nmethods have become ineffective in detecting new and unknown malware due to\ntheir rapid evolution.

In many modern applications, it is intractable to\nanalytically compute the Fisher information and Monte Carlo methods are used\ninstead. The standard Monte Carlo method produces estimates of the Fisher\ninformation that can be biased when the Monte-Carlo noise is non-negligible.\nMost problematic is noise in the derivatives as this leads to an overestimation\nof the available constraining power, given by the inverse Fisher information.\nIn this work we find another simple estimate that is oppositely biased and\nproduces an underestimate of the constraining power. This estimator can either\nbe used to give approximate bounds on the parameter constraints or can be\ncombined with the standard estimator to give improved, approximately unbiased\nestimates. Both the alternative and the combined estimators are asymptotically\nunbiased so can be also used as a convergence check of the standard approach.\nWe discuss potential limitations of these estimators and provide methods to\nassess their reliability.

The correlation\nbetween process parameters, morphology and performance obtained by GPR provides\nhints to the underlying physics, which are finally quantified by automated\nhigh-throughput drift-diffusion simulations.

However, some sequences are often missing in clinical\npractice due to time constraints or image artifacts, such as patient motion.\nConsequently, the ability to substitute missing modalities and gain\nsegmentation performance is highly desirable and necessary for the broader\nadoption of these algorithms in the clinical routine. In this work, we present\nthe establishment of the Brain MR Image Synthesis Benchmark (BraSyn) in\nconjunction with the Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention\n(MICCAI) 2023. The primary objective of this challenge is to evaluate image\nsynthesis methods that can realistically generate missing MRI modalities when\nmultiple available images are provided.

For the sparse component's action, we do a small 1D convolution.\nFor the low rank component, we replace the RPE MLP with linear interpolation\nand use asymmetric Structured Kernel Interpolation (SKI) (Wilson et. al. 2015)\nfor O(n) complexity: we provide rigorous error analysis. For causal models,\n\"fast\" causal masking (Katharopoulos et. al. 2020) negates SKI's benefits.\nWorking in the frequency domain, we avoid an explicit decay bias. To enforce\ncausality, we represent the kernel via the real part of its frequency response\nusing the RPE and compute the imaginary part via a Hilbert transform. This\nmaintains O(n log n) complexity but achieves an absolute speedup. Modeling the\nfrequency response directly is also competitive for bidirectional training,\nusing one fewer FFT. We set a speed state of the art on Long Range Arena (Tay\net. al. 2020) with minimal score degradation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 21:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

The challenge in doing this is to combine\nreplication (for reliability) and failure atomicity (for persistence) with\nconcurrency (for fully utilizing persistent memory bandwidth).

We present Blizzard -- a fault-tolerant,\nPMEM-optimized persistent programming runtime.

We consider here the orientation-dependent plasma-less etching of\nsilicon by molecular fluorine, which was previously established experimental.\nMoreover, this anisotropic process was implemented with atmospheric dry etching\n(ADE) technology. The nature of the anisotropy is that the etching in the (111)\ndirection of the Si surface is significantly slower than that in the (100) and\n(110) directions. Using DFT (density functional theory) simulations, we\nperformed quantum chemistry modelling of the reaction pathways determining the\nrates of the etching caused by F2 dissociative chemisorption and subsequent\nSi-Si bond breaking.

A charge density analysis indicates that F atoms attracts\nelectron density from the Si atoms giving them a positive charge, whereas the\nneighboring Si atoms unpassivated with fluorine have a negative charge. The\namount of positive charge increases with the number of F atoms bonded with\nsilicon. Si(100) and Si(110) incorporate a larger number of fluorine atoms than\nSi(111) resulting in the Si-Si bonds on these surfaces have a larger amount of\npositive charge. The lower reaction barrier and higher etch rate of Si(100) and\nSi(110) compared to Si(111) is explained by the fact that F2 molecule\napproaching the surface becomes negatively charged and more strongly attracts\nto the Si(100) and Si(110) surfaces than to the Si(111).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 21:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

However, the design\nand implementation of a quantum network is a holistic task that is way beyond\nthe scope of an abstract design problem. As such, a testbed on which multiple\ndisciplines can verify the design and implementation across a full networking\nstack has become a necessary infrastructure for the future development of\nquantum networks. In this work, we demonstrate the concept of quantum internet\nservice provider (QISP), in analogy to the conventional ISP that allows for the\nsharing of classical information between the network nodes. The QISP is\nsignificant for the next-generation quantum networks as it coordinates the\nproduction, management, control, and sharing of quantum information across the\nend-users of a quantum network. We construct a reconfigurable QISP comprising\nboth the quantum hardware and classical control software. Building on the\nfiber-based quantum-network testbed of the Center for Quantum Networks (CQN) at\nthe University of Arizona (UA), we develop an integrated QISP prototype based\non a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) architecture, whose classical control\nsoftware is abstracted and modularized as an open-source QISP framework. To\nverify and characterize the QISP's performance, we demonstrate multi-channel\nentanglement distribution and routing among multiple quantum-network nodes with\na time-energy entangled-photon source.

Our analysis encompasses both\nthe regret and the ratio objectives.\n  For these objectives, we derive an optimal mechanism in closed form as a\nfunction of the support and the number of buyers $n$. Our analysis reveals\nthree regimes of support information and a new class of robust mechanisms. i.)\nWith \"low\" support information, the optimal mechanism is a second-price auction\n(SPA) with a random reserve, a focal class in the earlier literature. ii.) With\n\"high\" support information, we show that second-price auctions are strictly\nsuboptimal, and an optimal mechanism belongs to a novel class of mechanisms we\nintroduce, which we call $\\textbf{pooling auctions}$ (POOL); whenever the\nhighest value is above a threshold, the mechanism still allocates to the\nhighest bidder, but otherwise the mechanism allocates to a uniformly random\nbuyer, i.e., pools low types. iii.) With \"moderate\" support information, a\nrandomization between SPA and POOL is optimal.\n  We also characterize optimal mechanisms within nested central subclasses of\nmechanisms: standard mechanisms (only allocate to the highest bidder), SPA with\nrandom reserve, and SPA with no reserve. We show strict separations across\nclasses, implying that deviating from standard mechanisms is necessary for\nrobustness. Lastly, we show that the same results hold under other distribution\nclasses that capture \"positive dependence\" (mixture of i.i.d., exchangeable and\naffiliated), as well as i.i.d. regular distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 23:23:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

There are also existing works on generating both\ntopology and edge weights of weighted graphs. Differently, we are interested in\ngenerating edge weights that are realistic in a macroscopic scope, merely from\nthe topology, which is unexplored and challenging. To this end, we explore and\nexploit the patterns involving edge weights and topology in real-world graphs.\nSpecifically, we divide each graph into layers where each layer consists of the\nedges with weights at least a threshold. We observe consistent and surprising\npatterns appearing in multiple layers: the similarity between being adjacent\nand having high weights, and the nearly-linear growth of the fraction of edges\nhaving high weights with the number of common neighbors. We also observe a\npower-law pattern that connects the layers. Based on the observations, we\npropose PEAR, an algorithm assigning realistic edge weights to a given\ntopology.

Usually, that force is considered to arise from the Lindblad and\ncorotation resonances with the embryo. However, more important contributions\nexist for low-mass planets. Radiative thermal diffusion in the vicinity of\nembryos yields an additional contribution to the disc's force that damps the\neccentricity and inclination much more vigorously than the resonant interaction\nwith the disc, and that in general induces fast inward migration. In addition,\nthe irradiation of the disc by a hot embryo gives rise to an additional\ncontribution that excites eccentricity and inclination, and induces outward\nmigration. Which of the two contributions dominates depends on the embryo's\nluminosity. We assess the importance of these contributions (termed thermal\nforces) on the dynamics and growth of a set of pebble-accreting embryos\ninitially of Martian mass, by means of N-body simulations that include analytic\nexpressions for the disc's force. We find very different outcomes for the\nembryos subjected to thermal forces and those subjected only to resonant\nforces. Importantly, we find that the median final mass of the embryos\nsubjected to thermal forces is nearly independent of the metallicity, whereas\nthis mass roughly scales with the metallicity when they are subjected only to\nresonant forces. These results can be explained by the strong damping of\neccentricity and inclination at low metallicity, which enhances the embryos'\naccretion efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 01:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Our main idea is to\nuse both the original visibility data in the spectral domain and dirty images\nin the spatial domain to guide the image generation process with DDPM. This\nway, we can leverage DDPM to generate fine details and eliminate noise, while\nutilizing visibility data to separate signals from noise and retaining spatial\ninformation in dirty images. We have conducted experiments in comparison with\nboth traditional methods and recent deep learning based approaches. Our results\nshow that our method significantly improves the resulting images by reducing\nartifacts, preserving fine details, and recovering dim sources. This\nadvancement further facilitates radio astronomical data analysis tasks on\ncelestial phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 03:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

CFT\nalgorithms offer high throughput and low latency, making them an attractive\noption for centralized operations that require fault tolerance. However, CFT\nconsensus is vulnerable to Byzantine faults, which can be introduced by a\nsingle corrupt component. Such faults can break consensus in the system.\nByzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms withstand Byzantine faults,\nbut they are not as competitive with CFT algorithms in terms of performance. In\nthis work, we explore a middle ground between BFT and CFT consensus by\nexploring the role of accountability in CFT protocols. That is, if a CFT\nprotocol node breaks protocol and affects consensus safety, we aim to identify\nwhich node was the culprit. Based on Raft, one of the most popular CFT\nalgorithms, we present Raft-Forensics, which provides accountability over\nByzantine faults. We theoretically prove that if two honest components fail to\nreach consensus, the Raft-Forensics auditing algorithm finds the adversarial\ncomponent that caused the inconsistency. In an empirical evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that Raft-Forensics performs similarly to Raft and significantly\nbetter than state-of-the-art BFT algorithms. With 256 byte messages,\nRaft-Forensics achieves peak throughput 87.8% of vanilla Raft at 46% higher\nlatency, while state-of-the-art BFT protocol Dumbo-NG only achieves 18.9% peak\nthroughput at nearly $6\\times$ higher latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 03:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

This strategy exposes\ncompile-time optimizations and high memory reuse while retaining readable,\nmaintainable, and compact code. Remote direct memory access, realized via\nCUDA-aware MPI, reduces communication times. We implement this approach in the\nopen-source solver MFC.

Previous work\nanalyzed inductive bias by training models with a few synthetic data and\ncomparing the model's generalization with candidate generalization patterns.\nHowever, when examining the output sequence frequency, previous methods cannot\nbe directly applied since enumerating candidate patterns is computationally\ndifficult for longer sequences. To this end, we propose to directly calculate\nthe output sequence frequency for each model by regarding the outputs of the\nmodel as discrete-time signals and applying frequency domain analysis.\nExperimental results showed that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated\nRecurrent Unit (GRU) have an inductive bias towards lower-frequency patterns,\nwhile Elman RNN tends to learn patterns in which the output changes at high\nfrequencies.

In this scenario, an additional species dominates the energy budget of\nthe universe at early times (before BBN), resulting in a larger cosmological\nexpansion rate at a given temperature compared to the standard\nradiation-dominated (RD) universe. To investigate the production of DM in the\nfreeze-in scenario, we consider both standard RD and NS cosmological picture\nbefore BBN and perform a comparative analysis. We extend the Standard Model\n(SM) particle content with a SM singlet DM particle $\\chi $ and an axion-like\nparticle (ALP) $a$. The interactions between ALP, SM particles, and DM are\ngenerated by higher dimensional effective operators. This setup allows the\nproduction of DM $\\chi$ from SM bath through the mediation of ALP, via\nALP-portal processes. These interactions involve non-renormalizable operators,\nleading to ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in, which depends on the reheating\ntemperature ($T_{RH}$) of the early universe. In the NS cosmological scenario,\nthe faster expansion rate suppresses the DM production processes, allowing for\nenhanced effective couplings between the visible and dark sectors to satisfy\nthe observed DM abundance compared to RD scenario.

This paper presents a\ndata-driven aerodynamic force prediction model based on a small number of\npressure sensors located on the surface of UAV. The model is built on a linear\nterm that can make a reasonably accurate prediction and a nonlinear correction\nfor accuracy improvement. The linear term is based on a reduced basis\nreconstruction of the surface pressure distribution, where the basis is\nextracted from numerical simulation data and the basis coefficients are\ndetermined by solving linear pressure reconstruction equations at a set of\nsensor locations. Sensor placement is optimized using the discrete empirical\ninterpolation method (DEIM). Aerodynamic forces are computed by integrating the\nreconstructed surface pressure distribution. The nonlinear term is an\nartificial neural network (NN) that is trained to bridge the gap between the\nground truth and the DEIM prediction, especially in the scenario where the DEIM\nmodel is constructed from simulation data with limited fidelity. A large\nnetwork is not necessary for accurate correction as the linear model already\ncaptures the main dynamics of the surface pressure field, thus yielding an\nefficient DEIM+NN aerodynamic force prediction model. The model is tested on\nnumerical and experimental dynamic stall data of a 2D NACA0015 airfoil, and\nnumerical simulation data of dynamic stall of a 3D drone. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that the machine learning enhanced model can make fast and accurate\npredictions of aerodynamic forces using only a few pressure sensors, even for\nthe NACA0015 case in which the simulations do not agree well with the wind\ntunnel experiments. Furthermore, the model is robust to noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 06:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

A geometric calibration of the Milky Way TRGB has the benefit of\nbeing independent of other distance indicators and will help probe systematics\nin the local distance ladder, leading to improved measurements of the Hubble\nconstant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 06:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

We propose fitting the components via extrinsic information\ntransfer (EXIT) charts to a desired behavior which enables scaling to larger\nmessage lengths ($k \\approx 1000$) while retaining competitive performance. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first autoencoder that performs close to\nclassical codes in this regime. Although the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss\nfunction optimizes the bit error rate (BER) of the components, the design via\nEXIT charts enables to focus on the block error rate (BLER). In serially\nconcatenated systems the component-wise TGP approach is well known for inner\ncomponents with a fixed outer binary interface, e.g., a learned inner code or\nequalizer, with an outer binary error correcting code. In this paper we extend\nthe component training to structures with an inner and outer autoencoder, where\nwe propose a new 1-bit quantization strategy for the encoder outputs based on\nthe underlying communication problem. Finally, we discuss the model complexity\nof the learned components during design time (training) and inference and show\nthat the number of weights in the encoder can be reduced by 99.96 %.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 06:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

In this\npresent work, we have studied the structural and electronic properties of\nMX$_2$ (M= Mo/W, X= S/Se) heterobilayers using first-principles calculations\nbased on density functional theory. Unlike the traditional homobilayers of\nTMDs, these heterobilayers result in broken inversion symmetry and alter their\npoint group from D$_{3d}$ $\\rightarrow$ C$_{3v}$. From the calculated Raman\nspectra of these heterobilayers, we have observed that the shear and layer\nbreathing modes (LBM) at lower frequencies ($<$ 50 cm$^{-1}$), arise due to the\ninterlayer interactions between the different monolayers. We have simulated the\nelectronic properties using the G$_0$W$_0$ method and perceived the nature of\nthe band gap which mainly depends on the chalcogen atoms. Our results clearly\nindicate that the band gap is of direct nature for hetero bilayers with\ndifferent chalcogen atoms and indirect nature for the same chalcogen based\nheterobilayers, with a band gap range between 1.4 to 1.7 eV. The exciton states\nof these materials are calculated with the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and\nfound that the binding energies of inter-layer exciton are of the order of\n$\\sim$ 250 meV, which makes them useful for infrared optoelectronic\napplications.

However, the use of terahertz\nimagers in real-world applications has been limited by the slow speed, large\nsize, high cost, and complexity of the existing imaging systems. These\nlimitations are mainly imposed due to the lack of terahertz focal-plane arrays\n(THz-FPAs) that can directly provide the frequency-resolved and/or\ntime-resolved spatial information of the imaged objects. Here, we report the\nfirst THz-FPA that can directly provide the spatial amplitude and phase\ndistributions, along with the ultrafast temporal and spectral information of an\nimaged object. It consists of a two-dimensional array of ~0.3 million plasmonic\nphotoconductive nanoantennas optimized to rapidly detect broadband terahertz\nradiation with a high signal-to-noise ratio. As the first proof-of-concept, we\nutilized the multispectral nature of the amplitude and phase data captured by\nthese plasmonic nanoantennas to realize pixel super-resolution imaging of\nobjects. We successfully imaged and super-resolved etched patterns in a silicon\nsubstrate and reconstructed both the shape and depth of these structures with\nan effective number of pixels that exceeds 1-kilo pixels. By eliminating the\nneed for raster scanning and spatial terahertz modulation, our THz-FPA offers\nmore than a 1000-fold increase in the imaging speed compared to the\nstate-of-the-art. Beyond this proof-of-concept super-resolution demonstration,\nthe unique capabilities enabled by our plasmonic photoconductive THz-FPA offer\ntransformative advances in a broad range of applications that use hyperspectral\nand three-dimensional terahertz images of objects for a wide range of\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 07:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

By developing a magnonic analog of the\nCasimir effect into non-Hermitian systems, we show that this non-Hermitian\nCasimir effect of magnons is enhanced as the Gilbert damping constant (i.e.,\nthe energy dissipation rate) increases.

The paradigms and\naims of Unreal Engine contrast with the industrial simulators typically used by\nthe scientific community. The visual quality and performance of its rendering\nengine increase the opportunities, especially for industries and simulation\nbusiness: where interoperability and scalability are required. The study of the\nfollowing issue `` Which architecture should we implement to integrate\nreal-world data, in an Unreal Engine 5 simulator and in a mixed-reality\nenvironment? '' offers a point of view. The topic is reexamined in an\ninnovative and conceptual way, such as the generalization of mixedreality\ntechnologies, Internet of Things, digital twins, Big Data but providing a\nsolution for simple and actual use cases. This paper gives a detailed analysis\nof the issue, at both theoretical and operational level. Then, the document\ngoes deep into Unreal Engine's operation in order to extract the vanilla\ncapabilities. Next, the C++ Plugin system is reviewed in details as well as the\nthird-party library integration: pitfalls to be avoided are shown. Finally, the\nlast chapter proposes a generic architecture, useful in large-scale industrial\n3D applications, such as collaborative work or hyper-connected simulators. This\ndocument might be of interest to an Unreal Engine expert who would like to\ndiscover about server architectures. Conversely, it could be relevant for an\nexpert in backend servers who wants to learn about Unreal Engine capabilities.\nThis research concludes that Unreal Engine's modularity enables integration\nwith almost any protocol. The features to integrate external real data are\nnumerous but depend on use cases. Distributed systems for Big Data require a\nscalable architecture, possibly without the use of the Unreal Engine dedicated\nserver. Environments, which require sub-second latency need to implement direct\nconnections, bypassing any intermediate servers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 07:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Both species (intruders and grains) are surrounded by an interstitial\nmolecular gas (background) that plays the role of a thermal bath. The influence\nof the latter on the motion of intruders and grains is modeled via a standard\nviscous drag force supplemented by a stochastic Langevin-like force\nproportional to the background temperature. We solve the corresponding\nEnskog--Lorentz kinetic equation by means of the Chapman--Enskog expansion\ntruncated to first order in the gradient of the intruder number density. The\nintegral equation for the diffusion coefficient is solved by considering the\nfirst two Sonine approximations. To test these results, we also compute the\ndiffusion coefficient from the numerical solution of the inelastic Enskog\nequation by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method.

Fault-tolerant systems in general\nare essential in assuring continuity of service for mission critical\napplications. However, their implementation may be challenging and expensive.\nIn this study, IoT Systems with Byzantine Fault-Tolerance are considered.\nAnalytical models and solutions are presented as well as a detailed analysis\nfor the evaluation of the availability. Byzantine Fault Tolerance is\nparticularly important for blockchain mechanisms, and in turn for IoT, since it\ncan provide a secure, reliable and decentralized infrastructure for IoT devices\nto communicate and transact with each other. The proposed model is based on\ncontinuous-time Markov chains, and it analyses the availability of Byzantine\nFault-Tolerant systems. While the availability model is based on a\ncontinuous-time Markov chain where the breakdown and repair times follow\nexponential distributions, the number of the Byzantine nodes in the network\nstudied follows various distributions. The numerical results presented report\navailability as a function of the number of participants and the relative\nnumber of honest actors in the system. It can be concluded from the model that\nthere is a non-linear relationship between the number of servers and network\navailability; i.e. the availability is inversely proportional to the number of\nnodes in the system. This relationship is further strengthened as the ratio of\nbreak-down rate over repair rate increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 08:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

FAS is usually considered a classification\nproblem, where each class is assumed to contain a single cluster optimized by\nsoftmax loss. In practical deployment, one class can contain several local\nclusters, and a single-center is insufficient to capture the inherent structure\nof the FAS data. However, few approaches consider large distribution\ndiscrepancies in the field of FAS. In this work, we propose a unified framework\ncalled Latent Distribution Adjusting (LDA) with properties of latent,\ndiscriminative, adaptive, generic to improve the robustness of the FAS model by\nadjusting complex data distribution with multiple prototypes. 1) Latent. LDA\nattempts to model the data of each class as a Gaussian mixture distribution,\nand acquire a flexible number of centers for each class in the last fully\nconnected layer implicitly. 2) Discriminative. To enhance the intra-class\ncompactness and inter-class discrepancy, we propose a margin-based loss for\nproviding distribution constrains for prototype learning. 3) Adaptive. To make\nLDA more efficient and decrease redundant parameters, we propose Adaptive\nPrototype Selection (APS) by selecting the appropriate number of centers\nadaptively according to different distributions. 4) Generic. Furthermore, LDA\ncan adapt to unseen distribution by utilizing very few training data without\nre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can 1) make\nthe final representation space both intra-class compact and inter-class\nseparable, 2) outperform the state-of-the-art methods on multiple standard FAS\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 08:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

We find that\nthere are two different reduced phase space regimes for the first harmonic line\nnode's order parameter.

In particular, we propose a multi-step prompt learning model\n(MsPrompt) for debiasing few-shot event detection, that consists of the\nfollowing three components: an under-sampling module targeting to construct a\nnovel training set that accommodates the true few-shot setting, a multi-step\nprompt module equipped with a knowledge-enhanced ontology to leverage the event\nsemantics and latent prior knowledge in the PLMs sufficiently for tackling the\ncontext-bypassing problem, and a prototypical module compensating for the\nweakness of classifying events with sparse data and boost the generalization\nperformance.

Here, we demonstrate the PTE response can be reshaped when\nCa3Ru2O7 undergoes meta-magnetic phase (MMP) transition driven by both\ntemperature and magnetic field. Firstly, a sign change is observed crossing TS\n= 48 K and the linear polarization angle dependent PTE current maximizes along\na-axis above TS while maximizes along b-axis below TS, which indicates that the\nantiferromagnetic spin order contributes to such spatial anisotropy. Secondly,\nin the temperature range of around 40 ~ 50 K, the PTE current is found to be\nsharply suppressed when external magnetic field is applied in plane along\na-axis but is only gradually suppressed when applied field is along b-axis\nwhich gives out two critical fields. We attribute such suppression of PTE\ncurrent under magnetic field to the suppression of the spin entropy in the\nphase transition between the antiferromagnetic state and the MMP state and the\nH-T phase diagrams of Ca3Ru2O7 is redrawn accordingly.

With the development of deep learning\ntechnology, many deep neural network-based NR-IQA methods have been developed,\nwhich try to learn the image quality based on the understanding of database\ninformation. Currently, Transformer has achieved remarkable progress in various\nvision tasks. Since the characteristics of the attention mechanism in\nTransformer fit the global perceptual impact of artifacts perceived by a human,\nTransformer is thus well suited for image quality assessment tasks. In this\npaper, we propose a Transformer based NR-IQA model using a predicted objective\nerror map and perceptual quality token. Specifically, we firstly generate the\npredicted error map by pre-training one model consisting of a Transformer\nencoder and decoder, in which the objective difference between the distorted\nand the reference images is used as supervision. Then, we freeze the parameters\nof the pre-trained model and design another branch using the vision Transformer\nto extract the perceptual quality token for feature fusion with the predicted\nerror map. Finally, the fused features are regressed to the final image quality\nscore. Extensive experiments have shown that our proposed method outperforms\nthe current state-of-the-art in both authentic and synthetic image databases.\nMoreover, the attentional map extracted by the perceptual quality token also\ndoes conform to the characteristics of the human visual system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 11:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

The power absorbed by the plasma and the effect of the induced\nplasma currents in lowering the inductance of the driver are based on data from\nthe dedicated S16 experimental campaign (y.~2020) of SPIDER: plasma electron\ndensities on the order of $10^{18}$ m$^{-3}$, electron temperatures $\\sim 10$\neV; neutral gas pressure $\\sim 0.3$ Pa and up to $50$ kW of net power per\ndriver.

To address such issues, this paper\nexplores the viability of multi-granular rationale extraction with consistency\nand faithfulness for explainable multi-hop fact verification. In particular,\ngiven a pretrained veracity prediction model, both the token-level explainer\nand sentence-level explainer are trained simultaneously to obtain\nmulti-granular rationales via differentiable masking.

To substantiate our argument, we extend the nematic bond theory; a\ndiagrammatic large-$N_s$ method, to non-Bravais lattices, and demonstrate that\nthe predicted state is indeed realized at low temperatures in a large region of\nexchange coupling space. We also carry out a spin wave calculation which\nsuggests that the sublattice pairing state is coplanar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 12:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

The rapid spread of misinformation has made it\nincreasingly difficult for people to separate truth from fiction, and this has\nthe potential to cause significant harm to individuals and society as a whole.\nIn addition, there currently exists an information gap with regard to internet\neducation, with many schools across America not having the teaching personnel\nnor resources to adequately educate their students about the dangers of the\ninternet, specifically with regard to misinformation in the political sphere.\nTo address the dangers of misinformation, some game developers have created\nvideo games that aim to educate players on the issue and help them develop\ncritical thinking skills. These games can be used to raise awareness about the\nimportance of verifying information before sharing it. By doing so, they can\nhelp reduce the spread of misinformation and promote a more informed and\ndiscerning public. They can also provide players with a safe and controlled\nenvironment to practice these skills and build confidence in their ability to\nevaluate information. However, these existing games often suffer from various\nshortcomings such as failing to adequately address how misinformation\nspecifically exploits the biases within people to be effective and rarely\ncovering how evolving modern technologies like sophisticated chatbots and deep\nfakes have made individuals even more vulnerable to misinformation. The purpose\nof this study is to create an educational misinformation game to address this\ninformation gap and investigate its efficacy as an educational tool while also\niterating on the designs for previous games in the space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 13:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Semi-supervised learning can be used to learn from both\nlabeled and unlabeled samples, alleviating the burden of manual labeling.\nHowever, obtaining a large number of unlabeled images in medical scenarios\nremains challenging. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-level Global\nContext Cross-consistency (MGCC) framework that uses images generated by a\nLatent Diffusion Model (LDM) as unlabeled images for semi-supervised learning.\nThe framework involves of two stages.

However, when implementing a mobility\nsystem with emerging technologies, estimating demand level becomes harder\nbecause of more uncertainties with user behaviors. Therefore, this study\nproposes an artificial intelligence-driven algorithm that combines sequential\ntransit network design with optimal learning. An operator gradually expands its\nroute system to avoid risks from inconsistency between designed routes and\nactual travel demand. At the same time, observed information is archived to\nupdate the knowledge that the operator currently uses. Three learning policies\nare compared within the algorithm: multi-armed bandit, knowledge gradient, and\nknowledge gradient with correlated beliefs.

We interpret\neach edge weight as the strength of the relationship between a pair of\nindividuals, with edges increasing in weight if pairs continually listen to\neach others' opinions and decreasing if not. We investigate the impact of\nvarious edge dynamics at different timescales on the opinion dynamic itself.\nThis is done partly through analytic results and partly through extensive\nnumerical simulations of two case studies: one using bounded confidence\ninteraction dynamics in the opinion formation process (as in the classical\nHegselmann-Krause model) and one using an exponentially decaying interaction\nfunction. We find that the dynamic edge weights can have a significant impact\non the opinion formation process, since they may result in consensus formation\nbut can also reinforce polarisation.

These three\nconditions result in a direct coupling between the plasma emitted from the Sun\n(namely the solar wind) and Mercury's surface. The planet's magnetic field\nleads to a non-trivial pattern of plasma precipitation onto the surface, that\nis expected to contribute to the alteration of the regolith over geological\ntime scales. The goal of this work is to study the solar wind plasma\nprecipitation onto the surface of Mercury from a geographical perspective, as\nopposed to the local-time-of-day approach of previous precipitation modeling\nstudies. We employ solar wind precipitation maps for protons and electrons from\ntwo fully-kinetic numerical simulations of Mercury's plasma environment. These\nmaps are then integrated over two full Mercury orbits (176 Earth days). We\nfound that the plasma precipitation pattern at the surface is most strongly\naffected by the upstream solar wind conditions, particularly by the\ninterplanetary magnetic field direction, and less by Mercury's 3:2 spin-orbit\nresonance. We also found that Mercury's magnetic field is able to shield the\nsurface from roughly 90% of the incoming solar wind flux. At the surface,\nprotons have a broad energy distribution from below 500 eV to more than 1.5\nkeV; while electrons are mostly found in the range 0.1-4 keV. These results\nwill help to better constrain space weathering and exosphere source processes\nat Mercury, as well as to interpret observations by the ongoing ESA/JAXA\nBepiColombo mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 14:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

However, this comes at the price of losing granularity in\nthe feature maps, limiting the ability to correctly understand images or\nrecover fine detail in dense prediction tasks. To address this, common practice\nis to replace the last few downsampling operations in a CNN with dilated\nconvolutions, allowing to retain the feature map resolution without reducing\nthe receptive field, albeit increasing the computational cost. This allows to\ntrade off predictive performance against cost, depending on the output feature\nresolution. By either regularly downsampling or not downsampling the entire\nfeature map, existing work implicitly treats all regions of the input image and\nsubsequent feature maps as equally important, which generally does not hold. We\npropose an adaptive downsampling scheme that generalizes the above idea by\nallowing to process informative regions at a higher resolution than less\ninformative ones.

However,\ndifferent from video enhancement algorithms, almost all existing Video Quality\nAssessment (VQA) models are built generally rather than specifically, which\nmeasure the quality of a video from a comprehensive perspective.

However, its real-world effect may be limited as it suffers from low\nvisibility and distrust towards professional fact-checkers. As a remedy,\nTwitter launched its community-based fact-checking system Community Notes on\nwhich fact-checks are carried out by actual Twitter users and directly shown on\nthe fact-checked tweets. Yet, an understanding of how fact-checking via\nCommunity Notes differs from snoping is absent. In this study, we analyze\ndifferences in how contributors to Community Notes and Snopers select their\ntargets when fact-checking social media posts. For this purpose, we analyze two\nunique datasets from Twitter: (a) 25,917 community-created fact-checks from\nTwitter's Community Notes platform; and (b) 52,505 \"snopes\" that debunk tweets\nvia fact-checking replies linking to professional fact-checking websites. We\nfind that Notes contributors and Snopers focus on different targets when\nfact-checking social media content. For instance, Notes contributors tend to\nfact-check posts from larger accounts with higher social influence and are\nrelatively less likely to endorse/emphasize the accuracy of not misleading\nposts. Fact-checking targets of Notes contributors and Snopers rarely overlap;\nhowever, those overlapping exhibit a high level of agreement in the\nfact-checking assessment. Moreover, we demonstrate that Snopers fact-check\nsocial media posts at a higher speed. Altogether, our findings imply that\ndifferent fact-checking approaches -- carried out on the same social media\nplatform -- can result in vastly different social media posts getting\nfact-checked. This has important implications for future research on\nmisinformation, which should not rely on a single fact-checking approach when\ncompiling misinformation datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 15:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

Under the\nconjunction fallacy a human decision-maker will go against basic probability\nlaws and rank as more likely a conjunction over one of its parts. It has been\nproven overtime through a set of experiments with the Linda Problem being the\nmost famous one. Although this interdisciplinary effort is welcomed, we fear\nthat AI researchers ignore the driving force behind the conjunction fallacy as\ncaptured by the Linda Problem: the fact that Linda must be stereotypically\ndescribed as a woman. In this paper we revisit the Linda Problem and formulate\nit as a fairness problem. In doing so we introduce perception as a parameter of\ninterest through the structural causal perception framework. Using an\nillustrative decision-making example, we showcase the proposed conceptual\nframework and its potential impact for developing fair ADM systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 15:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

An arrangement is envy-free if no agent\nstrictly prefers someone else's seat, and it is stable if no two agents\nstrictly prefer each other's seats. We show that it is NP-complete to decide\nwhether an envy-free arrangement exists for both paths and cycles, even with\nbinary preferences.

Proving the hardness of computing stable arrangements\nseems more difficult, as even constructing unstable instances can be\nchallenging. To this end, we propose a characterization of the existence of\nstable arrangements based on the number of distinct values in the preference\nmatrix and the number of classes of agents.

While multiple transformer models have been\ndeveloped for sentence embedding learning, these models may not perform\noptimally when dealing with specialized domains like aviation, which has unique\ncharacteristics such as technical jargon, abbreviations, and unconventional\ngrammar. Furthermore, the absence of labeled datasets makes it difficult to\ntrain models specifically for the aviation domain. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel approach for adapting sentence transformers for the aviation\ndomain.

One\nway to address this concern is by collecting and releasing data labels in an\naggregated manner so that the information about a single user is potentially\ncombined with others. In this paper, we explore the possibility of training\nmachine learning models with aggregated data labels, rather than individual\nlabels. Specifically, we consider two natural aggregation procedures suggested\nby practitioners: curated bags where the data points are grouped based on\ncommon features and random bags where the data points are grouped randomly in\nbag of similar sizes. For the curated bag setting and for a broad range of loss\nfunctions, we show that we can perform gradient-based learning without any\ndegradation in performance that may result from aggregating data. Our method is\nbased on the observation that the sum of the gradients of the loss function on\nindividual data examples in a curated bag can be computed from the aggregate\nlabel without the need for individual labels. For the random bag setting, we\nprovide a generalization risk bound based on the Rademacher complexity of the\nhypothesis class and show how empirical risk minimization can be regularized to\nachieve the smallest risk bound. In fact, in the random bag setting, there is a\ntrade-off between size of the bag and the achievable error rate as our bound\nindicates. Finally, we conduct a careful empirical study to confirm our\ntheoretical findings.

In this regard, we apply the field equation of\nmimetic gravitational theory to a spherically symmetric ansatz and obtain an\nover determined system of non-linear differential equations in which\ndifferential equations are less than the unknown functions. To overcome the\nover determined system we suppose a specific form of the temporal component of\nthe metric potential, $g_{tt}$, and assume the vanishing of the anisotropic\ncondition to derive the form of the spatial component of the metric, $g_{rr}$.\nIn this regard, we discuss the possibility to derive a stellar isotropic model\nthat is in agreement with observed pulsars. To examine the stability of the\nisotropic model we use the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and the\nadiabatic index. Furthermore, we assess the model's validity by evaluating its\ncompatibility with a broad range of observed pulsar masses and radii. We\ndemonstrate that the model provides a good fit to these observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 06:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Static code is used to\ncreate software metrics, and reported bugs in the repository are used to gather\ndefect information. By using a correlation method, metrics that had no\nconnection to the defect data were removed. This makes it possible to analyze\nall the data without pausing the programming process. Large, sophisticated\nsoftware`s primary issue is that it is impossible to control everything\nmanually, and the cost of an error can be quite expensive.

To understand the\ncorrelation between disc winds and the dynamics of the accretion flow, we have\nperformed General Relativistic Magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of an\naxisymmetric thin accretion disc with different accretion rates and magnetic\nfield strengths.

While many dynamic graph\nconstruction methods have been developed, relatively few of them explore the\ncausal relationship between neighbour nodes. Thus, the resulting models lack\nstrong explainability for the causal relationship between the neighbour nodes\nof the dynamically generated graphs, which can easily lead to a risk in\nsubsequent decisions. Moreover, few of them consider the uncertainty and noise\nof dynamic graphs based on the time series datasets, which are ubiquitous in\nreal-world graph structure networks. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic\nDiffusion-Variational Graph Neural Network (DVGNN) for spatio-temporal\nforecasting. For dynamic graph construction, an unsupervised generative model\nis devised. Two layers of graph convolutional network (GCN) are applied to\ncalculate the posterior distribution of the latent node embeddings in the\nencoder stage.

Despite advanced robotic prostheses demonstrating similar motion\ncapabilities to biological limbs, users report them difficult and non-intuitive\nto use. Providing more effective feedback from the device to the user has\ntherefore become a topic of increased interest. In particular, prediction\nlearning methods from the field of reinforcement learning -- specifically, an\napproach termed Pavlovian signalling -- have been proposed as one approach for\nbetter modulating feedback in prostheses since they can adapt during continuous\nuse. One challenge identified in these learning methods is that they can forget\npreviously learned predictions when a user begins to successfully act upon\ndelivered feedback. The present work directly addresses this challenge,\ncontributing new evidence on the impact of algorithmic choices, such as on- or\noff-policy methods and representation choices, on the Pavlovian signalling from\na machine to a user during their control of a robotic arm. Two conditions of\nalgorithmic differences were studied using different scenarios of controlling a\nrobotic arm: an automated motion system and human participant piloting.\nContrary to expectations, off-policy learning did not provide the expected\nsolution to the forgetting problem. We instead identified beneficial properties\nof a look-ahead state representation that made existing approaches able to\nlearn (and not forget) predictions in support of Pavlovian signalling. This\nwork therefore contributes new insight into the challenges of providing learned\npredictive feedback from a prosthetic device, and demonstrates avenues for more\ndynamic signalling in future human-machine interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 15:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

As-is BIM models\nthat represent the spatial reality of a project site can offer crucial\ninformation to stakeholders for construction progress monitoring, error\nchecking, and building maintenance purposes. Geometric methods for\nautomatically converting raw scan data into BIM models (Scan-to-BIM) often fail\nto make use of higher-level semantic information in the data. Whereas, semantic\nsegmentation methods only output labels at the point level without creating\nobject level models that is necessary for BIM. To address these issues, this\nresearch proposes a hybrid semantic-geometric approach for clutter-resistant\nfloorplan generation from laser-scanned building point clouds. The input point\nclouds are first pre-processed by normalizing the coordinate system and\nremoving outliers. Then, a semantic segmentation network based on PointNet++ is\nused to label each point as ceiling, floor, wall, door, stair, and clutter. The\nclutter points are removed whereas the wall, door, and stair points are used\nfor 2D floorplan generation. A region-growing segmentation algorithm paired\nwith geometric reasoning rules is applied to group the points together into\nindividual building elements. Finally, a 2-fold Random Sample Consensus\n(RANSAC) algorithm is applied to parameterize the building elements into 2D\nlines which are used to create the output floorplan. The proposed method is\nevaluated using the metrics of precision, recall, Intersection-over-Union\n(IOU), Betti error, and warping error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 20:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

The creation of high-performance micro kernels\nrequires significant development effort to write tailored assembly code for\neach architecture. This hand optimization task is complicated by the recent\nintroduction of matrix engines by IBM's POWER10 MMA, Intel AMX, and Arm ME to\ndeliver high-performance matrix operations. This paper presents a compiler-only\nalternative to the use of high-performance libraries by incorporating, to the\nbest of our knowledge and for the first time, the automatic generation of the\nlayered approach into LLVM, a production compiler. Modular design of the\nalgorithm, such as the use of LLVM's matrix-multiply intrinsic for a clear\ninterface between the tiling and packing layers and the micro kernel, makes it\neasy to retarget the code generation to multiple accelerators. The use of\nintrinsics enables a comprehensive performance study. In processors without\nhardware matrix engines, the tiling and packing delivers performance up to 22x\n(Intel), for small matrices, and more than 6x (POWER9), for large matrices,\nfaster than PLuTo, a widely used polyhedral optimizer. The performance also\napproaches high-performance libraries and is only 34% slower than OpenBLAS and\non-par with Eigen for large matrices. With MMA in POWER10 this solution is, for\nlarge matrices, over 2.6x faster than the vector-extension solution, matches\nEigen performance, and achieves up to 96% of BLAS peak performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 16:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}
