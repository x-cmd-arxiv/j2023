In this model, leakage either\noccurs through a fully ionized gas distribution (ionization bounded) or\nadditionally through channels cleared of gas by supernova explosions\n(ionization bounded + holes). The escape fraction is therefore governed by a\ncombination of the density and star formation rate. Having calibrated our star\nformation efficiencies to match high-$z$ observables, we find the central gas\ndensity to regulate the boundary between high ($>0.70$) and low ($<0.06$)\nescape fractions. As galaxies become denser at higher redshifts, this boundary\nshifts from $M_{h}\\simeq 10^{9.5}\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ at $z\\sim 5$ to\n$M_{h}\\simeq 10^{7.8}\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ at $z\\sim 15$.

The variability in the escape of ionizing photons is driven by the\nunderlying variations in our dark matter assembly histories.

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid eddy detection\napproach that combines sea surface height (SSH) and velocity fields with\ngeometric criteria defining eddy behavior. Our approach searches for SSH minima\nand maxima, which oceanographers expect to find at the center of eddies.\nGeometric criteria are used to verify expected velocity field properties, such\nas net rotation and symmetry, by tracing velocity components along a circular\npath surrounding each eddy center. Progressive searches outward and into deeper\nlayers yield each eddy's 3D region of influence. Isolation of each eddy\nstructure from the dataset, using it's cylindrical footprint, facilitates\nvisualization of internal eddy structures using horizontal velocity, vertical\nvelocity, temperature and salinity. A quantitative comparison of Okubo-Weiss\nvorticity (OW) thresholding, the standard winding angle, and this new\nSSH-velocity hybrid methods of eddy detection as applied to the Red Sea dataset\nsuggests that detection results are highly dependent on the choices of method,\nthresholds, and criteria. Our new SSH-velocity hybrid detection approach has\nthe advantages of providing eddy structures with verified rotation properties,\n3D visualization of the internal structure of physical properties, and rapid\nefficient estimations of eddy footprints without calculating streamlines.

To address\nthese problems, this paper presents a fast and robust camera-IMU online\ncalibration method based space coordinate transformation constraints and SVD\n(singular Value Decomposition) tricks. First, constraint equations are\nconstructed based on equality of rotation and transformation matrices between\ncamera frames and IMU coordinates at different moments. Secondly, the external\nparameters of the camera-IMU are solved using quaternion transformation and SVD\ntechniques. Finally, the proposed method is validated using ROS platform, where\nimages from the camera and velocity, acceleration, and angular velocity data\nfrom the IMU are recorded in a ROS bag file. The results showed that the\nproposed method can achieve robust and reliable camera-IMU online calibration\nparameters results with less tune consuming and less uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2023 20:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

To tackle this problem, we demonstrate here for the first time\nartificial intelligence (AI) guided closed-loop autonomous optimization for\nfully functional organic solar cells. We empower our LineOne, an automated\nmaterials and device acceleration platform with a Bayesian Optimizer (BO) to\nenable autonomous operation for solving complex optimization problems without\nhuman interference. The system is able to fabricate and characterize complete\nOPV devices and navigate efficiently through the design space spanned by\ncomposition and processing parameters.

They thus create a significant background in the searches. This\nbackground is more critical in getting identified promptly and efficiently\nwithin the context of real-time searches for gravitational-wave transients.\nSuch searches are the ones that have enabled multi-messenger astrophysics with\nthe start of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data taking in 2015 and they\nwill continue to enable the field for further discoveries.

To effectively capture both the structural and\ntemporal aspects of these dynamic graphs, dynamic graph neural networks have\nbeen developed. However, existing methods are usually tailored to process\neither continuous-time or discrete-time dynamic graphs, and cannot be\ngeneralized from one to the other. In this paper, we propose a decoupled graph\nneural network for large dynamic graphs, including a unified dynamic\npropagation that supports efficient computation for both continuous and\ndiscrete dynamic graphs. Since graph structure-related computations are only\nperformed during the propagation process, the prediction process for the\ndownstream task can be trained separately without expensive graph computations,\nand therefore any sequence model can be plugged-in and used.

The irradiation causes an up-shift of the resistivity curves above the\ntransition without transition smearing or broadening.

In the\nlower $T_{V}$ crystal, the electron irradiation drives the transition\ntemperature into a ``forbidden\" regime believed to separate the first order\nfrom the second order phase transition. Contrary to this belief, the transition\nitself remains sharp and hysteretic without a significant change in the\nhysteresis width.

The treatment coefficient of the outcome model\ntargets a conditional treatment effect. Model-based standardization is\ntypically applied to average the model predictions over the target covariate\ndistribution, and generate a covariate-adjusted estimate of the marginal\ntreatment effect. The standard approach to model-based standardization involves\nmaximum-likelihood estimation and use of the non-parametric bootstrap. We\nintroduce a novel, general-purpose, model-based standardization method based on\nmultiple imputation that is easily applicable when the outcome model is a\ngeneralized linear model. We term our proposed approach multiple imputation\nmarginalization (MIM). MIM consists of two main stages: the generation of\nsynthetic datasets and their analysis. MIM accommodates a Bayesian statistical\nframework, which naturally allows for the principled propagation of\nuncertainty, integrates the analysis into a probabilistic framework, and allows\nfor the incorporation of prior evidence.

The ToT technique is inspired by the human mind's\napproach for solving complex reasoning tasks through trial and error. In this\nprocess, the human mind explores the solution space through a tree-like thought\nprocess, allowing for backtracking when necessary. To implement ToT as a\nsoftware system, we augment an LLM with additional modules including a prompter\nagent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller. In order to\nsolve a given problem, these modules engage in a multi-round conversation with\nthe LLM.

To tackle this problem, we propose a two-stage framework\nconsisting of audio-to-landmark generation and landmark-to-video rendering\nprocedures. First, we devise a novel Transformer-based landmark generator to\ninfer lip and jaw landmarks from the audio. Prior landmark characteristics of\nthe speaker's face are employed to make the generated landmarks coincide with\nthe facial outline of the speaker. Then, a video rendering model is built to\ntranslate the generated landmarks into face images.

For effectively exploring the prior\ninformation of static reference images, we align static reference images with\nthe target face's pose and expression based on motion fields. Moreover,\nauditory features are reused to guarantee that the generated face images are\nwell synchronized with the audio.

In conventional ferroelectric materials, the typical ferroelectric\nswitching mechanism is governed by a universal process of domain wall motion.\nHowever, recent experiments indicate that Van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6\npossesses anomalous polarization switching dynamics under an electric field. It\nis important to understand the switching dynamics, but it remains theoretically\nunexplored in CuInP2S6 due to the lack of description of its order-disorder\nphase transition characteristics by density functional theory. Here, we employ\na machine-learning potential trained from the first principles density\nfunctional theory dataset to conduct the large-scale atomistic simulations of\ntemperature-driven order-disorder ferroelectric phase transition in CuInP2S6.\nMost importantly, it is found that the electric field-driven polarization\nswitching in CuInP2S6 is mediated by single Cu dipole flip, rather than\nconventional domain wall motion mechanism. This intrinsic unconventional\nswitching behavior can be attributed to the competition between the energy\nbarrier of domain wall motion and single dipole flip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 03:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

However, it already achieved high F1 scores: 99.95% for the tag\nof APOLOGISING, 91.91% for REASON, 95.35% for APOLOGISER, 89.74% for\nAPOLOGISEE, and 96.47% for INTENSIFIER. This suggests that it is feasible to\nuse LLM-assisted annotation for local grammar analysis, together with human\nintervention on tags that are less accurately recognized by machine. We\nstrongly advocate conducting future studies to evaluate the performance of LLMs\nin annotating other linguistic phenomena. These studies have the potential to\noffer valuable insights into the advancement of theories developed in corpus\nlinguistics, as well into the linguistic capabilities of LLMs..\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 04:10:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 03:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

The stratum-specific target proportions play the role of the\npropensity score conditional on all baseline covariates (and not just the\nstrata) in these experiments.

The\nacceleration of ray tracing has been studied for a long period of time because\nalgorithms such as light transport simulations require a large amount of ray\ntracing. One of the major approaches to accelerate the intersections is to use\nbounding volumes for early pruning for primitives in the volume. The\naxis-aligned bounding box is a popular bounding volume for ray tracing because\nof its simplicity and efficiency. However, the conservative bounding volume may\nproduce extra empty space in addition to its content. Especially, primitives\nthat are thin and diagonal to the axis give false-positive hits on the box\nvolume due to the extra space. Although more complex bounding volumes such as\noriented bounding boxes may reduce more false-positive hits, they are\ncomputationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel culling approach\nto reduce false-positive hits for the bounding box by embedding a binary voxel\ndata structure to the volume. As a ray is represented as a conservative voxel\nvolume as well in our approach, the ray--voxel intersection is cheaply done by\nbitwise AND operations. Our method is applicable to hierarchical data\nstructures such as bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). It reduces false-positive\nhits due to the ray--box test and reduces the number of intersections during\nthe traversal of BVH in ray tracing. We evaluate the reduction of intersections\nwith several scenes and show the possibility of performance improvement despite\nthe culling overhead. We also introduce a compression approach with a lookup\ntable for our voxel data.

Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study of the negative\neffects of game design elements on education/learning systems. We also held a\nfocus group discussion with developers of a gamified software, discussing the\nmapping study results with regard to their awareness and perceptions on the\nreported negative effects in practice. Results: The mapping study revealed 87\npapers reporting undesired effects of game design elements.

A possible way to form those binaries is through the tidal\nspin-up of a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star by its BH companion. In this work, we\ninvestigate this scenario by directly calculating the tidal excitation of\noscillation modes in WR star models, determining the tidal spin-up rate, and\nintegrating the coupled spin-orbit evolution for WR-BH binaries. We find that\nfor short-period orbits and massive WR stars, the tidal interaction is mostly\ncontributed by standing gravity modes, in contrast to Zahn's model of\ntravelling waves which is frequently assumed in the literature. The standing\nmodes are less efficiently damped than traveling waves, meaning that prior\nestimates of tidal spin-up may be overestimated.

On the other hand, when non-Hermiticity parameters\ndominate, we report the exceptional and critical points where the energy gap\nvanishes and illustrate that bipartite entanglement is capable of detecting\nthese transitions as well. Going beyond this scenario, when the ground state\nevolves after a sudden quench with the transverse magnetic field, both rate\nfunction and the fluctuation of bipartite entanglement quantified via its\nsecond moment can detect critical lines generated without quenching dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 06:20:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

We present a method for probing the magnitude and sign of\nthe topological charge (TC) of an unknown discrete vortex, by analyzing the\ninterference pattern of a 1D ring array of lasers. The interference pattern of\nan unknown discrete vortex with TC$\\neq 0$ is averaged with the interference\npattern of TC= 0, which gives rise to a variation in the fringe visibility as a\nfunction of laser number (j) in a 1D ring array. The number of dips observed in\nthe fringe visibility curve is found to be proportional to the magnitude of TC\nof a discrete vortex. The sign of TC is determined by averaging the\ninterference patterns of unknown discrete vortex (TC$\\neq 0$) with known TC=\n+1. The number of dips in the fringe visibility curve decreases by one for a\npositive TC, and increases by one for a negative TC.

Our analysis covers cases where the solutions to the\nlimiting problem may not be unique nor stable. Equivalently the value function\nof the limiting problem might not be differentiable on the entire space. Our\nmain result is then to derive sharp rates of convergence in two distinct\nregimes. When the data is sufficiently regular, we obtain rates proportional to\n$N^{-1/2}$, with $N$ being the number of particles. When the data is merely\nLipschitz and semi-concave with respect to the first Wasserstein distance, we\nobtain rates proportional to $N^{-2/(3d+6)}$. Noticeably, the exponent\n$2/(3d+6)$ is close to $1/d$, which is the optimal rate of convergence for\nuncontrolled particle systems driven by data with a similar regularity. The key\nargument in our approach consists in mollifying the value function of the\nlimiting problem in order to produce functions that are almost classical\nsub-solutions to the limiting Hamilton-Jacobi equation (which is a PDE set on\nthe space of probability measures). These sub-solutions can be projected onto\nfinite dimensional spaces and then compared with the value functions associated\nwith the particle systems. In the end, this comparison is used to prove the\nmost demanding bound in the estimates. The key challenge therein is thus to\nexhibit an appropriate form of mollification. We do so by employing\nsup-convolution within a convenient functional Hilbert space. To make the whole\neasier, we limit ourselves to the periodic setting. We also provide some\nexamples to show that our results are sharp up to some extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 08:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Due to\nefficient wave-particle interactions of ion-scale waves with charged particles,\nthese waves are widely believed to be a major contributor to ion energization,\nand their contribution considerably depends on the wave occurrence rate. By\nanalyzing the radial distribution of quasi-monochromatic ion-scale waves\nobserved by the Parker Solar Probe, this work shows that the wave occurrence\nrate is significantly enhanced in the near-Sun solar wind, specifically\n21%$-$29% below 0.3 au, in comparison to 6%$-$14% beyond 0.3 au. The radial\ndecrease of the wave occurrence rate is not only induced by the sampling effect\nof a single spacecraft detection, but also by the physics relating to the wave\nexcitation, such as the enhanced ion beam instability in the near-Sun solar\nwind.

Nevertheless, in some\ncases it is possible to use a well-specified model to give meaning to a\nBayesian analysis of a misspecified model and we will focus on such cases.\nThree main classes of methods are discussed - restricted likelihood methods,\nwhich use a model based on a non-sufficient summary of the original data;\nmodular inference methods which use a model constructed from coupled submodels\nand some of the submodels are correctly specified; and the use of a reference\nmodel to construct a projected posterior or predictive distribution for a\nsimplified model considered to be useful for prediction or interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 08:17:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 01:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

However, this quality has often come at the\nprice of more expensive algorithms. We introduce a new framework for bridging\nthis gap, by allowing for the efficient implementation of discrepancy-theoretic\nprimitives. Our framework repeatedly solves regularized optimization problems\nto low accuracy to approximate the partial coloring method of [Rot17], and\nsimplifies and generalizes recent work of [JSS23] on fast algorithms for\nSpencer's theorem. In particular, our framework only requires that the\ndiscrepancy body of interest has exponentially large Gaussian measure and is\nexpressible as a sublevel set of a symmetric, convex function. We combine this\nframework with new tools for proving Gaussian measure lower bounds to give\nimproved algorithms for a variety of sparsification and coloring problems.\n  As a first application, we use our framework to obtain an $\\widetilde{O}(m\n\\cdot \\epsilon^{-3.5})$ time algorithm for constructing an\n$\\epsilon$-approximate spectral sparsifier of an $m$-edge graph, matching the\nsparsity of [BSS14] up to constant factors and improving upon the\n$\\widetilde{O}(m \\cdot \\epsilon^{-6.5})$ runtime of [LeeS17].

We generalize these results to their analogs in\nsparsifying isotropic sums of positive semidefinite matrices. Finally, to\ndemonstrate the versatility of our technique, we obtain a nearly-input-sparsity\ntime constructive algorithm for Spencer's theorem (where we recover a recent\nresult of [JSS23]).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 08:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

This critical $Bo$ is found to scale\ninversely with $\\delta$, defining the existence of a quasi-stationary pendant\ncurtain sustained below the cylinder by surface tension. The interface of the\npendant curtain is unconditionally linearly unstable and is prone to\nRayleigh-Plateau-like, capillarity-driven, and Rayleigh-Taylor, gravity-driven,\ninstabilities. The linear stability of the quasi-static state along with an\nenergy analysis of the unstable mode illustrates that while the Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability is always present, capillary effects dominate the instability at\nsmall $Bo$, which promotes the formation of pearls enveloping the cylinder. In\ncontrast, at large $Bo$, capillarity acts in a stabilising way and the\ninstability is purely gravity-driven, forming underside modulations.

The abrupt\nautofocusing is quantified by a maximum k-value, and how fast it changes around\nthe autofocusing distance ($z_{af}$). In particular, CADB blocked with inner\nrings (first/two/three) exhibits an abrupt autofocusing, as the k-value sharply\nincreases [decreases] just before [after] $z_{af}$. The maximum k-value always\noccurs at $z_{af}$, which decreases as the number of blocked inner rings\nincreases.

The method relies on a set of\nhyperparameters that control how gradients are treated in the physical loss and\nhow the activation functions of the neural model are dynamically accounted for.\nThe performance of our GA-PINN model is demonstrated by solving Riemann\nproblems in special relativistic hydrodynamics, extending earlier studies with\nPINNs in the context of the classical Euler equations. The solutions obtained\nwith our GA-PINN model correctly describe the propagation speeds of\ndiscontinuities and sharply capture the associated jumps. We use the relative\n$l^{2}$ error to compare our results with the exact solution of special\nrelativistic Riemann problems, used as the reference ``ground truth'', and with\nthe error obtained with a second-order, central, shock-capturing scheme. In all\nproblems investigated, the accuracy reached by our GA-PINN model is comparable\nto that obtained with a shock-capturing scheme and significantly higher than\nthat achieved by a baseline PINN algorithm. An additional benefit worth\nstressing is that our PINN-based approach sidesteps the costly recovery of the\nprimitive variables from the state vector of conserved ones, a well-known\ndrawback of grid-based solutions of the relativistic hydrodynamics equations.\nDue to its inherent generality and its ability to handle steep gradients, the\nGA-PINN method discussed could be a valuable tool to model relativistic flows\nin astrophysics and particle physics, characterized by the prevalence of\ndiscontinuous solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 08:43:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2023 09:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-22"}

Despite the\nimpressive overall results, the segmentation performance in some hard areas\n(e.g., small objects or thin parts) is still not promising. A straightforward\nsolution is hard sample mining, which is widely used in object detection. Yet,\nmost existing hard pixel mining strategies for semantic segmentation often rely\non pixel's loss value, which tends to decrease during training. Intuitively,\nthe pixel hardness for segmentation mainly depends on image structure and is\nexpected to be stable. In this paper, we propose to learn pixel hardness for\nsemantic segmentation, leveraging hardness information contained in global and\nhistorical loss values. More precisely, we add a gradient-independent branch\nfor learning a hardness level (HL) map by maximizing hardness-weighted\nsegmentation loss, which is minimized for the segmentation head. This\nencourages large hardness values in difficult areas, leading to appropriate and\nstable HL map. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method can be applied to\nmost segmentation methods with no and marginal extra cost during inference and\ntraining, respectively. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method\nachieves consistent/significant improvement (1.37% mIoU on average) over most\npopular semantic segmentation methods on Cityscapes dataset, and demonstrates\ngood generalization ability across domains.

Our protocol incorporates non-protected control,\nbraiding-based protected control, and readout, of the Majorana qubit. We use\nthe Kitaev chain model for the simulations, and focus on the case when the main\nsource of errors is quasistatic charge noise affecting the hybridization energy\nsplitting of the Majorana modes. We provide quantitative guidelines to suppress\nboth diabatic errors and disorder-induced qubit dephasing, such that a fidelity\nplateau is observed as the hallmark of the topological quantum gate. Our\nsimulations predict realistic features that are expected to be seen in future\nbraiding experiments with Majorana zero modes and other topological qubit\narchitectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 09:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

In this paper we study weaker concepts of quasiuniform\ninfimum, quasiuniform lower semicontinuity and quasiuniform minimum, putting\nthem into the context of the general theory developed by the aforementioned\nauthors. On the way, we unify the terminology and notation and fill in some\ngaps in the general theory.

In traditional cloud-centric approaches, raw\ndata is transmitted to a central server for training and inference purposes. On\nthe other hand, Federated Learning migrates both tasks closer to the edge nodes\nand endpoints. This allows for a significant reduction in data exchange while\npreserving the privacy of users. Trained models, though, may under-perform in\ndynamic environments due to changes in the data distribution, affecting the\nmodel's ability to infer accurately; this is referred to as concept drift. Such\ndrift may also be adversarial in nature. Therefore, it is of paramount\nimportance to detect such behaviours promptly. In order to simultaneously\nreduce communication traffic and maintain the integrity of inference models, we\nintroduce FLARE, a novel lightweight dual-scheduler FL framework that\nconditionally transfers training data, and deploys models between edge and\nsensor endpoints based on observing the model's training behaviour and\ninference statistics, respectively. We show that FLARE can significantly reduce\nthe amount of data exchanged between edge and sensor nodes compared to\nfixed-interval scheduling methods (over 5x reduction), is easily scalable to\nlarger systems, and can successfully detect concept drift reactively with at\nleast a 16x reduction in latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 10:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Within the normal mode,\nfurther analysis has revealed the presence of two sub-modes, i.e. the cW mode\nand cB mode, where the central component can appear either weak or bright. As\nfor the anomalous mode, a new bright component emerges in the advanced phase\nwhile the bright trailing component in the normal mode disappears. New\nobservations of PSR B1859+07 by using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical\nradio Telescope (FAST) have revealed the existence of a previously unknown\nemission mode, dubbed as the Af mode. In this mode, all emission components\nseen in the normal and anomalous modes are detected. Notably, the mean\npolarization profiles of both the A and Af modes exhibit an orthogonal\npolarization angle jump in the bright leading component. The polarization\nangles for the central component in the original normal mode follow two\ndistinct orthogonal polarization modes in the A and Af modes respectively. The\npolarization angles for the trailing component show almost the same but a small\nsystematic shift in the A and Af modes, roughly following the values for the cW\nand cB modes. Those polarization features of this newly detected emission mode\nimply that the anomalous mode A of PSR B1859+07 is not a result of ``phase\nshift\" or ``swooshes\" of normal components, but simply a result of the varying\nintensities of different profile components.

The\npolarization plane of the incident wave has an arbitrary orientation against\nthe cylinder axis ($z$-axis), and the wave vector is antiparallel to the\n$x$-axis. The angle between the polarization plane and the $z$-axis plays the\nrole of a bifurcation parameter. We show that any deviation of the incident\nwave from the pure TE or TM orientations makes the pattern of the Poynting\nvector field lines three-dimensional. Meanwhile, the translational symmetry\nalong the $z$-axis remains. Accordingly, all singular points of the Poynting\nvector field, but the ones lying on the $x$-axis, become ``false''\nsingularities. They are singular in the projection of the field lines on the\nplane $xy$.

In order to address the\ndrawbacks of current tethered UAV lighting, which necessitates manual operation\nand coordination with tethered cables, this paper presents a rapid reaction and\nautonomous deployment emergency lighting system prototype based on Tello UAV.\nThe system design is divided into three modules. First, the lighting module has\ndesigned the protogype lighting extensions for the Tello UAV. By selecting and\ninstalling LED light sources reasonably, the stability of the UAV's takeoff,\nlanding, and flight is not affected, while ensuring good lighting effects;\nSecond, the addressing module extracts the optimization objective function\nbased on the optimization deployment requirements of UAV, and uses simulated\nannealing algorithm to iteratively optimize for different distribution\nscenarios and user needs, calculating the optimal deployment location of UAV\nand planning flight missions for UAV. Third, the flight control module has\ndesigned a specialized command control framework based on Tello UAV's API,\nwhich converts the planned flight path into command statements, forms flight\ntext, and controls the flight of unmanned aerial vehicles accordingly. The test\nresults of the emergency lighting system show that the system can respond\nquickly to both densely distributed and sparsely distributed user scenarios,\ndeploying UAV to the best service locations, and providing high-quality\nservices to users.

Indeed, their arbitrariness is why they have\nbeen used to infer causal relationships among variables in numerous settings.\nRegression discontinuity from econometrics assumes the existence of a\ndiscontinuous variable that splits the population into distinct partitions to\nestimate the causal effects of a given phenomenon. Here we consider the design\nof partitions for a given discontinuous variable to optimize a certain effect\npreviously studied using regression discontinuity. To do so, we propose a\nquantization-theoretic approach to optimize the effect of interest, first\nlearning the causal effect size of a given discontinuous variable and then\napplying dynamic programming for optimal quantization design of discontinuities\nthat balance the gain and loss in the effect size. We also develop a\ncomputationally-efficient reinforcement learning algorithm for the dynamic\nprogramming formulation of optimal quantization.

In contrast to online reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithms, which can incur substantial communication overheads\nand longer delays, the majority of existing works employ offline-trained RL\nalgorithms for resource allocation decisions in MEC systems. However, they\nneglect the impact of desynchronization between the physical and digital worlds\non the effectiveness of the allocation strategy.

E-government service recommendation is a\ncrucial area for recommendation re-search as it involves rigid aspects of\npeople's lives. However, it has not received ad-equate attention in comparison\nto other recommendation scenarios like news and music recommendation. We\nempirically find that when existing GCN-based CF methods are directly applied\nto e-government service recommendation, they are limited by the MF framework\nand showing poor performance. This is because MF's equal treatment of users and\nitems is not appropriate for scenarios where the number of users and items is\nunbalanced.

Understanding when and how the onset\nof wave breaking will occur remains a challenge. The mechanisms that form steep\nwaves, i.e. nonlinearity or dispersion, are thought to have a strong influence\non the onset of wave breaking. In two-dimensions and on deep-water, spectral\nbandwidth is the main factor that affects the roles these mechanism play.\nExisting studies, in which the relationship between spectral bandwidth and wave\nbreaking onset is investigated, present varied and sometimes conflicting\nresults. We perform numerical simulations of two-dimensional focused wave\ngroups on deep-water to better understand this relationship, with the aim\nreconciling existing studies. We show that the way in which steepness is\ndefined, may be the main source confusion in the literature. At breaking onset,\nlocally defined steepness reduces as a function of bandwidth, and globally\ndefined steepness increases. The relationship between global breaking onset\nsteepness and spectral shape (using the parameters bandwidth and spectral\nskewness) is too complex to parameterise in a general sense. However, we find\nthat the local surface slope of maximally steep non breaking waves, of all\nspectral bandwidths and shapes (constant-steepness, constant-amplitude, and\nJONSWAP), approaches a limit of $1/\\tan(\\pi/3)\\approx0.5774$. This slope based\nthreshold, is simple to measure and may be used as an alternative to existing\nkinematic breaking onset thresholds.

Interactions between particles, which\ntend to synchronize their phases and align their motion, decrease with the\ndistance and phase difference between them, coupling the spatial and phase\ndynamics. In this work, we explore the effects of disorder induced by phase\nfrustration on a system of Swarmalators that move on a one-dimensional ring.\nOur model is inspired by the well-known Kuramoto-Sakaguchi equations. We find,\nnumerically and analytically, the ordered and disordered states that emerge in\nthe system. The active states, not present in the model without disorder,\nresemble states found previously in numerical studies for the 2D Swarmalators\nsystem. One of these states, in particular, shows similarities to turbulence\ngenerated in a flattened media. We show that all ordered states can be\ngenerated for any values of the coupling constants by tuning the phase\nfrustration parameters only. Moreover, many of these combinations display\nmulti-stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 13:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

This protocol uses a steering Hamiltonian\nthat enables local coupling between the system and ancillary degrees of\nfreedom. At periodic intervals, the ancillary system is reset to its initial\nstate. For infinitesimally short reset times, the dynamics can be approximated\nby a Lindbladian whose steady state is the target state. For finite reset\ntimes, however, the spin chain and the ancilla become entangled between reset\noperations. To evaluate the performance of the protocol, we employ Matrix\nProduct State simulations and quantum trajectory techniques, focusing on the\npreparation of the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state. Our analysis\nconsiders convergence time, fidelity, and energy evolution under different\nreset intervals.

Furthermore, the protocol shows\nremarkable resilience to small deviations in reset time and dephasing noise.\nOur study suggests that stroboscopic maps using quantum resetting may offer\nadvantages over alternative methods, such as quantum reservoir engineering and\nquantum state steering protocols, which rely on Markovian dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 13:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Detecting the semantic variation of words is an\nimportant task for various NLP applications that must make time-sensitive\npredictions. Existing work on semantic variation prediction have predominantly\nfocused on comparing some form of an averaged contextualised representation of\na target word computed from a given corpus. However, some of the previously\nassociated meanings of a target word can become obsolete over time (e.g.\nmeaning of gay as happy), while novel usages of existing words are observed\n(e.g. meaning of cell as a mobile phone). We argue that mean representations\nalone cannot accurately capture such semantic variations and propose a method\nthat uses the entire cohort of the contextualised embeddings of the target\nword, which we refer to as the sibling distribution. Experimental results on\nSemEval-2020 Task 1 benchmark dataset for semantic variation prediction show\nthat our method outperforms prior work that consider only the mean embeddings,\nand is comparable to the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, a qualitative\nanalysis shows that our method detects important semantic changes in words that\nare not captured by the existing methods.

However, PLMs are sensitive to the\nfrequency information of words from their pre-training corpora, resulting in\nanisotropic embedding space, where the embeddings of high-frequency words are\nclustered but those of low-frequency words disperse sparsely. This anisotropic\nphenomenon results in two problems of similarity bias and information bias,\nlowering the quality of sentence embeddings. To solve the problems, we\nfine-tune PLMs by leveraging the frequency information of words and propose a\nnovel USRL framework, namely Sentence Representation Learning with\nFrequency-induced Adversarial tuning and Incomplete sentence filtering\n(SLT-FAI). We calculate the word frequencies over the pre-training corpora of\nPLMs and assign words thresholding frequency labels. With them, (1) we\nincorporate a similarity discriminator used to distinguish the embeddings of\nhigh-frequency and low-frequency words, and adversarially tune the PLM with it,\nenabling to achieve uniformly frequency-invariant embedding space; and (2) we\npropose a novel incomplete sentence detection task, where we incorporate an\ninformation discriminator to distinguish the embeddings of original sentences\nand incomplete sentences by randomly masking several low-frequency words,\nenabling to emphasize the more informative low-frequency words. Our SLT-FAI is\na flexible and plug-and-play framework, and it can be integrated with existing\nUSRL techniques. We evaluate SLT-FAI with various backbones on benchmark\ndatasets.

The problem\ncan be solved completely mode by mode for each spatial wave number, and their\nlongtime dynamics is intimately tied to the ``survival threshold'' of wave\nnumbers computed by $$\\kappa_0^2 = 4\\pi \\int_0^\\Upsilon \\frac{u^2\\mu(\\frac12\nu^2)}{\\Upsilon^2-u^2} \\;du$$ where $\\Upsilon$ is the maximal speed of particle\nvelocities. It is shown that purely oscillatory electric fields exist and obey\na Klein-Gordon's type dispersion relation for wave numbers below the threshold,\nthus confirming the existence of Langmuir's oscillatory waves known in the\nphysical literature. At the threshold, the phase velocity of these oscillatory\nwaves enters the range of admissible particle velocities, namely there are\nparticles that move at the same propagation speed of the waves. It is this\nexact resonant interaction between particles and the oscillatory fields that\ncauses the waves to be damped, classically known as Landau damping. Landau's\nlaw of decay is explicitly computed and is sensitive to the decaying rate of\nthe background equilibria. The faster it decays at the maximal velocity, the\nweaker Landau damping is. Beyond the threshold, the electric fields are a\nperturbation of those generated by the free transport dynamics and thus decay\nrapidly fast due to the phase mixing mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 14:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

In\nrelation to the photon field the Lorentz symmetry violation is of a simple but\nnon-trivial kind that implies birefringence.

Under such an open and untrusted environment, vehicles\nare reluctant to share their computing resource unless provisioning strong\nincentives, privacy protection, and fairness guarantee. Precisely, without\nstrategy-proofness guarantee, the strategic vehicles can overclaim\nparticipation costs so as to conduct market manipulation. Without the fairness\nprovision, vehicles can deliberately abort the assigned tasks without any\npunishments, and UAVs can refuse to pay by the end, causing an exchange\ndilemma. Lastly, the strategy-proofness and fairness provision typically\nrequire transparent payment/task results exchange under public audit, which may\ndisclose sensitive information of vehicles and make the privacy preservation a\nforemost issue. To achieve the three design goals, we propose SEAL, an\nintegrated framework to address strategy-proof, fair, and privacy-preserving\nUAV computation offloading. SEAL deploys a strategy-proof reverse combinatorial\nauction mechanism to optimize UAVs' task offloading under practical constraints\nwhile ensuring economic-robustness and polynomial-time efficiency. Based on\nsmart contracts and hashchain micropayment, SEAL implements a fair on-chain\nexchange protocol to realize the atomic completion of batch payments and\ncomputing results in multi-round auctions. In addition, a privacy-preserving\noff-chain auction protocol is devised with the assistance of the trusted\nprocessor to efficiently protect vehicles' bid privacy. Using rigorous\ntheoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we validate that SEAL can\neffectively prevent vehicles from manipulating, ensure privacy protection and\nfairness, improve the offloading efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 14:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

We make use of the model\ndeveloped by Blossey et al., which takes into account the structural\ninteractions between ions through a bilinear form over the gradients of local\nionic concentrations in the grand thermodynamic potential, as well as their\nsteric interactions through the lattice gas model. The structural interactions\nmay describe effects of the molecular structure of ions at a phenomenological\nlevel. For example, these effects include steric effects due to non-spherical\nshapes of ions, their conformation lability, and solvent effects. In addition,\nwe explore their specific interactions with the pore walls by incorporating\nexternal attractive potentials. Our primary focus is on observing the behavior\nof ionic concentration profiles and the disjoining pressure as the pore width\nchanges. By starting with the local mechanical equilibrium condition, we derive\na general expression for the disjoining pressure. Our findings indicate that\nconsidering the structural interactions of ions leads to a pronounced minimum\non the disjoining pressure profiles at small pore widths. We attribute this\nminimum to the formation of electric double layers on the electrified surfaces\nof the pore. Additionally, our results demonstrate that inclusion of the\nattractive interactions of ions with the pore walls enhances this minimum and\nshifts it to smaller pore thicknesses.

Detailed models of the oscillation frequency\nversus input current are developed and found to be in excellent agreement with\nthe numerical simulations of the dynamics. In the case of pulsed excitation,\nthe magnetization can be switched from one stable state to any of the other\nfive stable states in the Kagome plane by tuning the duration or the amplitude\nof the current pulse. Precise functional forms of the final switched state\nversus the input current are derived, offering crucial insights into the\nswitching dynamics of Mn$_3$Sn. The readout of the magnetic state can be\ncarried out via either the anomalous Hall effect, or the recently demonstrated\ntunneling magnetoresistance in an all-Mn$_3$Sn junction. We also discuss\npossible disturbance of the magnetic order due to heating that may occur if the\nsample is subject to large currents. Operating the device in pulsed mode or\nusing low DC currents reduces the peak temperature rise in the sample due to\nJoule heating. Our predictive modeling and simulation results can be used by\nboth theorists and experimentalists to explore the interplay of SOT and the\norder dynamics in Mn$_3$Sn, and to further benchmark the device performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 15:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Amortized variational\ninference is restricted by the expressive power of the chosen variational\ndistribution and the availability of training data in the form of joint data\nand parameter samples, which often lead to approximation errors such as the\namortization gap. To address this issue, we propose an iterative framework that\nrefines the current amortized posterior approximation at each step. Our\napproach involves alternating between two steps: (1) constructing a training\ndataset consisting of pairs of summarized data residuals and parameters, where\nthe summarized data residual is generated using a gradient-based summary\nstatistic, and (2) training a conditional generative model -- a normalizing\nflow in our examples -- on this dataset to obtain a probabilistic update of the\nunknown parameter.

The vector curl operator can separate out the transverse\ncomponent of a complicated displacement field, and directional filters can\nseparate distinct orientations of wave propagation. However, there are\npractical limitations that can prevent the intended improvement in elastography\nestimates. Some simple configurations of wavefields relevant to elastography\nare examined against theoretical models within the semi-infinite elastic medium\nand guided waves in a bounded medium. The Miller-Pursey solutions in simplified\nform are examined for the semi-infinite medium and the Lamb wave symmetric form\nis considered for the guided wave structure. In both cases, wave combinations\nalong with practical limits on the imaging plane can prevent the curl and\ndirectional filter operations from directly providing an improved measure of\nshear wave speed and shear modulus. Additional limits on signal-to-noise and\nthe support of filters also restrict the applica-bility of these strategies for\nimproving elastographic measures.

In this study, we proposed a covariate\nweighting function that combines the geographical distance and attribute\ndistance. The covariate-distance weighted regression (CWR) is the extension of\nGWR including geographical distance and attribute distance. House prices are\naffected by numerous factors, such as house age, floor area, and land use.\nPrediction model is used to help understand the characteristics of regional\nhouse prices. The CWR was used to understand the relationship between the house\nprice and controlling factors. The CWR can consider the geological and\nattribute distances, and produce accurate estimates of house price that\npreserve the weight matrix for geological and attribute distance functions.\nResults show that the house attributes/conditions and the characteristics of\nthe house, such as floor area and house age, might affect the house price.\nAfter factor selection, in which only house age and floor area of a building\nare considered, the RMSE of the CWR model can be improved by 2.9%-26.3% for\nskyscrapers when compared to the GWR. CWR can effectively reduce estimation\nerrors from traditional spatial regression models and provide novel and\nfeasible models for spatial estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 03:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

This transformation is where the methodological\nchallenges of data valuation lie, both for practitioners and for academic\nresearchers. Considerations on the methods applicable to take advantage of the\npossibilities offered by these massive data are relatively recent, and often\nhighlight the disruptive aspect of the current ''data deluge'' to point out\nthat this evolution would be the source of a revival of empiricism in a\n''fourth paradigm'' based on the intensive and ''agnostic'' exploitation of\nmassive amounts of data in order to bring out new knowledge, following a purely\ninductive logic.

The pentamodes usually are composed of double cone-shaped struts\nwith the middle diameter being large and the end diameters being tiny (ideally\napproaching zero). The cubic diamond geometry was proposed by Milton and\nCherkaev as a suitable geometry for the unit cell and has since been used in\nthe majority of the works on pentamodes. In this work, we aim to evaluate the\ndegree to which the main unit cell design is contributing to high bulk to shear\nmodulus ratio (known as FOM). In addition to the diamond unit cell, three other\nwell-known unit cell designs are considered, and the effect of small diameter\nradius and the ratio of large-to-small diameter ratio, {\\alpha}, on the FOM is\nevaluated. The results showed that regardless of the primitive unit cell shape,\nthe FOM value is highly dependent on the d value, but its dependence on the D\nvalue is very weak. For d/h around 0.05 (h representing the linkage length),\nfigures of merit in the range of 10^3 could be reached for all the studied\ntopologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2023 20:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Much of the expressive\npower of human language derives from semantic composition, the mind's ability\nto represent meaning hierarchically & relationally over constituents. At the\nsame time, much sentential meaning is outside the text and requires grounding\nin sensory, motor, and experiential modalities to be adequately learned.\nAlthough large language models display considerable compositional ability,\nrecent work shows that visually-grounded language models drastically fail to\nrepresent compositional structure. In this thesis, we explore whether & how\nmodels compose visually grounded semantics, and how we might improve their\nability to do so.\n  Specifically, we introduce 1) WinogroundVQA, a new compositional visual\nquestion answering benchmark, 2) Syntactic Neural Module Distillation, a\nmeasure of compositional ability in sentence embedding models, 3) Causal\nTracing for Image Captioning Models to locate neural representations vital for\nvision-language composition, 4) Syntactic MeanPool to inject a compositional\ninductive bias into sentence embeddings, and 5) Cross-modal Attention\nCongruence Regularization, a self-supervised objective function for\nvision-language relation alignment. We close by discussing connections of our\nwork to neuroscience, psycholinguistics, formal semantics, and philosophy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 03:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

Given this, the integration of contextual \"side\" information in addition\nto user-item ratings is highly desirable. Whilst there are algorithms that can\nhandle both rating and contextual data simultaneously, these algorithms are\ntypically limited to making only in-sample recommendations, suffer from the\ncurse of dimensionality, and do not incorporate multi-armed bandit (MAB)\npolicies for long-term cumulative reward optimization. We propose multi-view\ninteractive topic regression (MV-ICTR) a novel partially online latent factor\nrecommender algorithm that incorporates both rating and contextual information\nto model item-specific feature dependencies and users' personal preferences\nsimultaneously, with multi-armed bandit policies for continued online\npersonalization.

However,\ncurrent research primarily focuses on creating auditable AI documentation,\nwhich is intended for regulators and experts rather than end-users affected by\nAI decisions. How to communicate to members of the public that an AI has been\naudited and considered trustworthy remains an open challenge. This study\nempirically investigated certification labels as a promising solution. Through\ninterviews (N = 12) and a census-representative survey (N = 302), we\ninvestigated end-users' attitudes toward certification labels and their\neffectiveness in communicating trustworthiness in low- and high-stakes AI\nscenarios. Based on the survey results, we demonstrate that labels can\nsignificantly increase end-users' trust and willingness to use AI in both low-\nand high-stakes scenarios. However, end-users' preferences for certification\nlabels and their effect on trust and willingness to use AI were more pronounced\nin high-stake scenarios. Qualitative content analysis of the interviews\nrevealed opportunities and limitations of certification labels, as well as\nfacilitators and inhibitors for the effective use of labels in the context of\nAI. For example, while certification labels can mitigate data-related concerns\nexpressed by end-users (e.g., privacy and data protection), other concerns\n(e.g., model performance) are more challenging to address. Our study provides\nvaluable insights and recommendations for designing and implementing\ncertification labels as a promising constituent within the trustworthy AI\necosystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2023 09:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}
