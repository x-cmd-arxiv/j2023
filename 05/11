In the simulation we do\nnot include the gravity of the NS such that all effects we find are solely due\nto the jets that the spiralling-in NS launches. The angular momentum that the\njets deposit to the envelope is of the same order of magnitude as the orbital\nangular momentum and has the same direction. The turbulence that the jets\ninduce in the common envelope might play a role in transporting energy and\nangular momentum. The jet-deposited energy that is radiated away (a process not\nstudied here) leads to a transient event that is termed common envelope jets\nsupernova (CEJSN) and might mimic an energetic core collapse supernova. The\nturbulence and the spiral pattern that we explore here might lead to bumps in\nthe late light curve of the CEJSN when different segments of the ejected\nenvelope collide with each other.

The panoramic stereo\ncamera with a pentagon shape consists of 5 stereo vision camera pairs to stream\nsynchronized panoramic stereo images for the following three fusion modules. In\nthe disparity fusion module, rectified stereo images produce the initial\ndisparity maps using multiple stereo vision algorithms. Then, these initial\ndisparity maps, along with the intensity images, are input into a disparity\nfusion network to produce refined disparity maps. Next, the refined disparity\nmaps are converted into full-view point clouds or single-view point clouds for\nthe pose fusion module. The pose fusion module adopts a two-stage\nglobal-coarse-to-local-fine strategy. In the first stage, each pair of\nfull-view point clouds is registered by a global point cloud matching algorithm\nto estimate the transformation for a global pose graph's edge, which\neffectively implements loop closure. In the second stage, a local point cloud\nmatching algorithm is used to match single-view point clouds in different\nnodes. Next, we locally refine the poses of all corresponding edges in the\nglobal pose graph using three proposed rules, thus constructing a refined pose\ngraph.

We propose Video-conditioned Policy learning (ViP),\na data-driven approach that maps human demonstrations of previously unseen\ntasks to robot manipulation skills. To this end, we learn our policy to\ngenerate appropriate actions given current scene observations and a video of\nthe target task. To encourage generalization to new tasks, we avoid particular\ntasks during training and learn our policy from unlabelled robot trajectories\nand corresponding robot videos. Both robot and human videos in our framework\nare represented by video embeddings pre-trained for human action recognition.\nAt test time we first translate human videos to robot videos in the common\nvideo embedding space, and then use resulting embeddings to condition our\npolicies. Notably, our approach enables robot control by human demonstrations\nin a zero-shot manner, i.e., without using robot trajectories paired with human\ninstructions during training.

When a robot\ngrasps an item, the mask of that grasped item can be inferred from the images\nof the scene before and after the grasp. Leveraging this insight, we learn a\ngrasp segmentation model to segment the grasped object from before and after\ngrasp images. Such a model can segment grasped objects from thousands of grasp\ninteractions without costly human annotation. Using the segmented grasped\nobjects, we can \"cut\" objects from their original scenes and \"paste\" them into\nnew scenes to generate instance supervision. We show that our grasp\nsegmentation model provides a 5x error reduction when segmenting grasped\nobjects compared with traditional image subtraction approaches. Combined with\nour \"cut-and-paste\" generation method, instance segmentation models trained\nwith our method achieve better performance than a model trained with 10x the\namount of labeled data. On a real robotic grasping system, our instance\nsegmentation model reduces the rate of grasp errors by over 3x compared to an\nimage subtraction baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 16:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

Extracting this\nlensing signal will enable us to constrain cluster masses, even for high\nredshift clusters ($z \\gtrsim 1$) that are expected to be detected by future\nCMB surveys. However, cluster-correlated foreground signals, like the kinematic\nand thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ and tSZ) signals, present a challenge when\nextracting the lensing signal from CMB temperature data. While CMB\npolarization-based lensing reconstruction is one way to mitigate these\nforeground biases, the sensitivity from CMB temperature-based reconstruction is\nexpected to be similar to or higher than polarization for future surveys. In\nthis work, we extend the cluster lensing estimator developed in Raghunathan et\nal. (2019) to CMB temperature and test its robustness against systematic biases\nfrom foreground signals. We find that the kSZ signal only acts as an additional\nsource of variance and provide a simple stacking-based approach to mitigate the\nbias from the tSZ signal.

In this work, a generalized stratified sampling scheme is\nproposed in which two phases of sampling are involved: the first is devoted to\nthe generation of strata-wise samples and the estimation of strata\nprobabilities whereas the second aims at the estimation of strata-wise failure\nprobabilities. Phase-I sampling enables the selection of a generalized\nstratification variable (i.e., not necessarily belonging to the input set of\nrandom variables) for which the probability distribution is not known a priori.\nTo improve the efficiency, Markov Chain Monte Carlo Phase-I sampling is\nproposed when Monte Carlo simulation is deemed infeasible and optimal Phase-II\nsampling is implemented based on user-specified target coefficients of\nvariation for the limit states of interest.

However, since the available knowledge is often not\nfiltered for a particular question, in-context reasoning can be sensitive to\ndistractor facts, additional content that is irrelevant to a question but that\nmay be relevant for a different question (i.e., not necessarily random noise).\nIn these situations, the model fails to distinguish the knowledge that is\nnecessary to answer the question, leading to spurious reasoning and degraded\nperformance. This reasoning failure contrasts with the model's apparent ability\nto distinguish its contextual knowledge from all the knowledge it has memorized\nduring pre-training. Following this observation, we propose teaching the model\nto reason more robustly by folding the provided contextual knowledge into the\nmodel's parameters before presenting it with a question. Our method, RECKONING,\nis a bi-level learning algorithm that teaches language models to reason by\nupdating their parametric knowledge through back-propagation, allowing them to\nthen answer questions using the updated parameters. During training, the inner\nloop rapidly adapts a copy of the model weights to encode contextual knowledge\ninto its parameters. In the outer loop, the model learns to use the updated\nweights to reproduce and answer reasoning questions about the memorized\nknowledge. Our experiments on two multi-hop reasoning datasets show that\nRECKONING's performance improves over the in-context reasoning baseline (by up\nto 4.5%). We also find that compared to in-context reasoning, RECKONING\ngeneralizes better to longer reasoning chains unseen during training, is more\nrobust to distractors in the context, and is more computationally efficient\nwhen multiple questions are asked about the same knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 17:54:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 16:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

Based on this mapping,\nwe then propose an experimental scheme for the realization of a large-scale\nspin-$1$ $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ QLM using spinless bosons in an optical superlattice.\nUsing perturbation theory and infinite matrix product state calculations, which\nwork directly in the thermodynamic limit, we demonstrate the faithfulness of\nthe mapping and stability of gauge invariance throughout all accessible\nevolution times. We further demonstrate the potential of our proposed quantum\nsimulator to address relevant high-energy physics by probing the\n(de)confinement of an electron--positron pair by tuning the gauge coupling. Our\nwork provides an essential step towards gauge-theory quantum simulators in the\nquantum-field-theory limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

They can sometimes exhibit\ngreater fault-tolerance than conventional subspace codes, which use commuting\nchecks. However, unlike subspace codes, it is unclear if subsystem codes -- in\nparticular their advantages -- can be understood in terms of ground state\nproperties of a physical Hamiltonian. In this paper, we address this question\nfor the three-dimensional subsystem toric code (3D STC), as recently\nconstructed by Kubica and Vasmer [Nat. Comm. 13, 6272(2022)], which exhibits\nsingle-shot error correction (SSEC). Motivated by a conjectured relation\nbetween SSEC and thermal stability, we study the zero and finite temperature\nphases of an associated non-commuting Hamiltonian. By mapping the Hamiltonian\nmodel to a pair of 3D Z_2 gauge theories coupled by a kinetic constraint, we\nfind various phases at zero temperature, all separated by first-order\ntransitions: there are 3D toric code-like phases with deconfined point-like\nexcitations in the bulk, and there are phases with a confined bulk supporting a\n2D toric code on the surface when appropriate boundary conditions are chosen.\nThe latter is similar to the surface topological order present in 3D STC.\nHowever, the similarities between the SSEC in 3D STC and the confined phases\nare only partial: they share the same sets of degrees of freedom, but they are\ngoverned by different dynamical rules. Instead, we argue that the process of\nSSEC can more suitably be associated with a path (rather than a point) in the\nzero-temperature phase diagram, a perspective which inspires alternative\nmeasurement sequences enabling SSEC. Moreover, since none of the\nabove-mentioned phases survives at nonzero temperature, SSEC of the code does\nnot imply thermal stability of the associated Hamiltonian phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 18:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

The goal is to analyse and evaluate the performance of\nrobot-mounted distributed directional or axial-based sensors to observe\nspecific axes in task space as a function of joint configuration. For example,\njoint torque sensors are often used in serial robot manipulators and assumed to\nbe perfectly capable of estimating end effector forces, but certain joint\nconfigurations may cause one or more task-space axes to be unobservable as a\nresult of how the joint torque sensors are aligned. The proposed sensor\nobservability analysis provides a method to analyse the cumulative quality of a\nrobot configuration to observe the task space, akin to forward kinematics for\nsensors. The resultant metrics can then be used in optimization and in\nnull-space control to avoid sensor observability singular configurations or to\nmaximize sensor observability in particular directions. Parallels are drawn\nbetween sensor observability and the traditional kinematic Jacobian for the\nparticular case of joint torque sensors in serial robot manipulators. Compared\nto kinematic analysis using the Jacobian in serial manipulators, sensor\nobservability analysis is shown to be more generalizable in terms of analysing\nnon-joint-mounted sensors and can potentially be applied to sensor types other\nthan for force sensing, e.g., link-mounted proximity sensors.

Phase\ntransitions are induced by collective phenomena firstly discovered in\nstatistical mechanics and later observed in many fields of science. Finding a\nphase transition varying the mini-batch size raises several important questions\non the role of a hyperparameter which have been somehow overlooked until now.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 19:59:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 06:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

Much of this malicious behavior can be\ntraced to a lack of strong authentication for software. To mitigate this\nproblem, digital signatures provide confidence in the authenticity and\nauthorization for signers of the software, but introduce privacy problems by\nexposing maintainers' personally identifiable information. The contribution of\nthis project, Speranza, is to allow for verification of authenticity for\nsoftware packages in a repository while providing anonymity to signers through\nthe use of zero-knowledge identity co-commitments.\n  In Speranza, a signer uses an automated certificate authority (CA) to create\na private identity-backed signature and proof of authorization. Verifiers check\nthat a signer was authorized to publish a package, without learning the\nsigner's identity. The package repository keeps a private mapping from package\nnames to the identities of authorized signers, but publishes only commitments\nto identities in a public map. When issuing certificates, the CA issues the\ncertificate to a distinct commitment to the same identity. The signer then\ncreates a zero-knowledge proof of a commitment that these are identity\nco-commitments.\n  We implemented a proof-of-concept, finding that costs to maintainers\n(signing) and end users (verifying) are small, even for a repository with\nmillions of packages: 404 us and 372 us, respectively.

We analyze the inherent\nlimitations of these approaches and their underlying impact on privacy\nguarantee, model accuracy, and attack resilience. Next, we present a gradient\nleakage resilient approach to securing distributed SGD in federated learning,\nwith differential privacy controlled noise as the tool. Unlike conventional\nmethods with the per-client federated noise injection and fixed noise parameter\nstrategy, our approach keeps track of the trend of per-example gradient\nupdates. It makes adaptive noise injection closely aligned throughout the\nfederated model training.

Assuming a sparse scene,\nidentifiability is determined by the Kruskal rank of a highly structured\nsensing matrix, which depends on both the transmitted waveforms and the array\nconfiguration. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions that the array\ngeometry and transmit waveforms need to satisfy for the Kruskal rank -- and\nhence identifiability -- to be maximized.

The\nnon-linear convective and the viscous terms are solved at the aid of an\nexplicit FV scheme, while the magnetic field is evolved in a divergence-free\nmanner via an explicit FV method based on a discrete form of the Stokes law in\nthe edges/faces of each primary element.

The\nkey idea is to realize that the likelihood function is a multivariable Gaussian\nof the spherical-harmonic components of the energy spectrum of the\ngravitational-wave background. If a uniform and wide prior of these\nspherical-harmonic components is prescribed, the marginalized posterior and the\nBayes factor can be well approximated by a high-dimensional Gaussian integral.\nThe analytical marginalization allows us to regard the spherical-harmonic\ncomponents of the intensity map of the background as free parameters, and to\nconstruct their individual marginalized posterior distribution in a reasonable\ntime, even though many spherical-harmonic components are required.

Stain\nnormalization can effectively reduce the differences in color and brightness of\ndigital pathology images, thus improving the performance of computer-aided\ndiagnostic systems. Conventional stain normalization methods rely on one or\nseveral reference images, but one or several images are difficult to represent\nthe entire dataset. Although learning-based stain normalization methods are a\ngeneral approach, they use complex deep networks, which not only greatly reduce\ncomputational efficiency, but also risk introducing artifacts. StainNet is a\nfast and robust stain normalization network, but it has not a sufficient\ncapability for complex stain normalization due to its too simple network\nstructure. In this study, we proposed a parameter-variable stain normalization\nnetwork, ParamNet. ParamNet contains a parameter prediction sub-network and a\ncolor mapping sub-network, where the parameter prediction sub-network can\nautomatically determine the appropriate parameters for the color mapping\nsub-network according to each input image. The feature of parameter variable\nensures that our network has a sufficient capability for various stain\nnormalization tasks. The color mapping sub-network is a fully 1x1 convolutional\nnetwork with a total of 59 variable parameters, which allows our network to be\nextremely computationally efficient and does not introduce artifacts.

It is simple to describe, can be implemented using\nstandard linear algebra, and often finds better clusters than traditional\nclustering algorithms like $k$-means and $k$-centers. The foundational\nalgorithm for two-way spectral clustering, by Shi and Malik, creates a\ngeometric graph from data and finds a spectral cut of the graph.\n  In modern machine learning, many data sets are modeled as a large number of\npoints drawn from a probability density function. Little is known about when\nspectral clustering works in this setting -- and when it doesn't. Past\nresearchers justified spectral clustering by appealing to the graph Cheeger\ninequality (which states that the spectral cut of a graph approximates the\n``Normalized Cut''), but this justification is known to break down on large\ndata sets.\n  We provide theoretically-informed intuition about spectral clustering on\nlarge data sets drawn from probability densities, by proving when a continuous\nform of spectral clustering considered by past researchers (the unweighted\nspectral cut of a probability density) finds good clusters of the underlying\ndensity itself. Our work suggests that Shi-Malik spectral clustering works well\non data drawn from mixtures of Laplace distributions, and works poorly on data\ndrawn from certain other densities, such as a density we call the `square-root\ntrough'.\n  Our core theorem proves that weighted spectral cuts have low weighted\nisoperimetry for all probability densities.

A general approach in such\ncases is to leverage Lyapunov stability theory to compute a combination of a\nLyapunov control function and an associated control policy. However, finding\nLyapunov functions for general nonlinear systems is a challenging task. To\naddress this challenge, several methods have been recently proposed that\nrepresent Lyapunov functions using neural networks. However, such approaches\nhave been designed exclusively for continuous-time systems. We propose the\nfirst approach for learning neural Lyapunov control in discrete-time systems.\nThree key ingredients enable us to effectively learn provably stable control\npolicies. The first is a novel mixed-integer linear programming approach for\nverifying the stability conditions in discrete-time systems. The second is a\nnovel approach for computing sub-level sets which characterize the region of\nattraction. Finally, we rely on a heuristic gradient-based approach for quickly\nfinding counterexamples to significantly speed up Lyapunov function learning.\nOur experiments on four standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. For example, on the path\ntracking benchmark, we outperform recent neural Lyapunov control baselines by\nan order of magnitude in both running time and the size of the region of\nattraction, and on two of the four benchmarks (cartpole and PVTOL), ours is the\nfirst automated approach to return a provably stable controller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 03:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

Firstly, the computing gain does not increase linearly with\ncomputing devices. Secondly, the device type which dominates the communication\noverhead is various to different job types. To achieve a better gain-overhead\ntradeoff, we formulate an accumulative reward maximization program and design\nan online algorithm, i.e., OGASched, to schedule multi-server jobs.

Quantum\ndevices are being exposed through the same familiar cloud platforms used for\nclassical computers, and enabling seamless execution of hybrid applications\nthat combine quantum and classical components. Quantum devices vary in\nfeatures, e.g., number of qubits, quantum volume, CLOPS, noise profile, queuing\ndelays and resource cost. So, it may be useful to split hybrid workloads with\neither large quantum circuits or large number of quantum circuits, into smaller\nunits. In this paper, we profile two workload splitting techniques on IBM's\nQuantum Cloud: (1) Circuit parallelization, to split one large circuit into\nmultiple smaller ones, and (2) Data parallelization to split a large number of\ncircuits run on one hardware to smaller batches of circuits run on different\nhardware. These can improve the utilization of heterogenous quantum hardware,\nbut involve trade-offs.

The goal is to design compact repair groups that can tolerate\nas many failures as possible. It turns out that the maximum number of failures\na collection of repair groups can tolerate equals the size of a minimum hitting\nset of a collection of subsets of the finite field {\\mathbb{F}_{q^{\\ell}}}\nminus one.

They are then\nprocessed in a quasi-static way. However, with transistors approaching their\nphysical limits and the von Neumann bottleneck, the rate of improvement in\ncomputing efficiency has slowed down. Therefore, drawing inspiration from the\ndynamic and adaptive properties of biological systems, research in neural\nmorphology computing has great potential for development. Memristors, a class\nof nonlinear resistors with memory function, naturally embody dynamics through\ntheir internal electrical processes. This enables nonconventional computing\nparadigms with enhanced capability and energy efficiency, such as reservoir\ncomputing. In this paper, we propose a volatile memristor made of LiNbO3 with\nnonlinear I-V characteristics and short-term memory function. This memristor is\nwell-suited to be used as a nonlinear node in the storage layer of reservoir\ncomputing.

The collective states of memristors after the\napplication of trains of pulses to the respective memristors are unique for\neach combination of pulse patterns. This provides a more reliable and efficient\nway for subsequent output layer classification processing. The system was\nsuccessfully used to recognize images of Arabic numerals 0-9.

We then construct a\ncollaborative graph to learn the client representation through a federated\ngraph neural network. Based on these learned representations, we cluster users\ninto different user groups and learn personalized models for each cluster.

A challenge for doing causal inference with\ncontinuous interventions is that the positivity assumption is typically\nviolated. To address positivity violations, we develop projection functions,\nwhich reweigh and redefine the estimand of interest based on functions of the\nconditional support for the respective interventions. With these functions, we\nobtain the desired dose-response curve in areas of enough support, and\notherwise a meaningful estimand that does not require the positivity\nassumption.

The objective of robust RL is to learn a robust\npolicy that optimizes the worst-case performance over an uncertainty set. In\nthis paper, we propose a new uncertainty set containing more realistic MDPs\nthan the existing ones.

The textbook dynamic-programming algorithm computes the edit\ndistance of two length-$n$ strings in $O(n^2)$ time, which is optimal up to\nsubpolynomial factors under SETH. An established way of circumventing this\nhardness is to consider the bounded setting, where the running time is\nparameterized by the edit distance $k$. A celebrated algorithm by Landau and\nVishkin (JCSS '88) achieves time $O(n + k^2)$, which is optimal as a function\nof $n$ and $k$.\n  Most practical applications rely on a more general weighted edit distance,\nwhere each edit has a weight depending on its type and the involved characters\nfrom the alphabet $\\Sigma$. This is formalized through a weight function $w :\n\\Sigma\\cup\\{\\varepsilon\\}\\times\\Sigma\\cup\\{\\varepsilon\\}\\to\\mathbb{R}$\nnormalized so that $w(a,a)=0$ and $w(a,b)\\geq 1$ for all $a,b \\in\n\\Sigma\\cup\\{\\varepsilon\\}$ with $a \\neq b$; the goal is to find an alignment of\nthe two strings minimizing the total weight of edits. The $O(n^2)$-time\nalgorithm supports this setting seamlessly, but only very recently, Das,\nGilbert, Hajiaghayi, Kociumaka, and Saha (STOC '23) gave the first non-trivial\nalgorithm for the bounded version, achieving time $O(n + k^5)$. While this\nrunning time is linear for $k\\le n^{1/5}$, it is still very far from the bound\n$O(n+k^2)$ achievable in the unweighted setting.\n  In this paper, we essentially close this gap by showing both an improved\n$\\tilde O(n+\\sqrt{nk^3})$-time algorithm and, more surprisingly, a matching\nlower bound: Conditioned on the All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) hypothesis, our\nrunning time is optimal for $\\sqrt{n}\\le k\\le n$ (up to subpolynomial factors).\nThis is the first separation between the complexity of the weighted and\nunweighted edit distance problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 08:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

In half of\nthese objects (Taurus, Orion A, Orion B), the observed gamma-ray spectrum can\nbe explained using the Galactic diffused Cosmic Ray (CR) interactions with the\ngas environments. In the remaining three GMCs (Rho Oph, Aquila Rift, Cepheus),\nthe origin of the gamma-ray spectrum is still not well established. We use the\nGEometry ANd Tracking (GEANT4) simulation framework in order to simulate\ngamma-ray emission due to CR/GMC interaction in these three objects, taking\ninto account the gas density distribution inside the GMCs. We find that\npropagation of diffused Galactic CRs inside these GMCs can explain the\nFermi-LAT detected gamma-ray spectra. Further, our estimated TeV-PeV fluxes are\nconsistent with the HAWC upper limits, available for the Aquila Rift GMC. As\nlast step, we compute the total neutrino flux estimated for these GMCs and\ncompare it with the IceCube detection sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 09:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

In this paper, we thus\npropose aligned visual-genetic inference spaces with the aim to implicitly\nencode cross-domain associations for improved performance. We demonstrate for\nthe first time that such alignment can be achieved via deep embedding models\nand that the approach is directly applicable to boosting long-tailed\nrecognition (LTR) particularly for rare species. We experimentally demonstrate\nthe efficacy of the concept via application to microscopic imagery of 30k+\nplanktic foraminifer shells across 32 species when used together with\nindependent genetic data samples. Most importantly for practitioners, we show\nthat visual-genetic alignment can significantly benefit visual-only recognition\nof the rarest species. Technically, we pre-train a visual ResNet50 deep\nlearning model using triplet loss formulations to create an initial embedding\nspace. We re-structure this space based on genetic anchors embedded via a\nSequence Graph Transform (SGT) and linked to visual data by cross-domain cosine\nalignment.

However, restoration derives less of a benefit from\npretrained models compared to the overwhelming success of pretrained models in\nclassification tasks. Due to such unbalanced benefits, there has been rising\ninterest in how to improve the performance of pretrained models for restoration\ntasks such as speech enhancement (SE). Previous works have shown that the\nfeatures extracted by pretrained audio encoders are effective for SE tasks, but\nthese speech-specific encoder-only models usually require extra decoders to\nbecome compatible with SE tasks, and involve complicated pretraining procedures\nor complex data augmentation. Therefore, in pursuit of a universal audio model,\nthe audio masked autoencoder (MAE) whose backbone is the autoencoder of Vision\nTransformers (ViT-AE), is extended from audio classification toward restoration\ntasks in this paper. ViT-AE naturally learns mel-to-mel mapping that is\ncompatible with restoration tasks during pretraining. Among many restoration\ntasks, SE is chosen due to its well-established evaluation metrics and test\ndata. We propose variations of ViT-AE to improve the SE performance, where the\nmel-to-mel variations yield high scores for non-intrusive metrics and the\nSTFT-oriented variation is effective at standard intrusive metrics such as\nPESQ. Different variations can be used in accordance with the scenarios.\nComprehensive evaluations and ablation studies show that MAE pretraining is\nalso beneficial to SE tasks and help the ViT-AE to better generalize to\nout-of-domain distortions. We further found that large-scale noisy data of\ngeneral audio sources, rather than clean speech, is sufficiently effective for\npretraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 10:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

The main idea is to extrapolate the model\nin the direction of text guidance and away from null-text guidance. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that null-text guidance in diffusion models is secretly a\ncartoon-style creator, i.e., the generated images can be efficiently\ntransformed into cartoons by simply perturbing the null-text guidance.\nSpecifically, we proposed two disturbance methods, i.e., Rollback disturbance\n(Back-D) and Image disturbance (Image-D), to construct misalignment between the\nnoisy images used for predicting null-text guidance and text guidance\n(subsequently referred to as \\textbf{null-text noisy image} and \\textbf{text\nnoisy image} respectively) in the sampling process. Back-D achieves\ncartoonization by altering the noise level of null-text noisy image via\nreplacing $x_t$ with $x_{t+\\Delta t}$. Image-D, alternatively, produces\nhigh-fidelity, diverse cartoons by defining $x_t$ as a clean input image, which\nfurther improves the incorporation of finer image details.

CANTS utilizes a continuous search space to\nindirectly-encode a neural architecture search space. Synthetic ant agents\nexplore CANTS' continuous search space based on the density and distribution of\npheromones, strongly inspired by how ants move in the real world. This\ncontinuous search space allows CANTS to automate the design of artificial\nneural networks (ANNs) of any size, removing a key limitation inherent to many\ncurrent NAS algorithms that must operate within structures of a size that is\npredetermined by the user. This work expands CANTS by adding a fourth dimension\nto its search space representing potential neural synaptic weights.

Our analysis is based on the formulation of an Effective Field\nTheory (EFT) for the system, which is appropriate for discussing universal\nphenomena. The EFT is constructed as a direct product of two known\none-dimensional ones obtained both from the thermodynamic limit of the\nCalogero-Sutherland model. This lower dimensional EFT is known to be capable of\ndescribing a quantum hydrodynamical flow. The resulting two-dimensional EFT\ndisplays a ground state charge density that is constant along the large\ndimension and vanishes at the boundaries of the narrow one with the shape of a\nsemi-circumference. This latter feature is a consequence of the specific\nharmonic confining potential in the narrow dimension considered. The charge\ntransport is obtained by coupling the system to an external electromagnetic\nfield that induces a global translation. The EFT incorporates quantum solitonic\nexcitations along the direction of the flow and the two-dimensional electric\ncurrent density shows a Poiseuille-like behavior, indicating the presence of\nnon-dissipative quantum viscous effects in the direction transverse to the\nflow. These two are among the most interesting features while discussing and\nobserving charge flow in nanoscopic structures of several types.

Measuring wind\nspeeds at different pressure levels may help understand the atmospheric\ndynamics of the planet. The goal of this work is to directly measure winds in\nNeptune's stratosphere with ALMA Doppler spectroscopy. We derived the Doppler\nlineshift maps of Neptune at the CO(3-2) and HCN(4-3) lines at 345.8 GHz\n($\\lambda$~0.87 mm) and 354.5 GHz (0.85 mm), respectively. For that, we used\nspectra obtained with ALMA in 2016 and recorded with a spatial resolution of\n~0.37\" on Neptune's 2.24\" disk. After subtracting the planet solid rotation, we\ninferred the contribution of zonal winds to the measured Doppler lineshifts at\nthe CO and HCN lines. We developed an MCMC-based retrieval methodology to\nconstrain the latitudinal distribution of wind speeds. We find that CO(3-2) and\nHCN(4-3) lines probe the stratosphere of Neptune at pressures of\n$2^{+12}_{-1.8}$ mbar and $0.4^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ mbar, respectively.

We find equatorial retrograde\n(westward) winds of $-180^{+70}_{-60}$ m/s for CO, and $-190^{+90}_{-70}$ m/s\nfor HCN.

In this work, a general framework is outlined for\ncalculating the SNR of any analytic function and it is applied to the specific\ncase of a trapezoidal transit as a demonstration. By refining the approximation\nfrom boxcar to trapezoid, an improved SNR equation is obtained that takes the\nform $(\\delta/\\sigma_0) \\sqrt{(T_{14}+2T_{23})/3}$.

As a rule of thumb,\nintegration times exceeding $T_{14}/3$ lead to a 10% loss in SNR.

We focus\non establishing the value of entanglement distillation of the stored Bell pairs\nprior to entanglement swapping in presence of their inevitable aging, i.e.,\ndecoherence: For a simple instance of a switch with two clients, exponential\ndecay of entanglement fidelity, and a well-known probabilistic but heralded\ntwo-to-one distillation protocol, given a threshold end-to-end entanglement\nfidelity, we use the Markov Decision Processes framework to identify the\noptimal action policy - to wait, to distill, or to swap that maximizes\nthroughput. We compare the switch's performance under the optimal\ndistillation-enabled policy with that excluding distillation. Simulations of\nthe two policies demonstrate the improvements that are possible in principle\nvia optimal use of distillation with respect to average throughput, average\nfidelity, and jitter of end-to-end entanglement, as functions of fidelity\nthreshold. Our model thus helps capture the role of entanglement distillation\nin mitigating the effects of decoherence in a quantum switch in an entanglement\ndistribution network, adding to the growing literature on quantum switches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 13:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

ISPs improve these attributes in line with\ntheir profit objective, i.e., up to the level that maximizes revenue from\nattracted traffic while minimizing attribute-related cost, all in the context\nof alternative offers by competing ISPs. In today's Internet, this quality\ncompetition mostly takes place between ISPs that are next-hop options for a\ngiven destination. In contrast, emerging path-aware networks enable end-points\nto select entire inter-domain forwarding paths, and thus intensify ISP\ncompetition.\n  In this paper, we analyze how path-aware networking changes the competition\ndynamics in the Internet, and how path quality and ISP profits are affected as\na result. To that end, we develop a game-theoretic model in which ISPs (i)\naffect path quality via multiple attributes that entail costs, (ii) constitute\npaths together with other selfish ISPs, and (iii) are in competition with\nalternative paths when attracting traffic. The model enables an extensive\ntheoretical analysis, surprisingly showing that end-point path selection can\nhave both positive and negative effects on path quality and ISP profits,\ndepending on the network topology and the cost structure of ISPs. However, a\nlarge-scale simulation, which draws on real-world data to set model parameters,\nshows that the positive effects will likely prevail in practice: Compared to a\nsingle-path scenario, the prevalence of quality attributes increases by at\nleast 50%, and 75% of ISPs improve their profit if the end-points can choose\namong 5 paths towards any destination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 14:06:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

Double layers arise typically in\ntheories with dipoles, i.e., two opposite charges, such as electromagnetic\ntheories, and appear exceptionally in gravitational theories, which are\ntheories with a single charge. We explore this property of the existence of\ndouble layers in quadratic gravity to find and study traversable wormholes in\nwhich the two domains of the wormhole interior region, where the throat is\nlocated, are matched to two vacuum domains of the exterior region via the use\nof two double layer thin shells. The quadratic gravity we use is essentially\ngiven by a $R+\\alpha R^2$ Lagrangian, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar of the\nspacetime and $\\alpha$ is a coupling constant, plus a matter Lagrangian. The\nnull energy condition, or NEC for short, is tested for the whole wormhole\nspacetime. The analysis shows that the NEC is satisfied for the stress-energy\ntensor of the matter in the whole wormhole interior region, notably at the\nthroat, and is satisfied for some of the stress-energy tensor components of the\nmatter at the double layer thin shell, but is not satisfied for some other\ncomponents, namely, the double layer stress-energy distribution component, at\nthe thin shell. This seems to mean that the NEC is basically impossible, or at\nleast very hard, to be satisfied when double layer thin shells are present.\nSingle layer thin shells are also admitted within the theory, and we present\nthin shell traversable wormholes, i.e., wormholes without interior, with a\nsingle layer thin shell at the throat for which the corresponding stress-energy\ntensor satisfies the NEC, that are asymmetric, i.e., with two different vacuum\ndomains of the exterior region joined at the wormhole throat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 14:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

We, therefore, investigate how close the\nprotostars, consisting of a high-density core and a vast low-density envelope,\ncan approach each other but not coalesce. To investigate the coalescence\nconditions, we conduct smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations following\nthe evolution of equal-mass binaries with different initial separations. Since\nPopulation (Pop) I and III protostars have similar interior structures, we\nadopt a specific Pop~III model with the mass and radius of $7.75\\;M_{\\odot}$\nand $61.1\\;R_{\\odot}$ obtained by the stellar evolution calculations. Our\nresults show that the binary separation decreases due to the transport of the\norbital angular momentum to spin angular momentum. If the initial separation is\nless than about 80 per~cent of the sum of the protostellar radius, the binary\ncoalesces in a time shorter than the tidal lock timescale. The mass loss up to\nthe merging is $\\lesssim 3$ per~cent. After coalescence, the star rotates\nrapidly, and its interior structure is independent of the initial separation.\nWe conclude that there must be some orbital shrinking mechanism after the\nprotostars contract to enter the zero-age main-sequence stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 14:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

Unfortunately, vanilla nonminimal solvers for\nleast-squares problems are notoriously sensitive to outliers. As such, various\nrobust loss functions have been proposed to reduce the sensitivity to outliers.\nExamples of loss functions include pseudo-Huber, Cauchy, and Geman-McClure.\nRecently, these loss functions have been generalized into a single loss\nfunction that enables the best loss function to be found adaptively based on\nthe distribution of the residuals. However, even with the generalized robust\nloss function, most nonminimal solvers can only be solved locally given a prior\nstate estimate due to the nonconvexity of the problem. The first contribution\nof this paper is to combine graduated nonconvexity (GNC) with the generalized\nrobust loss function to solve least-squares problems without a prior state\nestimate and without the need to specify a loss function. Moreover, existing\nloss functions, including the generalized loss function, are based on\nGaussian-like distribution. However, residuals are often defined as the squared\nnorm of a multivariate error and distributed in a Chi-like fashion. The second\ncontribution of this paper is to apply a norm-aware adaptive robust loss\nfunction within a GNC framework. This leads to additional robustness when\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods. Simulations and experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed approach is more robust and yields faster convergence times\ncompared to other GNC formulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 15:11:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 May 2023 02:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-15"}

We argue that\ncausal discovery can help inferring properties of the `unobserved joint\ndistributions' $P_{X,Y,Z}$ or $P_{X,Z}$. The properties may be conditional\nindependences (as in `integrative causal inference') or also quantitative\nstatements about dependences.\n  More generally, we define a learning scenario where the input is a subset of\nvariables and the label is some statistical property of that subset. Sets of\njointly observed variables define the training points, while unobserved sets\nare possible test points. To solve this learning task, we infer, as an\nintermediate step, a causal model from the observations that then entails\nproperties of unobserved sets. Accordingly, we can define the VC dimension of a\nclass of causal models and derive generalization bounds for the predictions.\n  Here, causal discovery becomes more modest and better accessible to empirical\ntests than usual: rather than trying to find a causal hypothesis that is `true'\na causal hypothesis is {\\it useful} whenever it correctly predicts statistical\nproperties of unobserved joint distributions. This way, a sparse causal graph\nthat omits weak influences may be more useful than a dense one (despite being\nless accurate) because it is able to reconstruct the full joint distribution\nfrom marginal distributions of smaller subsets.\n  Within such a `pragmatic' application of causal discovery, some popular\nheuristic approaches become justified in retrospect.

We investigate how the architecture of a family of chips\ninfluences how it is affected by supply and demand uncertainties. We observe\nthat semiconductor supply chains become fragile, in part, due to single demand\npaths, where one chip can satisfy only one demand. Chip architects can enable\nmultiple paths to satisfy a chip demand, which improves supply chain\nresilience. Based on this observation, we study composition and adaptation as\narchitectural strategies to improve resilience to volatility and also introduce\na third strategy of dispersion. These strategies allow multiple paths to\nsatisfy a given chip demand. We develop a model to analyze the impact of these\narchitectural techniques on supply chain costs under different regimes of\nuncertainties and evaluate what happens when they are combined. We present\nseveral interesting and even counterintuitive observations about the product\nconfigurations and market conditions where these interventions are impactful\nand where they are not.

Available software packages solve it using finite\ndifference, finite element, and boundary element methods, where the latter is\nattractive due to the accurate representation of the molecular surface and\npartial charges, and exact enforcement of the boundary conditions at infinity.\nHowever, the boundary element method is limited to linear equations and\npiecewise constant variations of the material properties. In this work, we\npresent a scheme that couples finite and boundary elements for the\nPoisson--Boltzmann equation, where the finite element method is applied in a\nconfined {\\it solute} region, and the boundary element method in the external\n{\\it solvent} region. As a proof-of-concept exercise, we use the simplest\nmethods available: Johnson--N\\'ed\\'elec coupling with mass matrix and diagonal\npreconditioning, implemented using the Bempp-cl and FEniCSx libraries via their\nPython interfaces. We showcase our implementation by computing the polar\ncomponent of the solvation free energy of a set of molecules using a constant\nand a Gaussian-varying permittivity. We validate our implementation against the\nfinite difference code APBS (to 0.5\\%), and show scaling from protein G B1 (955\natoms) up to immunoglobulin G (20\\,148 atoms). For small problems, the coupled\nmethod was efficient, outperforming a purely boundary integral approach. For\nGaussian-varying permittivities, which are beyond the applicability of boundary\nelements alone, we were able to run medium to large sized problems on a single\nworkstation. Development of better preconditioning techniques and the use of\ndistributed memory parallelism for larger systems remains an area for future\nwork.
