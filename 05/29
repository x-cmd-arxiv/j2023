This way, analyzing and trying to localize the root-cause\nof the failure is easier and more agile. Delta debugging has been found to be\nan efficient technique to reduce failure-inducing test inputs. In this paper,\nwe enhance this technique by first monitoring the environment at which the CPS\noperates as well as its physical states.

Real-world graphs are dynamic in nature and\nroutinely undergo edge and vertex additions, as well as, deletions.

Unfortunately, we know little about how to efficiently process\ndynamic graphs on massively parallel architectures such as GPUs.

In this work, we\npropose transferable backdoor attacks against prompt-based models, called\nNOTABLE, which is independent of downstream tasks and prompting strategies.\nSpecifically, NOTABLE injects backdoors into the encoders of PLMs by utilizing\nan adaptive verbalizer to bind triggers to specific words (i.e., anchors). It\nactivates the backdoor by pasting input with triggers to reach\nadversary-desired anchors, achieving independence from downstream tasks and\nprompting strategies.

When particle deprivation occurs, it can\ncause mode collapse of the underlying belief distribution during importance\nsampling. If the region surrounding the true state suffers from mode collapse,\nrecovering its belief is challenging since the area is no longer represented in\nthe probability mass formed by the particles.

In\nthis paper, we build a mathematical model for the actuation capability of a\nmodular multi-rotor vehicle and develop methods to determine if a vehicle is\ncapable of satisfying a task requirement. Based on this result, we find the\noptimal configurations for a given task. Our approach is validated in realistic\n3D simulations, showing that our modular system can adapt to tasks with varying\nrequirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 01:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

We have performed simulations of Rayleigh-B\\'enard\nconvection at three Rayleigh numbers $Ra=10^{5}, 10^{7}$ and $10^{8}$ while\nkeeping the Prandtl number fixed at unity ($Pr=1$). The average radial\ntemperature profile and the Nusselt number match very well, both qualitatively\nand quantitatively, with the existing literature. Closure of the turbulent\nkinetic energy budget, apart from the relative magnitude of the grid spacing\ncompared to the local Kolmogorov scales, assures sufficient spatial resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 04:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

Since a WSI is too large and needs to be divided into\npatches for processing, WSI classification is commonly approached as a Multiple\nInstance Learning (MIL) problem. In this context, each WSI is considered a bag,\nand the obtained patches are treated as instances. The objective of FSWC is to\nclassify both bags and instances with only a limited number of labeled bags.\nUnlike conventional few-shot learning problems, FSWC poses additional\nchallenges due to its weak bag labels within the MIL framework. Drawing\ninspiration from the recent achievements of vision-language models (V-L models)\nin downstream few-shot classification tasks, we propose a two-level prompt\nlearning MIL framework tailored for pathology, incorporating language prior\nknowledge.

However, we argue that this\nkind of method suffers from the low reliability of such noise data decision\noperation. It makes that some mistakenly abounded clean data are not utilized\nsufficiently and some mistakenly kept noised data disturbing the model learning\nprocess. In this paper, we propose a more reliable noise-label suppression\nmethod called ReSup (Reliable label noise Suppression for FER). First, instead\nof directly predicting noised or not, ReSup makes the noise data decision by\nmodeling the distribution of noise and clean labels simultaneously according to\nthe disagreement between the prediction and the target. Specifically, to\nachieve optimal distribution modeling, ReSup models the similarity distribution\nof all samples. To further enhance the reliability of our noise decision\nresults, ReSup uses two networks to jointly achieve noise suppression.\nSpecifically, ReSup utilize the property that two networks are less likely to\nmake the same mistakes, making two networks swap decisions and tending to trust\ndecisions with high agreement. Extensive experiments on three popular\nbenchmarks show that the proposed method significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art noisy label FER methods by 3.01% on FERPlus becnmarks.

DL libraries are essential for building DL applications.\nFurthermore, DL operators are the important building blocks of the DL\nlibraries, that compute the multi-dimensional data (tensors). Therefore, bugs\nin DL operators can have great impacts. Testing is a practical approach for\ndetecting bugs in DL operators. In order to test DL operators effectively, it\nis essential that the test cases pass the input validity check and are able to\nreach the core function logic of the operators. Hence, extracting the input\nvalidation constraints is required for generating high-quality test cases.\nExisting techniques rely on either human effort or documentation of DL library\nAPIs to extract the constraints. They cannot extract complex constraints and\nthe extracted constraints may differ from the actual code implementation.\n  To address the challenge, we propose ACETest, a technique to automatically\nextract input validation constraints from the code to build valid yet diverse\ntest cases which can effectively unveil bugs in the core function logic of DL\noperators. For this purpose, ACETest can automatically identify the input\nvalidation code in DL operators, extract the related constraints and generate\ntest cases according to the constraints. The experimental results on popular DL\nlibraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch, demonstrate that ACETest can extract\nconstraints with higher quality than state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques.\nMoreover, ACETest is capable of extracting 96.4% more constraints and detecting\n1.95 to 55 times more bugs than SOTA techniques. In total, we have used ACETest\nto detect 108 previously unknown bugs on TensorFlow and PyTorch, with 87 of\nthem confirmed by the developers.

This paper attempts to develop a new QSAR method that is\ntheoretically possible to predict various properties of molecules with diverse\nstructures. The proposed deep electron cloud-activity relationships (DECAR) and\ndeep field-activity relationships (DFAR) methods consist of three essentials:\n(1) A large number of molecule entities with activity data as training objects\nand responses; (2) three-dimensional electron cloud density (ECD) or related\nfield data by the accurate density functional theory methods as input\ndescriptors; (3) a deep learning model that is sufficiently flexible and\npowerful to learn the large data described above.

To guarantee superchannel operation, we need to\naccount for soft failures, e.g., laser drifts causing interference between\nsubchannels, wavelength-dependent performance variations, and filter\nmisalignments affecting the edge subchannels. This is achieved by reserving\nspectral guardband between subchannels or by employing a lower modulation\nformat.

In the former, it was revealed\nthat not all SLSNe-I show the W-shaped absorption feature between 4000 and 5000\n\\AA\\ in the pre-maximum spectra, and two new SLSN-subgroups were disclosed:\nType W, where the W-shaped feature is present, and Type 15bn, where it is\nmissing. In the latter, it was shown that the pre-maximum photosphere of Type W\nSLSNe-I tend to be hotter compared to Type 15bn objects, and they are different\nregarding their ion composition, their early light curves and their geometry as\nwell. For completeness, post-maximum data are analyzed in this paper. It is\nconcluded that in terms of photospheric temperature and velocity, Type W and\nType 15bn SLSNe decrease to a similar value by the post-maximum phases, and\ntheir pseudo-nebular spectra are nearly uniform. Pseudo-equivalent width\ncalculations show that the pEW of the wavelength range between 4166 and 5266\n\\AA\\ evolve differently in case of the two sub-types, while the other parts of\nthe spectra seem to evolve similarly. It was found that the host galaxies of\nthe studied objects do not differ significantly in their star formation rate,\nmorphology, stellar mass and absolute brightness. The main difference behind\nthe bimodality of Type W and Type 15bn SLSNe-I therefore is in their\npre-maximum evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 08:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

The poor generalizability on unseen domains, a well-recognized\ndefect of data-driven approaches, can potentially harm the real-world\nperformance of trajectory prediction models. We are thus motivated to improve\ngeneralization ability of models instead of merely pursuing high accuracy on\naverage. Due to the lack of benchmarks for quantifying the generalization\nability of trajectory predictors, we first construct a new benchmark called\nargoverse-shift, where the data distributions of domains are significantly\ndifferent.

For a given set of Hate Terms lists\n(HTs-lists) and Hate Speech data (HS-data), it is challenging to understand\nwhich hate term contributes the most for hate speech classification. This paper\ncontributes two approaches to quantitatively measure and qualitatively\nvisualise the relationship between co-occurring Hate Terms (HTs). Firstly, we\npropose an approach for the classification of hate-speech by producing a Severe\nHate Terms list (Severe HTs-list) from existing HTs-lists. To achieve our goal,\nwe proposed three metrics (Hatefulness, Relativeness, and Offensiveness) to\nmeasure the severity of HTs. These metrics assist to create an Inter-agreement\nHTs-list, which explains the contribution of an individual hate term toward\nhate speech classification. Then, we used the Offensiveness metric values of\nHTs above a proposed threshold minimum Offense (minOffense) to generate a new\nSevere HTs-list. To evaluate our approach, we used three hate speech datasets\nand six hate terms lists. Our approach shown an improvement from 0.845 to 0.923\n(best) as compared to the baseline. Secondly, we also proposed Stable Hate Rule\n(SHR) mining to provide ordered co-occurrence of various HTs with minimum\nStability (minStab).

Moreover, the\ncalculated elastic moduli demonstrate that all the niobium nitrides are hard\nmaterials with bulk moduli and hardness being comparable to or larger than the\nwell-known hard sapphire. Third, the calculated band structures reveal that the\nnitrides possess both type I and type II Dirac nodal points and are thus\ntopological metals.

Focusing on Markovian dynamics, we show that the asymmetry observed\nin finite-time cross-correlations is always upper bounded by dissipation.\nPrecisely, we prove that, for systems in a steady state with arbitrary\noperational durations, the asymmetry exhibits, at most, linear growth over\ntime, with the growth speed determined by the rates of entropy production and\ndynamical activity. In the long-time regime, the asymmetry exhibits exponential\ndecay, with the decay rate dictated by the spectral gap of the transition\nmatrix. Furthermore, we generalize the short-time bounds on correlation\nasymmetry, as reported by Shiraishi [arXiv:2304.12775] and Ohga et\nal.~[arXiv:2303.13116], to encompass finite-time scenarios.

The Secret\nKey Rate is the number of bits per transmission that result in being part of a\nSecret Key between two parties. There are equations that give the Secret Key\nRate, for example, for the BB84 protocol, equation 52 from [1, p.1032] gives\nthe Secret Key Rate for a given Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER). However, the\nanalysis leading to equations such as these often rely on an Asymptotic\napproach, where it is assumed that an infinite number of transmissions are sent\nbetween the two communicating parties (henceforth denoted as Alice and Bob). In\na practical implementation this is obviously impossible.

If a service-curve model were found for the\ninterleaved regulator, then the analysis of this mechanism would no longer be\nlimited to the situations where the shaping-for-free holds, which would widen\nits use in time-sensitive networks. In this paper, we investigate if\nnetwork-calculus service curves can capture the behavior of the interleaved\nregulator. We find that an interleaved regulator placed outside of the\nshaping-for-free requirements (after a non-FIFO system) can yield unbounded\nlatencies. Consequently, we prove that no network-calculus service curve exists\nto explain the interleaved regulator's behavior. It is still possible to find\nnon-trivial service curves for the interleaved regulator. However, their\nlong-term rate cannot be large enough to provide any guarantee (specifically,\nwe prove that for the regulators that process at least four flows with the same\ncontract, the long-term rate of any service curve is upper bounded by three\ntimes the rate of the per-flow contract).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 11:56:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2023 15:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

Obtaining high-fidelity data of\nliquid atomization, either experimentally or numerically, is expensive, which\nmakes the exploration of the design space difficult. First, to tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a framework to predict the DSD of a liquid spray based\non data as a function of the spray angle, the Reynolds number, and the Weber\nnumber. Second, to guide the design of liquid atomizers, the model accurately\npredicts the volume of fluid contained in drops of specific sizes whilst\nproviding uncertainty estimation. To do so, we propose a Gaussian process\nregression (GPR) model, which infers the DSD and its uncertainty form the\nknowledge of its integrals, and of its first moment, i.e., the mean drop\ndiameter. Third, we deploy multiple GPR models to estimate these quantities at\narbitrary points of the design space from data obtained from a large number of\nnumerical simulations of a flat fan spray.

In this paper, we\nstudy several typical disentangled representation learning works in terms of\nboth disentanglement and compositional generalization abilities, and we provide\nan important insight: vector-based representation (using a vector instead of a\nscalar to represent a concept) is the key to empower both good disentanglement\nand strong compositional generalization.

We present, a spatially resolved radio analysis\nof the radio galaxy associated with NGC 6086 and constraints on the spectral\nage of the diffuse emission to investigate the duty cycle and evolution of the\nsource. We use three new low-frequency, high-sensitivity observations,\nperformed with the Low Frequency Array at 144 MHz and with the upgraded Giant\nMetrewave Radio Telescope at 400 MHz and 675 MHz. To these, we add two Very\nLarge Array archival observations at 1400 and 4700 MHz. In the new\nobservations, we detect a second pair of larger lobes and three regions with a\nfilamentary morphology. We analyse the spectral index trend in the inner\nremnant lobes and see systematic steeper values at the lower frequencies\ncompared to the GHz ones. Steeper spectral indices are found in the newly\ndetected outer lobes (up to 2.1), as expected if they trace a previous phase of\nactivity of the AGN. However, the differences between the spectra suggest\ndifferent dynamical evolution within the intragroup medium during their\nexpansion and/or different magnetic field values. We place constraints on the\nage of the inner and outer lobes and derive the duty cycle of the source. This\nresults in a total active time of $\\sim$39%. The filamentary structures have a\nsteep spectral index ($\\sim$1) without any spectral index trend and only one of\nthem shows a steepening in the spectrum.

According to\nthe existing deep learning (DL) rationale, the first CL reveals localized\nfeatures from the raw data, whereas the subsequent layers progressively extract\nhigher-level features required for refined classification. This article\npresents an efficient three-phase procedure for quantifying the mechanism\nunderlying successful DL. First, a deep architecture is trained to maximize the\nsuccess rate (SR). Next, the weights of the first several CLs are fixed and\nonly the concatenated new FC layer connected to the output is trained,\nresulting in SRs that progress with the layers. Finally, the trained FC weights\nare silenced, except for those emerging from a single filter, enabling the\nquantification of the functionality of this filter using a correlation matrix\nbetween input labels and averaged output fields, hence a well-defined set of\nquantifiable features is obtained. Each filter essentially selects a single\noutput label independent of the input label, which seems to prevent high SRs;\nhowever, it counterintuitively identifies a small subset of possible output\nlabels. This feature is an essential part of the underlying DL mechanism and is\nprogressively sharpened with layers, resulting in enhanced signal-to-noise\nratios and SRs. Quantitatively, this mechanism is exemplified by the VGG-16,\nVGG-6, and AVGG-16. The proposed mechanism underlying DL provides an accurate\ntool for identifying each filter's quality and is expected to direct additional\nprocedures to improve the SR, computational complexity, and latency of DL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 13:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

Outages are usually\ncomprised of several concurring events/source causes, and therefore\nunderstanding the context of outages is a very challenging yet crucial first\nstep toward mitigating and resolving outages.

Oasis is able to automatically assess the impact scope\nof outages as well as to produce human-readable summarization. Specifically,\nOasis first assesses the impact scope of an outage by aggregating relevant\nincidents via multiple techniques. Then, it generates a human-readable summary\nby leveraging fine-tuned large language models like GPT-3.x. The impact\nassessment component of Oasis was introduced in Microsoft over three years ago,\nand it is now widely adopted, while the outage summarization component has been\nrecently introduced, and in this article we present the results of an empirical\nevaluation we carried out on 18 real-world cloud systems as well as a\nhuman-based evaluation with outage owners.

However, due\nto the complexity of unmanned warehouse systems and their susceptibility to\nerrors, incidents may occur during their operation, most often in inbound and\noutbound operations, which can decrease operational efficiency. Hence it is\ncrucial to to improve the response to such incidents. This paper proposes a\ncollaborative optimization algorithm for emergent incident response based on\nSafe-MADDPG. To meet safety requirements during emergent incident response, we\ninvestigated the intrinsic hidden relationships between various factors. By\nobtaining constraint information of agents during the emergent incident\nresponse process and of the dynamic environment of unmanned warehouses on\nagents, the algorithm reduces safety risks and avoids the occurrence of chain\naccidents; this enables an unmanned system to complete emergent incident\nresponse tasks and achieve its optimization objectives: (1) minimizing the\nlosses caused by emergent incidents; and (2) maximizing the operational\nefficiency of inbound and outbound operations during the response process.

This singularity\noccurs at the bottom of the band of a 1D chain, for example. We first analyze\nthe non-interacting system: A resonant state e_d, located close to the band\nsingularity, suffers a strong `renormalization', such that a bound state is\ncreated below the bottom of the band in addition to a resonance in the\ncontinuum. When e_d is positioned right at the singularity, the spectral weight\nof the bound state is 2/3, irrespective of its coupling to the conduction\nelectrons. The interacting system is modeled using the Single Impurity Anderson\nModel, which is then solved using the Numerical Renormalization Group method.\nWe observe that the Hubbard interaction causes the bound state to suffer a\nseries of transformations, including level splitting, transfer of spectral\nweight, appearance of a spectral discontinuity, changes in binding energy (the\nlowest state moves farther away from the bottom of the band), and development\nof a finite width. When e_d is away from the singularity and in the\nintermediate valence regime, the impurity occupancy is lower. As e_d moves\ncloser to the singularity, the system partially recovers Kondo regime\nproperties, i.e., higher occupancy and lower Kondo temperature T_K. The\nimpurity thermodynamic properties show that the local moment fixed point is\nalso strongly affected by the existence of the bound state.

Rigid body quantization, in which one quantizes motion\non the spin-isospin orbit of just one minimum, is thus an ill-justified\napproximation. Instead, one should identify a (finite dimensional) moduli space\nof configurations containing all local minima (for a given $B$) as well as\nfields interpolating smoothly between them. This paper proposes a systematic\ncomputational scheme for generating such a moduli space: one constructs an\nenergy minimizing path between each pair of local minima, then defines the\nmoduli space to be the union of spin-isospin orbits of points on the union of\nthese curves, a principal bundle over a graph.

While (dialogue-like)\ninteractivity is important to better communicate an explanation, background\nknowledge has the potential to significantly improve their quality, e.g., by\nadapting the explanation to the needs of the end-user.

We aim to develop the arc model to represent the\nglobal perturbation of Plutinos by taking into account their asymmetric spatial\ndistribution resulting from the 2:3 resonance, and demonstrate the difference\nto the commonly employed ring model. The global perturbation of Plutinos is\nmeasured by the change in the Sun-Neptune distance. We begin by deriving the\nnumber density of the discrete-arc comprised of point masses to accurately\nrepresent the continuous-arc. Based on the resonant characteristics of the 2:3\nMMR, we then construct three overlapping discrete-arcs to model the Plutinos.\nThe perturbations of these arcs are investigated in detail, considering various\nazimuthal and radial distributions associated with the resonant amplitudes A\nand eccentricities e of the Plutinos, respectively. The change in Sun-Neptune\ndistance, i.e. $\\Delta d_{SN}$, caused by Plutinos increases as the range of A\nwidens. At e<=0.1, $\\Delta d_{SN}$ can reach magnitudes on the order of 100 km.\nHowever, the effects of Plutinos' A and e can possibly balance each other. As\ngiven e>=0.25, we find that $\\Delta d_{SN}$ approaches zero, indicating a\nnegligible contribution from highly eccentric Plutinos to the planetary\nephemerides. We finally provide a concise analytic expression, which contains\nthe parameters A, e and the total mass of Plutinos, to estimate $\\Delta d_{SN}$\nat any epoch from 2020 to 2120. Furthermore, since the difference in $\\Delta\nd_{SN}$ between the arc and ring model can be as large as 170 km, we conclude\nthat the ring model is unsuitable for representing the perturbations of\nPlutinos. The idea of the multiple-arc model designed for Plutinos can be\nreadily generalized to other MMRs heavily populated by small bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 15:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

This\nis a fundamental and ubiquitous question that the end user in a business or\nindustrial AI application often asks. The deviation may be due to a sub-optimal\nblack-box model, or it may be simply because the sample in question is an\noutlier. In either case, one would ideally wish to obtain some form of\nattribution score -- a value indicative of the extent to which an input\nvariable is responsible for the anomaly.\n  In the present paper we address this task of ``anomaly attribution,''\nparticularly in the setting in which the model is black-box and the training\ndata are not available. Specifically, we propose a novel likelihood-based\nattribution framework we call the ``likelihood compensation (LC),'' in which\nthe responsibility score is equated with the correction on each input variable\nneeded to attain the highest possible likelihood. We begin by showing formally\nwhy mainstream model-agnostic explanation methods, such as the local linear\nsurrogate modeling and Shapley values, are not designed to explain anomalies.\nIn particular, we show that they are ``deviation-agnostic,'' namely, that their\nexplanations are blind to the fact that there is a deviation in the model\nprediction for the sample of interest. We do this by positioning these existing\nmethods under the unified umbrella of a function family we call the\n``integrated gradient family.'' We validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nLC approach using publicly available data sets.

To obtain this result, we propose a novel\nlift-flow-discretization approach that shows that the uniform UAP has a deep\nconnection with topological theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 06:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Most existing attacks\nrely on the observation that models tend to assign higher probabilities to\ntheir training samples than non-training points. However, simple thresholding\nof the model score in isolation tends to lead to high false-positive rates as\nit does not account for the intrinsic complexity of a sample. Recent work has\ndemonstrated that reference-based attacks which compare model scores to those\nobtained from a reference model trained on similar data can substantially\nimprove the performance of MIAs. However, in order to train reference models,\nattacks of this kind make the strong and arguably unrealistic assumption that\nan adversary has access to samples closely resembling the original training\ndata. Therefore, we investigate their performance in more realistic scenarios\nand find that they are highly fragile in relation to the data distribution used\nto train reference models. To investigate whether this fragility provides a\nlayer of safety, we propose and evaluate neighbourhood attacks, which compare\nmodel scores for a given sample to scores of synthetically generated neighbour\ntexts and therefore eliminate the need for access to the training data\ndistribution. We show that, in addition to being competitive with\nreference-based attacks that have perfect knowledge about the training data\ndistribution, our attack clearly outperforms existing reference-free attacks as\nwell as reference-based attacks with imperfect knowledge, which demonstrates\nthe need for a reevaluation of the threat model of adversarial attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 07:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Specifically,\nengineering optimization methods based on physics still outperform generative\nmodels when dealing with constrained environments where data is scarce and\nprecision is paramount. To address these challenges, we introduce Diffusion\nOptimization Models (DOM) and Trajectory Alignment (TA), a learning framework\nthat demonstrates the efficacy of aligning the sampling trajectory of diffusion\nmodels with the optimization trajectory derived from traditional physics-based\nmethods.

The general concept for learning in PC is that each\nlayer learns to predict the activities of neurons in the previous layer which\nenables local computation of error and in-parallel learning across layers. In\nthis paper, we extend existing PC approaches by developing a network which\nsupports both feedforward and feedback propagation of information. Each layer\nin the networks trained using DBPC learn to predict the activities of neurons\nin the previous and next layer which allows the network to simultaneously\nperform classification and reconstruction tasks using feedforward and feedback\npropagation, respectively.

However, this\nanomaly-discriminative property is ignored by existing GAD methods that are\ntypically built using a conventional anomaly detection objective, such as data\nreconstruction. In this work, we explore this property to introduce a novel\nunsupervised anomaly scoring measure for GAD -- local node affinity -- that\nassigns a larger anomaly score to nodes that are less affiliated with their\nneighbors, with the affinity defined as similarity on node\nattributes/representations. We further propose Truncated Affinity Maximization\n(TAM) that learns tailored node representations for our anomaly measure by\nmaximizing the local affinity of nodes to their neighbors. Optimizing on the\noriginal graph structure can be biased by non-homophily edges (i.e., edges\nconnecting normal and abnormal nodes). Thus, TAM is instead optimized on\ntruncated graphs where non-homophily edges are removed iteratively to mitigate\nthis bias. The learned representations result in significantly stronger local\naffinity for normal nodes than abnormal nodes. Extensive empirical results on\nsix real-world GAD datasets show that TAM substantially outperforms seven\ncompeting models, achieving over 10% increase in AUROC/AUPRC compared to the\nbest contenders on challenging datasets.

This\npaper explores the evolution, capabilities, and limitations of these models,\nwhile highlighting ethical concerns they raise. The study contribution is\ntwo-fold: first, it is acknowledged that, withstanding the challenges of\ntracking and controlling LLM impacts, it is necessary to reconsider our\ninteraction with these AI technologies and the narratives that form public\nperception of them. It is argued that before achieving this goal, it is\nessential to confront a potential deontological tipping point in an increasing\nAI-driven infosphere. This goes beyond just adhering to AI ethical norms or\nregulations and requires understanding the spectrum of social epistemic risks\nLLMs might bring to our collective SC. Secondly, building on Luciano Floridi's\ntaxonomy for SC risks, those are mapped within the functionality and\nconstraints of LLMs. By this outlook, we aim to protect and enrich our SC while\nfostering a collaborative environment between humans and AI that augments human\nintelligence rather than replacing it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2023 09:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}
