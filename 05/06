We cast the\nproblem as a discrete-time control with continuous action space: at each time\nstep, an autonomous agent can set the flow rate of two jets of fluid,\npositioned at the back of the body. The agent, trained with Proximal Policy\nOptimization, learns an effective strategy to make the jets interact with the\nvortexes of the wake, thus reducing the drag. To tackle the computational\ncomplexity of the fluid dynamics simulations, which would make the training\nprocedure prohibitively expensive, we train the agent on a coarse\ndiscretization of the domain. We provide numerical evidence that a policy\ntrained in this approximate environment still retains good performance when\ncarried over to a denser mesh.

Discovering\ncausal relationships in time-series health data is even more challenging when\nrelationships change over the course of a disease, such as medications that are\nmost effective early on or for individuals with severe disease. Stage variables\nsuch as weeks of pregnancy, disease stages, or biomarkers like HbA1c, can\ninfluence what causal relationships are true for a patient. However, causal\ninference within each stage is often not possible due to limited amounts of\ndata, and combining all data risks incorrect or missed inferences. To address\nthis, we propose Causal Discovery with Stage Variables (CDSV), which uses stage\nvariables to reweight data from multiple time-series while accounting for\ndifferent causal relationships in each stage. In simulated data, CDSV discovers\nmore causes with fewer false discoveries compared to baselines, in eICU it has\na lower FDR than baselines, and in MIMIC-III it discovers more clinically\nrelevant causes of high blood pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 16:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

To prevent the\nadding of sensing noise to the data by the subtraction process, the success of\nthis strategy depended on a previous direct noise reduction by test mass\nalignment. The exact dependency of the level of tilt-to-length coupling on the\nset-points of LISA Pathfinder's test masses was not understood until the end of\nthe mission. Here, we present, for the first time, an analytical tilt-to-length\ncoupling model that describes the coupling noise changes due to the\nrealignments. We report on the different mechanisms, namely the lever arm and\npiston effect as well as the coupling due to transmissive components, and how\nthey contribute to the full coupling. Further, we show that a pure geometric\nmodel would not have been sufficient to describe the coupling in LISA\nPathfinder. Therefore, we model also the non-geometric tilt-to-length noise\ncontributions. For the resulting coupling coefficients of the full model, we\ncompute the expected error bars based on the known individual error sources.\nAlso, we validated the analytical model against numerical simulations.

Spectral fitting of the\nmedium-resolution XMM-Newton MOS (MOS1+MOS2) spectrum required the use of an\nadditional component not seen in previous studies in order to fit the 2.0-4.0\nkeV energy range.

Our paper presents a play-and-plug module for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), namely Interactive Perception Network (IPN), aiming to\nachieve a LVLM by incorporating the image understanding capability into LLMs.\nPrevious methods incorporate visual information into LLMs with a simple visual\nmapping network, where the image feature is projected into the embedding space\nof LLMs via a linear layer. Such mapping network projects the image feature\nonce yet does not consider the interaction between the image and the human\ninput query. Hence, the obtained visual information with no connections with\nhuman intention may be inadequate for LLMs to make intention-following\nresponses, which we term as static visual information. IPN addresses this issue\nby allowing the LLM to request the desired visual information aligned with\nvarious human instructions, which we term as the dynamic interaction between\nthe LLM and visual information. Specifically, IPN consists of a simple visual\nmapping network to provide the basic perception of an image for LLMs. It also\ncontains additional modules responsible for acquiring requests from LLMs,\nperforming request-based visual information interaction, and transmitting the\nresulting interacted visual information to LLMs, respectively. In this way,\nLLMs act to understand the human query, deliver the corresponding request to\nthe request-based visual information interaction module, and generate the\nresponse based on the interleaved multimodal information.

In radio\nAGN, one manifestation of feedback is seen in gas outflows. However, it is\nstill not well understood whether the effect of feedback evolves with the radio\nAGN life cycle. In this study, we investigate this link using the radio\nspectral shape as a proxy for the evolutionary stage of the AGN. We used [OIII]\nemission line spectra to trace the presence of outflows on the ionised gas.\nUsing a sample of uniformly selected 129 radio AGN with\n$L_\\textrm{1.4GHz}\\approx10^{23}-10^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, and a mean stacking\nanalysis of the [OIII] profile, we conclude that the ionised gas outflow is\nlinked to the radio spectral shape, and it evolves with the evolution of the\nradio source. We find that sources with a peak in their radio spectra\n(optically thick), on average, drive a broad outflow ($FWHM\\approx1330\\pm418$\nkm s$^{-1}$) with a velocity $v_\\textrm{out}\\approx 240$ km s$^{-1}$. However,\nwe detect no outflow in the stacked [OIII] profile of sources without a peak in\ntheir radio spectrum. In addition, we find that individual outflow detections\nare kinematically more extreme in peaked than non-peaked sources. We conclude\nthat radio jets are most effective at driving gas outflows when young, and the\noutflow is typically short lived. Our stacking analysis shows no significant\ndependence of the presence of ionised gas outflows on the radio morphology, 1.4\nGHz luminosity, optical luminosity and Eddington ratio of these sources. We\nalso identify candidate restarted AGN in our sample, whose [OIII] profiles\nsuggest that they have more disturbed gas kinematics than their evolved\ncounterparts, although the evidence for this is tentative. Our findings support\nthe picture where the impact of AGN feedback changes as the source evolves, and\nyoung radio jets interact with the ambient medium, clearing a channel of gas as\nthey expand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 17:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

For present-day galaxies, the predicted\noptical-line calibrations are consistent with previously published ones, while\nwe find different ultraviolet-line ratios, such as\nHeII$\\lambda$1640/CIII]$\\lambda$1908, to provide powerful metallicity\ndiagnostics. At fixed metallicity, most emission-line ratios are predicted to\nstrongly increase or decrease with redshift (with the notable exception of\nN2O2=[NII]$\\lambda$6584/[OII]$\\lambda$3727), primarily because of a change in\nionization parameter. The predicted dependence of\nR3=[OIII]$\\lambda$5007/H$\\beta$ and\nR23=([OII]$\\lambda$3727+[OIII]$\\lambda\\lambda$4959,5007)/H$\\beta$, and to a\nslightly lesser extent R2=[OII]$\\lambda$3727/H$\\beta$ and\nO32=[OIII]$\\lambda$5007/[OII]$\\lambda$3727, on O abundance for galaxies at\n$z=4-8$ agrees remarkably well with T$_e$-based measurements in 14 galaxies\nobserved with JWST. This success leads us to provide new calibrations of\noptical and ultraviolet metallicity estimators specifically designed for\ngalaxies at z $>$ 4, to guide interpretations of future, high-redshift\nspectroscopic surveys. We further demonstrate that applying classical z = 0\ncalibrations to high-redshift galaxies can bias O-abundance estimates downward\nby up to 1 dex, leading to the conclusion of a stronger evolution of the\nmass-metallicity relation than the actual one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

It has been suggested that vortices play an\nimportant role for channeling energy and plasma into the corona, but the impact\nof vortex flows on the corona has not directly been studied in a realistic\nsetup. We investigate the role vortices play for coronal heating using high\nresolution simulations of coronal loops. The vortices are not artificially\ndriven, but arise self-consistently from magnetoconvection. We perform 3D\nresistive MHD simulations with the MURaM code. Studying an isolated coronal\nloop in a Cartesian geometry allows us to resolve the structure of the loop\ninterior. We conduct a statistical analysis to determine vortex properties as a\nfunction of height from the chromosphere into the corona. We find that the\nenergy injected into the loop is generated by internal coherent motions within\nstrong magnetic elements. A significant part of the resulting Poynting flux is\nchanneled through the chromosphere in vortex tubes forming a magnetic\nconnection between the photosphere and corona. Vortices can form contiguous\nstructures that reach up to coronal heights, but in the corona itself the\nvortex tubes get deformed and eventually lose their identity with increasing\nheight. Vortices show increased upward directed Poynting flux and heating rate\nboth in the chromosphere and corona, but their effect becomes less pronounced\nwith increasing height. While vortices play an important role for the energy\ntransport and structuring in the chromosphere and low corona, their importance\nhigher up in the atmosphere is less clear since the swirls are less\ndistinguishable from their environment.

This paper focuses\non the recently developed Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that allow users to\nquery images using natural language like \"cars during daytime at traffic\nintersections.\" Through an in-depth analysis, we show VLMs address three\nlimitations of current video analytics systems: general expressivity, a single\ngeneral purpose model to query many predicates, and are both simple and fast.\nHowever, VLMs still return large numbers of redundant and low-quality results,\nwhich can overwhelm and burden users.\n  We present Zelda: a video analytics system that uses VLMs to return both\nrelevant and semantically diverse results for top-K queries on large video\ndatasets. Zelda prompts the VLM with the user's query in natural language and\nadditional terms to improve accuracy and identify low-quality frames. Zelda\nimproves result diversity by leveraging the rich semantic information encoded\nin VLM embeddings. We evaluate Zelda across five datasets and 19 queries and\nquantitatively show it achieves higher mean average precision (up to\n1.15$\\times$) and improves average pairwise similarity (up to 1.16$\\times$)\ncompared to using VLMs out-of-the-box.

Another example of surveillance capitalism is the use of\nmilitary technology to collect and analyze data for national security purposes.\nIn this context, surveillance capitalism involves the use of technologies like\nfacial recognition and social media monitoring to gather information on\nindividuals and groups deemed to be potential threats to national security.\nThis information is then used to inform military operations and\ndecision-making. This paper wants to analyze in a critical way the phenomenon\nof surveillance capitalism, proposed under two different ethical framework\nperspectives. Utilitarianism, a consequentialist ethical theory that judges\nactions based on their ability to bring about the greatest amount of happiness\nor pleasure for the greatest number of people, and Kantian deontology, a\nnon-consequentialist ethical theory that emphasizes the importance of\nindividual autonomy, freedom, and dignity. On one side, the utilitarian\nframework enlightens how Information Technology (IT) and the features provided\noffer, at first sight, all the positive perceptions to the majority of people,\nhappiness, entertainment, and pleasure. On the other side, the Kantian\ndeontology framework mostly focuses on the aspect of freedom and free will of\nthe individual.

A further\nchallenge is that most experiments probing dynamical structure and rheology do\nso only in very simple flow fields that are not characteristic of the complex\ndeformation histories experienced by material in a processing application. A\nrecently-developed experimental methodology holds potential to overcome this\nchallenge by incorporating a fluidic four-roll mill (FFoRM) into scanning\nsmall-angle x-ray scattering instrumentation (sSAXS) [Corona, P.

HER2 is known to be over-expressed in certain cancer types. In some\nsub-types of breast cancer, it is known that overexpressed HER2s are\nnon-homogenously distributed on the cell membrane surface, forming HER2\nclusters that consist of HER2s in close proximity to each other. One\ntherapeutic strategy is to disrupt this clustering behavior. However, given the\nnanometer lengthscales involved, detecting these subtle changes has proven\nchallenging.

However, for CTC-based ASR, it is\nnot as straightforward to decouple the model into such acoustic and language\ncomponents, as CTC log-posteriors are computed in a non-autoregressive manner.\nIn this work, we propose a novel ILME technique for CTC-based ASR models. Our\nmethod iteratively masks the audio timesteps to estimate a pseudo\nlog-likelihood of the internal LM by accumulating log-posteriors for only the\nmasked timesteps. Extensive evaluation across multiple out-of-domain datasets\nreveals that the proposed approach improves WER by up to 9.8% and OOV F1-score\nby up to 24.6% relative to Shallow Fusion, when only text data from target\ndomain is available. In the case of zero-shot domain adaptation, with no access\nto any target domain data, we demonstrate that removing the source domain bias\nwith ILME can still outperform Shallow Fusion to improve WER by up to 9.3%\nrelative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 20:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

A network fine-tuning step based on a\nhigh-pass filtering dipole convolution forward model is proposed to reduce the\ngeneralization error of the pre-trained network.

QAOA has a strong connection to the adiabatic\nalgorithm, which it can approximate with sufficient depth. At the same time, it\nis unclear to what extent the lessons from the adiabatic regime apply to QAOA\nas executed in practice, i.e., with small to moderate depth. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that the intuition from the adiabatic algorithm applies to the task\nof choosing the QAOA initial state. Specifically, we observe that the best\nperformance is obtained when the initial state of QAOA is set to be the ground\nstate of the mixing Hamiltonian, as required by the adiabatic algorithm. We\nprovide numerical evidence using the examples of constrained portfolio\noptimization problems with both low ($p\\leq 3$) and high ($p = 100$) QAOA\ndepth, suggesting that the alignment between the initial state and the ground\nstate of the mixing Hamiltonian is beneficial in most cases. We compare many\nvariations of Hamming-weight-preserving XY mixers, which we simulate both\nexactly and approximately, using different numbers of Trotter steps. We observe\nthat lower Trotter error improves QAOA performance when the initial state is\nset to be the easy-to-prepare ground state of the (exact) XY model.

Although there is a wide\nliterature on signed social networks, where positive signs associated to the\nlinks indicate trust, friendship, agreement, while negative signs represent\ndistrust, antagonism, and disagreement, very little is known about the effect\nthat signed interactions can have on the spreading of social behaviors when\nhigher-order interactions are taken into account. In this paper we focus on\nprocesses of complex contagion, such as the adoption of social norms, where\nexposure to multiple sources is needed for the contagion to occur. Complex\ncontagion has been recently modeled by higher-order networks, such as\nsimplicial complexes, which allow transmission to happen not only through the\nlinks connecting pair of nodes, but also in group interactions, namely over\nsimplices of dimension larger or equal than two. Here, we introduce a model of\ncomplex contagion on signed simplicial complexes, and we investigate the role\nplayed by trust and distrust on the dynamics of a social contagion process. The\npresence of higher-order signed structures in our model naturally induces new\ninfection and recovery mechanisms. Through numerical simulations and analytical\nresults in the mean-field approximation, we show how distrust determines the\nway the system moves from a state where no individuals adopt the social\nbehavior, to a state where a finite fraction of the population actively spreads\nit. Interestingly, the fraction of spreading individuals displays a\nnon-monotonic dependence on the average number of connections between\nindividuals. We then investigate how social balance affects social contagion,\nfinding that balanced triads either promote or impede contagion based on the\nrelative abundance of fully trusted relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 00:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

We\nfurther investigate the generalizability of the PRS313 for American women of\nEuropean (EA), African (AFR), Asian (EAA), and Latinx (HL) ancestry within one\ninstitution with a singular EHR system, genotyping platform, and quality\ncontrol process. We found that the PRS313 achieved overlapping Areas under the\nROC Curve (AUCs) in females of Lantix (AUC, 0.68; 95 CI, 0.65-0.71) and\nEuropean ancestry (AUC, 0.70; 95 CI, 0.69-0.71) but lower AUCs for the AFR and\nEAA populations (AFR: AUC, 0.61; 95 CI, 0.56-0.65; EAA: AUC, 0.64; 95 CI,\n0.60-0.680). While PRS313 is associated with Hormone Positive (HR+) disease in\nEuropean Americans (OR, 1.42; 95 CI, 1.16-1.64), for Latinx females, it may be\ninstead associated with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2+)\ndisease (OR, 2.52; 95 CI, 1.35-4.70) although due to small numbers, additional\nstudies are needed. In summary, we found that PRS313 was significantly\nassociated with breast cancer but with attenuated accuracy in women of African\nand Asian descent within a singular health system in Los Angeles. Our work\nfurther highlights the need for additional validation in diverse cohorts prior\nto clinical implementation of polygenic risk scores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 01:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

This increases the burden\non blockchain nodes, and increases the communication overhead for new nodes\njoining the network since they have to copy the entire blockchain. In order to\nreduce storage requirements without compromising on system security and\nintegrity, coded blockchains, based on error correcting codes with fixed rates\nand lengths, have been recently proposed. This approach, however, does not fit\nwell with dynamic IoT networks in which nodes actively leave and join. In such\ndynamic blockchains, the existing coded blockchain approaches lead to high\ncommunication overheads for new joining nodes and may have high decoding\nfailure probability. This paper proposes a rateless coded blockchain with\ncoding parameters adjusted to network conditions. Our goals are to minimize\nboth the storage requirement at each blockchain node and the communication\noverhead for each new joining node, subject to a target decoding failure\nprobability. We evaluate the proposed scheme in the context of real-world\nBitcoin blockchain and show that both storage and communication overhead are\nreduced by 99.6\\% with a maximum $10^{-12}$ decoding failure probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 02:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

We unroll each phase from iteration of\nthe augmented Lagrangian method solving non-local and sparse regularized\noptimization problem by a network.

Nearly all existing studies refer to\nclass imbalance as a proportion imbalance, where the proportion of training\nsamples in each class is not balanced. The ignorance of the proportion\nimbalance will result in unfairness between/among classes and poor\ngeneralization capability. Previous literature has presented numerous methods\nfor either theoretical/empirical analysis or new methods for imbalance\nlearning. This study presents a new taxonomy of class imbalance in machine\nlearning with a broader scope. Four other types of imbalance, namely, variance,\ndistance, neighborhood, and quality imbalances between/among classes, which may\nexist in machine learning tasks, are summarized. Two different levels of\nimbalance including global and local are also presented. Theoretical analysis\nis used to illustrate the significant impact of the new imbalance types on\nlearning fairness. Moreover, our taxonomy and theoretical conclusions are used\nto analyze the shortcomings of several classical methods. As an example, we\npropose a new logit perturbation-based imbalance learning loss when proportion,\nvariance, and distance imbalances exist simultaneously. Several classical\nlosses become the special case of our proposed method.

However, PET\nscanning is costly and involves radioactive exposure, resulting in a lack of\nPET. Moreover, simultaneous PET and MRI at ultra-high-field are currently\nhardly infeasible. Ultra-high-field imaging has unquestionably proven valuable\nin both clinical and academic settings, especially in the field of cognitive\nneuroimaging. These motivate us to propose a method for synthetic PET from\nhigh-filed MRI and ultra-high-field MRI. From a statistical perspective, the\njoint probability distribution (JPD) is the most direct and fundamental means\nof portraying the correlation between PET and MRI. This paper proposes a novel\njoint diffusion attention model which has the joint probability distribution\nand attention strategy, named JDAM. JDAM has a diffusion process and a sampling\nprocess. The diffusion process involves the gradual diffusion of PET to\nGaussian noise by adding Gaussian noise, while MRI remains fixed. JPD of MRI\nand noise-added PET was learned in the diffusion process. The sampling process\nis a predictor-corrector. PET images were generated from MRI by JPD of MRI and\nnoise-added PET.

In this article, we use X-ray micro-computed (microCT) technique\nto capture the microscopic details of coffee matrices at particle-level and\nperform fluid dynamics simulation based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics\nmethod (SPH) with the 3D reconstructured data. Information like flow\npermeability and tortuosity of the matrices can be therefore obtained from our\nsimulation.

Several types of coffee powder are further examined,\nrevealing their distinct microscopic details and resulting flow features. By\ncomparing the microCT images of pre- and post-extraction coffee matrices, it is\nfound that a decreasing porosity profile (from the bottom-outlet to the\ntop-inlet) always develops after extraction.

Recent studies adopt image patches to extract\nmaterial features. Although the trained networks can improve the segmentation\nperformance, their methods choose a fixed patch resolution which fails to take\ninto account the variation in pixel area covered by each material. In this\npaper, we propose the Dynamic Backward Attention Transformer (DBAT) to\naggregate cross-resolution features. The DBAT takes cropped image patches as\ninput and gradually increases the patch resolution by merging adjacent patches\nat each transformer stage, instead of fixing the patch resolution during\ntraining. We explicitly gather the intermediate features extracted from\ncross-resolution patches and merge them dynamically with predicted attention\nmasks. Experiments show that our DBAT achieves an accuracy of 86.85%, which is\nthe best performance among state-of-the-art real-time models. Like other\nsuccessful deep learning solutions with complex architectures, the DBAT also\nsuffers from lack of interpretability. To address this problem, this paper\nexamines the properties that the DBAT makes use of. By analysing the\ncross-resolution features and the attention weights, this paper interprets how\nthe DBAT learns from image patches. We further align features to semantic\nlabels, performing network dissection, to infer that the proposed model can\nextract material-related features better than other methods. We show that the\nDBAT model is more robust to network initialisation, and yields fewer variable\npredictions compared to other models.

In such cases, current methods are vulnerable to the quality of the\ngenerated region graphs, which may lead to suboptimal performance.

This paper proposes\nnovel relaxation techniques to address safety-critical control problems in the\npresence of conflicting safety conditions. In particular, Control Barrier\nFunction (CBFs) provide a means to encode safety as constraints in a Quadratic\nProgram (QP), wherein multiple safety conditions yield multiple constraints.\nHowever, the QP problem becomes infeasible when the safety conditions cannot be\nsimultaneously satisfied. To resolve this potential infeasibility, we introduce\na hierarchy between the safety conditions and employ an additional variable to\nrelax the less important safety conditions (Relaxed-CBF-QP), and formulate a\ncascaded structure to achieve smaller violations of lower-priority safety\nconditions (Hierarchical-CBF-QP). The proposed approach, therefore, ensures the\nexistence of at least one solution to the QP problem with the CBFs while\ndynamically balancing enforcement of additional safety constraints.\nImportantly, this paper evaluates the impact of different weighting factors in\nthe Hierarchical-CBF-QP and, due to the sensitivity of these weightings in the\nobserved behavior, proposes a method to determine the weighting factors via a\nsampling-based technique.

Though the duality between patch validation and mutation testing is\nrecognized, so far there exists no study of systematically adapting mutation\ntesting techniques to general-purpose patch validation. To address this gap, we\ninvestigate existing mutation testing techniques and recognize five classes of\nacceleration techniques that are suitable for general-purpose patch validation.\nAmong them, mutant schemata and mutant deduplication have not been adapted to\ngeneral-purpose patch validation due to the arbitrary changes that third-party\nAPR approaches may introduce. This presents two problems for adaption: 1) the\ndifficulty of implementing the static equivalence analysis required by the\nstate-of-the-art mutant deduplication approach; 2) the difficulty of capturing\npatches' changes to the system state at runtime.\n  To overcome these problems, we propose two novel approaches: 1) execution\nscheduling, which detects the equivalence between patches online, avoiding the\nstatic equivalence analysis and its imprecision; 2) interception-based\ninstrumentation, which intercepts patches' changes to the system state,\navoiding a full interpreter and its overhead.\n  Based on the contributions above, we implement ExpressAPR, a general-purpose\npatch validator for Java that integrates all recognized classes of techniques\nsuitable for patch validation. Our large-scale evaluation with four APR\napproaches shows that ExpressAPR accelerates patch validation by 137.1x over\nplain validation or 8.8x over the state-of-the-art approach, making patch\nvalidation no longer the time bottleneck of APR.

If a signal reception\ncondition from a certain satellite can be detected, the positioning performance\ncan be improved by excluding or de-weighting the multipath contaminated\nsatellite signal. Thus, we developed a machine-learning-based method of\nclassifying GPS signal reception conditions using a dual-polarized antenna. We\nemployed a decision tree algorithm for classification using three features, one\nof which can be obtained only from a dual-polarized antenna. A machine-learning\nmodel was trained using GPS signals collected from various locations.

To this end, an\nasymptotically unbiased aggregation scheme is first proposed to ensure zero\noptimality gap after convergence, and the impact of compression error and\ntransmission outage on the overall training time are quantified through\nconvergence analysis. Then, the formulated problem is solved in an alternating\nmanner, based on which, the novel joint compression and deadline optimization\n(JCDO) algorithm is derived. Numerical experiments for different use cases in\nFEEL including image classification and autonomous driving show that the\nproposed method is nearly 30X faster than the vanilla FedAVG algorithm, and\noutperforms the state-of-the-art schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 08:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Current\ndebiasing methods often come at the cost of significant in-distribution\nperformance to achieve favorable out-of-distribution generalizability, while\nnon-debiasing methods sacrifice a considerable amount of out-of-distribution\nperformance in order to obtain high in-distribution performance. Therefore, it\nis challenging for them to deal with the complicated changing real-world\nsituations. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective novel loss\nfunction with adaptive loose optimization, which seeks to make the best of both\nworlds for question answering. Our main technical contribution is to reduce the\nloss adaptively according to the ratio between the previous and current\noptimization state on mini-batch training data.

However, little research attention has been paid\nto this important application. This type of retrieval task is challenging due\nto the facts: 1)~domain gap exists between query and doc. 2)~multi-modality\nalignment and fusion. 3)~skewed training data and noisy labels collected from\nuser behaviors. 4)~huge number of queries and timely responses while the\nlarge-scale candidate docs exist. To this end, we propose a novel scalable and\nefficient image query to multi-modal retrieval learning paradigm called Mixer,\nwhich adaptively integrates multi-modality data, mines skewed and noisy data\nmore efficiently and scalable to high traffic. The Mixer consists of three key\ningredients: First, for query and doc image, a shared encoder network followed\nby separate transformation networks are utilized to account for their domain\ngap. Second, in the multi-modal doc, images and text are not equally\ninformative. So we design a concept-aware modality fusion module, which\nextracts high-level concepts from the text by a text-to-image attention\nmechanism.\n  Lastly, but most importantly, we turn to a new data organization and training\nparadigm for single-modal to multi-modal retrieval: large-scale classification\nlearning which treats single-modal query and multi-modal doc as equivalent\nsamples of certain classes. Besides, the data organization follows a\nweakly-supervised manner, which can deal with skewed data and noisy labels\ninherited in the industrial systems. Learning such a large number of categories\nfor real-world multi-modality data is non-trivial and we design a specific\nlearning strategy for it. The proposed Mixer achieves SOTA performance on\npublic datasets from industrial retrieval systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 08:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

To\naccurately measure the weak lensing signal, one has to control the systematic\nbias to a small level. One of the most difficult problems is how to correct the\nsmearing effect of the Point Spread Function (PSF) on the shape of the\ngalaxies. The chromaticity of PSF for a broad-band observation can lead to new\nsubtle effects. Since the PSF is wavelength dependent and the spectrum energy\ndistributions between stars and galaxies are different, the effective PSF\nmeasured from the star images will be different from that smears the galaxies.\nSuch a bias is called colour bias. We estimate it in the optical bands of the\nChinese Space Station Survey Telescope from simulated PSFs, and show the\ndependence on the colour and redshift of the galaxies. Moreover, due to the\nspatial variation of spectra over the galaxy image, there exists another\nhigher-order bias, colour gradient bias. Our results show that both colour bias\nand colour gradient bias are generally below $0.1$ percent in CSST. Only for\nsmall-size galaxies, one needs to be careful about the colour gradient bias in\nthe weak lensing analysis using CSST data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 08:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

In this\nscenario, we estimate the advance speed of the jet head, ranging from\n$\\sim$0.1c -- 0.3c, which yields a mildly relativistic case. The projected\nlinear distance between the two hotspots is $\\sim13$ kpc, yielding a linear\nsize ($\\leq20$ kpc) of a Compact-Steep-Spectrum (CSS) source. Combined with new\n\\black{high-frequency ($\\nu_\\text{obs}\\geq44$ GHz) and archived low-frequency\nobservations ($\\nu_\\text{obs}\\leq8.2$ GHz)}, we find that injection spectra of\nboth NW and SE hotspots can be fitted with a continuous injection (CI) model.\nBased on the CI model, the synchrotron ages of NW and SE hotspots have an order\nof $10^5$ yr, consistent with the order of magnitude $10^3 - 10^5$ yr observed\nin CSS sources associated with radio AGNs at an early evolution stage. The CI\nmodel also favors the scenario in which the double hotspots have experienced a\nquiescent phase, suggesting that this RLAGN may have transient or intermittent\nactivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 08:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

To resolve this challenge, previous approaches have\nresorted to different features in the generation process aimed at representing\nappearance and motion. However, in the absence of strict mechanisms to\nguarantee such disentanglement, a separation of motion from appearance has\nremained challenging, resulting in spatial distortions and temporal jittering\nthat break the spatio-temporal coherency. Motivated by this, we here propose\nLEO, a novel framework for human video synthesis, placing emphasis on\nspatio-temporal coherency. Our key idea is to represent motion as a sequence of\nflow maps in the generation process, which inherently isolate motion from\nappearance. We implement this idea via a flow-based image animator and a Latent\nMotion Diffusion Model (LMDM). The former bridges a space of motion codes with\nthe space of flow maps, and synthesizes video frames in a warp-and-inpaint\nmanner. LMDM learns to capture motion prior in the training data by\nsynthesizing sequences of motion codes. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nanalysis suggests that LEO significantly improves coherent synthesis of human\nvideos over previous methods on the datasets TaichiHD, FaceForensics and\nCelebV-HQ.

Photos captured in such a\ncondition significantly impact the performance of various nighttime activities,\nsuch as autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and night photography. While\nexisting methods designed for low-light enhancement or deraining show promising\nperformance, they have limitations in simultaneously addressing the task of\nbrightening low light and removing rain. Furthermore, using a cascade approach,\nsuch as ``deraining followed by low-light enhancement'' or vice versa, may lead\nto difficult-to-handle rain patterns or excessively blurred and overexposed\nimages. To overcome these limitations, we propose an end-to-end network called\n$L^{2}RIRNet$ which can jointly handle low-light enhancement and deraining. Our\nnetwork mainly includes a Pairwise Degradation Feature Vector Extraction\nNetwork (P-Net) and a Restoration Network (R-Net). P-Net can learn degradation\nfeature vectors on the dark and light areas separately, using contrastive\nlearning to guide the image restoration process. The R-Net is responsible for\nrestoring the image. We also introduce an effective Fast Fourier - ResNet\nDetail Guidance Module (FFR-DG) that initially guides image restoration using\ndetail image that do not contain degradation information but focus on texture\ndetail information. Additionally, we contribute a dataset containing synthetic\nand real-world low-light-rainy images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour $L^{2}RIRNet$ outperforms existing methods in both synthetic and complex\nreal-world scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 10:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

A\nbiased dataset can be divided, according to biased features, into bias-aligned\nsamples (i.e., with biased features) and bias-conflicting samples (i.e.,\nwithout biased features). Recent debiasing works typically assume that no bias\nlabel is available during the training phase, as obtaining such information is\nchallenging and labor-intensive. Following this unsupervised assumption,\nexisting methods usually train two models: a biased model specialized to learn\nbiased features and a target model that uses information from the biased model\nfor debiasing. This paper first presents experimental analyses revealing that\nthe existing biased models overfit to bias-conflicting samples in the training\ndata, which negatively impacts the debiasing performance of the target models.\nTo address this issue, we propose a straightforward and effective method called\n\\textit{Echoes}, which trains a biased model and a target model with a\ndifferent strategy. We construct an \"echo chamber\" environment by reducing the\nweights of samples which are misclassified by the biased model, to ensure the\nbiased model fully learns the biased features without overfitting to the\nbias-conflicting samples. The biased model then assigns lower weights on the\nbias-conflicting samples. Subsequently, we use the inverse of the sample\nweights of the biased model as the sample weights for training the target\nmodel. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior debiasing results\ncompared to the existing baselines on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 13:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

To reduce the noise in HSI data\ncubes, both model-driven and learning-based denoising algorithms have been\nproposed.

Specifically,\nwe first extract prototypes from the labeled data on the server and send them\nto the clients.

Existing solutions for diversity-aware image retrieval either\nexplicitly post-process the raw retrieval results from standard retrieval\nsystems or try to learn multi-vector representations of images to represent\ntheir diverse semantics. However, neither of them is good enough to balance\nrelevance and diversity. On the one hand, standard retrieval systems are\nusually biased to common semantics and seldom exploit diversity-aware\nregularization in training, which makes it difficult to promote diversity by\npost-processing. On the other hand, multi-vector representation methods are not\nguaranteed to learn robust multiple projections. As a result, irrelevant images\nand images of rare or unique semantics may be projected inappropriately, which\ndegrades the relevance and diversity of the results generated by some typical\nalgorithms like top-k. To cope with these problems, this paper presents a new\nmethod called CoLT that tries to generate much more representative and robust\nrepresentations for accurately classifying images. Specifically, CoLT first\nextracts semantics-aware image features by enhancing the preliminary\nrepresentations of an existing one-to-one cross-modal system with\nsemantics-aware contrastive learning. Then, a transformer-based token\nclassifier is developed to subsume all the features into their corresponding\ncategories. Finally, a post-processing algorithm is designed to retrieve images\nfrom each category to form the final retrieval result. Extensive experiments on\ntwo real-world datasets Div400 and Div150Cred show that CoLT can effectively\nboost diversity, and outperforms the existing methods as a whole (with a higher\nF1 score).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 15:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Large black holes are shown to be stable when subject to\nthermal fluctuations, and we begin by exploring how these fluctuations affect\nthe uncorrected thermodynamic quantities of entropy, Helmholtz free energy,\nGibbs free energy, enthalpy specific heat, and phase transition stability. We\nalso discuss null geodesics and the radius of the photon sphere for the charged\nAdS BH and use the radius of a photon sphere to calculate the Lyapunov exponent\nand angular velocity. Exceptionally, we test the effects of various parameters\nof a black hole graphically by observing the existence of the correction\nparameter and the coupling parameter, which reveal the behavior of corrected\nthermodynamic quantities. Lastly, we see how the system is stable (under the\neffects of the dark matter parameter) by figuring out the specific heat and\nHawking temperature, which are both related to entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 10:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

However, existing methods often perform\npoorly on image-text matching tasks that require a detailed semantics\nunderstanding of the text. Although there have been some works on this problem,\nthey do not sufficiently exploit the structural knowledge present in sentences\nto enhance multi-modal language representations, which leads to poor\nperformance. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework Structure-CLIP,\nwhich integrates latent detailed semantics from the text to enhance\nfine-grained semantic representations. Specifically, (1) we use scene graphs in\norder to pay more attention to the detailed semantic learning in the text and\nfully explore structured knowledge between fine-grained semantics, and (2) we\nutilize the knowledge-enhanced framework with the help of the scene graph to\nmake full use of representations of structured knowledge. To verify the\neffectiveness of our proposed method, we pre-trained our models with the\naforementioned approach and conduct experiments on different downstream tasks.\nNumerical results show that Structure-CLIP can often achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on both VG-Attribution and VG-Relation datasets. Extensive\nexperiments show its components are effective and its predictions are\ninterpretable, which proves that our proposed method can enhance detailed\nsemantic representation well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 03:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

First, we couple the system to a dephasing bath that\nreduces quantum fragmentation to a classical one with the resulting stationary\nstate being separable. We observe that despite vanishing quantum correlations,\nclassical correlations develop due to fluctuations of the remaining conserved\nquantities, which we show can be captured by a classical stochastic circuit\nevolution. Second, we use a coupling that preserves the quantum fragmentation\nstructure. We derive a general expression for the steady state, which has a\nstrong coherent memory of the initial state due to the extensive number of\nnon-commuting conserved quantities.

The findings of the study suggested that the most important factor\naffecting students' satisfaction with their college experience is their\nsatisfaction with their chosen major.

Additionally, the challenge of class\nimbalance in JIT-SDP data poses a potential risk to the accuracy of CD\ndetection methods if rebalancing is implemented.
