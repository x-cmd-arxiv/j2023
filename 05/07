Entropic trapping in\nthe wall bulges slows dispersion, and hydrodynamic flows induced by wall\nfluctuations enhance dispersion. Previous studies primarily concentrated on the\ncase of a single Brownian tracer either embedded in an incompressible fluid or\nin the ideal case where the presence of fluid is ignored. Here we address the\nquestion of what happens when there is a large ensemble of interacting Brownian\ntracers -- a common situation in applications. Introducing repulsive\ninteractions between the tracer particles, while ignoring the presence of a\nbackground fluid, leads to an effective flow field. This flow field enhances\ntracer dispersion, a phenomenon strongly reminiscent of that seen in\nincompressible background fluid. We characterise the dispersion by the\nlong-time diffusion coefficient of a single tracer, numerically and\nanalytically with a mean-field density functional analysis. We find a\nsurprising effect where an increased particle density enhances the diffusion\ncoefficient, challenging the notion that crowding effects tend to reduce\ndiffusion. Here, inter-particle interactions push particles closer to the\nfluctuating channel walls. Then, interactions between the fluctuating wall and\nthe now-nearby particles drive particle mixing. Our mechanism is sufficiently\ngeneral that we expect it to apply to various systems. In addition, the\nperturbation theory we derive quantifies dispersion in generic\nadvection-diffusion systems with arbitrary spatiotemporal drift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 16:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

This leads to a path in the graph, which determines the\nwinner. Traditionally, the control of vertices is predetermined and fixed. The\nnovelty of pawn games is that control of vertices changes dynamically\nthroughout the game as follows. Each vertex of a pawn game is owned by a pawn.\nIn each turn, the pawns are partitioned between the two players, and the player\nwho controls the pawn that owns the vertex on which the token is located,\nchooses the next location of the token.

We find no difference in OH+ absorption line properties between\nactive and star-forming galaxies with both samples following the same optical\ndepth-dust temperature relation, suggesting that these observables are driven\nby the same mechanism in both samples. Similarly, star-forming and active\ngalaxies both follow the same OH+ emission-FIR relation. Obscured QSOs display\nbroader (>800 km/s) emission than the unobscured QSOs and all but one of the\nhigh-z star-forming galaxies, likely caused by the warm molecular gas reservoir\nobscuring the accreting nucleus. Broader CO(9-8) emission (>500 km/s) is found\nin obscured versus unobscured QSOs, but overall cover a similar range in line\nwidths as the star-forming galaxies and follow the CO(9-8)-FIR luminosity\nrelation found in low-z galaxies. We find that outflows traced by OH+ are only\ndetected in extreme star-forming galaxies (broad CO emission) and in both types\nof QSOs, which, in turn, display no red-shifted absorption. This suggests that\ndiffuse neutral outflows in galaxy halos may be associated with the most\nenergetic evolutionary phases leading up to and following the obscured QSO\nphase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2023 17:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

However, the dynamic nature of software codebases poses a\nchallenge to the effectiveness and robustness of PLMs. In particular,\nworld-realistic scenarios potentially lead to significant differences between\nthe distribution of the pre-training and test data, i.e., distribution shift,\nresulting in a degradation of the PLM's performance on downstream tasks. In\nthis paper, we stress the need for adapting PLMs of code to software data whose\ndistribution changes over time, a crucial problem that has been overlooked in\nprevious works. The motivation of this work is to consider the PLM in a\nnon-stationary environment, where fine-tuning data evolves over time according\nto a software evolution scenario. Specifically, we design a scenario where the\nmodel needs to learn from a stream of programs containing new, unseen APIs over\ntime.

To address\nthese issues, we implement five continual learning approaches, including\nreplay-based and regularization-based methods.

Among their numerous skills,\nthe translation abilities of LLMs have received considerable attention. In\ncontrast to traditional machine translation that focuses solely on\nsource-target mapping, LLM-based translation can potentially mimic the human\ntranslation process that takes many preparatory steps to ensure high-quality\ntranslation. This work aims to explore this possibility by proposing the MAPS\nframework, which stands for Multi-Aspect Prompting and Selection. Specifically,\nwe enable LLMs to first analyze the given source text and extract three aspects\nof translation-related knowledge: keywords, topics and relevant demonstrations\nto guide the translation process. To filter out the noisy and unhelpful\nknowledge, we employ a selection mechanism based on quality estimation.\nExperiments suggest that MAPS brings significant and consistent improvements\nover text-davinci-003 and Alpaca on eight translation directions from the\nlatest WMT22 test sets.

High altitude platform station (HAPS) computing can\nbe a promising addition to existing distributed computing frameworks because of\nits wide coverage and strong computational capabilities. In this regard, this\npaper proposes an adaptive scheme in a new distributed computing framework that\ninvolves HAPS computing to deal with the two problems of the IoV.

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel approach to model human artifact removal as a generative\ndenoising process, capable of simultaneously generating and learning\nsubject-specific domain variance and invariant brain signals. We introduce the\nDomain Specific Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DS-DDPM), which\ndecomposes the denoising process into subject domain variance and invariant\ncontent at each step. By incorporating subtle constraints and probabilistic\ndesign, we formulate domain variance and invariant content into orthogonal\nspaces and further supervise the domain variance with a subject classifier.\nThis method is the first to explicitly separate human subject-specific variance\nthrough generative denoising processes, outperforming previous methods in two\naspects: 1) DS-DDPM can learn more accurate subject-specific domain variance\nthrough domain generative learning compared to traditional filtering methods,\nand 2) DS-DDPM is the first approach capable of explicitly generating subject\nnoise distribution.

If a WD accretes from stellar wind of a distant evolved\ngiant in a symbiotic binary, it can undergo occasional outbursts in which it\nbrightens by several magnitudes, produces a low- and high-velocity\nmass-outflow, and, in some cases, ejects bipolar jets. In this paper, we\ncomplement the current picture of these outbursts by the transient emergence of\na neutral region in the orbital plane of symbiotic binaries consisting of wind\nfrom the giant. We prove its presence by determining H$^0$ column densities\n($N_{\\rm H}$) in the direction of the WD and at any orbital phase of the binary\nby modeling the continuum depression around the Ly$\\alpha$ line caused by\nRayleigh scattering on atomic hydrogen for all suitable objects, i.e.,\neclipsing symbiotic binaries, for which a well-defined ultraviolet spectrum\nfrom an outburst is available. The $N_{\\rm H}$ values follow a common course\nalong the orbit with a minimum and maximum of a few times $10^{22}$ and\n$10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ around the superior and inferior conjunction of the giant,\nrespectively. Its asymmetry implies an asymmetric density distribution of the\nwind from the giant in the orbital plane with respect to the binary axis. The\nneutral wind is observable in the orbital plane due to the formation of a dense\ndisk-like structure around the WD during outbursts, which blocks ionizing\nradiation from the central burning WD in the orbital plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2023 08:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}

Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in\nprograms, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree\n(AST) and graph neural network (GNN) to create code representations for code\nclassification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information\nof the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect\nthe high-order correlations that already exist between nodes in the AST, which\nmay result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while\na general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous\nand undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural\ninformation such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes\nand parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose to represent AST\nas a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) and process the graph by\nheterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) for code\nclassification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent\nhigh-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess\nheterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of\nPython and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and\nGNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2023 09:28:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 15:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

Owing to these properties, the Swin Transformer is suitable for\nestablishing more distant relationships between corresponding voxels in\ndifferent positions in complex abdominal image registration tasks. However, the\nregistration models based on transformers combine multiple voxels into a single\nsemantic token. This merging process limits the transformers to model and\ngenerate coarse-grained spatial information. To address this issue, we propose\nRecovery Feature Resolution Network (RFRNet), which allows the transformer to\ncontribute fine-grained spatial information and rich semantic correspondences\nto higher resolution levels. Furthermore, shifted window partitioning\noperations are inflexible, indicating that they cannot perceive the semantic\ninformation over uncertain distances and automatically bridge the global\nconnections between windows. Therefore, we present a Weighted Window Attention\n(WWA) to build global interactions between windows automatically.

Hence, the\nperformance of cross-modal retrieval methods heavily depends on the\nrepresentational capacity of this embedding space. Existing methods treat all\ninstances equally, applying the same penalty strength to instances with varying\ndegrees of difficulty, ignoring the differences between instances. This can\nresult in ambiguous convergence or local optima, severely compromising the\nseparability of the feature space. To address this limitation, we propose an\nInstance-Variant loss to assign different penalty strengths to different\ninstances, improving the space separability.

By leveraging the Gaussian RBF kernel to evaluate sample\nsimilarity, we further propose an Intra-Class loss function that minimizes the\nintra-class distance among same-class instances.

We first derive stochastic\nvirtual element equations for 2D and 3D linear elastic problems that may\ninvolve uncertainties in material properties, external forces, etc. A\nstochastic virtual element space that couples the deterministic virtual element\nspace and the stochastic space is constructed for this purpose and used to\napproximate the unknown stochastic solution. Two numerical frameworks are then\ndeveloped to solve the derived stochastic virtual element equations, including\na Polynomial Chaos approximation based approach and a weakly intrusive\napproximation based approach. In the PC based framework, the stochastic\nsolution is approximated using the Polynomial Chaos basis and solved via an\naugmented deterministic virtual element equation that is generated by applying\nthe stochastic Galerkin procedure to the original stochastic virtual element\nequation. In the weakly intrusive approximation based framework, the stochastic\nsolution is approximated by a summation of a set of products of random\nvariables and deterministic vectors, where the deterministic vectors are solved\nvia converting the original stochastic problem to deterministic virtual element\nequations by the stochastic Galerkin approach, and the random variables are\nsolved via converting the original stochastic problem to one-dimensional\nstochastic algebraic equations by the classical Galerkin procedure.

The total\nintegrated intensity of class I methanol masers is well correlated with the\nintegrated intensity and velocity coverage of the SiO (2--1) emission.

However, many of\nthese networks cannot perform well on removing the real noise (i.e. spatially\nvariant noise) generated during image acquisition or transmission, which\nseverely sets back their application in practical image denoising tasks.\nInstead of continuously increasing the network depth, many researchers have\nrevealed that expanding the width of networks can also be a useful way to\nimprove model performance. It also has been verified that feature filtering can\npromote the learning ability of the models. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose a novel Dual-branch Residual Attention Network (DRANet) for image\ndenoising, which has both the merits of a wide model architecture and\nattention-guided feature learning. The proposed DRANet includes two different\nparallel branches, which can capture complementary features to enhance the\nlearning ability of the model. We designed a new residual attention block (RAB)\nand a novel hybrid dilated residual attention block (HDRAB) for the upper and\nthe lower branches, respectively. The RAB and HDRAB can capture rich local\nfeatures through multiple skip connections between different convolutional\nlayers, and the unimportant features are dropped by the residual attention\nmodules. Meanwhile, the long skip connections in each branch, and the global\nfeature fusion between the two parallel branches can capture the global\nfeatures as well. Moreover, the proposed DRANet uses downsampling operations\nand dilated convolutions to increase the size of the receptive field, which can\nenable DRANet to capture more image context information. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that compared with other state-of-the-art denoising methods, our\nDRANet can produce competitive denoising performance both on synthetic and\nreal-world noise removal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2023 13:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Substantial progress has been made in pre- and\npost-processing for IIS, but the critical issue of interaction ambiguity\nnotably hindering segmentation quality, has been under-researched. To address\nthis, we introduce AdaptiveClick -- a clicks-aware transformer incorporating an\nadaptive focal loss, which tackles annotation inconsistencies with tools for\nmask- and pixel-level ambiguity resolution. To the best of our knowledge,\nAdaptiveClick is the first transformer-based, mask-adaptive segmentation\nframework for IIS. The key ingredient of our method is the Clicks-aware\nMask-adaptive Transformer Decoder (CAMD), which enhances the interaction\nbetween clicks and image features. Additionally, AdaptiveClick enables\npixel-adaptive differentiation of hard and easy samples in the decision space,\nindependent of their varying distributions. This is primarily achieved by\noptimizing a generalized Adaptive Focal Loss (AFL) with a theoretical\nguarantee, where two adaptive coefficients control the ratio of gradient values\nfor hard and easy pixels. Our analysis reveals that the commonly used Focal and\nBCE losses can be considered special cases of the proposed AFL loss.

In particular,\nthe use of a RIS imposes additional structured sparsity that, when paired with\nthe initial sparse line-of-sight (LoS) channels of the BS, facilitates\nbeneficial group sparsity. The resultant group sparsity significantly enriches\nthe energies of the original direct-only channel, enabling a greater\nconcentration of the LoS channel energies emanated from the same vehicle\nlocation index. Furthermore, the burst sparsity is exposed by representing the\nnon-line-of-sight (NLoS) channels as their sparse copies. This thus constitutes\nthe philosophy of the diverse sparsities of interest. Then, a diverse dynamic\nlayered structured sparsity (DiLuS) framework is customized for capturing\ndifferent priors for this pair of sparsities, based upon which the location\ntracking problem is formulated as a maximum a posterior (MAP) estimate of the\nlocation. Nevertheless, the tracking issue is highly intractable due to the\nill-conditioned sensing matrix, intricately coupled latent variables associated\nwith the BS and RIS, and the spatialtemporal correlations among the vehicle\nplatoon.

The\nproposed schemes are implemented without requiring any channel state\ninformation knowledge at the transmitter side; this characteristic makes them\nattractive for practical applications. In particular, the RIS elements are\npartitioned into sub-surfaces, which are periodically modified in an efficient\nway to assist the communication. Under this framework, we propose two\nlow-complexity partition-based schemes, where each sub-surface is adjusted by\nfollowing an amplitude-based or a phase-based approach. Specifically, the\nactivate-reflect (AR) scheme activates each sub-surface consecutively, by\nchanging the reflection amplitude of the corresponding elements.

Interestingly, Turbo-GPT3.5 performed well on customer service\ntasks, suggesting potential applications in human augmentation for chatbots in\ncall centers and routine advice services. The models also score well on sensory\nand experience-based tests such as wine sommelier, beer taster, emotional\nquotient, and body language reader. The OpenAI model improvement from Babbage\nto Turbo resulted in a median 60% better-graded performance in less than a few\nyears. This progress suggests that focusing on the latest model's shortcomings\ncould lead to a highly performant AI capable of mastering the most demanding\nprofessional certifications.

Multilevel partitioners\nare subject to two limitations: (i) hypergraph coarsening processes rely on\nlocal neighborhood structure without fully considering the global structure of\nthe hypergraph; and (ii) refinement heuristics risk entrapment in local minima.\nIn this paper, we describe K-SpecPart, a supervised spectral framework for\nmulti-way partitioning that directly tackles these two limitations. K-SpecPart\nrelies on the computation of generalized eigenvectors and supervised\ndimensionality reduction techniques to generate vertex embeddings. These are\ncomputational primitives that are fast and capture global structural properties\nof the hypergraph that are not explicitly considered by existing partitioners.\nK-SpecPart then converts the vertex embeddings into multiple partitioning\nsolutions. K-SpecPart introduces the idea of ''ensembling'' multiple solutions\nvia a cut-overlay clustering technique that often enables the use of\ncomputationally demanding partitioning methods such as ILP (integer linear\nprogramming). Using the output of a standard partitioner as a supervision hint,\nK-SpecPart effectively combines the strengths of established multilevel\npartitioning techniques with the benefits of spectral graph theory and other\ncombinatorial algorithms. K-SpecPart significantly extends ideas and algorithms\nthat first appeared in our previous work on the bipartitioner SpecPart. Our\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of K-SpecPart. For bipartitioning,\nK-SpecPart produces solutions with up to 15% cutsize improvement over SpecPart.\nFor multi-way partitioning, K-SpecPart produces solutions with up to 20%\ncutsize improvement over leading partitioners hMETIS and KaHyPar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2023 00:53:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2023 19:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-06"}
