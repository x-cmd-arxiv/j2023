Inferring the causal graph from\nobservational data without interventions, however, requires a lot of strong\nassumptions that are not always realistic. Even for domain experts it can be\nchallenging to express the causal graph. Therefore, metrics that quantitatively\nassess the goodness of a causal graph provide helpful checks before using it in\ndownstream tasks. Existing metrics provide an absolute number of\ninconsistencies between the graph and the observed data, and without a\nbaseline, practitioners are left to answer the hard question of how many such\ninconsistencies are acceptable or expected. Here, we propose a novel\nconsistency metric by constructing a surrogate baseline through node\npermutations. By comparing the number of inconsistencies with those on the\nsurrogate baseline, we derive an interpretable metric that captures whether the\nDAG fits significantly better than random. Evaluating on both simulated and\nreal data sets from various domains, including biology and cloud monitoring, we\ndemonstrate that the true DAG is not falsified by our metric, whereas the wrong\ngraphs given by a hypothetical user are likely to be falsified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 16:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

These subsystems often depend upon each other in a way that\nrestricts the overall system's dynamics. How does this network of dependencies\naffect the system's thermodynamics? Prior studies in the stochastic\nthermodynamics of multipartite processes (MPPs) have approached this question\nby restricting the system to allow only one subsystem to change state at a\ntime. However, in many real systems, such as chemical reaction networks or\nelectronic circuits, multiple subsystems must change state together. Therefore,\nstudies of MPPs do not apply to such systems. Here, we investigate the\nthermodynamics of composite processes, in which subsets of subsystems are\nallowed to change state simultaneously. These subsets correspond to the\nsubsystems that interact with a single mechanism (e.g., a thermal or chemical\nreservoir) that is coupled to the system. An MPP is simply a (subcase of a)\ncomposite process in which all such subsets have cardinality one. We\ndemonstrate the power of the composite systems framework to study the\nthermodynamics of multiple, co-evolving subsystems. In particular, we derive\nthermodynamic uncertainty relations for information flows in composite\nprocesses.

In AFQMC, the\nformulation of branching random walks along imaginary-time is needed to realize\na constraint to control the sign or phase problem. The constraint is derived\nfrom an exact gauge condition, and is in practice implemented approximately\nwith a trial wave function or trial density matrix, which can break exactness\nin the algorithm.

Early work on creating systems for doing so used\nproprioceptive sensing to estimate joint mechanisms during contact. However,\nnowadays, almost all systems use only vision and no longer consider\nproprioceptive information during contact. We believe that proprioceptive\ninformation during contact is a valuable source of information and did not find\nclear motivation for not using it in the literature. Therefore, in this paper,\nwe create a system that, starting from a given grasp, uses proprioceptive\nsensing to open cabinets with a position-controlled robot and a parallel\ngripper. We perform a qualitative evaluation of this system, where we find that\nslip between the gripper and handle limits the performance. Nonetheless, we\nfind that the system already performs quite well. This poses the question:\nshould we make more use of proprioceptive information during contact in\narticulated object manipulation systems, or is it not worth the added\ncomplexity, and can we manage with vision alone? We do not have an answer to\nthis question, but we hope to spark some discussion on the matter.

A common\nlimitation of both approaches is the use of global latent codes for the whole\nimage, which hinders the learning of independent object distributions.\nMotivated by SemanticStyleGAN (SSG), a recent work on latent space\ndisentanglement in human face generation, we propose a novel framework,\nUrban-StyleGAN, for urban scene generation and manipulation. We find that a\nstraightforward application of SSG leads to poor results because urban scenes\nare more complex than human faces. To provide a more compact yet disentangled\nlatent representation, we develop a class grouping strategy wherein individual\nclasses are grouped into super-classes. Moreover, we employ an unsupervised\nlatent exploration algorithm in the $\\mathcal{S}$-space of the generator and\nshow that it is more efficient than the conventional $\\mathcal{W}^{+}$-space in\ncontrolling the image content. Results on the Cityscapes and Mapillary datasets\nshow the proposed approach achieves significantly more controllability and\nimproved image quality than previous approaches on urban scenes and is on par\nwith general-purpose non-controllable generative models (like StyleGAN2) in\nterms of quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 16:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

We utilized a\nBayesian block analysis to identify M87 emission states with H.E.S.S.\nobservations from 2004 until 2021, dividing them into low, intermediate, and\nhigh states. Because of the causality argument, an extended ($\\gtrsim$kpc)\nsignal is allowed only in steady emission states.

Inversions provide a path\nforward by directly probing the internal structure of these stars from their\npulsation periods, quantifying which parts of the model are in need of\nimprovement. This method has been used for solar-like pulsators, but has not\nyet been applied to main-sequence gravity-mode pulsators. Our aim is to\ndetermine whether structure inversions for gravity-mode pulsators are feasible.\nWe focus on the case of slowly rotating SPB stars. We computed and analyzed\ndipole mode kernels for three variables pairs: $(\\rho,c), (N^2,c)$, and\n$(N^2,\\rho)$. We assessed the potential of these kernels by predicting the\noscillation frequencies of a model after perturbing its structure.

The near core region of the star can be probed\nwith SOLA, while RLS requires fine tuning to obtain accurate results. Both RLS\nand SOLA are strongly affected by the nonlinear dependencies on the structure\ndifferences, as these methods are based on a first-order approximation.

First, we show that this model accurately\nreproduces the GC and GGL of a mock galaxy sample in the TNG300 hydrodynamic\nsimulation with analogous properties to BOSS galaxies. Then, we switch our\nattention to observed BOSS galaxies at z=0.31-0.43, and we attempt to reproduce\ntheir GC and GGL by evaluating SHAMe on two different simulations: one adopting\nbest-fitting cosmological parameters from Planck and the other from weak\ngravitational lensing surveys (Low S8), where the amplitude of matter\nfluctuations is lower for the latter. We find excellent agreement between SHAMe\npredictions and observations for both cosmologies, indicating that the\nlensing-is-low problem originates from approximations in previous theoretical\ndescriptions of the data. The main difference between SHAMe results in these\ncosmologies is the level of galaxy assembly bias, which is approximately 20 and\n10% for Planck and Low S8, respectively. These results highlight the dangers of\nemploying oversimplified models to analyse current large-scale structure\ndatasets, and the need for realistic yet flexible descriptions of the\ngalaxy-halo connection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 17:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

We analyze two families of unitaries that\nare asymptotically more efficient to implement in this cost model than in the\nstandard one. The first example of quantum precomputation, based on density\nmatrix exponentiation, could offer an exponential advantage under certain\nconditions. The second example uses a variant of gate teleportation to achieve\na quadratic advantage when compared with implementing the unitaries directly.\nThese examples hint that quantum precomputation may offer a new arena in which\nto seek quantum advantage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 17:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

To\nshow this, we prove that injectivity of modules in HoTT interprets to internal\ninjectivity in these models.

Prompt learning\nis widely used in NLP but has limited applicability to RL due to the complex\nphysical meaning and environment-specific information contained within RL\nprompts. These factors require supervised learning to imitate the\ndemonstrations and may result in a loss of meaning after learning.\nAdditionally, directly extending prompt-tuning approaches to RL is challenging\nbecause RL prompts guide agent behavior based on environmental modeling and\nanalysis, rather than filling in missing information, making it unlikely that\nadjustments to the prompt format for downstream tasks, as in NLP, can yield\nsignificant improvements. In this work, we propose the Prompt-Tuning DT\nalgorithm to address these challenges by using trajectory segments as prompts\nto guide RL agents in acquiring environmental information and optimizing\nprompts via black-box tuning to enhance their ability to contain more relevant\ninformation, thereby enabling agents to make better decisions. Our approach\ninvolves randomly sampling a Gaussian distribution to fine-tune the elements of\nthe prompt trajectory and using preference ranking function to find the\noptimization direction, thereby providing more informative prompts and guiding\nthe agent towards specific preferences in the target environment. Extensive\nexperiments show that with only 0.03% of the parameters learned, Prompt-Tuning\nDT achieves comparable or even better performance than full-model fine-tuning\nin low-data scenarios.

Absorption and scattering by\nphotochemical hazes have the potential to drastically alter temperature\nstructure and atmospheric circulation of these planets but have previously been\nneglected in general circulation models (GCMs). We present GCM simulations of\nhot Jupiter HD 189733b that include photochemical hazes as a radiatively active\ntracer fully coupled to atmospheric dynamics. The influence of haze radiative\nfeedback strongly depends on the assumed haze optical properties. For soot\nhazes, two distinct thermal inversions form, separated by a local temperature\nminimum around 10$^{-5}$ bar caused by upwelling on the dayside mixing air with\nlow haze abundance upwards. The equatorial jet broadens and slows down. The\nhorizontal distribution of hazes remains relatively similar to simulations with\nradiatively passive tracers.

We define the\noptimizer and use the Reptile class to create an instance of the Reptile\nmeta-learning algorithm. We train the model using multiple tasks and episodes,\nchoosing actions using the current weights of the neural network model, taking\nthose actions in the environment, and updating the model weights using the\nReptile algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by printing the\ntotal reward for each episode. In addition, we compare the performance of the\nReptile algorithm approach to two other popular reinforcement learning\nalgorithms, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN),\napplied to the same Super Mario Bros task.

In this paper, we propose a new satisfiability-aided language modeling\n(SATLM) approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We use an\nLLM to generate a declarative task specification rather than an imperative\nprogram and leverage an off-the-shelf automated theorem prover to derive the\nfinal answer. This approach has two key advantages. The declarative\nspecification is closer to the problem description than the reasoning steps\nare, so the LLM can parse it out of the description more accurately.\nFurthermore, by offloading the actual reasoning task to an automated theorem\nprover, our approach can guarantee the correctness of the answer with respect\nto the parsed specification and avoid planning errors in the solving process.\nWe evaluate SATLM on 6 different datasets and show that it consistently\noutperforms program-aided LMs in an imperative paradigm.

However, they require a large amount of paired data,\nincurring extra costs. In this work, we present a new task: given a dataset\nwith synthetic images and labels and a dataset with unlabeled real images, our\ngoal is to learn a model that can generate images with the content of the input\nmask and the appearance of real images. This new task reframes the well-known\nunsupervised SIS task in a more practical setting, where we leverage cheaply\navailable synthetic data from a driving simulator to learn how to generate\nphotorealistic images of urban scenes.

The star emerged from this Great Dimming episode with its typical,\nroughly 400-day pulsation cycle halved, and a new dominant period of around 200\ndays. The dimming event has been attributed to a surface mass ejection, in\nwhich rising material drove shocks through the stellar atmosphere and expelled\nsome material, partially obscuring the star as it formed molecules and dust. In\nthis paper, we use hydrodynamic simulations to reveal the connections between\nBetelgeuse's vigorously convective envelope, the surface mass ejection, and the\npulsation mode switching that ensued. An anomalously hot convective plume,\ngenerated rarely but naturally in the star's turbulent envelope, can rise and\nbreak free from the surface, powering an upwelling that becomes the surface\nmass ejection. The rising plume also breaks the phase coherence of the star's\npulsation, causing the surface to keep expanding even as the deeper layers\ncontract. This drives a switch from the 400-day fundamental mode of pulsation,\nin which the whole star expands and contracts synchronously, to the 200-day\nfirst overtone, where a radial node separates the interior and exterior of the\nenvelope moving in opposite phase. We predict that the star's convective\nmotions will damp the overtone oscillation and Betelgeuse will return to its\nprevious, 400-day fundamental mode pulsation in the next 5-10 years.

We construct the generic lattice parent\nHamiltonians for these intermediate states, and show that they form an\nentangled superposition of a twisted quantum double with an SPT ordered state.\nNotably, we show that they can be connected to the TQD through a finite-depth,\nlocal quantum circuit which does not respect the global symmetry of the SET\norder. We introduce the so-called symmetry branch line operators and show that\nthey can be used to extract the symmetry fractionalization classes and symmetry\ndefectification classes of the SET phases with the input data $G$ and\n$[\\omega]\\in H^3(G,U(1))$ of the pre-gauged SPT ordered state. We illustrate\nthe procedure of preparing and characterizing the emerging SET ordered states\nfor some Abelian and non-Abelian examples such as dihedral groups $D_n$ and the\nquaternion group $Q_8$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 18:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

One mechanism leading to this time-dependent deformation under a\nconstant load is the dissolution/formation processes accompanied by\nchemo-mechanical interactions with a reactive environment. When\ndissolution/formation processes occur within the material phases, the\ndistribution of stress and strain within the material microstructure changes.\nIn the case of the dissolution process, the stress carried by the dissolving\nphase is distributed into neighboring voxels, which leads to further\ndeformation of the material. The aim of this study was to explore the\nrelationship between the microstructural evolution and time-dependent creep\nbehavior of rocks subjected to chemo-mechanical loading. This work uses the\nexperimentally characterized microstructural and mechanical evolution of a\nshale rock induced by interactions with a reactive brine (CO2-rich brine) and a\nnon-reactive brine (N2-rich brine) under high-pressure and high-temperature\nconditions to compute the resulting time-dependent deformation using a\ntime-stepping finite-element-based modeling approach.

The populations are arranged in a ring and oscillators belonging\nto one population are uniformly coupled to all oscillators within the same\npopulation and to those in the two neighboring populations. This topology\nsupports the existence of different configurations of coherent and incoherent\npopulations along the ring, but all of them are linearly unstable in most of\nthe parameter space. Yet, chimera dynamics is observed from random initial\nconditions in a wide parameter range, characterized by one incoherent and five\nsynchronized populations.

Second, concept embeddings should capture the semantic properties of\nconcepts, whereas contextualised word vectors are also affected by other\nfactors. To address these issues, we propose two contrastive learning\nstrategies, based on the view that whenever two sentences reveal similar\nproperties, the corresponding contextualised vectors should also be similar.\nOne strategy is fully unsupervised, estimating the properties which are\nexpressed in a sentence from the neighbourhood structure of the contextualised\nword embeddings.

We also proposed the Lyapunov barrier actor-critic\n(LBAC), a model-free RL algorithm, to search for a controller that satisfies\nthe data-based approximation of the safety and reachability conditions. The\nproposed approach is demonstrated through simulation and real-world robot\ncontrol experiments, i.e., a 2D quadrotor navigation task. The experimental\nfindings reveal this approach's effectiveness in reachability and safety,\nsurpassing other model-free RL methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 20:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Here we demonstrate an efficient SWAP gate that deterministically\nswaps a photon's polarization qubit with its spatial-momentum qubit on a\nnanofabricated two-level silicon-photonics chip containing three cascaded\ngates. The on-chip SWAP gate is comprehensively characterized by tomographic\nmeasurements with high fidelity for both single-qubit and two-qubit operation.\nThe coherence preservation of the SWAP gate process is verified by\nsingle-photon and two-photon quantum interference. The coherent reversible\nconversion of our SWAP gate facilitates a quantum interconnect between\ndifferent photonic subsystems with different degrees of freedom, demonstrated\nby distributing four Bell states between two chips. We also elucidate the\nsource of decoherence in the SWAP operation in pursuit of near-unity fidelity.\nOur deterministic SWAP gate in the silicon platform provides a pathway towards\nintegrated quantum information processing for interconnected modular systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 21:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

It does not prevent data misusage while at the same time stifling\nsensible use cases for data.\n  We think the conflict between data protection and increasingly data-driven\nsystems should be solved differently. When access to an employees' data is\ngiven, all usages should be made transparent to them, according to the concept\nof inverse transparency. This allows individuals to benefit from sensible data\nusage while addressing the potentially harmful consequences of data misusage.\nTo accomplish this, we propose a new design approach for workforce analytics we\nrefer to as inverse transparency by design.\n  To understand the developer and user perspectives on the proposal, we conduct\ntwo exploratory studies with students. First, we let small teams of developers\nimplement analytics tools with inverse transparency by design to uncover how\nthey judge the approach and how it materializes in their developed tools. We\nfind that architectural changes are made without inhibiting core functionality.\nThe developers consider our approach valuable and technically feasible. Second,\nwe conduct a user study over three months to let participants experience the\nprovided inverse transparency and reflect on their experience. The study models\na software development workplace where most work processes are already digital.\nParticipants perceive the transparency as beneficial and feel empowered by it.\nThey unanimously agree that it would be an improvement for the workplace.

However, as\nthe goals of a project shift over time, and developers and their habits change,\nthe performance of said models tends to degrade (drift) over time, until a\nmodel is retrained using new data. Current retraining practices typically are\nan afterthought (and hence costly), requiring a new model to be retrained from\nscratch on a large, updated data set at random points in time; also, there is\nno continuity between the old and new model. In this paper, we propose to use\nlifelong learning (LL) to continuously build and maintain ML-based software\nanalytics tools using an incremental learner that progressively updates the old\nmodel using new data. To avoid so-called ''catastrophic forgetting'' of\nimportant older data points, we adopt a replay buffer of older data, which\nstill allows us to drastically reduce the size of the overall training data\nset, and hence model training time. We empirically evaluate our LL approach on\ntwo industrial use cases, i.e., a brown build detector and a Just-in-Time risk\nprediction tool, showing how LL in practice manages to at least match\ntraditional retraining-from-scratch performance in terms of F1-score, while\nusing 3.3-13.7x less data at each update, thus considerably speeding up the\nmodel updating process. Considering both the computational effort of updates\nand the time between model updates, the LL setup needs 2-40x less computational\neffort than retraining-from-scratch setups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 21:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

As the Moore's Law is reaching its physical\nlimit, reducing computing complexity should be carefully considered, rather\nthan keep piling up silicon resources. The Tiny Triplet Finder is a scheme that\nreduces the computing complexity of the segment seeding. As a proof of concept,\na 3D track segment seeding engine core based on the Tiny Triplet Finder has\nbeen implemented and tested in a low-cost FPGA device. The seeding engine is\ndesigned to preselect and group hits (stubs) from detector layers to feed\nsubsequent track fitting stage. The seeding engine consists of a Hough\ntransform space for r-z view and a Tiny Triplet Finder for r-phi view to\nimplement 3D constraints. The seeding engine is organized as a pipeline so that\neach hit is processed in a single clock cycle. Taking advantage of the\nregister-like storage block scheme which enables effectively resetting of a\nblock RAM within a single clock cycle, clearing or refreshing the seeding\nengine takes only one clock cycles between two events. The Tiny Triplet Finder\nis also a generic coincidence finding scheme that can be used for many tasks.\nAs a versatility demonstration, track segment finding performances for two\ndistinctive detector geometries are tested in our seeding engine.

The coagent framework offers an\nalternative to backpropagation-based deep learning (BDL) that overcomes some of\nbackpropagation's main limitations. For example, coagent networks can compute\ndifferent parts of the network \\emph{asynchronously} (at different rates or at\ndifferent times), can incorporate non-differentiable components that cannot be\nused with backpropagation, and can explore at levels higher than their action\nspaces (that is, they can be designed as hierarchical networks for exploration\nand/or temporal abstraction). However, the coagent framework is not just an\nalternative to BDL; the two approaches can be blended: BDL can be combined with\ncoagent learning rules to create architectures with the advantages of both\napproaches. This work generalizes the coagent theory and learning rules\nprovided by previous works; this generalization provides more flexibility for\nnetwork architecture design within the coagent framework. This work also\nstudies one of the chief disadvantages of coagent networks: high variance\nupdates for networks that have many coagents and do not use backpropagation.

Next, we turn our\nfocus to the development of accessible and reproducible robotic platforms for\nscientific research. We propose a new concept for reproducible robotics\nresearch that integrates development and benchmarking, so that reproducibility\nis obtained \"by design\" from the beginning of the research and development\nprocess. We then propose a framework called SHARC (SHared Autonomy for Remote\nCollaboration), to improve accessibility for underwater robotic intervention\noperations. SHARC allows multiple remote scientists to efficiently plan and\nexecute high-level sampling procedures using an underwater manipulator while\ndeferring low-level control to the robot. Lastly, we developed the first\nhardware-based MOOC in AI and robotics. This course allows learners to study\nautonomy hands-on by making real robots make their own decisions and accomplish\nbroadly defined tasks. We design a new robotic platform from the ground up to\nsupport this new learning experience. A fully browser-based interface, based on\nleading tools and technologies for code development, testing, validation, and\ndeployment serves to maximize the accessibility of these educational resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 23:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

State of the art desalinators typically evaporate water using\nwicking structures to achieve high solar-to-vapor efficiency by minimizing heat\nloss. However, wicking structures cannot reject salt continuously which limits\nthe operating duration of the desalinators to several hours before the devices\nare turned off to reject salt. While significant research has focused on\ndeveloping efficient evaporators to achieve high solar-to-vapor efficiency,\ninefficient condensers have become the bottleneck for the overall\nsolar-to-water efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we designed a passive\ninverted single stage solar membrane desalinator that achieves continuous\ndesalination and salt rejection. By flowing salt water on a radiative\nabsorbing, porous, hydrophobic evaporator membrane using gravity, salt\ncontinuously diffuses away from the membrane while allowing heated water vapor\nto transport to and condense on a cooler microporous membrane below. Our design\nutilizes thin-film condensation on a microporous membrane which offers ample\nthree-phase contact region to enhance condensation phase change heat transfer.\nBy condensing within the microporous membrane, we reduce the gap distance\nbetween the condenser and evaporator membranes, which reduces the vapor\ntransport resistance. We experimentally demonstrated a record-high continuous\ndesalination and salt rejection test duration of 7 days under one-sun. Despite\nan increased convection heat loss necessary for salt rejection on the\nevaporator, our desalinator still achieved a water-collection rate of 0.487\n$kg$ $m^{-2}h^{-1}$, which corresponds to a 32.2% solar-to-water efficiency.\nThis work signifies an improvement in the robustness of current state of the\nart desalinators and presents a new architecture to further optimize passive\nsolar desalinators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 23:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

The Procrustes analysis of\nable-bodied movement showed that the hand and forearm segments moved in a more\ncoordinated manner during initiation. The shoulder and elbow become more\ncoordinated during movement completion. In impaired movement, this coordination\nbetween the hand and forearm is disrupted.

To reach performance comparable to centralized training,\ndistributed frameworks focus on maximally recovering cross-instance node\ndependencies with either communication across instances or periodic fallback to\ncentralized training, which create overhead and limit the framework\nscalability. In this work, we present a simplified framework for distributed\nGNN training that does not rely on the aforementioned costly operations, and\nhas improved scalability, convergence speed and performance over the\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, our framework (1) assembles\nindependent trainers, each of which asynchronously learns a local model on\nlocally-available parts of the training graph, and (2) only conducts periodic\n(time-based) model aggregation to synchronize the local models. Backed by our\ntheoretical analysis, instead of maximizing the recovery of cross-instance node\ndependencies -- which has been considered the key behind closing the\nperformance gap between model aggregation and centralized training -- , our\nframework leverages randomized assignment of nodes or super-nodes (i.e.,\ncollections of original nodes) to partition the training graph such that it\nimproves data uniformity and minimizes the discrepancy of gradient and loss\nfunction across instances.

DB has been so far\nmainly considered in classical settings and for classical applications,\nespecially in wireless settings, e.g., to prevent relay attacks in wireless\nauthentication and access control systems, and for secure localization. While\nrecent research has started exploring DB in quantum settings, all current\nquantum DB (QDB) protocols employ quantum-bits (qubits) in the rapid-bit\nexchange phase and only perform one-way DB. Specifically, the latest QDB\nproposals improve the initial ones by adding resistance to photon number\nsplitting attacks, and improving round complexity by avoiding communication\nfrom the prover to the verifier in the last authentication phase. This paper\npresents two new QDB protocols that differ from previously proposed protocols\nin several aspects: (1) to the best of our knowledge, our protocols are the\nfirst to utilize entangled qubits in the rapid-bit exchange phase, previous\nprotocols relied on sending individual qubits, not those from a pair of\nentangled ones; (2) our second protocol can perform mutual QDB between two\nparties in one execution, previous QDB protocols had to be executed twice with\nthe prover and verifier roles reversed in each execution; (3) the use of\nentangled qubits in our protocols thwarts attacks that previous QDB protocols\nwere prone to; (4) and finally, our protocols also eliminate the need for\ncommunication from the prover to the verifier in the last authentication phase,\nwhich was necessary in some previous QDB protocols.

This is often the case in practical\nsettings such as the modeling of case counts of infectious disease or the\ncarbon dioxide (CO2) concentration over time. In this paper, we introduce a\nclass of Gaussian processes, called seasonal Gaussian Processes (sGP), for\nmodel-based inference of such quasi-periodic behavior. We illustrate that the\nexact sGP can be efficiently fit within $O(n)$ time using its state space\nrepresentation for equally spaced locations. However, for large datasets with\nirregular spacing, the exact approach becomes computationally inefficient and\nunstable. To address this, we develop a continuous finite dimensional\napproximation for sGP using the seasonal B-spline (sB-spline) basis constructed\nby damping B-splines with sinusoidal functions. We prove that the proposed\napproximation converges in distribution to the true sGP as the number of basis\nfunctions increases, and show its superior approximation quality through\nnumerical studies. We also provide a unified and interpretable way to define\npriors for the sGP, based on the notion of predictive standard deviation (PSD).\nFinally, we implement the proposed inference method on several real data\nexamples to illustrate its practical usage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 02:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

One of the advanced methods for constructing this\npotential is the semi-microscopical double-folding model with the M3Y-Paris\nNN-forces. Proton and neutron densities are significant ingredient of this\nmodel. Correct nucleon density (ND) must reproduce experimental nuclear charge\ndensity (NCD). We consider several versions of NDs available in the literature\nand construct our own approximation for the ND of even-even spherical nuclei\n12C, 16O, 40Ca which is abbreviated as FE-density (Fermi+exponential). We\ncarefully compare the NCDs resulting from different versions of NDs with the\nexperimental NCSs. After finding the nucleus-nucleus potential using the\ndouble-folding model with the density dependent M3Y-Paris NN-forces and FE\ndensities we evaluate the above-barrier fusion cross sections for five\nreactions, 12C+12C, 12C+16O, 16O+16O, 16O+40Ca, and 40Ca+40Ca, where the\nexperimental data are available. The cross sections are calculated using two\napproaches: a) the barrier penetration model and b) the Trajectory Model with\nsurface friction (TM). To find the transmission coefficients for TM, the\nLangevin equations are employed. For all considered reactions, our TM typically\nreproduces the above-barrier experimental cross sections within 10-15%. The\nonly adjustable parameter of the model, the optimal friction strength K_Rm, was\nfound to be about 90 zs/GeV for light reactions 12C+12C, 12C+16O, 16O+16O and\nabout 15 zs/GeV for heavier reactions 16O+40Ca and 40Ca+40Ca. The latter\nfindings are in reasonable agreement with the systematics found earlier. Thus,\nthe FE-recipe allows reproducing simultaneously with good accuracy both the\ncharge nucleon density and the above-barrier fusion cross sections for five\nreactions involving 12C, 16O, 40Ca nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 02:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Among existing solutions,\nautomatic ULTR algorithms that jointly learn user bias models (i.e., propensity\nmodels) with unbiased rankers have received a lot of attention due to their\nsuperior performance and low deployment cost in practice. Despite their\ntheoretical soundness, the effectiveness is usually justified under a weak\nlogging policy, where the ranking model can barely rank documents according to\ntheir relevance to the query. However, when the logging policy is strong, e.g.,\nan industry-deployed ranking policy, the reported effectiveness cannot be\nreproduced. In this paper, we first investigate ULTR from a causal perspective\nand uncover a negative result: existing ULTR algorithms fail to address the\nissue of propensity overestimation caused by the query-document relevance\nconfounder. Then, we propose a new learning objective based on backdoor\nadjustment and highlight its differences from conventional propensity models,\nwhich reveal the prevalence of propensity overestimation. On top of that, we\nintroduce a novel propensity model called Logging-Policy-aware Propensity (LPP)\nmodel and its distinctive two-step optimization strategy, which allows for the\njoint learning of LPP and ranking models within the automatic ULTR framework,\nand actualize the unconfounded propensity estimation for ULTR.

One possible explanation is the presence of a double-diffusive\nstaircase below the planet's outer convection zone, which inhibits mixing\nacross the deeper layers. However, hydrodynamic simulations have shown that\nthese staircases are not long-lasting and can be disrupted by overshooting\nconvection. In this paper we suggests that planetary rotation could be another\nfactor for the longevity of primordial composition gradients. Using rotational\nmixing-length theory and 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that\nrotation significantly reduces both the convective velocity and the mixing of\nprimordial composition gradients. In particular, for Jovian conditions at\n$t\\sim10^{8}~\\mathrm{yrs}$ after formation, rotation reduces the convective\nvelocity by a factor of 6, and in turn, the kinetic energy flux available for\nmixing gets reduced by a factor of $6^3\\sim 200$. This leads to an entrainment\ntimescale that is more than two orders of magnitude longer than without\nrotation. We encourage future hydrodynamic models of Jupiter and other gas\ngiants to include rapid rotation, because the decrease in the mixing efficiency\ncould explain why Jupiter and Saturn are not fully mixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 03:07:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2023 14:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

To address this, several efficient variants\nof Transformers have been proposed to accelerate computation or reduce memory\nconsumption while preserving performance. This paper presents an efficient\nvision Transformer, called CageViT, that is guided by convolutional activation\nto reduce computation. Our CageViT, unlike current Transformers, utilizes a new\nencoder to handle the rearranged tokens, bringing several technical\ncontributions: 1) Convolutional activation is used to pre-process the token\nafter patchifying the image to select and rearrange the major tokens and minor\ntokens, which substantially reduces the computation cost through an additional\nfusion layer. 2) Instead of using the class activation map of the convolutional\nmodel directly, we design a new weighted class activation to lower the model\nrequirements. 3) To facilitate communication between major tokens and fusion\ntokens, Gated Linear SRA is proposed to further integrate fusion tokens into\nthe attention mechanism. We perform a comprehensive validation of CageViT on\nthe image classification challenge.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CageViT outperforms the\nmost recent state-of-the-art backbones by a large margin in terms of\nefficiency, while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy (e.g. a\nmoderate-sized 43.35M model trained solely on 224 x 224 ImageNet-1K can achieve\nTop-1 accuracy of 83.4% accuracy).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 03:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

While rate estimation would be straight-forward with\ncomplete data, in the autonomous driving setting this estimation is greatly\ncomplicated by the fact that \\textit{detecting} these events within large\ndriving logs is a non-trivial task that often involves human reviewers.

In\naddition, the framework allows for valid streaming estimates at any phase of\nthe data collection process, even when labels are incomplete, for which we\ndevelop the maximum likelihood estimate and show it is unbiased. Constructing\nhonest and effective confidence intervals (CI) for these rate estimates,\nparticularly for rare safety-critical events, is a novel and challenging\nstatistical problem due to the complexity of the data likelihood.

We have also shown that ternary states {-1,\n0, +1} can be implemented with three magnetoresistance values obtained from a\np-MTJ corresponding to ferromagnetic up, down, and skyrmion state, with 99%\nswitching probability in the presence of room temperature thermal noise in an\nenergy-efficient way, requiring ~3 fJ energy on an average for each switching\noperation. Additionally, we show that our proposed ternary memory demonstrates\nan improvement in area and energy by at least 2X and ~60X respectively,\ncompared to state-of-the-art spin-transfer torque (STT)-based non-volatile\nmagnetic multistate memories. Furthermore, these three states can be\npotentially utilized for energy-efficient, high-density in-memory quantized\ndeep neural network implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 05:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Firstly, as expected when pressure forces oppose compression,\nan increase in anti-correlation between density and magnetic field strengths\nobtains even in subsonic flows with the anti-correlation arising from the\nintense but rarer magnetic structures. In supersonic flows, due to stronger\ncompressive motions density and magnetic field strength continue to maintain a\npositive correlation. However, the degree of positive correlation decreases as\nthe dynamo saturates. Secondly, we find that the unit vectors of $\\nabla\\rho$\nand $\\nabla B^{2}$ are preferentially anti-parallel to each other in subsonic\nflows. This is indicative of magnetic pressure opposing compression. This\nanti-parallel alignment persists in transonic and supersonic flows at dynamo\nsaturation. However, compressive motions also lead to the emergence of a\nparallel alignment in these flows. Finally, we consider the work done against\nthe components of the Lorentz force and the different sources of magnetic\nenergy growth and dissipation. We show that while in subsonic flows,\nsuppression of field line stretching is dominant in saturating the dynamo, the\npicture is different in supersonic flows. Both field line stretching and\ncompression amplifies the field initially. But the growing magnetic pressure\nopposes further compression of magnetic flux which then dominates the\nsaturation of the dynamo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 06:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Our model takes into account the loss of angular\nmomentum due to radiation and the scale-height derivative in the basic\nequations of the GR slim disk. For comparison purposes, we also provide a new\nanalytical solution for a radiation-pressure-dominant GR slim disk, which\nneglects the angular momentum loss due to radiation and the scale-height\nderivative. We find that the radiation pressure enhances by incorporating the\nscale height derivative into the basic equations. As a result, the surface\ndensity near the disk's inner edge decreases, whereas the disk temperature and\nscale height increase, brightening the disk spectrum in the soft X-ray\nwaveband. Notably, an extremely high mass accretion rate significantly enhances\nthe effect of the scale-height derivative, affecting the entire disk. In\ncontrast, the inclusion of the radiation-driven angular momentum loss only\nslightly influences the disk surface density and temperature compared with the\ncase of the scale-height derivative inclusion. The X-ray luminosity increases\nsignificantly due to scale height derivative for $\\dot{M}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}\n\\gtrsim 2$.

A malicious node can\nillegitimately claim a closer position to the root by advertising a lower rank\nvalue trapping other nodes to forward their traffic through that malicious\nnode. In this study, we show how this behavior can have a detrimental side\neffect on the network via extensive simulations and propose a new secure\nobjective function to prevent such an attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 08:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Recent studies show that around one quarter of the existing polyps\nare routinely missed. While some of these do appear in the endoscopist's field\nof view, others are missed due to a partial coverage of the colon. The task of\ndetecting and marking unseen regions of the colon has been addressed in recent\nwork, where the common approach is based on dense 3D reconstruction, which\nproves to be challenging due to lack of 3D ground truth and periods with poor\nvisual content. In this paper we propose a novel and complementary method to\ndetect deficient local coverage in real-time for video segments where a\nreliable 3D reconstruction is impossible. Our method aims to identify skips\nalong the colon caused by a drifted position of the endoscope during poor\nvisibility time intervals. The proposed solution consists of two phases. During\nthe first, time segments with good visibility of the colon and gaps between\nthem are identified. During the second phase, a trained model operates on each\ngap, answering the question: Do you observe the same scene before and after the\ngap? If the answer is negative, the endoscopist is alerted and can be directed\nto the appropriate area in real-time. The second phase model is trained using a\ncontrastive loss based on auto-generated examples. Our method evaluation on a\ndataset of 250 procedures annotated by trained physicians provides sensitivity\nof 0.75 with specificity of 0.9.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 08:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Unitarity is shown to require that the entanglement entropy of the\nwitness photon does not change after its entangled partner undergoes\nscattering. The final mutual information of the electronic and witness\nparticle's polarization is nonzero for low energy Compton scattering. This\nindicates that the two particles become correlated in spite of no direct\ninteraction.

Recent\ndiffusion models show realistic and detailed image generation through a\nsequence of denoising refinements and motivate us to introduce them to\nlow-light image enhancement for recovering realistic details. However, we found\ntwo problems when doing this, i.e., 1) diffusion models keep constant\nresolution in one reverse process, which limits the speed; 2) diffusion models\nsometimes result in global degradation (e.g., RGB shift). To address the above\nproblems, this paper proposes a Pyramid Diffusion model (PyDiff) for low-light\nimage enhancement. PyDiff uses a novel pyramid diffusion method to perform\nsampling in a pyramid resolution style (i.e., progressively increasing\nresolution in one reverse process). Pyramid diffusion makes PyDiff much faster\nthan vanilla diffusion models and introduces no performance degradation.\nFurthermore, PyDiff uses a global corrector to alleviate the global degradation\nthat may occur in the reverse process, significantly improving the performance\nand making the training of diffusion models easier with little additional\ncomputational consumption. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show\nthat PyDiff achieves superior performance and efficiency.

The stress balance at the\nsurface is modeled using a modified membrane equation. There is an insoluble\nsurfactant at the liquid-liquid interface of the flow system. The linear\ninstability of perturbation waves is captured by numerically solving the\ngeneralized Orr-Sommerfeld eigenvalue problem using Chebyshev spectral\ncollocation technique. Four different types of linear stability modes are\nidentified: namely surface mode (SM), interface mode (IM), interface surfactant\nmode (ISM), and shear mode (SHM). The floating flexible plate has an inferior\nimpact on all the existing modes in the longwave zone. However, a significant\ninfluence is noticed for the finite wave numbers. The surface and interface\nwave instabilities can be suppressed in the smaller wavenumber zone by imposing\nhigher structural rigidity and uniform thickness of the flexible plate. The\nstabilizing nature of the surface mode becomes more powerful when the top layer\nviscosity is dominant. A new interfacial instability emerges when the top layer\nis less viscous than the lower one. At moderate Reynolds numbers, the behaviour\nof interface mode is different in two different zones $mr<1$ and $mr>1$, where\n$m$ and $r$ denote the viscosity and density ratio, respectively. Further, the\nunstable shear modes induced by the top and bottom layers are detected under\nthe low inclination angles with a strong inertia force. The occurrence of the\nshear modes demands the bottom layer's viscosity and density to be very high\nthan that of the upper layer. The influence of characteristic parameters of the\nflexible plate on the lower layer shear mode is not very sensitive. Finally,\nthe competition between the different modes for dominance of stability\nboundaries is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 08:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

For the state of the art representation learning part,\nour methodology employs Guided Backpropagation to interpret the regions of\ninterest of the input data. For the clustering part, the methodology relies on\nShallow Trees to explain the clustering result using optimized depth decision\ntree. Finally, a data-specific visualizations part enables connection for each\nof the clusters to the input data trough the relevant features. We explain on a\nuse case of wireless spectrum activity clustering how the CNN-based, deep\nclustering architecture reasons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 08:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

It is expected that the prediction can maintain the corresponding\nrotation when objects rotate, but severe mutational in angular prediction is\nsometimes observed when objects rotate near the boundary angle, which is\nwell-known boundary discontinuity problem. The problem has been long believed\nto be caused by the sharp loss increase at the angular boundary during\ntraining, and widely used IoU-like loss generally deal with this problem by\nloss-smoothing. However, we experimentally find that even state-of-the-art\nIoU-like methods do not actually solve the problem. On further analysis, we\nfind the essential cause of the problem lies at discontinuous angular\nground-truth(box), not just discontinuous loss. There always exists an\nirreparable gap between continuous model ouput and discontinuous angular\nground-truth, so angular prediction near the breakpoints becomes highly\nunstable, which cannot be eliminated just by loss-smoothing in IoU-like\nmethods. To thoroughly solve this problem, we propose a simple and effective\nAngle Correct Module (ACM) based on polar coordinate decomposition. ACM can be\neasily plugged into the workflow of oriented object detectors to repair angular\nprediction. It converts the smooth value of the model output into sawtooth\nangular value, and then IoU-like loss can fully release their potential.\nExtensive experiments on multiple datasets show that whether Gaussian-based or\nSkewIoU methods are improved to the same performance of AP50 and AP75 with the\nenhancement of ACM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 09:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

With preliminary experimental results\ndemonstrated, a method enabling verification and cross-comparison would\nincrease confidence in the experimental results. Purpose: To generate synthetic\nspectral panoramic images and compare the synthetic images against experimental\nspectral panoramic images Methods: A simulation framework for generating\nsynthetic spectral panoramic images from CT volumes is described. A cone beam\nCT scan of an anthropomorphic head phantom is used as input. An experimental\nspectral panoramic image of the same phantom is acquired. The framework also\nincludes a tool for estimating anatomical noise. Results: The output of the\nframework of an anthropomorphic head phantom is compared against an\nexperimental spectral panoramic image of the same phantom. The synthetic and\nexperimental spectral panoramic images resemble each other considerably,\nespecially the bone features. In the soft tissue images there are some\ndifferences, which are a result of the differences on how each image is\ngenerated. Finally, anatomical noise is revealed to be small, with the spread\nin the values in the order of 1 cm for the soft tissue and 1 mm for the\ncortical bone through most of the image. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that\ngenerating synthetic spectral panoramic images from CT volumes is possible. The\nsynthetic images have many similarities with the experimental results,\nincreasing the confidence in the correctness of the information contained\nwithin experimental spectral panoramic images and indicating that the synthetic\nimages could be useful in further research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 09:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Hence, it requires identifying complex human conversational strategies\nand dynamics in addition to generic emotions to control and interpret\nempathetic responding capabilities of chatbots.

According\nto the radio power and morphology, radio galaxies can be separated into\nFanaroff-Riley Type I radio galaxies (FR-Is) and Type II radio galaxies\n(FR-IIs). In this paper, we consider the unification of FR-Is and BL Lacertae\nobjects (BL Lacs), and assume FR-Is to be a standard candle to discuss the\nbeaming effect for Fermi-LAT-detected FR-Is. Our main conclusions are as\nfollows: (1) The estimated Doppler factors for 30 Fermi-LAT-detected FR-Is are\nin a range of $\\delta_{\\rm{I}}=0.88-7.49$. The average Doppler factor\n($<\\delta_{\\rm{I}}>=2.56\\pm0.30$) of the 30 FR-Is is smaller than that\n($<\\delta_{\\rm{BL}}>=10.28\\pm2.03$) of the 126 Fermi-LAT-detected BL Lacs,\nsupporting the unification model that FR-Is are regarded as the misaligned BL\nLacs with smaller Doppler factors; (2) We propose that different regions of\nFR-Is in the plot of the $\\gamma$-ray luminosity against the photon spectral\nindex $(\\log L_{\\gamma}-\\alpha_{\\rm{ph}})$ may indicate the different beaming\neffects; (3) The average Doppler factor of the 6 TeV FR-Is is similar to that\nof the 24 non-TeV FR-Is, which implies that the difference between the TeV and\nGeV emissions is not driven by the beaming effect in the Fermi-LAT-detected\nFR-I samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 10:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

In the literature, several\nstudies address this issue by leveraging direct features of the posts,\ntypically related to the textual content and the user publishing it. In this\npaper, we argue that the rise of engagement is also related to another key\ncomponent, which is the semantic connection among posts published by users in\nsocial media. Hence, we propose TweetGage, a Graph Neural Network solution to\npredict the user engagement based on a novel graph-based model that represents\nthe relationships among posts.

Water is the\nmost common contaminant and alters numerous properties of a cryogenic optical\nsystem. Too much ice means that Euclid's calibration requirements and science\ngoals cannot be met. Euclid must then be thermally decontaminated, a long and\nrisky process. We need to understand how iced optics affect the data and when a\ndecontamination is required. This is essential to build adequate calibration\nand survey plans, yet a comprehensive analysis in the context of an\nastrophysical space survey has not been done before.\n  In this paper we look at other spacecraft with well-documented outgassing\nrecords, and we review the formation of thin ice films. A mix of amorphous and\ncrystalline ices is expected for Euclid. Their surface topography depends on\nthe competing energetic needs of the substrate-water and the water-water\ninterfaces, and is hard to predict with current theories. We illustrate that\nwith scanning-tunnelling and atomic-force microscope images.\n  Industrial tools exist to estimate contamination, and we must understand\ntheir uncertainties. We find considerable knowledge errors on the diffusion and\nsublimation coefficients, limiting the accuracy of these tools. We developed a\nwater transport model to compute contamination rates in Euclid, and find\ngeneral agreement with industry estimates. Tests of the Euclid flight hardware\nin space simulators did not pick up contamination signals; our in-flight\ncalibrations observations will be much more sensitive.\n  We must understand the link between the amount of ice on the optics and its\neffect on Euclid's data. Little research is available about this link, possibly\nbecause other spacecraft can decontaminate easily, quenching the need for a\ndeeper understanding. In our second paper we quantify the various effects of\niced optics on spectrophotometric data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 10:15:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2023 15:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-24"}

However, so far\nfilter-decomposition-based affine G-CNN methods rely on parameter sharing for\nachieving high parameter efficiency and suffer from a heavy computational\nburden. They also use a limited number of transformations and in particular\nignore the shear transform in the application. In this paper, we address these\nproblems by emphasizing the importance of the diversity of transformations. We\npropose a flexible and efficient strategy based on weighted filter-wise Monte\nCarlo sampling. In addition, we introduce shear equivariant CNN to address the\nhighly sparse representations of natural images. We demonstrate that the\nproposed methods are intrinsically an efficient generalization of traditional\nCNNs, and we explain the advantage of bottleneck architectures used in the\nexisting state-of-the-art CNN models such as ResNet, ResNext, and ConvNeXt from\nthe group-equivariant perspective.

The ballistic switching by a pulsed magnetic filed is a\npromising candidate for the high-speed switching. It is known that the\nswitching speed of the ballistic switching can be increased by increasing the\nmagnitude of the pulsed magnetic field. However it is difficult to generate a\nstrong and short magnetic field pulse in a small device. Here we explore\nanother direction to achieve the high-speed ballistic switching by designing\nmaterial parameters such as anisotropy constant, saturation magnetization, and\nthe Gilbert damping constant. We perform the macrospin simulations for the\nballistic switching of in-plane magnetized nano magnets with varying material\nparameters. The results are analyzed based on the switching dynamics on the\nenergy density contour. We show that the pulse width required for the ballistic\nswitching can be reduced by increasing the magnetic anisotropy constant or by\ndecreasing the saturation magnetization. We also show that there exists an\noptimal value of the Gilbert damping constant that minimizes the pulse width\nrequired for the ballistic switching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 10:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Recently, various studies have focused\non this task and have achieved promising performance. However, current\nspeech-to-image approaches are based on a stacked modular framework that\nsuffers from three vital issues: 1) Training separate networks is\ntime-consuming as well as inefficient and the convergence of the final\ngenerative model strongly depends on the previous generators; 2) The quality of\nprecursor images is ignored by this architecture; 3) Multiple discriminator\nnetworks are required to be trained. To this end, we propose an efficient and\neffective single-stage framework called Fusion-S2iGan to yield perceptually\nplausible and semantically consistent image samples on the basis of given\nspoken descriptions. Fusion-S2iGan introduces a visual+speech fusion module\n(VSFM), constructed with a pixel-attention module (PAM), a speech-modulation\nmodule (SMM) and a weighted-fusion module (WFM), to inject the speech embedding\nfrom a speech encoder into the generator while improving the quality of\nsynthesized pictures.

However, the design of the neural network structure\nbasically relies on prior knowledge and experience, which has caused great\ntrouble and high computational overhead. Therefore, we propose a neural\narchitecture search-guided method, namely NAS-PINN, to automatically search the\noptimum neural architecture for solving certain PDEs. By relaxing the search\nspace into a continuous one and utilizing masks to realize the addition of\ntensors in different shapes, NAS-PINN can be trained through a bi-level\noptimization, where the inner loop optimizes the weights and bias of neural\nnetworks and the outer loop the architecture parameters. We verify the ability\nof NAS-PINN by several numerical experiments including Poisson, Burgers, and\nAdvection equations. The characteristics of effective neural architectures for\nsolving different PDEs are summarized, which can be used to guide the design of\nneural networks in PINN. It is found that more hidden layers do not necessarily\nmean better performance and sometimes can be harmful.

This\nraises the doubt that the push pulse may directly promote dissociation without\ninvolving delocalized states. Here, we perform PPP experiments with mid-IR push\npulses at energies that are well below the binding energy of a CTX state\n(0.12-0.25 eV). We identify three types of CTX: delocalized, localized, and\ntrapped. The excitation resides over multiple polymer chains in delocalized\nCTXs, while is restricted to a single chain (albeit maintaining a degree of\nintrachain delocalization) in localized CTXs. Trapped CTXs are instead\ncompletely localized. The pump pulse generates a hot delocalized CTX, which\nrelaxes to a localized CTX, and eventually to trapped states. We find that\nphoto-exciting localized CTXs with push pulses resonant to the mid-IR charge\ntransfer absorption can promote delocalization and contribute to the formation\nof long-lived charge separated states. On the other hand, we found that trapped\nCTX are non-responsive to the push pulses. We hypothesize that delocalized\nstates identified in prior studies are only accessible in systems where there\nis significant interchain electronic coupling or regioregularity that supports\neither interchain or intrachain polaron delocalization. This emphasizes the\nimportance of engineering the micromorphology and energetics of the\ndonor-acceptor interface to exploit a full potential of a material for\nphotovoltaic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 11:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

It can be used for a digital\nplatform of 3D jaw-teeth-face models in a variety of applications, including 3D\ndigital treatment planning and orthognathic surgery. Difficulties in accurately\nmerging facial scans and CBCT images are due to the different image acquisition\nmethods and limited area of correspondence between the two facial surfaces. In\naddition, it is difficult to use machine learning techniques because they use\nface-related 3D medical data with radiation exposure, which are difficult to\nobtain for training. The proposed method addresses these problems by reusing an\nexisting machine-learning-based 2D landmark detection algorithm in an\nopen-source library and developing a novel mathematical algorithm that\nidentifies paired 3D landmarks from knowledge of the corresponding 2D\nlandmarks. A main contribution of this study is that the proposed method does\nnot require annotated training data of facial landmarks because it uses a\npre-trained facial landmark detection algorithm that is known to be robust and\ngeneralized to various 2D face image models. Note that this reduces a 3D\nlandmark detection problem to a 2D problem of identifying the corresponding\nlandmarks on two 2D projection images generated from two different projection\nangles. Here, the 3D landmarks for registration were selected from the\nsub-surfaces with the least geometric change under the CBCT and face scan\nenvironments. For the final fine-tuning of the registration, the Iterative\nClosest Point method was applied, which utilizes geometrical information around\nthe 3D landmarks.

However, most materials\nonly show a weak response to ultrasound, and those materials that are\nresponsive to ultrasound to date require the use of high-powers, which is\nassociated with undesirable effects such as streaming, cavitation, or\ntemperature rise. These effects make it difficult to control the response and\nmay even cause damage to the medium where the ultrasound is applied. Moreover,\nmaterials that are currently in use typically make use of all-or-nothing\neffects, limiting the ability to fine-tune the response of the material on the\nfly. For these reasons, it would be desirable to identify materials that can\nrespond to low intensity ultrasound. Here we demonstrate that antibubbles are a\nlow-intensity-ultrasound-responsive material system that can controllably\nrelease a payload using acoustic pressures in the kPa range. By tuning the size\nand composition of the antibubble, the release pressure can be tuned, and the\nresponse can be switched between a single release and stepwise release across\nmultiple ultrasound pulses. Observations using confocal and high-speed\nmicroscopy revealed the different ways in which antibubbles respond to\nultrasound and release the payload. Our findings lay the groundwork to design\nantibubble formulations that controllably respond to low-intensity ultrasound\nand thereby open up a wide range of applications ranging from\nultrasound-responsive material systems to advanced contrast agents and carriers\nfor targeted delivery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 11:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

We are interested in this question because if LLMs were able to\nimprove each other, it would imply the possibility of creating strong AI agents\nwith minimal human intervention. We ask two LLMs to negotiate with each other,\nplaying the roles of a buyer and a seller, respectively. They aim to reach a\ndeal with the buyer targeting a lower price and the seller a higher one. A\nthird language model, playing the critic, provides feedback to a player to\nimprove the player's negotiation strategies. We let the two agents play\nmultiple rounds, using previous negotiation history and AI feedback as\nin-context demonstrations to improve the model's negotiation strategy\niteratively. We use different LLMs (GPT and Claude) for different roles and use\nthe deal price as the evaluation metric.

Specifically, we revisit a recent result on the stability of\nYudovich's solutions to the incompressible Euler equations in\n$L^\\infty([0,T];H^1)$ by providing a new approach to its proof based on the\nidea of compactness extrapolation and by extending it to the whole plane.\n  This new method of proof is robust and, when applied to viscous models, leads\nto a remarkable logarithmic improvement on the rate of convergence in the\nvanishing viscosity limit of two-dimensional fluids. Loosely speaking, this\nlogarithmic gain is the result of the fact that, in appropriate high-regularity\nsettings, the smoothness of solutions to the Euler equations at times $t\\in\n[0,T)$ is strictly higher than their regularity at time $t=T$. This ``memory\neffect'' seems to be a general principle which is not exclusive to fluid\nmechanics. It is therefore likely to be observed in other setting and deserves\nfurther investigation.\n  Finally, we also apply the stability results on Euler systems to the study of\ntwo-dimensional ideal plasmas and establish their convergence, in strong\ntopologies, to solutions of magnetohydrodynamic systems, when the speed of\nlight tends to infinity.

However, most of them focused on the\nextraction of design behaviors, while paying less attention to how a design is\nformed. Therefore, this study proposes an approach to tracking and replaying\nthe BIM-based design process by integrating data logging and 4D visualization\ntechniques. First of all, potential design behaviors and procedures are\nanalyzed and extracted by observing how a designer designs a BIM model.\nMeanwhile, the required data for logging design process is defined and a\nrelevant method to collect these data is developed based on the APIs of BIM\nsoftware. Then, strategies on how to visualize different design procedures are\ndesigned and implemented via 4D visualization. Finally, a prototype system is\ndeveloped based on Autodesk Revit and validated through a case study.

However, it demands substantial effort and special\ntraining for dosimetrists. Existing automated treatment planning systems\ntypically require either an explicit prioritization of planning objectives,\nhuman-assigned objective weights, large amounts of historic plans to train an\nartificial intelligence or long planning times. Many of the existing\nauto-planning tools are difficult to extend to new planning goals.\n  A new spot weight optimisation algorithm, called JulianA, was developed. The\nalgorithm minimises a scalar loss function that is built only based on the\nprescribed dose to the tumour and organs at risk (OARs), but does not rely on\nhistoric plans. The objective weights in the loss function have default values\nthat do not need to be changed for the patients in our dataset. The system is a\nversatile tool for researchers and clinicians without specialised programming\nskills. Extending it is as easy as adding an additional term to the loss\nfunction. JulianA was validated on a dataset of 19 patients with intra- and\nextracerebral neoplasms within the cranial region that had been treated at our\ninstitute. For each patient, a reference plan which was delivered to the cancer\npatient, was exported from our treatment database. Then JulianA created the\nauto plan using the same beam arrangement. The reference and auto plans were\ngiven to a blinded independent reviewer who assessed the acceptability of each\nplan, ranked the plans and assigned the human-/machine-made labels.\n  The auto plans were considered acceptable in 16 out of 19 patients and at\nleast as good as the reference plan for 11 patients.

Another is the concept of ensemble averaging in holography,\nwhere a coarse-grained description is obtained by an integral over a moduli\nspace. To examine the relation between the two, we study ensemble averages of\ngeneralized Narain-type theories associated with a general even quadratic form\nand their holographic duals. We establish the emergence of global symmetries\nand discuss their consistency with the Swampland conjecture forbidding exact\nglobal symmetries. Out of all the zero-form symmetries, the quantum symmetries\nin the bulk are truly emergent, while classical symmetries are identified as\nvestiges of T-duality of the Narain-type theories. The latter mechanism can be\nformulated very generally as a ``folding'' of T-duality orbits via the\nSiegel-Weil Theorem. We also discuss the interrelations between the Swampland\ndistance conjecture, on one hand, and ensemble averaging and spectral\ndecompositions, on the other. The spectral decomposition also illustrates how\nensemble averaging sits within the low-energy limit of certain string\ncompactifications.

We summarise and test a\nspectral stacking method that has been used in the literature to recover\nlow-intensity molecular line emission, such as HCN(1-0), HCO+(1-0), and even\nfainter lines in external galaxies. The goal is to study the capabilities and\nlimitations of the stacking technique when applied to imaged interferometric\nobservations. The core idea of spectral stacking is to align spectra of the low\nS/N spectral lines to a known velocity field calculated from a higher S/N line\nexpected to share the kinematics of the fainter line, e.g., CO(1-0) or 21-cm\nemission. Then these aligned spectra can be coherently averaged to produce\npotentially high S/N spectral stacks. Here, we use imaged simulated\ninterferometric and total power observations at different signal-to-noise\nlevels, based on real CO observations. For the combined interferometric and\ntotal power data, we find that the spectral stacking technique is capable of\nrecovering the integrated intensities even at low S/N levels across most of the\nregion where the high S/N prior is detected. However, when stacking\ninterferometer-only data for low S/N emission, the stacks can miss up to 50% of\nthe emission from the fainter line. A key result of this analysis is that the\nspectral stacking method is able to recover the true mean line intensities in\nlow S/N cubes and to accurately measure the statistical significance of the\nrecovered lines. To facilitate the application of this technique we provide a\npublic Python package, called PyStacker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 14:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Calculating path signatures and using them as features in models has\nachieved state-of-the-art results in fields such as finance, medicine, and\ncyber security. We look at the nowcasting problem by applying regression on\nsignatures, a simple linear model on these nonlinear objects that we show\nsubsumes the popular Kalman filter. We quantify the performance via a\nsimulation exercise, and through application to nowcasting US GDP growth, where\nwe see a lower error than a dynamic factor model based on the New York Fed\nstaff nowcasting model. Finally we demonstrate the flexibility of this method\nby applying regression on signatures to nowcast weekly fuel prices using daily\ndata. Regression on signatures is an easy-to-apply approach that allows great\nflexibility for data with complex sampling patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 14:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

However,\nexisting literatures lack approaches which utilize strength of each approach by\nintegrating them to achieve a much more productive one. To tackle the link\nprediction problem, we propose an approach based on the combination of first\nand second group methods; the existing studied works use just one of these\ncategories. Our two-phase developed method firstly determines new features\nrelated to the position and dynamic behavior of nodes, which enforce the\napproach more efficiency compared to approaches using mere measures.

In contrast, this question\nis not at all understood for multi-objective optimization.\n  In this work, we conduct the first mathematical runtime analysis of a simple\nmulti-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) on a classic benchmark in the\npresence of noise in the objective functions. We prove that when bit-wise prior\nnoise with rate $p \\le \\alpha/n$, $\\alpha$ a suitable constant, is present, the\n\\emph{simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer} (SEMO) without any\nadjustments to cope with noise finds the Pareto front of the OneMinMax\nbenchmark in time $O(n^2\\log n)$, just as in the case without noise. Given that\nthe problem here is to arrive at a population consisting of $n+1$ individuals\nwitnessing the Pareto front, this is a surprisingly strong robustness to noise\n(comparably simple evolutionary algorithms cannot optimize the single-objective\nOneMax problem in polynomial time when $p = \\omega(\\log(n)/n)$). Our proofs\nsuggest that the strong robustness of the MOEA stems from its implicit\ndiversity mechanism designed to enable it to compute a population covering the\nwhole Pareto front.\n  Interestingly this result only holds when the objective value of a solution\nis determined only once and the algorithm from that point on works with this,\npossibly noisy, objective value. We prove that when all solutions are\nreevaluated in each iteration, then any noise rate $p = \\omega(\\log(n)/n^2)$\nleads to a super-polynomial runtime.

In particular, the region-aware branch is first to be\nutilized to locate the potential regions related to the semantic of the given\nattribute. Then, considering that the located region is coarse and still\ncontains the background visual contents, the patch-aware branch is proposed to\ncapture patch-wise attribute-related details from the previous amplified\nregion. Such a hybrid architecture strikes a proper balance between region\nlocalization and feature extraction. Besides, different from previous works\nthat solely focus on discriminating the attribute-relevant foreground visual\nfeatures, we argue that the attribute-irrelevant background features are also\ncrucial for distinguishing the detailed visual contexts in a contrastive\nmanner. Therefore, a novel E-InfoNCE loss based on the foreground and\nbackground representations is further proposed to improve the discrimination of\nattribute-specific representation.

This specific grain boundary exhibits two different\natomic structures with different microscopic degrees of freedom (complexions),\ncalled ``domino'' and ``pearl'' complexion. We show that the grain boundary\nmigration is affected by both the formation energy of a disconnection dipole\nand the Peierls-like barrier required to move the disconnections. For the pearl\ncomplexion, the latter is much higher, leading to a high stress required for\ngrain boundary migration at low temperatures.

Mixup has shown to improve classification performance, network\ncalibration, and out-of-distribution generalisation. While effective, a\ncornerstone of Mixup, namely that networks learn linear behaviour patterns\nbetween classes, is only indirectly enforced since the output interpolation is\nperformed at the probability level. This paper seeks to address this limitation\nby mixing the classifiers directly instead of mixing the labels for each mixed\npair. We propose to define the target of each augmented sample as a uniquely\nnew classifier, whose parameters are a linear interpolation of the classifier\nvectors of the input pair. The space of all possible classifiers is continuous\nand spans all interpolations between classifier pairs. To make optimisation\ntractable, we propose a dual-contrastive Infinite Class Mixup loss, where we\ncontrast the classifier of a mixed pair to both the classifiers and the\npredicted outputs of other mixed pairs in a batch. Infinite Class Mixup is\ngeneric in nature and applies to many variants of Mixup.

Numerical computations are performed to\nvalidate the asymptotic analysis and demonstrate the model's effectiveness in\nhandling topology changes, such as electrocoalescence.

QRAM has a\nlong and controversial history, and here we survey and expand arguments and\nconstructions for and against.\n  We use two primary categories of QRAM from the literature: (1) active, which\nrequires external intervention and control for each QRAM query (e.g. the\nerror-corrected circuit model), and (2) passive, which requires no external\ninput or energy once the query is initiated. In the active model, there is a\npowerful opportunity cost argument: in many applications, one could repurpose\nthe control hardware for the qubits in the QRAM (or the qubits themselves) to\nrun an extremely parallel classical algorithm to achieve the same results just\nas fast. Escaping these constraints requires ballistic computation with passive\nmemory, which creates an array of dubious physical assumptions, which we\nexamine in detail. Considering these details, in everything we could find, all\nnon-circuit QRAM proposals fall short in one aspect or another. We apply these\narguments in detail to quantum linear algebra and prove that most asymptotic\nquantum advantage disappears with active QRAM systems, with some nuance related\nto the architectural assumptions.\n  In summary, we conclude that cheap, asymptotically scalable passive QRAM is\nunlikely with existing proposals, due to fundamental limitations that we\nhighlight. We hope that our results will help guide research into QRAM\ntechnologies that attempt to circumvent or mitigate these limitations. Finally,\ncircuit-based QRAM still helps in many applications, and so we additionally\nprovide a survey of state-of-the-art techniques as a resource for algorithm\ndesigners using QRAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 15:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

However, owing to great\nimprovement in the experimental sensitivity in the past decade, some parameter\nspace of the SUSY-based WIMP model is ruled out. In addition, WIMP as the CDM\nparticle is also at variance with other astrophysical observables at small\nscales. We consider a model that addresses both these issues. In the model, the\nWIMP decays into a massive particle and radiation. We study the background\nevolution and the first order perturbation theory (coupled Einstein-Boltzmann\nequations) for this model and show that the dynamics can be captured by a\nsingle parameter $r=m_L/q$, which is the ratio of the lighter mass and the\ncomoving momentum of the decay particle. We incorporate the relevant equations\nin the existing Boltzmann code CLASS to compute the matter power spectra and\nCMB angular power spectra. The decaying WIMP model is akin to a non-thermal\nWarm Dark Matter(WDM) model and suppresses matter power at small scales, which\ncould alleviate several issues that plague the CDM model. We compare the\npredictions of the model with CMB, galaxy clustering, and high-z HI data. Both\nthese data sets yield $r\\gtrsim 10^6$, which can be translated into the bounds\non other parameters.

We present a novel method that utilizes parametric control of head\norientation and facial expression over a pre-trained neural-talking head model.\nTo enable this, we introduce a landmark-parameter morphable model (LPMM), which\noffers control over the facial landmark domain through a set of semantic\nparameters. Using LPMM, it is possible to adjust specific head pose factors,\nwithout distorting other facial attributes. The results show our approach\nprovides intuitive rig-like control over neural talking head models, allowing\nboth parameter and image-based inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 06:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Unfortunately, these architectures\noften become able to well reconstruct also the anomalies in the data. This\nphenomenon is more evident when there are anomalies in the training set.

The innovation of ad hoc plasma sources and personalized protocols\nappears crucial to treat cancers with a very poor prognosis. This is the case\nfor cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) , whose treatment with cold plasma requires the\ninnovation of catheters and endoscopic devices for local therapies. Before\nconducting clinical trials, the performances and limitations of cold plasma\nendoscopy must be evaluated in terms of safety for both the patient and\nclinician as well as in terms of therapeutic efficacy. These objectives are\npursued in the present work, in which a transferred plasma catheter is used,\npowered by 8-10 kV, 5-10 kHz repeated pulses, allowing guided streamers to be\ntransferred over lengths of at least 2 m. In a first step, the catheter is\ndirectly inserted into an artificial model reproducing the topography and the\nelectrical response of the biliary tree. This model allows to validate the\ntechnical feasibility of the technology and to demonstrate the absence of\nelectrical and thermal risks. In a second step, the catheter is inserted into\nthe duodenoscope, the whole being applied to a porcine anatomical model. After\npassing through the esophagus, stomach and duodenum, the distal part of the\nduodenoscope is placed at the entrance to the papilla so that the catheter can\neasily enter the choledoc and then the common bile duct. Interestingly, the\nelectrical power values deposited are of the order of 100 mW especially because\nthe current values are at least 10 times higher. The absence of electrical and\nthermal risks is demonstrated and consolidated by the IEC standards for medical\ndevices. In a third time, we demonstrate that the cold plasma catheter can\ninduce antitumor effects on in vitro experimental models of human CCA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 21:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-23"}

The calculated phonon thermal conductivity of bilayer\nsilicene is surprisingly higher than that of the monolayer silicene, contrary\nto the trends reported for other class of 2D materials like graphene and hBN\nbilayers. We attribute this counterintuitive result to the higher velocity of\nLA$_1$/LA$_2$ phonon modes arising from the interlayer interaction effects and\nbuckling, inherent to silicene bilayer. Interestingly, the thermal conductivity\nof both the mono- and bilayer silicene decreases with temperature as\n$\\kappa\\sim T^{-0.9}$ because of the strong correlations between heat current\ndecay characteristic timescales and temperature ($\\tau\\sim T^{-0.75}$). The\nmechanisms underlying phonon thermal transport in silicene bilayer are further\nestablished by analyzing the temperature induced changes in acoustic group\nvelocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 08:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Developing tools for automated assessment of ECG\nsequences can improve veterinary care by providing clinicians real-time results\nand decision support tools. We implement a deep convolutional neural network\n(CNN) approach for classifying canine electrocardiogram sequences as either\nnormal or abnormal. ECG records are converted into 8 second Lead II sequences\nand classified as either normal (no evidence of cardiac abnormalities) or\nabnormal (presence of one or more cardiac abnormalities). For training ECG\nsequences are randomly augmented using RandomAugmentECG, a new augmentation\nlibrary implemented specifically for this project. Each chunk is then is\nconverted using a continuous wavelet transform into a 2D scalogram. The 2D\nscalogram are then classified as either normal or abnormal by a binary CNN\nclassifier. Experimental results are validated against three boarded veterinary\ncardiologists achieving an AUC-ROC score of 0.9506 on test dataset matching\nhuman level performance. Additionally, we describe model deployment to\nMicrosoft Azure using an MLOps approach.

Despite this, concerns have been raised\nabout the quality of their outputs across different languages. In this paper,\nwe show how disparity in the treatment of different languages arises at the\ntokenization stage, well before a model is even invoked. The same text\ntranslated into different languages can have drastically different tokenization\nlengths, with differences up to 15 times in some cases. These disparities\npersist across the 17 tokenizers we evaluate, even if they are intentionally\ntrained for multilingual support. Character-level and byte-level models also\nexhibit over 4 times the difference in the encoding length for some language\npairs. This induces unfair treatment for some language communities in regard to\nthe cost of accessing commercial language services, the processing time and\nlatency, as well as the amount of content that can be provided as context to\nthe models. Therefore, we make the case that we should train future language\nmodels using multilingually fair tokenizers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 14:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

These methods have historically relied on\nstructure-based comparisons to compute molecular similarity. Here, we use a\nchemical language model to create a vector-based chemical search. We extend\nimplementations by creating a prompt engineering strategy that utilizes two\ndifferent chemical string representation algorithms: one for the query and the\nother for the database. We explore this method by reviewing the search results\nfrom five drug-like query molecules (penicillin G, nirmatrelvir, zidovudine,\nlysergic acid diethylamide, and fentanyl) and three dye-like query molecules\n(acid blue 25, avobenzone, and 2-diphenylaminocarbazole). We find that this\nnovel method identifies molecules that are functionally similar to the query,\nindicated by the associated patent literature, and that many of these molecules\nare structurally distinct from the query, making them unlikely to be found with\ntraditional chemical similarity search methods.

We\nare interested in a DIRECT detection of exotic fields emitted by the mergers.\nThis approach must be contrasted with the INDIRECT detection strategies, e.g.,\nbased on minute exotic-physics induced changes in gravitational wave spectral\nfeatures. While our strategy seems to be overly optimistic, the numbers do work\nout. The numbers work out because of (i) the exquisite sensitivity of atomic\nquantum sensors and because of (ii) the enormous amounts of energy released in\nthe mergers. Bursts of exotic fields may, for example, be produced during the\ncoalescence of black hole singularities, releasing quantum gravity messengers\nper the title of this contribution. To be detectable by the precision atomic\nsensors, such fields must be ultralight and ultra-relativistic and we refer to\nthem as exotic low-mass fields (ELFs). Since the fields are massive, the group\nvelocity of ELF bursts is smaller than the speed of light. Thereby the ELF\nbursts lag behind the gravitational waves. Then LIGO or other gravitational\nwave observatories would provide a trigger for networks of precision atomic\nsensors that can listen for the feeble ELF signals. We characterize ELF\nsignatures in the sensors. ELFs would imprint a characteristic anti-chirp\nsignal across the sensor network.
