Instead, the agent is provided with pre-existing offline\ntrajectories and human preferences between pairs of trajectories to extract the\ndynamics and task information, respectively. Since the dynamics and task\ninformation are orthogonal, a naive approach would involve using\npreference-based reward learning followed by an off-the-shelf offline RL\nalgorithm. However, this requires the separate learning of a scalar reward\nfunction, which is assumed to be an information bottleneck. To address this\nissue, we propose the offline preference-guided policy optimization (OPPO)\nparadigm, which models offline trajectories and preferences in a one-step\nprocess, eliminating the need for separately learning a reward function. OPPO\nachieves this by introducing an offline hindsight information matching\nobjective for optimizing a contextual policy and a preference modeling\nobjective for finding the optimal context. OPPO further integrates a\nwell-performing decision policy by optimizing the two objectives iteratively.\nOur empirical results demonstrate that OPPO effectively models offline\npreferences and outperforms prior competing baselines, including offline RL\nalgorithms performed over either true or pseudo reward function specifications.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/bkkgbkjb/OPPO .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 16:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

One such new physics concept is the large\nextra dimension (LED), which provides an elegant solution to the hierarchy\nproblem. This model also explains the small neutrino mass in a natural way. The\npresence of LED modifies the standard neutrino oscillation probabilities.\nHence, the long-baseline experiments are sensitive to the LED parameters. We\nexplore the potential of the three future long-baseline neutrino experiments,\nnamely T2HK, ESSnuSB, and DUNE, to probe the LED parameter space. We also\ncompare the capability of the charged and neutral current measurements at DUNE\nto constrain the LED model. We find that T2HK will provide more stringent\nbounds on the largest compactification radius ($R_{\\rm{ED}}$) compared to the\nDUNE and ESSnuSB experiments. At $90\\%$ C.L., T2HK can exclude $R_{\\rm{ED}}\\sim\n0.45~(0.425)$ $\\mu$m for the normal (inverted) mass hierarchy scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 16:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

We propose a unified robust concept of\nfunctional mean, covariance, and principal component analysis, while existing\nmethods and definitions often differ from one another or only address fully\nobserved functions (the ``ideal'' case). Specifically, the robust functional\nmean can deviate from its non-robust counterpart and is estimated using robust\nlocal linear regression. Moreover, we define a new robust functional covariance\nthat shares useful properties with the classic version. Importantly, this\ncovariance yields the robust version of Karhunen--Lo\\`eve decomposition and\ncorresponding principal components beneficial for dimension reduction. The\ntheoretical results of the robust functional mean, covariance, and\neigenfunction estimates, based on pooling discretely observed data (ranging\nfrom sparse to dense), are established and aligned with their non-robust\ncounterparts. The newly-proposed perturbation bounds for estimated\neigenfunctions, with indexes allowed to grow with sample size, lay the\nfoundation for further modeling based on robust functional principal component\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 16:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Traditionally, kinetic exchange\nmodels have been studied without considering preferential interactions.\nHowever, in this study, we introduce two types of preferential interactions to\nexplore wealth dynamics and its associated distributions. In the first\npreference, one agent is randomly selected, while the other agent is chosen\nrandomly with wealth just above or below the first agent. Through this\npreference, we observe the emergence of a quasi-oligarchic society, where the\nmajority of the wealth cycles around the hand of very few agents. For the\nsecond preference, we impose a constraint on the difference in pre-interaction\nwealth between the two agents. This preference leads to the segregation of\nsociety into two distinct economic classes. To investigate these phenomena, we\nconducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations, enabling us to characterize the\nbehavior of wealth distributions in these two scenarios.

However, obtaining enough labeled data can be\nexpensive, time-consuming, and subject to ethical constraints for many\napplications. One approach that has shown tremendous value in addressing this\nchallenge is semi-supervised learning (SSL); this technique utilizes both\nlabeled and unlabeled data during training, often with much less labeled data\nthan unlabeled data, which is often relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain.\nIn fact, SSL methods are particularly useful in applications where the cost of\nlabeling data is especially expensive, such as medical analysis, natural\nlanguage processing (NLP), or speech recognition. A subset of SSL methods that\nhave achieved great success in various domains involves algorithms that\nintegrate graph-based techniques. These procedures are popular due to the vast\namount of information provided by the graphical framework and the versatility\nof their applications. In this work, we propose an algebraic topology-based\nsemi-supervised method called persistent Laplacian-enhanced graph MBO (PL-MBO)\nby integrating persistent spectral graph theory with the classical\nMerriman-Bence- Osher (MBO) scheme. Specifically, we use a filtration procedure\nto generate a sequence of chain complexes and associated families of simplicial\ncomplexes, from which we construct a family of persistent Laplacians. Overall,\nit is a very efficient procedure that requires much less labeled data to\nperform well compared to many ML techniques, and it can be adapted for both\nsmall and large datasets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on\ndata classification, and the results indicate that the proposed technique\noutperforms other existing semi-supervised algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 16:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

The guarantees provided by the hardware to ensure no\nviolation of process boundaries have been shown to be breached in several\nreal-world scenarios. While modern CPU features such as superscalar,\nout-of-order, simultaneous multi-threading, and speculative execution play a\ncritical role in boosting system performance, they are central for a potent\nclass of security attacks termed transient micro-architectural attacks. These\nattacks leverage shared hardware resources in the CPU that are used during\nspeculative and out-of-order execution to steal sensitive information.\nResearchers have used these attacks to read data from the Operating Systems\n(OS) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and to even break\nhardware-enforced isolation.\n  Over the years, several variants of transient micro-architectural attacks\nhave been developed. While each variant differs in the shared hardware resource\nused, the underlying attack follows a similar strategy.

Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, the dominating number of a graph is\nthe minimum size of a vertex set, $V' \\subseteq V$, so that every vertex in the\ngraph is either in $V'$ or is adjacent to a vertex in $V'$. A Roman Dominating\nfunction of $G$ is defined as $f:V \\rightarrow \\{0,1,2\\}$ such that every\nvertex with a label of 0 in $G$ is adjacent to a vertex with a label of 2. The\nRoman Dominating number of a graph is the minimum total weight over all\npossible Roman Dominating functions. In this paper, we analyze a new variant:\n$n$-attack Roman Domination, particularly focusing on 2-attack Roman Domination\n$(n=2)$. An $n$-attack Roman Dominating function of $G$ is defined similarly to\nthe Roman Dominating function with the additional condition that, for any\n$j\\leq n$, any subset $S$ of $j$ vertices all with label 0 must have at least\n$j$ vertices with label 2 in the open neighborhood of $S$.

By composing a Markovian process that starts in the data\ndomain and then gradually adds noise until reaching pure white noise, they\nachieve superior performance in learning data distributions. Yet, these models\nrequire a large number of diffusion steps to produce aesthetically pleasing\nsamples, which is inefficient. In addition, unlike common generative\nadversarial networks, the latent space of diffusion models is not\ninterpretable. In this work, we propose to generalize the denoising diffusion\nprocess into an Upsampling Diffusion Probabilistic Model (UDPM), in which we\nreduce the latent variable dimension in addition to the traditional noise level\naddition. As a result, we are able to sample images of size $256\\times 256$\nwith only 7 diffusion steps, which is less than two orders of magnitude\ncompared to standard DDPMs. We formally develop the Markovian diffusion\nprocesses of the UDPM, and demonstrate its generation capabilities on the\npopular FFHQ, LSUN horses, ImageNet, and AFHQv2 datasets. Another favorable\nproperty of UDPM is that it is very easy to interpolate its latent space, which\nis not the case with standard diffusion models.

In this work, we\npropose a UV complete model of flavour based on deconstructing only\nhypercharge.

However, compression can introduce information\ndistortion, which slows down convergence and incurs more communication rounds\nto achieve desired solutions. Given the trade-off between lower per-round\ncommunication costs and additional rounds of communication, it is unclear\nwhether communication compression reduces the total communication cost.\n  This paper explores the conditions under which unbiased compression, a widely\nused form of compression, can reduce the total communication cost, as well as\nthe extent to which it can do so. To this end, we present the first theoretical\nformulation for characterizing the total communication cost in distributed\noptimization with communication compression. We demonstrate that unbiased\ncompression alone does not necessarily save the total communication cost, but\nthis outcome can be achieved if the compressors used by all workers are further\nassumed independent. We establish lower bounds on the communication rounds\nrequired by algorithms using independent unbiased compressors to minimize\nsmooth convex functions, and show that these lower bounds are tight by refining\nthe analysis for ADIANA.

We tackle this challenge\nthrough a fine-grained complexity analysis of time-optimal MAPF on 2D grids,\nthereby closing two gaps and identifying a new tractability frontier. First, we\nshow that 2-colored MAPF, i.e., where the agents are divided into two teams,\neach with its own set of targets, remains NP-hard. Second, for the flowtime\nobjective (also called sum-of-costs), we show that it remains NP-hard to find a\nsolution in which agents have an individually optimal cost, which we call an\nindividually optimal solution.

An alternative approach is to\nallow interactions between the query and every possible candidate, i.e.,\nreference-text-candidate triplets, and pick the best from the entire set.\nThough this approach is more discriminative, for large-scale datasets the\ncomputational cost is prohibitive since pre-computation of candidate embeddings\nis no longer possible.

However, despite their success, text\ndescriptions often struggle to adequately convey detailed controls, even when\ncomposed of long and complex texts. Moreover, recent studies have also shown\nthat these models face challenges in understanding such complex texts and\ngenerating the corresponding images. Therefore, there is a growing need to\nenable more control modes beyond text description. In this paper, we introduce\nUni-ControlNet, a novel approach that allows for the simultaneous utilization\nof different local controls (e.g., edge maps, depth map, segmentation masks)\nand global controls (e.g., CLIP image embeddings) in a flexible and composable\nmanner within one model. Unlike existing methods, Uni-ControlNet only requires\nthe fine-tuning of two additional adapters upon frozen pre-trained\ntext-to-image diffusion models, eliminating the huge cost of training from\nscratch. Moreover, thanks to some dedicated adapter designs, Uni-ControlNet\nonly necessitates a constant number (i.e., 2) of adapters, regardless of the\nnumber of local or global controls used. This not only reduces the fine-tuning\ncosts and model size, making it more suitable for real-world deployment, but\nalso facilitate composability of different conditions. Through both\nquantitative and qualitative comparisons, Uni-ControlNet demonstrates its\nsuperiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation\nquality and composability.

Nevertheless, preserving security and\nprivacy in cloud computing systems pose notable challenges. This issue arises\nbecause these systems have a distributed structure, which is susceptible to\nunsanctioned access - a fundamental problem.

However, unlike\ndiscriminative vision-and-language models, it is a non-trivial task to subject\nthese diffusion-based generative models to automatic fine-grained quantitative\nevaluation of high-level phenomena such as compositionality. Towards this goal,\nwe perform two innovations. First, we transform diffusion-based models (in our\ncase, Stable Diffusion) for any image-text matching (ITM) task using a novel\nmethod called DiffusionITM. Second, we introduce the Generative-Discriminative\nEvaluation Benchmark (GDBench) benchmark with 7 complex vision-and-language\ntasks, bias evaluation and detailed analysis. We find that Stable Diffusion +\nDiffusionITM is competitive on many tasks and outperforms CLIP on compositional\ntasks like like CLEVR and Winoground. We further boost its compositional\nperformance with a transfer setup by fine-tuning on MS-COCO while retaining\ngenerative capabilities. We also measure the stereotypical bias in diffusion\nmodels, and find that Stable Diffusion 2.1 is, for the most part, less biased\nthan Stable Diffusion 1.5. Overall, our results point in an exciting direction\nbringing discriminative and generative model evaluation closer.

The\npotential of dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in assessing carpal\ndynamics associated with this condition is a field of ongoing research. This\nstudy contributes to this line of inquiry by developing MRI-derived carpal\nkinematic metrics and investigating their stability. Methods: A previously\ndescribed 4D MRI approach for tracking the movements of carpal bones in the\nwrist was deployed in this study. A panel of 120 metrics characterizing\nradial/ulnar deviation and flexion extension movements was constructed by\nfitting low order polynomial models of scaphoid and lunate degrees of freedom\nagainst that of the capitate. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients were utilized\nto analyze intra- and inter-subject stability within a mixed cohort of 49\nsubjects, including 20 with and 29 without a history of wrist injury. Results:\nA comparable degree of stability across the two different wrist movements. Out\nof the total 120 derived metrics, distinct subsets demonstrated high stability\nwithin each type of movement.

Proposed solutions to catastrophic forgetting\ntend to involve storing information about past tasks, meaning that memory usage\nis a chief consideration in determining their practicality. This paper proposes\na memory-efficient solution to catastrophic forgetting, improving upon an\nestablished algorithm known as orthogonal gradient descent (OGD). OGD utilizes\nprior model gradients to find weight updates that preserve performance on prior\ndatapoints. However, since the memory cost of storing prior model gradients\ngrows with the runtime of the algorithm, OGD is ill-suited to continual\nlearning over arbitrarily long time horizons. To address this problem, this\npaper proposes SketchOGD. SketchOGD employs an online sketching algorithm to\ncompress model gradients as they are encountered into a matrix of a fixed,\nuser-determined size. In contrast to existing memory-efficient variants of OGD,\nSketchOGD runs online without the need for advance knowledge of the total\nnumber of tasks, is simple to implement, and is more amenable to analysis. We\nprovide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error of the relevant\nsketches under a novel metric suited to the downstream task of OGD.\nExperimentally, we find that SketchOGD tends to outperform current\nstate-of-the-art variants of OGD given a fixed memory budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 18:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

Lastly, the size parameter of the source function, $R$, which in\nprinciple should be a magnitude provided by the experimental teams, can be\nobtained from a fit to the data with a high accuracy. These findings show the\nvalue of the correlation function to learn about the meson-meson interaction\nfor systems which are difficult to access in other present facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 19:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

In this paper we demonstrate one such machine learning workflow,\nPairVAE, that works with data from Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) that\npresents information about bulk morphology and images from Scanning Electron\nMicroscopy (SEM) that presents two-dimensional local structural information of\nthe sample. Using paired SAXS and SEM data of novel block copolymer assembled\nmorphologies [open access data from Doerk G.S., et al. Science Advances. 2023\nJan 13;9(2): eadd3687], we train our PairVAE. After successful training, we\ndemonstrate that the PairVAE can generate SEM images of the block copolymer\nmorphology when it takes as input that sample's corresponding SAXS 2D pattern,\nand vice versa. This method can be extended to other soft materials\nmorphologies as well and serves as a valuable tool for easy interpretation of\n2D SAXS patterns as well as creating a database for other downstream\ncalculations of structure-property relationships.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 20:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

Various backdoor attacks have been\ndevised which can achieve nearly perfect attack success without affecting model\npredictions for clean inputs. Means of mitigating such vulnerabilities are\nunderdeveloped, especially in natural language processing. To fill this gap, we\nintroduce IMBERT, which uses either gradients or self-attention scores derived\nfrom victim models to self-defend against backdoor attacks at inference time.\nOur empirical studies demonstrate that IMBERT can effectively identify up to\n98.5% of inserted triggers.

By analyzing common\ntool manipulation failures, we first demonstrate that open-source LLMs may\nrequire training with usage examples, in-context demonstration and generation\nstyle regulation to resolve failures. These insights motivate us to revisit\nclassical methods in LLM literature, and demonstrate that we can adapt them as\nmodel alignment with programmatic data generation, system prompts and\nin-context demonstration retrievers to enhance open-source LLMs for tool\nmanipulation. To evaluate these techniques, we create the ToolBench, a tool\nmanipulation benchmark consisting of diverse software tools for real-world\ntasks.

Nevertheless, $\\mathsf{PAR}$ does have a usual\ncategorical product as well in the form of $A \\sqcup B \\sqcup (A \\times B)$.\nSurprisingly, asking that a distributive restriction category (a restriction\ncategory with restriction products $\\times$ and coproducts $\\oplus$) has $A\n\\oplus B \\oplus (A \\times B)$ a categorical product is enough to imply that the\ncategory is a classical restriction category. This is a restriction category\nwhich has joins and relative complements and so supports classical Boolean\nreasoning. The first and main observation of the paper is that a distributive\nrestriction category is classical if and only if $A \\& B := A \\oplus B \\oplus\n(A \\times B)$ is a categorical product in which case we call $\\&$ the\n``classical'' product.

A recent dichotomy result rules out the existence of such an algorithm\nfor a general family of queries and orders.

Given a query\ncaption, the goal is to rank candidate images by relevance, from large to\nsmall. The current ITR datasets are constructed in a pairwise manner.\nImage-text pairs are annotated as positive or negative. Correspondingly, ITR\nmodels mainly use pairwise losses, such as triplet loss, to learn to rank.\nPairwise-based ITR increases positive pair similarity while decreasing negative\npair similarity indiscriminately. However, the relevance between dissimilar\nnegative pairs is different. Pairwise annotations cannot reflect this\ndifference in relevance. In the current datasets, pairwise annotations miss\nmany correlations. There are many potential positive pairs among the pairs\nlabeled as negative. Pairwise-based ITR can only rank positive samples before\nnegative samples, but cannot rank negative samples by relevance. In this paper,\nwe integrate listwise ranking into conventional pairwise-based ITR. Listwise\nranking optimizes the entire ranking list based on relevance scores.\nSpecifically, we first propose a Relevance Score Calculation (RSC) module to\ncalculate the relevance score of the entire ranked list.

Therefore, we propose Graph-of-Thought (GoT)\nreasoning, which models human thought processes not only as a chain but also as\na graph. By representing thought units as nodes and connections between them as\nedges, our approach captures the non-sequential nature of human thinking and\nallows for a more realistic modeling of thought processes.

We demonstrate that the proposed\nhybrid coding scheme achieves a comparable accuracy with the state-of-the-art\nSNNs with homogeneous neural coding on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet\ndatasets with less than eight time steps and at least 3.90x fewer computations.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate accurate, rapid, and robust sound source\nlocalization on SoClas dataset. This study yields valuable insights into the\nperformance of various hybrid neural coding designs and hold significant\nimplications for designing high performance SNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 02:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

While previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using\nuser behavior signals (e.g., clicks) as both features and labels of LTR\nalgorithms, we argue that existing LTR algorithms that indiscriminately treat\nbehavior and non-behavior signals in input features could lead to suboptimal\nperformance in practice. Particularly because user behavior signals often have\nstrong correlations with the ranking objective and can only be collected on\nitems that have already been shown to users, directly using behavior signals in\nLTR could create an exploitation bias that hurts the system performance in the\nlong run.\n  To address the exploitation bias, we propose EBRank, an empirical Bayes-based\nuncertainty-aware ranking algorithm. Specifically, to overcome exploitation\nbias brought by behavior features in ranking models, EBRank uses a sole\nnon-behavior feature based prior model to get a prior estimation of relevance.\nIn the dynamic training and serving of ranking systems, EBRank uses the\nobserved user behaviors to update posterior relevance estimation instead of\nconcatenating behaviors as features in ranking models. Besides, EBRank\nadditionally applies an uncertainty-aware exploration strategy to explore\nactively, collect user behaviors for empirical Bayesian modeling and improve\nranking performance.

In existing\nwork, separate modules are used to capture spatial and temporal features,\nrespectively.

In light of this, we present a spatio-temporal\ntransformer-based policy optimization algorithm to enhance the utilization of\nspatio-temporal features, thereby facilitating the capture of human-robot\ninteractions. Specifically, this paper introduces a gated embedding mechanism\nthat effectively aligns the spatial and temporal representations by integrating\nboth modalities at the feature level. Then Transformer is leveraged to encode\nthe spatio-temporal semantic information, with hope of finding the optimal\nnavigation policy. Finally, a combination of spatio-temporal Transformer and\nself-adjusting policy entropy significantly reduces the conservatism of\nnavigation policies.

Sensors always have noise and state\nestimation becomes even more difficult under adverse weather conditions and\nocclusion. Traditionally, Bayes filters have been used to fuse information from\nnoisy sensors to update states with associated belief. But, they fail to\naddress non-linearities and long-term predictions.

Besides the\nranking relevance to users, the exposure fairness to item providers has also\nbeen considered an important factor in ranking optimization. Many fair ranking\nalgorithms have been proposed to jointly optimize both ranking relevance and\nfairness. However, we find that most existing fair ranking methods adopt greedy\nalgorithms that only optimize rankings for the next immediate session or\nrequest. As shown in this paper, such a myopic paradigm could limit the upper\nbound of ranking optimization and lead to suboptimal performance in the long\nterm. To this end, we propose FARA, a novel Future-Aware Ranking Algorithm for\nranking relevance and fairness optimization. Instead of greedily optimizing\nrankings for the next immediate session, FARA plans ahead by jointly optimizing\nmultiple ranklists together and saving them for future sessions. Particularly,\nFARA first uses the Taylor expansion to investigate how future ranklists will\ninfluence the overall fairness of the system. Then, based on the analysis of\nthe Taylor expansion, FARA adopts a two-phase optimization algorithm where we\nfirst solve an optimal future exposure planning problem and then construct the\noptimal ranklists according to the optimal future exposure planning.\nTheoretically, we show that FARA is optimal for ranking relevance and fairness\njoint optimization. Empirically, our extensive experiments on three\nsemi-synthesized datasets show that FARA is efficient, effective, and can\ndeliver significantly better ranking performance compared to state-of-the-art\nfair ranking methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 05:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

In\norder to clarify this, we first review existing absolute and relative position\nencoding methods when applied in time series classification.

In this work, we draw on theoretical research in\nsociolinguistics, sociology, and film studies to operationalize a\nconversational thread (including the notion of a floor change) in dramatic\ntexts, and use that definition to annotate a dataset of 10,033 dialogue turns\n(comprising 2,209 threads) from 831 movies. We compare the performance of\nseveral disentanglement models on this dramatic dataset, and apply the\nbest-performing model to disentangle 808 movies.

Second, DNS models\nrequire extensive training data, including noisy audios as inputs and clean\naudios as labels. It is often difficult to obtain clean labels for training DNS\nmodels. We propose the use of knowledge distillation (KD) to resolve both\nchallenges. Our study serves 2 main purposes. To begin with, we are among the\nfirst to comprehensively investigate mainstream KD techniques on DNS models to\nresolve the two challenges.

One of the most important gates is the\ncontrolled-NOT, which is widely used to prepare two-qubit entangled states. The\ncontrolled-NOT gate for single photon qubits is normally realized as a six-mode\nnetwork of individual beamsplitters. This architecture however, utilizes only a\nsmall fraction of the circuit for the quantum operation with the majority of\nthe footprint dedicated to routing waveguides. Quantum walks are an alternative\nphotonics platform that use arrays of coupled waveguides with a continuous\ninteraction region instead of discrete gates. While quantum walks have been\nsuccessful for investigating condensed matter physics, applying the multi-mode\ninterference for logical quantum operations is yet to be shown.

We, however, observe that the reports generated\nin such a simple way only obtain comparable performance compared with that\ntrained separately on each specific dataset. We suspect that this is caused by\nthe dilemma between the diversity of body parts and the limited availability of\nmedical data. To develop robust and generalizable models, it is important to\nconsider a diverse range of body parts and medical conditions. However,\ncollecting a sufficiently large dataset for each specific body part can be\ndifficult due to various factors, such as data availability and privacy\nconcerns. Thus, rather than striving for more data, we propose a\nsingle-for-multiple (S4M) framework, which seeks to facilitate the learning of\nthe report generation model with two auxiliary priors: an explicit prior (\\ie,\nfeeding radiology-informed knowledge) and an implicit prior (\\ie, guided by\ncross-modal features). Specifically, based on the conventional encoder-decoder\nreport generation framework, we incorporate two extra branches: a\nRadiology-informed Knowledge Aggregation (RadKA) branch and an Implicit Prior\nGuidance (IPG) branch. We conduct the experiments on our merged dataset which\nconsists of a public dataset (\\ie, IU-Xray) and five private datasets, covering\nsix body parts: chest, abdomen, knee, hip, wrist and shoulder.

Internet of Things (IoT) devices\nare considered as resource-constrained devices that are expected to operate\nwith low computational power and resource utilization criteria. At the same\ntime, recent research has shown that IoT devices are highly vulnerable to\nemerging security threats, which elevates the need for low-power and small-size\nhardware-based security countermeasures. Chaotic encryption is a method of data\nencryption that utilizes chaotic systems and non-linear dynamics to generate\nsecure encryption keys. It aims to provide high-level security by creating\nencryption keys that are sensitive to initial conditions and difficult to\npredict, making it challenging for unauthorized parties to intercept and decode\nencrypted data. Since the discovery of chaotic equations, there have been\nvarious encryption applications associated with them. In this paper, we\ncomprehensively analyze the physical and encryption attacks on continuous\nchaotic systems in resource-constrained devices and their potential remedies.\nTo this aim, we introduce different categories of attacks of chaotic\nencryption.

However, in real-world\nscenarios, only the latest KB snapshot is available during training and as a\nresult, the train dialogs may contain facts conflicting with the latest KB.\nThese dialog-KB inconsistencies in the training data may potentially confuse\nthe TOD agent learning algorithm.\n  In this work, we define the novel problem of learning a TOD agent with\ndialog-KB inconsistencies in the training data. We propose a Dialog-KB\nArbitration Framework (DKAF) which reduces the dialog-KB inconsistencies by\npredicting the contemporary KB snapshot for each train dialog. These predicted\nKB snapshots are then used for training downstream TOD agents. As there are no\nexisting datasets with dialog-KB inconsistencies, we systematically introduce\ninconsistencies in two publicly available dialog datasets.

During the HIMS, the characteristic frequency of the\nreverberation lags $\\nu_0$ (the frequency at which the soft lag turns to zero\nin the lag-frequency spectra) increases when the spectrum softens. This\nreflects a reduction of the spatial distance between the corona and accretion\ndisc, when assuming the measured time lags are associated with the light travel\ntime.

The\norientation of the gap minima is found to be aligned with the bulk direction\nwhen the surface lattice image shows twofold symmetry, but, surprisingly, it is\nrotated by 30$^{\\circ}$ when twofold symmetry is absent. In addition, the\nsuperconducting gap spectra in zero magnetic field suggest that the gap nodes\nare most likely lifted. We argue that only an emergent symmetry at the surface,\nallowing for a linear superposition of gap functions with different symmetries,\ncan lead to the rotation of the gap nodes. The absence of inversion symmetry at\nthe surface additionally lifts the nodes.

Extensive efforts on the designs of\nscheduling methods for TAS shapers have been reported in recent years to\nimprove the system schedulability, each with their own distinct focuses and\nconcerns.

With the development of deep learning, increasingly deep OD\nalgorithms are proposed. Despite the availability of numerous deep OD models,\nexisting research has reported that the performance of deep models is extremely\nsensitive to the configuration of hyperparameters (HPs). However, the selection\nof HPs for deep OD models remains a notoriously difficult task due to the lack\nof any labels and long list of HPs. In our study. we shed light on an essential\nfactor, training time, that can introduce significant variation in the\nperformance of deep model. Even the performance is stable across other HPs,\ntraining time itself can cause a serious HP sensitivity issue. Motivated by\nthis finding, we are dedicated to formulating a strategy to terminate model\ntraining at the optimal iteration.

To our\nknowledge, our approach is the first to enable reliable identification of the\noptimal training iteration during training without requiring any labels.

In the first paper in this\nseries (Brinkman et al. 2019), we focused on the production of $^{26}$Al in\nmassive binaries. In our second paper (Brinkman et al. 2021), we considered\nrotating single stars, two more short-lived radioactive nuclei, $^{36}$Cl and\n$^{41}$Ca, and the comparison to the early Solar System data. In this work, we\nupdate our previous conclusions by further considering the impact of binary\ninteractions. We used the MESA stellar evolution code with an extended nuclear\nnetwork to compute massive (10-80 M$ _{\\odot} $), binary stars at various\ninitial periods and solar metallicity (Z=0.014), up to the onset of core\ncollapse. The early Solar System abundances of $^{26}$Al and $^{41}$Ca can be\nmatched self-consistently by models with initial masses $\\geq$25 M$_{\\odot}$,\nwhile models with initial primary masses $\\geq$35 M$_{\\odot}$ can also match\n$^{36}$Cl. Almost none of the models provide positive net yields for $^{19}$F,\nwhile for $^{22}$Ne the net yields are positive from 30 M$_{\\odot}$ and higher.\nThis leads to an increase by a factor of approximately 4 in the amount of\n$^{22}$Ne produced by a stellar population of binary stars, relative to single\nstars. Also, besides the impact on the stellar yields, our 10 M$_{\\odot}$\nprimary star undergoing Case A mass-transfer ends its life as a white dwarf\ninstead of as a core-collapse supernova. This demonstrates that binary\ninteractions can also strongly impact the evolution of stars close to the\nsupernova boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 09:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

However, depth distribution can\nonly characterize the 3D geometry of visible object surfaces but fails to\ncapture their internal space and overall geometric structure, leading to sparse\nand unsatisfactory 3D representations. To mitigate this issue, we present\nBEV-IO, a new 3D detection paradigm to enhance BEV representation with instance\noccupancy information. At the core of our method is the newly-designed instance\noccupancy prediction (IOP) module, which aims to infer point-level occupancy\nstatus for each instance in the frustum space. To ensure training efficiency\nwhile maintaining representational flexibility, it is trained using the\ncombination of both explicit and implicit supervision. With the predicted\noccupancy, we further design a geometry-aware feature propagation mechanism\n(GFP), which performs self-attention based on occupancy distribution along each\nray in frustum and is able to enforce instance-level feature consistency. By\nintegrating the IOP module with GFP mechanism, our BEV-IO detector is able to\nrender highly informative 3D scene structures with more comprehensive BEV\nrepresentations.

It is speculated that these\nexotic phases may arise in the cores of neutron stars. Focus on neutrons stars\nhas tremendously intensified in recent years with the direct detection of\ngravitational waves (GW) by LIGO/Virgo from BNS merger events which has allowed\nthe possibility of directly probing the properties of the interior of a neutron\nstar. A remarkable phenomenon manifested by rapidly rotating neutron stars is\nin their {\\it avatar} as {\\it Pulsars}. The accuracy of pulsar timing can reach\nthe level of one part in 10$^{15}$, comparable to that of atomic clocks. This\nsuggests that even a tiny deformation of the pulsar can leave its imprints on\nthe pulses by inducing tiny perturbations in the entire moment of inertia (MI)\ntensor affecting the pulse timings, as well as the pulse profile (from wobbling\ninduced by off-diagonal MI components). This may allow a new probe of various\nphase transitions occurring inside a pulsar core through induced density\nfluctuations affecting the MI tensor. Such perturbations also naturally induce\na rapidly changing quadrupole moment of the star, thereby providing a new\nsource of gravitational wave emission. Another remarkable possibility arises\nwhen we consider the effect of an external GW on neutron star. With the\npossibility of detecting any minute changes in its configuration through pulse\nobservations, the neutron star has the potential of performing as a Weber\ndetector of gravitational wave. This brief review will focus on these specific\naspects of a pulsar. Specifically, the focus will be on the type of physics\nwhich can be probed by utilizing the effect of changes in the MI tensor of the\npulsar on pulse properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 12:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

However, the uplink channel noise incurs considerable model\naggregation distortion, which is critically determined by the device scheduling\nand compromises the learned model performance.

As a result, LLMs will frequently interact with us and\nother agents. It is, therefore, of great societal value to understand how LLMs\nbehave in interactive social settings. Here, we propose to use behavioral game\ntheory to study LLM's cooperation and coordination behavior. To do so, we let\ndifferent LLMs (GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) play finitely repeated games with\neach other and with other, human-like strategies. Our results show that LLMs\ngenerally perform well in such tasks and also uncover persistent behavioral\nsignatures. In a large set of two players-two strategies games, we find that\nLLMs are particularly good at games where valuing their own self-interest pays\noff, like the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma family. However, they behave\nsub-optimally in games that require coordination. We, therefore, further focus\non two games from these distinct families. In the canonical iterated Prisoner's\nDilemma, we find that GPT-4 acts particularly unforgivingly, always defecting\nafter another agent has defected only once. In the Battle of the Sexes, we find\nthat GPT-4 cannot match the behavior of the simple convention to alternate\nbetween options. We verify that these behavioral signatures are stable across\nrobustness checks.

This increases the relevance of people\nanalytics (PA), which are tools for the behavioral analysis of employees.\nDespite this potential, the successful usage of PA is hindered by employee\nconcerns. Especially in Europe, where the GDPR or equivalent laws apply,\nemployee consent is required before data can be processed in PA. Therefore, PA\ncan only provide relevant insights if employees are willing to share their\ndata. One potential way of achieving this is the use of appeal strategies. In\nthe design of PA, the core strategy that can be used is the inclusion of data\nowner benefits, such as automated feedback, that are given to employees in\nexchange for sharing their own data. In this paper, we examine benefits as an\nappeal strategy and develop four design principles for the inclusion of\nbenefits in PA. Then, we describe an exemplary set of analyses and benefits,\ndemonstrating how our principles may be put into practice. Based on this\nexemplary implementation, we describe and discuss the results of a user study\n($n = 46$) among employees in the EU and UK. Our study investigates the factors\nthat foster or hinder employees' consent to sharing their data with PA. Then,\nwe introduce our data owner benefits and analyze whether they can positively\ninfluence this consent decision.\n  Our introduced data owner benefits were, contrary to our expectations, not\nsuited to motivate our participants to consent to sharing their data. We\ntherefore analyze how participants judge the benefits. Participants generally\nappreciate having them, confirming the value of including data owner benefits\nwhen designing PA. Some of our introduced benefits negatively influenced\nparticipants' sharing decision, though, meaning that careful consideration of\npotential risks is required when conceptualizing them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 12:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

One of the\nfirst exoplanets observed by JWST in the summer of 2022 was WASP-96 b, a\nhot-Saturn orbiting a G8 star. As part of the Early Release Observations\nprogram, one transit of WASP-96 b was observed with NIRISS/SOSS to capture its\ntransmission spectrum from 0.6-2.85 microns. In this work, we utilise four\nretrieval frameworks to report precise and robust measurements of WASP-96 b's\natmospheric composition.

Some attempts have\nbeen made to directly apply parts of the Adam algorithm to manifolds or to find\nan underlying structure, but a full generalization has remained elusive.

This makes updates slower and more expensive than necessary. More\nrecent consensus-free replicated ledgers forego consensus algorithms, with\nsignificant increase in performance and decrease in infrastructure costs.\nHowever, current designs are based around reliable broadcast of update\noperations to all replicas which require reliable message delivery and\nreasoning over operation histories to establish convergence and safety.\n  In this paper, we present a replicated ledger as a state-based conflict-free\nreplicated data type (CRDT) based on grow-only counters. This design provides\ntwo major benefits: 1) it requires a weaker eventual transitive delivery of the\nlatest state rather than reliable broadcast of all update operations to all\nreplicas; 2) eventual convergence and safety properties can be proven easily\nwithout having to reason over operation histories: convergence comes from the\ncomposition of grow-only counters, themselves CRDTs, and safety properties can\nbe expressed over the state of counters, locally and globally. In addition,\napplications that tolerate temporary negative balances require no additional\nmechanisms and applications that require strictly non-negative balances can be\nsupported by enforcing sequential updates to the same account across replicas.\n  Our design is sufficient when executing on replicas that might crash and\nrecover, as common in deployments in which all replicas are managed by trusted\nentities.

Recent work has shown that the\nbehavior of stellar spindown differs significantly from prior expectations for\nlate-type stars. We study the 4Gyr-old benchmark open cluster M67 to explore\nthis behavior further. We combined a Gaia DR3 sample with the Kepler K2\nsuperstamp of Campaign 5 around M67 and created new light curves from aperture\nphotometry. The light curves are subjected to an extensive correction process\nto remove instrumental systematics and trending, followed by period analysis to\nmeasure stellar rotation. We identify periodic signals in 136 light curves, 47\nof which are from the rotation of effectively single main-sequence stars that\nspan from early-G to mid-M type. These results connect well to prior work on\nM67 and extend it to much later spectral types. We find that the rotation\nperiods of single stars of age 4Gyr define a tight relationship with color,\nranging from spectral types F through M. The corresponding surface of rotation\nperiod against age and mass is therefore well-defined to an older age than was\npreviously known. However, the deviations from prior expectations of the\nstellar spindown behavior are even more pronounced at 4Gyr. The binary cluster\nmembers do not follow the single star relationship. The majority are widely\nscattered below the single star sequence.

Formal verification has been demonstrated to\nbe effective in providing provable robustness guarantees. To improve its\nscalability, over-approximating the non-linear activation functions in DNNs by\nlinear constraints has been widely adopted, which transforms the verification\nproblem into an efficiently solvable linear programming problem. Many efforts\nhave been dedicated to defining the so-called tightest approximations to reduce\noverestimation imposed by over-approximation. In this paper, we study existing\napproaches and identify a dominant factor in defining tight approximation,\nnamely the approximation domain of the activation function. We find out that\ntight approximations defined on approximation domains may not be as tight as\nthe ones on their actual domains, yet existing approaches all rely only on\napproximation domains. Based on this observation, we propose a novel\ndual-approximation approach to tighten over-approximations, leveraging an\nactivation function's underestimated domain to define tight approximation\nbounds.

While it is natural to believe that better\nalignment of student features to the teacher better distills teacher knowledge,\nsimply forcing this alignment does not directly contribute to the student's\nperformance, e.g., classification accuracy. In this work, we propose to align\nstudent features with class-mean of teacher features, where class-mean\nnaturally serves as a strong classifier. To this end, we explore baseline\ntechniques such as adopting the cosine distance based loss to encourage the\nsimilarity between student features and their corresponding class-means of the\nteacher. Moreover, we train the student to produce large-norm features,\ninspired by other lines of work (e.g., model pruning and domain adaptation),\nwhich find the large-norm features to be more significant.

Other strands of work have\npresented approaches for reducing the size of multi-robot models to admit more\nefficient solution methods.

However, many existing models oversimplify the problem\nby assuming the error process is time-independent, thereby overlooking the\nserial correlation in the error process. This oversight can potentially\ndiminish the accuracy of the forecasts, rendering these models less effective\nfor decision-making purposes. To overcome this limitation, we propose an\ninnovative training method that incorporates error autocorrelation to enhance\nthe accuracy of probabilistic forecasting. Our method involves constructing a\nmini-batch as a collection of $D$ consecutive time series segments for model\ntraining and explicitly learning a covariance matrix over each mini-batch that\nencodes the error correlation among adjacent time steps. The resulting\ncovariance matrix can be used to improve prediction accuracy and enhance\nuncertainty quantification. We evaluate our method using DeepAR on multiple\npublic datasets, and the experimental results confirm that our framework can\neffectively capture the error autocorrelation and enhance probabilistic\nforecasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 15:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

Instead of chemical species freely reacting and diffusing in space,\nour system describes the tug-of-war reaction-kinetics of molecular motors that\nare anchored in the flagellar structure, but the shear deformation that they\ngenerate can diffuse away via the bending elasticity of the flagellum.\nSynchronization of the reaction-kinetics in neighbouring elements occurs via a\nsliding-control mechanism. We derive from first principles the\nreaction-diffusion basis of animated patterns as a direct consequence of the\nhigh internal energy dissipation by the flagellum relative to the external\ndissipation by the surrounding fluid. By fitting nonlinear, large-amplitude\nsolutions of a specific motor cross-bridge reaction-kinetics, we show that\nreaction-diffusion successfully accounts for beating patterns of both bull\nsperm and Chlamydomonas (wild-type and mbo2-mutant).

First,\nit explains what internal audit is: a specific team that performs an ongoing\nassessment of an organization's risk management practices and reports directly\nto the board of directors, while being organizationally independent from senior\nmanagement. Next, the paper discusses the main benefits of internal audit for\nAGI labs: it can make their risk management practices more effective; ensure\nthat the board of directors has a more accurate view of the current level of\nrisk and the effectiveness of the lab's risk management practices; signal that\nthe lab follows best practices in corporate governance; and serve as a contact\npoint for whistleblowers. However, AGI labs should be aware of a number of\nlimitations: internal audit adds friction; there is not much empirical evidence\nin support of the above-mentioned benefits; the benefits depend on the people\ninvolved and their ability and willingness to identify ineffective risk\nmanagement practices; setting up and maintaining an internal audit team is\ncostly; and it should only be seen as an additional \"layer of defense\", not a\nsilver bullet against emerging risks from AI. Finally, the paper provides a\nblueprint for how AGI labs could set up an internal audit team and suggests\nconcrete things the team would do on a day-to-day basis. These suggestions are\nbased on the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal\nAuditing Standards. In light of rapid progress in AI research and development,\nAGI labs need to professionalize their risk management practices.

We establish that this entire procedure\nis implementable using the transformer mechanism, and we give sample complexity\nguarantees for this learning framework. Our empirical findings validate the\nchallenge of segmentation, and we show a correspondence between our posited\nmechanisms and observed attention maps for step (c).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 15:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

A unit test\nconsists of a test prefix and a test oracle. Synthesizing test oracles,\nespecially functional oracles, is a well-known challenging problem. Recent\nstudies proposed to leverage neural models to generate test oracles, i.e.,\nneural test oracle generation (NTOG), and obtained promising results. However,\nafter a systematic inspection, we find there are some inappropriate settings in\nexisting evaluation methods for NTOG. These settings could mislead the\nunderstanding of existing NTOG approaches' performance. We summarize them as 1)\ngenerating test prefixes from bug-fixed program versions, 2) evaluating with an\nunrealistic metric, and 3) lacking a straightforward baseline. In this paper,\nwe first investigate the impacts of these settings on evaluating and\nunderstanding the performance of NTOG approaches. We find that 1)\nunrealistically generating test prefixes from bug-fixed program versions\ninflates the number of bugs found by the state-of-the-art NTOG approach TOGA by\n61.8%, 2) FPR (False Positive Rate) is not a realistic evaluation metric and\nthe Precision of TOGA is only 0.38%, and 3) a straightforward baseline\nNoException, which simply expects no exception should be raised, can find 61%\nof the bugs found by TOGA with twice the Precision. Furthermore, we introduce\nan additional ranking step to existing evaluation methods and propose an\nevaluation metric named Found@K to better measure the cost-effectiveness of\nNTOG approaches. We propose a novel unsupervised ranking method to instantiate\nthis ranking step, significantly improving the cost-effectiveness of TOGA.\nEventually, we propose a more realistic evaluation method TEval+ for NTOG and\nsummarize seven rules of thumb to boost NTOG approaches into their practical\nusages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 15:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

Identifying and analysing these insects' use of natural\nand anthropogenic microhabitats is important to assess their responses to a\nchanging environment, for improving pollination and managing invasive pests.\nTraditional studies of insect microhabitat use can now be supplemented by\nmachine learning-based insect image analysis. Typically, research has focused\non automatic insect classification, but valuable data in image backgrounds has\nbeen ignored. In this research, we analysed the image backgrounds available on\nthe ALA database to determine their microhabitats.

NeurTaskSyn has two\ncomponents: the first component is trained via imitation learning procedure to\ngenerate possible solution codes, and the second component is trained via\nreinforcement learning procedure to guide an underlying symbolic execution\nengine that generates visual tasks for these codes. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of NeurTaskSyn through an extensive empirical evaluation and a\nqualitative study on reference tasks taken from the Hour of Code: Classic Maze\nchallenge by Code-dot-org and the Intro to Programming with Karel course by\nCodeHS-dot-com.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 01:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 14:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

To fill that void in literature, we study the\ndynamics of collision avoidance between pedestrian groups (in particular dyads)\nand individual pedestrians in an ecological environment, focusing in particular\non (i) how such avoidance depends on the group's social relation (e.g.\ncolleagues, couples, friends or families) and (ii) its intensity of social\ninteraction (indicated by conversation, gaze exchange, gestures etc). By\nanalyzing relative collision avoidance in the ``center of mass'' frame, we were\nable to quantify how much groups and individuals avoid each other with respect\nto the aforementioned properties of the group. A mathematical representation\nusing a potential energy function is proposed to model avoidance and it is\nshown to provide a fair approximation to the empirical observations. We also\nstudied the probability that the individuals disrupt the group by ``passing\nthrough it'' (termed as intrusion). We analyzed the dependence of the\nparameters of the avoidance model and of the probability of intrusion on\ngroups' social relation and intensity of interaction. We confirmed that the\nstronger social bonding or interaction intensity is, the more prominent\ncollision avoidance turns out. We also confirmed that the probability of\nintrusion is a decreasing function of interaction intensity and strength of\nsocial bonding. Our results suggest that such variability should be accounted\nfor in models and crowd management in general. Namely, public spaces with\nstrongly bonded groups (e.g. a family-oriented amusement park) may require a\ndifferent approach compared to public spaces with loosely bonded groups (e.g. a\nbusiness-oriented trade fair).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 04:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Al\nfoams can filter sparks to avoid damage from high voltage discharge during\nsurgery and efficiently deliver reactive species generated in CAP to the\ntarget. The sparks appear and plasma intensity increases at the foam/discharge\ninterface, which just slightly increases the interface temperature without\nchanging the interface microstructure during a 30-minute treatment. After CAP\npenetrated the Al foams, N2, N2+, *OH, O, and He emission peaks were\ncharacterized, and the highest values appeared using Al foams with 10 PPI. CAP\nwith and without Al foam intermediating was used to treat deionized water, and\nthe results indicate CAP in combination with 10 PPI Al foam led to much higher\nROS concentration than CAP alone. For melanoma cell experiments, CAP with and\nwithout Al foam had a similar effect on cell viability after 30-second\ntreatment, while CAP with the 10-PPI Al foam had much higher killing efficiency\nthan CAP alone after 60-second treatment.

One way to deal\nwith this is to transform, for verification purposes, the program to an\nequivalent one not using the problematic constructs, and to reason about its\ncorrectness instead. In this paper, we propose instrumentation as a unifying\nverification paradigm that subsumes various existing ad-hoc approaches, has a\nclear formal correctness criterion, can be applied automatically, and can\ntransfer back witnesses and counterexamples. We illustrate our approach on the\nautomated verification of programs that involve quantification and aggregation\noperations over arrays, such as the maximum value or sum of the elements in a\ngiven segment of the array, which are known to be difficult to reason about\nautomatically. We formalise array aggregation operations as monoid\nhomomorphisms. We implement our approach in the MonoCera tool, which is\ntailored to the verification of programs with aggregation, and evaluate it on\nexample programs, including SV-COMP programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2023 14:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Although there are numerous advantages of this\ngenerative model, it comes with some reasonable concerns as well.

In this article, leading\nscientists, researchers and engineers discuss the transformative effects of\nChatGPT on modern education. This research seeks to improve our knowledge of\nChatGPT capabilities and its use in the education sector, identifying potential\nconcerns and challenges. Our preliminary evaluation concludes that ChatGPT\nperformed differently in each subject area including finance, coding and maths.\nWhile ChatGPT has the ability to help educators by creating instructional\ncontent, offering suggestions and acting as an online educator to learners by\nanswering questions and promoting group work, there are clear drawbacks in its\nuse, such as the possibility of producing inaccurate or false data and\ncircumventing duplicate content (plagiarism) detectors where originality is\nessential. The often reported hallucinations within Generative AI in general,\nand also relevant for ChatGPT, can render its use of limited benefit where\naccuracy is essential. What ChatGPT lacks is a stochastic measure to help\nprovide sincere and sensitive communication with its users. Academic\nregulations and evaluation practices used in educational institutions need to\nbe updated, should ChatGPT be used as a tool in education. To address the\ntransformative effects of ChatGPT on the learning environment, educating\nteachers and students alike about its capabilities and limitations will be\ncrucial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2023 17:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}
