In the\nstrongest condition, the coloring model (which includes, e.g., random geometric\ngraphs), we prove that $\\rho(n)\\rightarrow 2-\\phi\\approx 0.38$ for\n$n\\rightarrow\\infty$. This separates it from the weaker independence conditions\nwe consider, as there we prove that $\\rho(n)>0.5-o(n)$. In stark contrast to\nthe coloring model, for our weakest independence condition -- pairwise\nindependence of non-adjacent edges -- we show that $\\rho(n)$ lies within\n$O(1/n^2)$ of the threshold for completely arbitrary distributions ($1-2/n$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 16:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-05"}

While an EF1 and Pareto optimal (PO) allocation of goods always exists\nand can be computed via several well-known algorithms, even the existence of\nsuch solutions for chores remains open, to date. We take an epistemic approach\nutilizing information asymmetry by introducing dubious chores -- items that\ninflict no cost on receiving agents, but are perceived costly by others. On a\ntechnical level, dubious chores provide a more fine-grained approximation of\nenvy-freeness -- compared to relaxations such as EF1 -- which enables progress\ntowards addressing open problems on the existence and computation of EF1 and\nPO. In particular, we show that finding allocations with optimal number of\ndubious chores is computationally hard even for highly restricted classes of\nvaluations.

Despite\nrecent empirical studies positing a near-perfect linear correlation between\nin-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, we empirically\ndemonstrate that this correlation is more nuanced under subpopulation shifts.\nThrough rigorous experimentation and analysis across a variety of datasets,\nmodels, and training epochs, we demonstrate that OOD performance often has a\nnonlinear correlation with ID performance in subpopulation shifts. Our\nfindings, which contrast previous studies that have posited a linear\ncorrelation in model performance during distribution shifts, reveal a \"moon\nshape\" correlation (parabolic uptrend curve) between the test performance on\nthe majority subpopulation and the minority subpopulation. This non-trivial\nnonlinear correlation holds across model architectures, hyperparameters,\ntraining durations, and the imbalance between subpopulations. Furthermore, we\nfound that the nonlinearity of this \"moon shape\" is causally influenced by the\ndegree of spurious correlations in the training data. Our controlled\nexperiments show that stronger spurious correlation in the training data\ncreates more nonlinear performance correlation. We provide complementary\nexperimental and theoretical analyses for this phenomenon, and discuss its\nimplications for ML reliability and fairness.

Recent work\nproposes ANNCUR (Yadav et al., 2022) which uses CUR matrix factorization to\nproduce an embedding space for efficient vector-based search that directly\napproximates the cross-encoder without the need for dual-encoders. ANNCUR\ndefines this shared query-item embedding space by scoring the test query\nagainst anchor items which are sampled uniformly at random. While this\nminimizes average approximation error over all items, unsuitably high\napproximation error on top-k items remains and leads to poor recall of top-k\n(and especially top-1) items. Increasing the number of anchor items is a\nstraightforward way of improving the approximation error and hence k-NN recall\nof ANNCUR but at the cost of increased inference latency.

The key challenge in\napplying transformers to point clouds is reducing the quadratic, thus\noverwhelming, computation complexity of attentions. To combat this issue,\nseveral works divide point clouds into non-overlapping windows and constrain\nattentions in each local window. However, the point number in each window\nvaries greatly, impeding the efficient execution on GPU. Observing that\nattentions are robust to the shapes of local windows, we propose a novel octree\nattention, which leverages sorted shuffled keys of octrees to partition point\nclouds into local windows containing a fixed number of points while permitting\nshapes of windows to change freely.

However, this\ndependence can significantly constrain the true potential of AI-assistant\nagents due to the high cost of obtaining human supervision and the related\nissues on quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable\nbiases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called\nSELF-ALIGN, which combines principle-driven reasoning and the generative power\nof LLMs for the self-alignment of AI agents with minimal human supervision. Our\napproach encompasses four stages: first, we use an LLM to generate synthetic\nprompts, and a topic-guided method to augment the prompt diversity; second, we\nuse a small set of human-written principles for AI models to follow, and guide\nthe LLM through in-context learning from demonstrations (of principles\napplication) to produce helpful, ethical, and reliable responses to user's\nqueries; third, we fine-tune the original LLM with the high-quality\nself-aligned responses so that the resulting model can generate desirable\nresponses for each query directly without the principle set and the\ndemonstrations anymore; and finally, we offer a refinement step to address the\nissues of overly-brief or indirect responses.

Despite their impressive\nresults on novel-view synthesis, it remains a fundamental challenge for NeRFs\nto edit the shape of the scene. Our key insight is to exploit the explicit\npoint cloud representation as the underlying structure to construct NeRFs,\ninspired by the intuitive interpretation of NeRF rendering as a process that\nprojects or \"plots\" the associated 3D point cloud to a 2D image plane. To this\nend, NeuralEditor introduces a novel rendering scheme based on deterministic\nintegration within K-D tree-guided density-adaptive voxels, which produces both\nhigh-quality rendering results and precise point clouds through optimization.\nNeuralEditor then performs shape editing via mapping associated points between\npoint clouds. Extensive evaluation shows that NeuralEditor achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both shape deformation and scene morphing\ntasks. Notably, NeuralEditor supports both zero-shot inference and further\nfine-tuning over the edited scene.

The PELM is based on the processing of the image of the scattered\nlight by an array of 18 gratings coupled to microresonators. Light propagation\nin the microresonator array is a linear process while light detection by the\nvideo camera is a nonlinear process. Training is done offline by analyzing the\nrecorded scattered light image with a linear classifier. We provide a\nproof-of-concept demonstration of the PELM by solving both binary and analog\ntasks, and show how the performance depends on the number of microresonators\nused in the readout procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 16:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

We use high-signal MUSE (Multi-Unit\nSpectroscopic Explorer) spectral observations and novel triaxial dynamical\norbit models to reveal a surprisingly isotropic central orbit distribution in\nNGC 5419. Recent collisionless simulations of merging massive ETGs suggest a\ntwo-phase core formation model, in which the low-density stellar core forms\nrapidly by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) sinking into the center due to\ndynamical friction. Only afterwards the SMBHs form a hard binary and the black\nhole scouring process slowly changes the central orbit distribution from\nisotropic to tangential.

Our triaxial dynamical models indicate a total mass\nof the two SMBHs in the center of NGC 5419 of MBH = (1.0 +/- 0.08) 10^10 Msol.\nMoreover, we find that NGC 5419's complex kinematically distinct core (KDC) can\nbe explained by a coherent flip of the orbital rotation direction of stars on\ntube orbits at ~3kpc distance from the galaxy center together with projection\neffects. This is also in agreement with merger simulations hosting SMBHs in the\nsame mass regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 15:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

For the first time, we herein introduce\ntrialkylsulfonium aprotic ionic liquids (ILs) as a group of seemingly highly\ncapacitive CO2 scavengers. We advocate the viability of the new sorbents by the\nreaction profiles recorded by means of hybrid density functional theory. All\nstages constituting CO2 chemisorption, such as the ethyldimethylsulfonium\nS211-cation deprotonation, S211-ylide carboxylation at the alpha-methylene\ngroup, and aprotic anion carboxamidation have been explored. The S211-ylide\nformation reaction is thermochemically forbidden but its cost is affordable.\nThe energetic cost ranges from a tiny number of 14 kJ/mol for S211 indazolide\nto a mediocre value of 50 kJ/mol for S211 1,2,4-triazolide. The barriers\ncorresponding to the sulfonium-based cation deprotonation range from 39 kJ/mol\nfor benzimidazolide to +60 kJ/mol for 1,2,4-triazolide. The energy loss during\nthe ylide intermediate formation is strongly compensated for by the subsequent\nsulfonium ylide carboxylation. The energetic gain is weakly dependent on the\nnature of the heterocyclic aprotic anion being 99 to 110 kJ/mol for different\nionic species studied. The AHAs additionally participate in CO2 capture\nfollowing the route of carboxamidation thanks to their nitrogen sites. The most\nthermochemically favorable carbamate forms out of S211-indazolide, 68 kJ/mol.\nThe steric and covalent barriers associated with these reactions are of the\norder of thermal motion energy, whereas a specific chemical structure of AHA\nengenders marginal differences. The rationalization of the energy reaction\nprofiles is given in terms of partial atomic charges, geometrical\npeculiarities, steric barriers, imaginary vibrational frequencies, and related\ndescriptors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 18:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

The\ntask is generally cast into two different settings: answer-aware and\nanswer-unaware. While the former facilitates the models by exposing the\nexpected answer, the latter is more realistic and receiving growing attentions\nrecently. What-to-ask and how-to-ask are the two main challenges in the\nanswer-unaware setting. To address the first challenge, existing methods mainly\nselect sequential sentences in context as the rationales. We argue that the\nconversation generated using such naive heuristics may not be natural enough as\nin reality, the interlocutors often talk about the relevant contents that are\nnot necessarily sequential in context. Additionally, previous methods decide\nthe type of question to be generated (boolean/span-based) implicitly. Modeling\nthe question type explicitly is crucial as the answer, which hints the models\nto generate a boolean or span-based question, is unavailable. To this end, we\npresent SG-CQG, a two-stage CQG framework. For the what-to-ask stage, a\nsentence is selected as the rationale from a semantic graph that we construct,\nand extract the answer span from it. For the how-to-ask stage, a classifier\ndetermines the target answer type of the question via two explicit control\nsignals before generating and filtering. In addition, we propose Conv-Distinct,\na novel evaluation metric for CQG, to evaluate the diversity of the generated\nconversation from a context.

However, most anomaly localization research in machine learning\nfocuses on non-medical datasets, and we find that these methods fall short when\nadapted to medical imaging datasets.

However, there are often\nmany valid normal completions given the same surroundings, especially in the\nDBT dataset, making this evaluation criterion less precise. To address such an\nissue, we consider pluralistic image completion by exploring the distribution\nof possible completions instead of generating fixed predictions.

Optimization under uncertainty (OUU) deals with this endeavor and\nrequires uncertainty quantification analyses at several design locations. The\ncost of OUU is proportional to the cost of performing a forward uncertainty\nanalysis at each design location visited, which makes the computational burden\ntoo high for high-fidelity simulations with significant computational cost.\nFrom a high-level standpoint, an OUU workflow typically has two main\ncomponents: an inner loop strategy for the computation of statistics of the\nquantity of interest, and an outer loop optimization strategy tasked with\nfinding the optimal design, given a merit function based on the inner loop\nstatistics. In this work, we propose to alleviate the cost of the inner loop\nuncertainty analysis by leveraging the so-called Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC)\nmethod.

To alleviate this issue, we\npropose a novel perspective that highlights the objects of interest by\ninvestigating the regions of the trait, thereby fostering an extensive\ncomprehension of the successive affinity matrix. Consequently, we suggest an\nadaptive re-activation mechanism (AReAM) that alleviates the issue of\nincomplete attention within the object and the unbounded background noise.\nAReAM accomplishes this by supervising high-level attention with shallow\naffinity matrices, yielding promising results. Exhaustive experiments conducted\non the commonly used dataset manifest that segmentation results can be greatly\nimproved through our proposed AReAM, which imposes restrictions on each\naffinity matrix in deep layers to make it attentive to semantic regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 19:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

On-device learning enables edge platforms to continually adapt the\nAI models to user personal data and further allows for a better service\nquality. However, AI training on resource-limited devices is extremely\ndifficult because of the intensive computing workload and the significant\namount of on-chip memory consumption exacted by deep neural networks (DNNs). To\nmitigate this, we propose to use embedded dynamic random-access memory (eDRAM)\nas the main storage medium of training data. Compared with static random-access\nmemory (SRAM), eDRAM introduces more than $2\\times$ improvement on storage\ndensity, enabling reduced off-chip memory traffic. However, to keep the stored\ndata intact, eDRAM is required to perform the power-hungry data refresh\noperations.\n  eDRAM refresh can be eliminated if the data is stored for a period of time\nthat is shorter than the eDRAM retention time. To achieve this, we design a\nnovel reversible DNN architecture that enables a significantly reduced data\nlifetime during the training process and removes the need for eDRAM refresh. We\nfurther design an efficient on-device training engine, termed~\\textit{CAMEL},\nthat uses eDRAM as the main on-chip memory.

To identify a\n\"quantum advantage\" for these simulations, performance analysis of both\nclassical-digital algorithms and analog-quantum simulation on noisy hardware is\nneeded. In this Perspective, we make this comparison for the simulation of\nmodel molecular Hamiltonians that describe intrinsically quantum models for\nmolecules that possess linear vibronic coupling, comparing the accuracy and\ncomputational cost. We describe several simple Hamiltonians that are commonly\nused to model molecular systems, which can be simulated with existing or\nemerging trapped-ion hardware. These Hamiltonians may serve as stepping stones\ntoward the use of trapped-ion simulators beyond the reach of classical-digital\nmethods. Finally, we identify dynamical regimes where classical-digital\nsimulations seem to have the weakest performance compared to analog-quantum\nsimulations. These regimes may provide the lowest hanging fruit to exploit\npotential quantum advantages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 21:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

We here\nelucidate that the speed of an observable of our interest can be tighter\nbounded when we have knowledge of other observables, such as experimentally\naccessible ones or conserved quantities. We prove this by introducing a new\nconcept, \"quantum velocity limit,\" which is a universal inequality of a\nvelocity vector for multiple observables and improves conventional speed limits\nfor a single observable. We first derive an information-theoretical velocity\nlimit in terms of the generalized correlation matrix of the observables and the\nquantum Fisher information. The velocity limit has various novel consequences,\nsome of which are particularly noteworthy: (I) Conservation law in the system,\na fundamental ingredient of quantum dynamics, can improve the velocity and\nspeed limits through the correlation between the observables and conserved\nquantities; (II) Speed of an observable can be bounded by a nontrivial lower\nbound from the information on another observable, while most of the previous\nspeed limits provide only upper bounds; (III) There exists a new tradeoff\nrelation in nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics, i.e., speeds of\nuncorrelated observables cannot be simultaneously large; (IV) Velocity and\nspeed limits for observables on a subsystem in locally interacting many-body\nsystems remain convergent even in the thermodynamic limit, unlike the naive\napplication of the conventional speed limits. Moreover, we discover another\ndistinct velocity limit for multiple observables on the basis of the local\nconservation law of probability current, which becomes advantageous for\nmacroscopic transitions of multiple quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 22:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

Here, we present a significant\nextension of Asfgrid to cover higher- and lower-mass stars and to increase the\ndensity of grid points, especially in the low-metallicity regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 00:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

One promising approach involves criticality-aware\nprocessing, where the computation is directed selectively to critical portions\nof individual image frames. We introduce MOSAIC, a novel system for such\ncriticality-aware concurrent processing of multiple vision sensing streams that\nprovides a multiplicative increase in the achievable throughput with negligible\nloss in perception fidelity. MOSAIC determines critical regions from images\nreceived from multiple vision sensors and spatially bin-packs these regions\nusing a novel multi-scale Mosaic Across Scales (MoS) tiling strategy into a\nsingle canvas frame, sized such that the edge device can retain sufficiently\nhigh processing throughput. Experimental studies using benchmark datasets for\ntwo tasks, Automatic License Plate Recognition and Drone-based Pedestrian\nDetection, show that MOSAIC, executing on a Jetson TX2 edge device, can provide\ndramatic gains in the throughput vs. fidelity tradeoff. For instance, for\ndrone-based pedestrian detection, for a batch size of 4, MOSAIC can pack input\nframes from 6 cameras to achieve (a) 4.75x higher throughput (23 FPS per\ncamera, cumulatively 138FPS) with less than 1% accuracy loss, compared to a\nFirst Come First Serve (FCFS) processing paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 00:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

Much discussion has surrounded how lenticular\ngalaxies may form a bridging population between elliptical and spiral galaxies.\nHowever, with recourse to a galaxy's central black hole mass, accretion-built\nspiral galaxies have emerged as the bridging population between low-mass\nlenticular galaxies and the dusty merger-built lenticular galaxies contiguous\nwith elliptical galaxies and `brightest cluster galaxies' in the black\nhole/galaxy mass diagram. Spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way, appear\nbuilt from gas accretion and minor mergers onto what were initially lenticular\ngalaxies. These connections are expressed as a new morphology sequence, dubbed\nthe `Triangal', which subsumes elements of the Hubble sequence and the van den\nBergh trident and reveals the bridging nature of the often overlooked ellicular\ngalaxies. Furthermore, a quadratic black hole/galaxy mass relation is found to\ndescribe ordinary elliptical galaxies. The relation is roughly parallel to the\nquadratic-like relations observed for the central spheroidal component of\nspiral galaxies, dust-rich lenticular galaxies, and old dust-poor lenticular\ngalaxies. The brightest cluster galaxies are offset according to expectations\nfrom an additional major merger. The findings have implications for feedback\nfrom active galactic nuclei, mapping morphology into simulations, and\npredicting gravitational wave signals from colliding supermassive black holes.\nA new galaxy speciation model is presented. It disfavours the `monolithic\ncollapse' scenario for spiral, dusty lenticular, and elliptical galaxies. It\nreveals substantial orbital angular momentum in the Universe's first galaxies\nand unites dwarf and ordinary `early-type' galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 02:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

However, the current multi-modal face\npresentation attack detection (PAD) has two defects: (1) The framework based on\nmulti-modal fusion requires providing modalities consistent with the training\ninput, which seriously limits the deployment scenario. (2) The performance of\nConvNet-based model on high fidelity datasets is increasingly limited. In this\nwork, we present a pure transformer-based framework, dubbed the Flexible Modal\nVision Transformer (FM-ViT), for face anti-spoofing to flexibly target any\nsingle-modal (i.e., RGB) attack scenarios with the help of available\nmulti-modal data. Specifically, FM-ViT retains a specific branch for each\nmodality to capture different modal information and introduces the Cross-Modal\nTransformer Block (CMTB), which consists of two cascaded attentions named\nMulti-headed Mutual-Attention (MMA) and Fusion-Attention (MFA) to guide each\nmodal branch to mine potential features from informative patch tokens, and to\nlearn modality-agnostic liveness features by enriching the modal information of\nown CLS token, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that the single model\ntrained based on FM-ViT can not only flexibly evaluate different modal samples,\nbut also outperforms existing single-modal frameworks by a large margin, and\napproaches the multi-modal frameworks introduced with smaller FLOPs and model\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 04:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

By interfacing multiple sensors that\ncollectively interact with the signal to be measured, one can go beyond the\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNR) than those attainable by the individual\nconstituting elements. Such distributed sensing techniques have also been\nimplemented in the quantum regime, where a linear increase in the SNR has been\nachieved via using entangled states. Along similar lines, coupled non-\nHermitian systems have provided yet additional degrees of freedom to obtain\nbetter sensors via higher-order exceptional points. Quite recently, a new class\nof non-Hermitian systems, known as non-Hermitian topological sensors (NTOS) has\nbeen theoretically proposed. Remarkably, the synergistic interplay between\nnon-Hermiticity and topology is expected to bestow such sensors with an\nenhanced sensitivity that grows exponentially with the size of the sensor\nnetwork. Here, we experimentally demonstrate NTOS using a network of photonic\ntime-multiplexed resonators in the synthetic dimension represented by optical\npulses. By judiciously programming the delay lines in such a network, we\nrealize the archetypical Hatano-Nelson model for our non-Hermitian topological\nsensing scheme. Our experimentally measured sensitivities for different lattice\nsizes confirm the characteristic exponential enhancement of NTOS. We show that\nthis peculiar response arises due to the combined synergy between\nnon-Hermiticity and topology, something that is absent in Hermitian topological\nlattices. Our demonstration of NTOS paves the way for realizing sensors with\nunprecedented sensitivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 04:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

In this process, there is no need of any\nmanual work to produce composite reference motions for learning.

However, these\nmethods directly take sentences with only a few errors as inputs, where the\ncorrect characters may leak answers to the model and dampen its ability to\ncapture distant context; while the erroneous characters may disturb the\nsemantic encoding process and result in poor representations. Based on such\nobservations, this paper proposes an n-gram masking layer that masks current\nand/or surrounding tokens to avoid label leakage and error disturbance.\nMoreover, considering that the mask strategy may ignore multi-modal information\nindicated by errors, a novel dot-product gating mechanism is proposed to\nintegrate the phonological and morphological information with semantic\nrepresentation. Extensive experiments on SIGHAN datasets have demonstrated that\nthe pluggable n-gram masking mechanism can improve the performance of prevalent\nCSC models and the proposed methods in this paper outperform multiple powerful\nstate-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 06:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

With the growth of unstructured\nand semi-structured data, parallelization of graph algorithms is inevitable.\nUnfortunately, due to inherent irregularity of computation, memory access, and\ncommunication, graph algorithms are traditionally challenging to parallelize.\nTo tame this challenge, several libraries, frameworks, and domain-specific\nlanguages (DSLs) have been proposed to reduce the parallel programming burden\nof the users, who are often domain experts. However, existing frameworks to\nmodel graph algorithms typically target a single architecture. In this paper,\nwe present a graph DSL, named StarPlat, that allows programmers to specify\ngraph algorithms in a high-level format, but generates code for three different\nbackends from the same algorithmic specification. In particular, the DSL\ncompiler generates OpenMP for multi-core, MPI for distributed, and CUDA for\nmany-core GPUs. Since these three are completely different parallel programming\nparadigms, binding them together under the same language is challenging. We\nshare our experience with the language design. Central to our compiler is an\nintermediate representation which allows a common representation of the\nhigh-level program, from which individual backend code generations begin. We\ndemonstrate the expressiveness of StarPlat by specifying four graph algorithms:\nbetweenness centrality computation, page rank computation, single-source\nshortest paths, and triangle counting. We illustrate the effectiveness of our\napproach by comparing the performance of the generated codes with that obtained\nwith hand-crafted library codes. We find that the generated code is competitive\nto library-based codes in many cases.

Steady state magnetic fields are\nstronger and cosmic ray energy density higher than in comparable nonrotating\nsystems. Transient gas outflows induced by the nonlinear instability persist\nlonger, of order 2 Gyr, with rotation. Stratification combined with\n(differential) rotation drives helical flows, leading to mean-field dynamo.\nConsequently, the nonlinear state becomes oscillatory (while both the linear\ninstability and the dynamo are non-oscillatory). The horizontal magnetic field\nnear the midplane reverses its direction propagating to higher altitudes as the\nreversed field spreads buoyantly.

Using first-principles calculations,\nwe find the energy barriers of cluster rotation in quasi-tetragonal monolayer\nC60 structures are rather low (about 10 meV/atom). The small rotational energy\nbarriers lead to a series of tetragonal C60 polymorphs with energies that are\nclose to the experimental quasi-tetragonal (expt-qT) phase.

The addition of ecological factors, termed \"eco-evolutionary\ndynamics\", further complicates the dynamics and results in many problems which\nare intractable or impractically messy for current theoretical methods.\nHowever, an analogous but underexplored approach is to analyze these systems\nwith an eye primarily towards uncertainty in the models themselves.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\n(NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique to get insights in these systems\nthanks to its ability to distinguish between bulk and adsorbed species and to\nits sensitivity to dynamic phenomena. Nevertheless, a clear interpretation of\nthe experimental results is sometimes rendered difficult by the various factors\naffecting NMR spectra. A mesoscopic model to predict NMR spectra of ions\ndiffusing in carbon particles is adapted to include dynamic exchange between\nthe intra-particle space and the bulk electrolyte surrounding the particle. A\nsystematic study of the particle size effect on the NMR spectra for different\ndistributions of magnetic environments in the porous carbons is conducted. The\nmodel demonstrates the importance of considering a range of magnetic\nenvironments, instead of a single chemical shift value corresponding to\nadsorbed species, and of including a range of exchange rates (between in and\nout of the particle), instead of a single timescale, to predict realistic NMR\nspectra. Depending on the pore size distribution of the carbon particle and the\nratio between bulk and adsorbed species, both the NMR linewidth and peak\npositions can be largely influenced by the particle size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 08:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

Existing methods mainly resort to finetuning a pretrained\ngenerative model, where the identity-relevant information and the\nidentity-irrelevant information are entangled in the latent embedding space.\nHowever, the highly entangled latent embedding may lead to the failure of\nsubject-driven text-to-image generation as follows: (i) the identity-irrelevant\ninformation hidden in the entangled embedding may dominate the generation\nprocess, resulting in the generated images heavily dependent on the irrelevant\ninformation while ignoring the given text descriptions; (ii) the\nidentity-relevant information carried in the entangled embedding can not be\nappropriately preserved, resulting in identity change of the subject in the\ngenerated images. To tackle the problems, we propose DisenBooth, an\nidentity-preserving disentangled tuning framework for subject-driven\ntext-to-image generation in this paper. Specifically, DisenBooth finetunes the\npretrained diffusion model in the denoising process. Different from previous\nworks that utilize an entangled embedding to denoise each image, DisenBooth\ninstead utilizes disentangled embeddings to respectively preserve the subject\nidentity and capture the identity-irrelevant information. We further design the\nnovel weak denoising and contrastive embedding auxiliary tuning objectives to\nachieve the disentanglement. Extensive experiments show that our proposed\nDisenBooth framework outperforms baseline models for subject-driven\ntext-to-image generation with the identity-preserved embedding.

Through experiments on stable diffusion,\nwe show that blocks of pixels in the initial latent images have a preference\nfor generating specific content, and that modifying these blocks can\nsignificantly influence the generated image. In particular, we show that\nmodifying a part of the initial image affects the corresponding region of the\ngenerated image while leaving other regions unaffected, which is useful for\nrepainting tasks.

A common issue with ANNs is that they usually have\nmillions or billions of trainable parameters, and therefore tend to overfit to\nthe training data. This is especially problematic in applications where it is\nimportant to have reliable uncertainty estimates. Bayesian neural networks\n(BNN) can improve on this, since they incorporate parameter uncertainty. In\naddition, latent binary Bayesian neural networks (LBBNN) also take into account\nstructural uncertainty by allowing the weights to be turned on or off, enabling\ninference in the joint space of weights and structures. In this paper, we will\nconsider two extensions to the LBBNN method: Firstly, by using the local\nreparametrization trick (LRT) to sample the hidden units directly, we get a\nmore computationally efficient algorithm. More importantly, by using\nnormalizing flows on the variational posterior distribution of the LBBNN\nparameters, the network learns a more flexible variational posterior\ndistribution than the mean field Gaussian. Experimental results show that this\nimproves predictive power compared to the LBBNN method, while also obtaining\nmore sparse networks. We perform two simulation studies. In the first study, we\nconsider variable selection in a logistic regression setting, where the more\nflexible variational distribution leads to improved results. In the second\nstudy, we compare predictive uncertainty based on data generated from\ntwo-dimensional Gaussian distributions.

Tidal heating is present in solar system satellites and it can\nheat up their interior depending on their orbital and interior properties. We\naim to identify a Tidally Heated Exomoon's (THEM) orbital parameter space that\nwould make it observable in infrared wavelengths with MIRI/JWST around\n$\\epsilon$ Eridani b. We study the possible constraints on orbital eccentricity\nand interior properties that a successful THEM detection in infrared\nwavelengths can bring. We also investigate what exomoon properties need to be\nindependently known in order to place these constraints. We use a coupled\nthermal-tidal model to find stable equilibrium points between the tidally\nproduced heat and heat transported within a moon. For the latter, we consider a\nspherical and radially symmetric satellite with heat being transported via\nmagma advection in a sub-layer of melt (asthenosphere) and convection in the\nlower mantle. We incorporate uncertainties in the interior and tidal model\nparameters to assess the fraction of simulated moons that would be observable\nwith MIRI. We find that a $2 R_{Io}$ THEM orbiting $\\epsilon$ Eridani b with an\neccentricity of 0.02, would need to have a semi-major axis of 4 planetary\nRoche-radii for 100% of the simulations to produce an observable moon.

To\novercome those limitations and improve the detection accuracy at night, we\npropose an object detector called Ghost Auto Anchor Network (GAANet) for\ninfrared (IR) images. The detector uses a YOLOv5 core to address challenges in\nobject detection for IR images, such as poor accuracy and a high false alarm\nrate caused by extended altitudes, poor lighting, and low image resolution. To\nimprove performance, we implemented auto anchor calculation, modified the\nconventional convolution block to ghost-convolution, adjusted the input channel\nsize, and used the AdamW optimizer. To enhance the precision of multiscale tiny\nobject recognition, we also introduced an additional extra-small object feature\nextractor and detector. Experimental results in a custom IR dataset with\nmultiple classes (birds, drones, planes, and helicopters) demonstrate that\nGAANet shows improvement compared to state-of-the-art detectors. In comparison\nto GhostNet-YOLOv5, GAANet has higher overall mean average precision (mAP@50),\nrecall, and precision around 2.5\\%, 2.3\\%, and 1.4\\%, respectively.

Finally, from the ACA CO(1-0) maps, we derive XCO.\nWe use a similar technique with 40 pc ALMA 12-m data for the three galaxies,\nbut instead derive dust attenuation at 40 pc resolution from reddening maps\nbased on VLT/MUSE data. At 250 pc resolution, XCO $\\sim$ 10^22 - 10^23 cm^-2 /\nK.km/s, 5-1000 times the Milky Way value, with much larger values than would be\nexpected from a simple metallicity dependence. Instead at 40 pc resolution, XCO\nagain shows large variation, but is roughly consistent with a power-law\nmetallicity dependence, given the Z $\\sim$ 1/3 Zsun metal abundances of our\ntargets. The large scatter in both estimations could imply additional parameter\ndependence, that we have investigated by comparing XCO with the observed\nvelocity-integrated brightness temperatures, ICO, as predicted by recent\nsimulations. Indeed, larger XCO is significantly correlated with smaller ICO,\nbut with slightly different slopes and normalizations than predicted by theory.\nSuch behavior can be attributed to the increasing fraction of CO-faint H2 gas\nwith lower spatial resolution. This confirms the idea the XCO is multi-variate,\ndepending not only on metallicity but also on CO brightness temperature and\nbeam size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 11:42:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 08:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

Operator precedence grammars,\nautomata, and logics have been investigated and used, for example, to verify\nprograms with arithmetic expressions and exceptions (both of which are\ndeterministic pushdown but lie outside the scope of the visibly pushdown\nlanguages). In this paper, we complete the picture and give, for the first\ntime, an algebraic characterization of the class of OPLs in the form of a\nsyntactic congruence that has finitely many equivalence classes exactly for the\noperator precedence languages. This is a generalization of the celebrated\nMyhill-Nerode theorem for the regular languages to OPLs. As one of the\nconsequences, we show that universality and language inclusion for\nnondeterministic operator precedence automata can be solved by an antichain\nalgorithm. Antichain algorithms avoid determinization and complementation\nthrough an explicit subset construction, by leveraging a quasi-order on words,\nwhich allows the pruning of the search space for counterexample words without\nsacrificing completeness. Antichain algorithms can be implemented symbolically,\nand these implementations are today the best-performing algorithms in practice\nfor the inclusion of finite automata. We give a generic construction of the\nquasi-order needed for antichain algorithms from a finite syntactic congruence.\nThis yields the first antichain algorithm for OPLs, an algorithm that solves\nthe \\textsc{ExpTime}-hard language inclusion problem for OPLs in exponential\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 11:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

Aiming to\nboost the computation efficiency and rendering quality of 3D scenes, a popular\nline of research maps the 3D coordinate system to another measuring system,\ne.g., 2D manifolds and hash tables, for modeling neural fields. The conversion\nof coordinate systems can be typically dubbed as gauge transformation, which is\nusually a pre-defined mapping function, e.g., orthogonal projection or spatial\nhash function. This begs a question: can we directly learn a desired gauge\ntransformation along with the neural field in an end-to-end manner? In this\nwork, we extend this problem to a general paradigm with a taxonomy of discrete\n& continuous cases, and develop an end-to-end learning framework to jointly\noptimize the gauge transformation and neural fields. To counter the problem\nthat the learning of gauge transformations can collapse easily, we derive a\ngeneral regularization mechanism from the principle of information conservation\nduring the gauge transformation. To circumvent the high computation cost in\ngauge learning with regularization, we directly derive an information-invariant\ngauge transformation which allows to preserve scene information inherently and\nyield superior performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 12:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

Various GS methods based on GANs or Flow have\nbeen developed recently. However, existing GAN-based GS methods cannot\ncompletely recover the hidden secret data due to the lack of network\ninvertibility, while Flow-based methods produce poor image quality due to the\nstringent reversibility restriction in each module. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel GS scheme called \"Generative Steganography Diffusion\" (GSD) by\ndevising an invertible diffusion model named \"StegoDiffusion\".

Many\ntasks rely on highly entangled pure states, but obtaining such states is often\nchallenging due to the presence of noise. Typically, entanglement manipulation\nprocedures involving asymptotically many copies of a state are considered to\novercome this problem. These procedures allow for distilling highly entangled\npure states from noisy states, which enables a wide range of applications, such\nas quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. When it comes to\nmanipulating entangled quantum systems on a single copy level, using entangled\nstates as catalysts can significantly broaden the range of achievable\ntransformations. Similar to the concept of catalysis in chemistry, the\nentangled catalyst is returned unchanged at the end of the state manipulation\nprocedure. Our results demonstrate that despite the apparent conceptual\ndifferences between the asymptotic and catalytic settings, they are actually\nstrongly connected and fully equivalent for all distillable states. Our methods\nrely on the analysis of many-copy entanglement manipulation procedures which\nmay establish correlations between different copies.

Due to the readily oxidizing nature of\nliquid metals, their atomization in an industrial scale system is generally\ncarried in inert atmosphere conditions. However, no previous study has\nconsidered gas-induced secondary atomization of liquid metals in inert\nconditions.

Despite its success in various\napplications, there has been a lack of systematic study on the regularization\nability of random smoothing. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by\npresenting a framework for random smoothing regularization that can adaptively\nand effectively learn a wide range of ground truth functions belonging to the\nclassical Sobolev spaces. Specifically, we investigate two underlying function\nspaces: the Sobolev space of low intrinsic dimension, which includes the\nSobolev space in $D$-dimensional Euclidean space or low-dimensional\nsub-manifolds as special cases, and the mixed smooth Sobolev space with a\ntensor structure. By using random smoothing regularization as novel\nconvolution-based smoothing kernels, we can attain optimal convergence rates in\nthese cases using a kernel gradient descent algorithm, either with early\nstopping or weight decay. It is noteworthy that our estimator can adapt to the\nstructural assumptions of the underlying data and avoid the curse of\ndimensionality. This is achieved through various choices of injected noise\ndistributions such as Gaussian, Laplace, or general polynomial noises, allowing\nfor broad adaptation to the aforementioned structural assumptions of the\nunderlying data.

In this paper we address this\nrequirement for the stochastic rotating shallow water (SRSW) model.

The noise used in [LvLCP23] was introduced as an\narbitrary random phase shift in the Fourier space. This is not necessarily\nconsistent with the uncertainty induced by a model reduction procedure.

I have identified candidate members that appear to share similar\nkinematics and ages with bona fide members compiled by Gagne et al. (2017) and\nI have assessed their membership using radial velocities and spectroscopic\ndiagnostics of age from various sources. My new catalog of adopted members\ncontains 67 Gaia sources in 55 systems. The histogram of spectral types for TWA\npeaks near M5 (~0.15 Msun), resembling the distributions measured for other\nnearby young associations. The UVW velocities of its members indicate that the\nassociation is expanding. The rate of expansion corresponds to an age of\n9.6+0.9/-0.8 Myr. In a Gaia color-magnitude diagram, the members of TWA exhibit\nwell-defined sequences of single stars and unresolved binary stars. The\ncombined sequence of low-mass stars in TWA is indicative of an age of\n11.4+1.3/-1.2 Myr when compared to the sequence for Upper Centaurus-Lupus/Lower\nCentaurus-Crux, for which an age of 20 Myr is assumed. Based on these expansion\nand isochronal ages, I have adopted an age of 10+/-2 Myr for TWA. Finally, I\nhave used mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer\nto check for excess emission from circumstellar disks among the TWA members.\nFourteen members have detected disks, all of which have been reported in\nprevious studies. The fraction of members at <=M6 (>=0.1 Msun) that have full,\ntransitional, or evolved disks is 10/52=0.19+0.08/-0.06. That value is similar\nto the fraction previously measured for the Upper Sco association, which is\nroughly coeval with TWA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 14:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

In particular,\na long-period binary measured over a small subset of its orbital period could\nmanifest via time derivatives of the spin-frequency incompatible with isolated\npulsar properties.

The emergence of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)\nresults in a mixed traffic condition, further increasing the complexity of the\ntransportation system. Against this background, this paper aims to study the\nintricate and heterogeneous interaction of vehicles and conflict resolution at\nthe high-density, mixed, unsignalized intersection. Theoretical insights about\nthe interaction between CAVs and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) and the\ncooperation of CAVs are synthesized, based on which a novel cooperative\ndecision-making framework in heterogeneous mixed traffic is proposed.\nNormalized Cooperative game is concatenated with Level-k game (NCL game) to\ngenerate a system optimal solution. Then Lattice planner generates the optimal\nand collision-free trajectories for CAVs. To reproduce HVs in mixed traffic,\ninteractions from naturalistic human driving data are extracted as prior\nknowledge. Non-cooperative game and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) are\nintegrated to mimic the decision making of heterogeneous HVs. Finally, three\ncases are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm,\nincluding the comparative analysis with different methods, the case study under\ndifferent Rates of Penetration (ROP) and the interaction analysis with\nheterogeneous HVs. It is found that the proposed cooperative decision-making\nframework is beneficial to the driving conflict resolution and the traffic\nefficiency improvement of the mixed unsignalized intersection. Besides, due to\nthe consideration of driving heterogeneity, better human-machine interaction\nand cooperation can be realized in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 14:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

Recently, deep neural networks have been exploited to\nregress the mapping between raw pixels and 3D coordinates in the scene, and\nthus the matching is implicitly performed by the forward pass through the\nnetwork. However, in a large and ambiguous environment, learning such a\nregression task directly can be difficult for a single network. In this work,\nwe present a new hierarchical scene coordinate network to predict pixel scene\ncoordinates in a coarse-to-fine manner from a single RGB image. The proposed\nmethod, which is an extension of HSCNet, allows us to train compact models\nwhich scale robustly to large environments.

While a large number of studies show that\nflux-tube codes provide an excellent approximation for turbulent transport in\nmedium-large devices, it still needs to be determined whether they are\nsufficient for modeling supra-thermal particle effects on core turbulence. This\nis called into question given the large temperature of energetic particles\n(EPs), which makes them hardly confined on a single flux-surface, but also due\nto the radially broad mode structure of energetic-particle-driven modes. The\nprimary focus of this manuscript is to assess the range of validity of\nflux-tube codes in modeling fast ion effects by comparing radially global\nturbulence simulations with flux-tube results at different radial locations for\nrealistic JET parameters using the gyrokinetic code GENE. To extend our study\nto a broad range of different plasma scenarios, this comparison is made for\nfour different plasma regimes, which differ only by the profile of the ratio\nbetween the plasma kinetic and magnetic pressure. The latter is artificially\nrescaled to address the electrostatic limit and regimes with marginally stable,\nweakly unstable and strongly unstable fast ion modes. These\nenergetic-particle-driven modes is identified as an AITG/KBAE via linear ORB5\nand LIGKA simulations. It is found that the local flux-tube simulations can\nrecover well the global results only in the electrostatic and marginally stable\ncases. When the AITG/KBAE becomes linearly unstable, the local approximation\nfails to correctly model the radially broad fast ion mode structure and the\nconsequent global zonal patterns. According to this study, global turbulence\nsimulations are likely required in regimes with linearly unstable AITG/KBAEs.\nIn conditions with different fast ion-driven modes, these results might change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 15:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

Such beam branching can be\nattributed to successive weak scatterings of the beam electrons by the unevenly\ndistributed magnetic fields induced by the local return currents in the\nskeletons of the porous medium. Results from a model for the excitation\nconditions and location of the first branching point with respect to the medium\nand beam parameters agree well with that from pore-resolved particle-in-cell\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 15:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

Overall, we conclude that\ncaps on PCMs are not just useful for stabilizing the PCM layer, but can also be\nused to tune the PCM crystallization temperature and reduce device footprint.\nMoreover, the capping layer can be exploited to enhance light-matter\ninteractions with the PCM element.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 15:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

Doping 1 at% $Mo^{5+}$ leads to\nsubstitution at the $V^{5+}$ site in $V_2O_5$ nanowires (VONW) and thereby\nreduction in Vo defects. This in turn affects the charge carrier hopping sites\nand subsequently enhances the sensor response at lower temperatures\n($<320^oC$). The $Mo^{5+}$ dopants lead to the lowering of Fermi energy (EF)\ntowards valence band maxima due to reduced $V_o$ donor density. The polaron\nsuppression is confirmed with activation energy of polaron hopping, increasing\nfrom 195 meV to 385 meV in VONW and MVONW respectively. As a result, the\nresponse to ethanol gas enhanced as the depletion width is widened for the\ngiven cross-section of the nanowires. This may lead to large depletion\ncontrolled cross-sectional area and thereby better sensitivity. At about\n$350^oC$ VONW show change in slope of resistance vs temperature (MIT) which is\nnot observed in case of MVONW.

MoMa tasks are difficult due to the large action\nspace of the robot and the common multi-objective nature of the task, e.g.,\nefficiently reaching a goal while avoiding obstacles. Current approaches often\nsegregate tasks into navigation without manipulation and stationary\nmanipulation without locomotion by manually matching parts of the action space\nto MoMa sub-objectives (e.g. base actions for locomotion objectives and arm\nactions for manipulation). This solution prevents simultaneous combinations of\nlocomotion and interaction degrees of freedom and requires human domain\nknowledge for both partitioning the action space and matching the action parts\nto the sub-objectives. In this paper, we introduce Causal MoMa, a new framework\nto train policies for typical MoMa tasks that makes use of the most favorable\nsubspace of the robot's action space to address each sub-objective. Causal MoMa\nautomatically discovers the causal dependencies between actions and terms of\nthe reward function and exploits these dependencies in a causal policy learning\nprocedure that reduces gradient variance compared to previous state-of-the-art\npolicy gradient algorithms, improving convergence and results. We evaluate the\nperformance of Causal MoMa on three types of simulated robots across different\nMoMa tasks and demonstrate success in transferring the policies trained in\nsimulation directly to a real robot, where our agent is able to follow moving\ngoals and react to dynamic obstacles while simultaneously and synergistically\ncontrolling the whole-body: base, arm, and head.

In this paper, we aim\nto illustrate to what extent European Union (EU) non-discrimination law\ncoincides with notions of algorithmic fairness proposed in computer science\nliterature and where they differ. The contributions of this paper are as\nfollows. First, we analyse seminal examples of algorithmic unfairness through\nthe lens of EU non-discrimination law, drawing parallels with EU case law.\nSecond, we set out the normative underpinnings of fairness metrics and\ntechnical interventions and compare these to the legal reasoning of the Court\nof Justice of the EU. Specifically, we show how normative assumptions often\nremain implicit in both disciplinary approaches and explain the ensuing\nlimitations of current AI practice and non-discrimination law. We conclude with\nimplications for AI practitioners and regulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 12:00:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 20:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

Even so, not many people with hearing loss use sign language, and\nthey frequently experience social isolation. Therefore, it is necessary to\ncreate human-computer interface systems that can offer hearing-impaired people\na social platform. Most commercial sign language translation systems now on the\nmarket are sensor-based, pricey, and challenging to use. Although vision-based\nsystems are desperately needed, they must first overcome several challenges.\nEarlier continuous sign language recognition techniques used hidden Markov\nmodels, which have a limited ability to include temporal information. To get\nover these restrictions, several machine learning approaches are being applied\nto transform hand and sign language motions into spoken or written language. In\nthis study, we compare various deep learning techniques for recognising sign\nlanguage. Our survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the most\nrecent approaches and challenges in this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2023 10:52:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 06:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

It presents his lifelong endeavors and reflections with\noriginal reasoning and re-interpretations of the most critical and misleading\nissues in thermodynamics; since now, we have the advantage to look at the\nhistorical developments more comprehensively and objectively than the pioneers.\nStarting from Carnot (grandfather of thermodynamics-to-be) to Kelvin and\nClausius (fathers of thermodynamics), and other followers, the most relevant\nissues are critically examined and put in historical and contemporary\nperspective. From original reasoning of energy forcing and displacement to\nlogical proofs of the fundamental laws, to ubiquity of thermal motion and heat,\nand indestructibility of entropy, including the new concept of \"thermal\nroughness\" and the inevitability of dissipative irreversibility, to \"dissecting\nCarnot true reversible-equivalency\" and critical concept of \"Carnot-Clausius\nheat-work equivalency (CCHWE)\" regarding the interchangeability of heat and\nwork, and to demonstrating \"no hope\" for the \"challengers\" of the Second Law of\nthermodynamics, among others, are offered. It is hoped that the novel\ncontributions presented will enhance comprehension and resolve some of the\nfundamental issues, as well as promote collaboration and future progress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2023 19:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}
