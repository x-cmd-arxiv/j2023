Numerous\nmethodologies have been developed over the years to detect bearing faults.\nDespite the appearance of numerous different approaches for diagnosing faults\nin motors have been proposed, vibration-based methods have become the de facto\nstandard and the most commonly used techniques. However, acquiring reliable\nvibration signals, especially from rotating machinery, can sometimes be\ninfeasibly difficult due to challenging installation and operational conditions\n(e.g., variations on accelerometer locations on the motor body), which will not\nonly alter the signal patterns significantly but may also induce severe\nartifacts. Moreover, sensors are costly and require periodic maintenance to\nsustain a reliable signal acquisition. To address these drawbacks and void the\nneed for vibration sensors, in this study, we propose a novel\nsound-to-vibration transformation method that can synthesize realistic\nvibration signals directly from the sound measurements regardless of the\nworking conditions, fault type, and fault severity. As a result, using this\ntransformation, the data acquired by a simple sound recorder, e.g., a mobile\nphone, can be transformed into the vibration signal, which can then be used for\nfault detection by a pre-trained model. The proposed method is extensively\nevaluated over the benchmark Qatar University Dual-Machine Bearing Fault\nBenchmark dataset (QU-DMBF), which encapsulates sound and vibration data from\ntwo different machines operating under various conditions.

This paper develops the first newsvendor model that incorporates\nmachine learned predictions. The paper considers a repeated newsvendor setting\nwith nonstationary demand.

The support surface is\ncommonly estimated based on exteroceptive depth measurements, e.g., from\nLiDARs. However, the measured depth fails to align with the true support\nsurface in the presence of high grass or other penetrable vegetation. In this\nwork, we present the Semantic Pointcloud Filter (SPF), a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) that learns to adjust LiDAR measurements to align with the\nunderlying support surface. The SPF is trained in a semi-self-supervised manner\nand takes as an input a LiDAR pointcloud and RGB image. The network predicts a\nbinary segmentation mask that identifies the specific points requiring\nadjustment, along with estimating their corresponding depth values. To train\nthe segmentation task, 300 distinct images are manually labeled into rigid and\nnon-rigid terrain.

Traditionally, a DNN is built by\nsolving a non-convex optimization problem. It is often challenging to solve\nsuch a problem numerically due to its non-convexity and having a large number\nof layers. To address this challenge, inspired by the human education system,\nthe multi-grade deep learning (MGDL) model was recently initiated by the author\nof this paper. The MGDL model learns a DNN in several grades, in each of which\none constructs a shallow DNN consisting of a small number of layers. The MGDL\nmodel still requires solving several non-convex optimization problems. The\nproposed SAL model mutates from the MGDL model. Noting that each layer of a DNN\nconsists of an affine map followed by an activation function, we propose to\nlearn the affine map by solving a quadratic/convex optimization problem which\ninvolves the activation function only {\\it after} the weight matrix and the\nbias vector for the current layer have been trained. In the context of function\napproximation, for a given function the SAL model generates an orthogonal\nexpansion of the function with adaptive basis functions in the form of DNNs. We\nestablish the Pythagorean identity and the Parseval identity for the orthogonal\nsystem generated by the SAL model. Moreover, we provide a convergence theorem\nof the SAL process in the sense that either it terminates after a finite number\nof grades or the norms of its optimal error functions strictly decrease to a\nlimit as the grade number increases to infinity. Furthermore, we present\nnumerical examples of proof of concept which demonstrate that the proposed SAL\nmodel significantly outperforms the traditional deep learning model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 20:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

However, the data variability between inter-session and\ninter-subject scenarios presents a great challenge. The existing approaches\nemployed very large and complex deep ConvNet or 2SRNN-based domain adaptation\nmethods to approximate the distribution shift caused by these inter-session and\ninter-subject data variability. Hence, these methods also require learning over\nmillions of training parameters and a large pre-trained and target domain\ndataset in both the pre-training and adaptation stages. As a result, it makes\nhigh-end resource-bounded and computationally very expensive for deployment in\nreal-time applications. To overcome this problem, we propose a lightweight\nAll-ConvNet+TL model that leverages lightweight All-ConvNet and transfer\nlearning (TL) for the enhancement of inter-session and inter-subject gesture\nrecognition performance. The All-ConvNet+TL model consists solely of\nconvolutional layers, a simple yet efficient framework for learning invariant\nand discriminative representations to address the distribution shifts caused by\ninter-session and inter-subject data variability. Experiments on four datasets\ndemonstrate that our proposed methods outperform the most complex existing\napproaches by a large margin and achieve state-of-the-art results on\ninter-session and inter-subject scenarios and perform on par or competitively\non intra-session gesture recognition. These performance gaps increase even more\nwhen a tiny amount (e.g., a single trial) of data is available on the target\ndomain for adaptation. These outstanding experimental results provide evidence\nthat the current state-of-the-art models may be overparameterized for\nsEMG-based inter-session and inter-subject gesture recognition tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 May 2023 21:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

These aircraft can fly in\ncalm conditions but avoid operations in gusty environments, which are seen in\nurban canyons, over mountainous terrains, and in ship wakes. Smaller aircraft\nare especially prone to such gust disturbances. With extreme weather becoming\never more frequent due to global warming, it is anticipated that aircraft,\nespecially those that are smaller in size, encounter large-scale atmospheric\ndisturbances and still be expected to manage stable flight. However, there\nexists virtually no foundation to describe the influence of extreme vortical\ngusts on flying bodies. To compound on this difficult problem, there is an\nenormous parameter space for gusty conditions wings encounter. While the\ninteraction between the vortical gusts and wings is seemingly complex and\ndifferent for each combination of gust parameters, we show in this study that\nthe fundamental physics behind extreme aerodynamics is far simpler and low-rank\nthan traditionally expected. It is revealed that the nonlinear vortical flow\nfield over time and parameter space can be compressed to only three variables\nwith a lift-augmented autoencoder while holding the essence of the original\nhigh-dimensional physics. Extreme aerodynamic flows can be optimally compressed\nthrough machine learning into a low-dimensional manifold, implying that the\nidentification of appropriate coordinates facilitates analyses, modeling, and\ncontrol of extremely unsteady gusty flows.

However, current security research in communication systems\nfocuses on specific aspects of security challenges and lacks a holistic\nperspective. To address this challenge, a novel systematic fuzzing approach is\nproposed to reveal, detect, and predict vulnerabilities with and without prior\nknowledge assumptions from attackers. It also serves as a digital twin platform\nfor system testing and defense simulation pipeline. Three fuzzing strategies\nare proposed: Listen-and-Learn (LAL), Synchronize-and-Learn (SyAL), and\nSource-and-Learn (SoAL). The LAL strategy is a black-box fuzzing strategy used\nto discover vulnerabilities without prior protocol knowledge, while the SyAL\nstrategy, also a black-box fuzzing method, targets vulnerabilities more\naccurately with attacker-accessible user information and a novel\nprobability-based fuzzing approach. The white-box fuzzing strategy, SoAL, is\nthen employed to identify and explain vulnerabilities through fuzzing of\nsignificant bits. Using the srsRAN 5G platform, the LAL strategy identifies 129\nRRC connection vulnerabilities with an average detection duration of 0.072s.\nLeveraging the probability-based fuzzing algorithm, the SyAL strategy\noutperforms existing models in precision and recall, using significantly fewer\nfuzzing cases. SoAL detects three man-in-the-middle vulnerabilities stemming\nfrom 5G protocol vulnerabilities. The proposed solution is scalable to other\nopen-source and commercial 5G platforms and protocols beyond RRC. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution is an efficient and\nefficient approach to validate 5G security; meanwhile, it serves as real-time\nvulnerability detection and proactive defense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2023 01:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

In\nparticular, we study how pose can be estimated from force and tactile data\narising from contact. Using data derived from contact is challenging because it\nis inherently less information-dense than visual data, and thus the pose\nestimation problem is severely under-constrained when there are few contacts.\nRather than attempting to estimate the true pose of the object, which is not\ntractable without a large number of contacts, we seek to estimate a plausible\nset of poses which obey the constraints imposed by the sensor data. Existing\nmethods struggle to estimate this set because they are either designed for\nsingle pose estimates or require informative priors to be effective. Our\napproach to this problem, Constrained pose Hypothesis Set Elimination (CHSEL),\nhas three key attributes: 1) It considers volumetric information, which allows\nus to account for known free space; 2) It uses a novel differentiable\nvolumetric cost function to take advantage of powerful gradient-based\noptimization tools; and 3) It uses methods from the Quality Diversity (QD)\noptimization literature to produce a diverse set of high-quality poses.

In this paper, we describe BBT-RGB, a suite of straightforward and\ncomplementary techniques for enhancing the efficiency and performance of\nblack-box optimization. Specifically, our method includes three plug-and-play\ncomponents: (1) Two-stage derivative-free optimization strategy that\nfacilitates fast convergence and mitigates overfitting; (2) Automatic\nverbalizer construction with its novel usage under few-shot settings; (3)\nBetter prompt initialization policy based on instruction search and\nauto-selected demonstration. Extensive experiments across various tasks on\nnatural language understanding and inference demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method.

These factors make\nthe optimization to be non-convex and hard to solve traditionally. Genetic\nalgorithm (GA) is typically used extensively to tackle such optimization in\nseveral application domains because it does not involve differential\ncalculation or gradient evaluation in its solution estimation. However, the\nsize of the search space in which the GA searches for the optimal control\ninputs is crucial for the applicability of the GA with systems that require\nfast response. This paper proposes an approach to accelerate the genetic\noptimization of NMPC by learning optimal search space size. The proposed\napproach trains a multivariate regression model to adaptively predict the best\nsmallest search space in every control cycle. The estimated best smallest size\nof search space is fed to the GA to allow for searching the optimal control\ninputs within this search space. The proposed approach not only reduces the\nGA's computational time but also improves the chance of obtaining the optimal\ncontrol inputs in each cycle. The proposed approach was evaluated on two\nnonlinear systems and compared with two other genetic-based NMPC approaches\nimplemented on the GPU of a Nvidia Jetson TX2 embedded platform in a\nprocessor-in-the-loop (PIL) fashion.

Several Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) algorithms have\nbeen developed to improve QoE, but most of them are designed based on fixed\nrules and unsuitable for a wide range of network conditions. Recently, Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) based Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)\nmethods have recently demonstrated promise in their ability to generalise to\ndiverse network conditions, but they still have limitations. One specific issue\nwith A3C methods is the lag between each actor's behavior policy and central\nlearner's target policy.

After motivating our\nanalysis, we propose the formal problem of communicating concepts, and provide\nits rate-distortion characterization, pointing out its connection with the\nconcepts of empirical and strong coordination in a network.

We propose\nprocedures for designing spiral sweeping protocols that ensure the successful\ncompletion of the task, thus deriving conditions on the sweeping speed of the\nlinear formation and its path. Successful completion of the task implies that\nevaders with a given limit on their speed cannot escape the sweeping agents. A\nsimpler task for the sweeping formation is the confinement of evaders to a\ndesired region, such as their original domain. The feasibility of completing\nthese tasks depends on geometric and dynamic constraints that impose a lower\nbound on the speed that the sweeping agents must have. This critical speed is\nderived to ensure the satisfaction of the confinement task. Increasing the\nspeed above the lower bound enables the sweepers to complete the search task as\nwell.

The experiment results demonstrate the great potential of the LLM\nto do text understanding and matching and, meanwhile, reveal the necessity of a\nbetter mechanism of interaction feedback and exploration. Several new\ndiscussions are conducted as well. A demo video is available at\nhttps://youtu.be/gKV6KZYwxGY. The code repository is available at\nhttps://github.com/X-LANCE/Mobile-Env. The proposed WikiHow task set is made\npublic at https://huggingface.co/datasets/zdy023/WikiHow-taskset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2023 12:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

One\ninstability is the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability (GSF), which is the\nlocal version of the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) and the other is a\nthermal overstability, the Convective Overstability (COS).\n  In the present paper we reproduce the analytic predicted growth rates for\nboth instabilities in numerical experiments of small axisymmetric sections of\nvertically isothermal disks with a radial temperature gradient, especially for\ncooling times longer than the critical cooling time for VSI. In this cooling\ntime regime our simulations reveal the simultaneous and independent growth of\nboth modes: COS and GSF. We consistently observe that GSF modes exhibit a\nfaster growth rate compared to COS modes. Near the midplane, GSF modes\neventually stop growing, while COS modes continue to grow and ultimately\ndominate the flow pattern.\n  Away from the midplane, we find GSF modes to saturate, when bands of constant\nangular momentum have formed. In these bands we observe the formation and\ngrowth of eddies driven by the baroclinic term, further enhancing the velocity\nperturbations. In geophysics this effect is known as horizontal convection or\nsea-breeze instability. Three-dimensional simulations will have to show whether\nsimilar effects will occur when axisymmetry is not enforced. Our local\nsimulations help to reveal the numerical resolution requirements to observe\nthermal instabilities in global simulations of disks around young stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2023 14:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

Using the flexibility of constructing a neural network, we\nuse an augmented network by defining an auxiliary output to represent the\ngradient of the SDF. There are three advantages of the augmented network; (i)\nthe target interface is accurately captured, (ii) the gradient has a unit norm,\nand (iii) two outputs are approximated by a single network. Moreover, unlike a\nconventional loss term which uses a residual of the eikonal equation, a novel\ntraining objective consisting of three loss terms is designed. The first loss\nfunction enforces a pointwise matching between two outputs of the augmented\nnetwork.

An\ninteresting observation is that when two theories are related by dimensional\nreduction on a compact surface, their 't Hooft anomalies corresponding to\ncontinuous symmetries are also related: the anomaly polynomial of the\nlower-dimensional theory can be obtained by integrating that of the\nhigher-dimensional one on the compact surface. Naturally, this relation only\nholds if both theories are even dimensional. This raises the question of\nwhether similar relations can also hold for the case of anomalies in discrete\nsymmetries, which might be true even in odd dimensions. The natural\ngeneralization to discrete symmetries is that the anomaly theories, associated\nwith the lower and higher dimensional theories, would be related by reduction\non the compact surface. We explore this idea for compactifications of 5d\nsuperconformal field theories (SCFTs) to 3d on Riemann surfaces with\nglobal-symmetry fluxes. In this context, it can be used both as a check for\nthese compactification constructions and for discovering new anomalies in the\n5d SCFTs.

Thus, detecting generated text is crucial. However, passive\ndetection methods are stuck in domain specificity and limited adversarial\nrobustness. To achieve reliable detection, a watermark-based method was\nproposed for white-box LLMs, allowing them to embed watermarks during text\ngeneration. The method involves randomly dividing the model vocabulary to\nobtain a special list and adjusting the probability distribution to promote the\nselection of words in the list. A detection algorithm aware of the list can\nidentify the watermarked text. However, this method is not applicable in many\nreal-world scenarios where only black-box language models are available. For\ninstance, third-parties that develop API-based vertical applications cannot\nwatermark text themselves because API providers only supply generated text and\nwithhold probability distributions to shield their commercial interests. To\nallow third-parties to autonomously inject watermarks into generated text, we\ndevelop a watermarking framework for black-box language model usage scenarios.\nSpecifically, we first define a binary encoding function to compute a random\nbinary encoding corresponding to a word. The encodings computed for\nnon-watermarked text conform to a Bernoulli distribution, wherein the\nprobability of a word representing bit-1 being approximately 0.5. To inject a\nwatermark, we alter the distribution by selectively replacing words\nrepresenting bit-0 with context-based synonyms that represent bit-1. A\nstatistical test is then used to identify the watermark. Experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both Chinese and English\ndatasets. Furthermore, results under re-translation, polishing, word deletion,\nand synonym substitution attacks reveal that it is arduous to remove the\nwatermark without compromising the original semantics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2023 07:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}
