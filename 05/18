However, with the growth of model scale and the rising number of\ndownstream tasks, this paradigm inevitably meets the challenges in terms of\ncomputation consumption and memory footprint issues. Recently,\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) (e.g., Adapter, LoRA, BitFit) shows a\npromising paradigm to alleviate these concerns by updating only a portion of\nparameters. Despite these PEFTs having demonstrated satisfactory performance in\nnatural language processing, it remains under-explored for the question of\nwhether these techniques could be transferred to graph-based tasks with Graph\nTransformer Networks (GTNs). Therefore, in this paper, we fill this gap by\nproviding extensive benchmarks with traditional PEFTs on a range of graph-based\ndownstream tasks. Our empirical study shows that it is sub-optimal to directly\ntransfer existing PEFTs to graph-based tasks due to the issue of feature\ndistribution shift.

We\nforecast that with upcoming data from the HELIX balloon experiment, the\nsignificance could increase to $6.8 \\sigma$. Adopting a coarse-graining\napproach, we find that such a strong suppression could be realised if the\nfilling fraction of low-diffusion zones in the disk was $\\sim 66 \\, \\%$. We\nconclude that the impact of regions of suppressed diffusion might be larger\nthan usually assumed and ought to be taken into account in models of Galactic\ncosmic ray transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 16:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

The basic idea is to model\nrigid motions as finite-order polynomials and then attacks the involved\nnavigation problems by optimally solving their coefficients, taking into\nconsiderations the constraints posed by inertial sensors and others. In the\ncurrent paper, a continuous-time attitude estimation approach is proposed,\nwhich transforms the attitude estimation into a constant parameter\ndetermination problem by the polynomial optimization.

Due to the extremely low mass of the constituent\nparticle ($\\sim 10^{-22}$ eV), ULDM can exhibit quantum effects up to\nkiloparsec scales. In particular, runaway collapse in the centres of ULDM halos\nis prevented by quantum pressure, providing a possible resolution to the\n'core-cusp problem' of CDM. However, the the detailed relationship between the\nULDM core mass and that of the overall halo is poorly understood. We simulate\nthe collapse of both spherical and aspherical isolated ULDM overdensities using\nAxioNyx, finding that the central cores of collapsed halos undergo sustained\noscillatory behaviour which affects both their peak density and overall\nmorphology. The variability in core morphology increases with the asphericity\nof the initial overdensity and remnants of initial asphericity persist long\nafter collapse. Furthermore, the peak central densities are higher in spherical\nconfigurations. Consequently, astrophysically realistic halos may exhibit\nsubstantial departures from theoretical core-halo profiles and we would expect\na significant variance of the properties of halos with the same mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 16:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Lattice based\ncryptography is a novel approach to public key cryptography, of which the\nmathematical investigation (so far) resists attacks from quantum computers. By\nchoosing a module learning with errors (MLWE) algorithm as the next standard,\nNational Institute of Standard & Technology (NIST) follows this approach. The\nmultiplication of polynomials is the central bottleneck in the computation of\nlattice based cryptography. Because public key cryptography is mostly used to\nestablish common secret keys, focus is on compact area, power and energy budget\nand to a lesser extent on throughput or latency. While most other work focuses\non optimizing number theoretic transform (NTT) based multiplications, in this\npaper we highly optimize a Toom-Cook based multiplier. We demonstrate that a\nmemory-efficient striding Toom-Cook with lazy interpolation, results in a\nhighly compact, low power implementation, which on top enables a very regular\nmemory access scheme. To demonstrate the efficiency, we integrate this\nmultiplier into a Saber post-quantum accelerator, one of the four NIST\nfinalists.

The weak line bundle\nensemble of dislocations is defined, whereby the treatment of dislocations by a\nvector density is justified. It is then found by direct averaging of the\ndislocation transport equation that additional driving forces arise which are\ndependent on the dislocation correlation. A combination of spatial\ncoarse-graining and statistical averaging of discrete dislocation systems are\nused to evaluate the various classes of tensorial dislocation correlations\nwhich arise in the line bundle kinetic theory. A novel, chiral classification\nof slip system interactions in FCC crystals is used to define proper and\nimproper rotations by which correlation functions corresponding to six\ninteraction classifications can be evaluated. The full set of these six\ndislocation correlations are evaluated from discrete data. Only the\nself-correlations (for densities of like slip system) are found to be highly\nanisotropic.

PaLM 2 is a Transformer-based model trained using a mixture\nof objectives. Through extensive evaluations on English and multilingual\nlanguage, and reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that PaLM 2 has significantly\nimproved quality on downstream tasks across different model sizes, while\nsimultaneously exhibiting faster and more efficient inference compared to PaLM.\nThis improved efficiency enables broader deployment while also allowing the\nmodel to respond faster, for a more natural pace of interaction. PaLM 2\ndemonstrates robust reasoning capabilities exemplified by large improvements\nover PaLM on BIG-Bench and other reasoning tasks. PaLM 2 exhibits stable\nperformance on a suite of responsible AI evaluations, and enables\ninference-time control over toxicity without additional overhead or impact on\nother capabilities. Overall, PaLM 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross a diverse set of tasks and capabilities.\n  When discussing the PaLM 2 family, it is important to distinguish between\npre-trained models (of various sizes), fine-tuned variants of these models, and\nthe user-facing products that use these models. In particular, user-facing\nproducts typically include additional pre- and post-processing steps.\nAdditionally, the underlying models may evolve over time. Therefore, one should\nnot expect the performance of user-facing products to exactly match the results\nreported in this report.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 17:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

When facing unseen task conditions or\nwhen new task requirements arise, robots must adapt their motion policies\naccordingly. In this context, policy optimization is the \\emph{de facto}\nparadigm to adapt robot policies as a function of task-specific objectives.\nMost commonly-used motion policies carry particular structures that are often\noverlooked in policy optimization algorithms. We instead propose to leverage\nthe structure of probabilistic policies by casting the policy optimization as\nan optimal transport problem. Specifically, we focus on robot motion policies\nthat build on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and formulate the policy\noptimization as a Wassertein gradient flow over the GMMs space. This naturally\nallows us to constrain the policy updates via the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance\nbetween GMMs to enhance the stability of the policy optimization process.\nFurthermore, we leverage the geometry of the Bures-Wasserstein manifold to\noptimize the Gaussian distributions of the GMM policy via Riemannian\noptimization. We evaluate our approach on common robotic settings: Reaching\nmotions, collision-avoidance behaviors, and multi-goal tasks. Our results show\nthat our method outperforms common policy optimization baselines in terms of\ntask success rate and low-variance solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 17:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-18"}

Altermagnetism, classified as a third basic\ncollinear magnetic phase, gives rise to intriguing momentum-dependent\nspin-splitting of the band structure, and results in an even number of\nspin-polarized Fermi surfaces due to the symmetry-enforced zero net\nmagnetization. In this work, we investigate the effect of this new magnetic\norder on the superconductivity of a two-dimensional metal with $d$-wave\naltermagnetism and Rashba spin-orbital coupling. Specifically we determine the\ntypes of superconducting pairing that can occur in this system and ascertain\nwhether they possess topological properties. Through self-consistent mean-field\ncalculations, we find that the system in general favors a mixture of\nspin-singlet $s$-wave and spin-triplet $p$-wave pairings, due to the absence of\ntime-reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry.

The optimal\nscenario to obtain a redshift is through the direct identification of an\nelectromagnetic (EM) counterpart and its host galaxy. With almost 100 GW\nsources detected without EM counterparts (dark sirens), it is becoming crucial\nto have statistical techniques able to perform cosmological studies in the\nabsence of EM emission. Currently, only two techniques for dark sirens are used\non GW observations: the spectral siren method, which is based on the\nsource-frame mass distribution to estimate conjointly cosmology and the\nsource's merger rate, and the galaxy survey method, which uses galaxy surveys\nto assign a probabilistic redshift to the source while fitting cosmology.

The detectors\nhave been almost completely renewed to allow running at an instantaneous\nluminosity five times larger than that of the previous running periods. Readout\nof all detectors into an all-software trigger is central to the new design,\nfacilitating the reconstruction of events at the maximum LHC interaction rate,\nand their selection in real time. The experiment's tracking system has been\ncompletely upgraded with a new pixel vertex detector, a silicon tracker\nupstream of the dipole magnet and three scintillating fibre tracking stations\ndownstream of the magnet. The whole photon detection system of the RICH\ndetectors has been renewed and the readout electronics of the calorimeter and\nmuon systems have been fully overhauled. The first stage of the all-software\ntrigger is implemented on a GPU farm. The output of the trigger provides a\ncombination of totally reconstructed physics objects, such as tracks and\nvertices, ready for final analysis, and of entire events which need further\noffline reprocessing. This scheme required a complete revision of the computing\nmodel and rewriting of the experiment's software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 18:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

We utilize a seeing sorted stacking\nmethod along with night-to-night relative transparency corrections to create\noptimal depth and optimal resolution mosaics in the U-band, which are capable\nof reaching point source magnitudes of AB 26.5 mag at 3 sigma. These ground\nbased mosaics bridge the wavelength gap between the HST WFC3 F27W and ACS F435W\nimages and are necessary to understand galaxy assembly in the last 9-10 Gyr. We\nuse the depth of these mosaics to search for the presence of U-band intragroup\nlight (IGrL) beyond the local Universe. Regardless of how groups are scaled and\nstacked, we do not detect any U-band IGrL to unprecedented U-band depths of\n29.1-29.6 mag/arcsec2, which corresponds to an IGrL fraction of less than 1% of\nthe total group light. This stringent upper limit suggests that IGrL does not\ncontribute significantly to the Extragalactic Background Light at short\nwavelengths. Furthermore, the lack of UV IGrL observed in these stacks suggests\nthat the atomic gas observed in the intragroup medium (IGrM) is likely not\ndense enough to trigger star formation on large scales. Future studies may\ndetect IGrL by creating similar stacks at longer wavelengths or by\npre-selecting groups which are older and/or more dynamically evolved similar to\npast IGrL observations of compact groups and loose groups with signs of\ngravitational interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 18:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Despite their success, it is still\nchallenging to disentangle the benefits of large-scale datasets and Transformer\nstructures from the limitations of the pre-training. In this paper, we\nintroduce a hierarchical training approach, named self-pretraining, in which\nTransformer models are pretrained and finetuned on the same dataset. Three\npre-trained models including HuBERT, Conformer and WavLM are evaluated on four\ndifferent speaker verification datasets with varying sizes.

These embedding\nmethods require that all test entities are observed at training time, resulting\nin a time-consuming retraining process for out-of-knowledge-graph (OOKG)\nentities. To address this issue, current inductive knowledge embedding methods\nemploy graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent unseen entities by aggregating\ninformation of known neighbors. They face three important challenges: (i) data\nsparsity, (ii) the presence of complex patterns in knowledge graphs (e.g.,\ninter-rule correlations), and (iii) the presence of interactions among rule\nmining, rule inference, and embedding. In this paper, we propose a virtual\nneighbor network with inter-rule correlations (VNC) that consists of three\nstages: (i) rule mining, (ii) rule inference, and (iii) embedding. In the rule\nmining process, to identify complex patterns in knowledge graphs, both logic\nrules and inter-rule correlations are extracted from knowledge graphs based on\noperations over relation embeddings. To reduce data sparsity, virtual neighbors\nfor OOKG entities are predicted and assigned soft labels by optimizing a\nrule-constrained problem.

As initially pointed out by Kohn,\nGalilean invariance for a homogeneous quantum Hall system implies that the\nelectronic center of mass (CM) decouples from the electron-electron\ninteraction, and the energy of the CM mode, also known as Kohn mode, is equal\nto the single particle cyclotron transition. In this work, we point out that\nstrong light-matter hybridization between the Kohn mode and the cavity photons\ngives rise to collective hybrid modes between the Landau levels and the\nphotons. We provide the exact solution for the collective Landau polaritons and\nwe demonstrate the weakening of topological protection at zero temperature due\nto the existence of the lower polariton mode which is softer than the Kohn\nmode. This provides an intrinsic mechanism for the recently observed\ntopological breakdown of the quantum Hall effect in a cavity [Appugliese et\nal., Science 375, 1030-1034 (2022)].

Hence, precise load forecasts become more\nand more important for effective grid management. Novel modeling approaches\nsuch as the Transformer architecture, in particular the Temporal Fusion\nTransformer (TFT), have emerged as promising methods for time series\nforecasting. To date, just a handful of studies apply TFTs to electricity load\nforecasting problems, mostly considering only single datasets and a few\ncovariates. Therefore, we examine the potential of the TFT architecture for\nhourly short-term load forecasting across different time horizons (day-ahead\nand week-ahead) and network levels (grid and substation level). We find that\nthe TFT architecture does not offer higher predictive performance than a\nstate-of-the-art LSTM model for day-ahead forecasting on the entire grid.\nHowever, the results display significant improvements for the TFT when applied\nat the substation level with a subsequent aggregation to the upper grid-level,\nresulting in a prediction error of 2.43% (MAPE) for the best-performing\nscenario. In addition, the TFT appears to offer remarkable improvements over\nthe LSTM approach for week-ahead forecasting (yielding a predictive error of\n2.52% (MAPE) at the lowest). We outline avenues for future research using the\nTFT approach for load forecasting, including the exploration of various grid\nlevels (e.g., grid, substation, and household level).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 20:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

These classifiers are becoming increasingly\npopular in high-stake decision-making problems, as they can withhold uncertain\npredictions to improve their reliability and safety. When evaluating black-box\nabstaining classifier(s), however, we lack a principled approach that accounts\nfor what the classifier would have predicted on its abstentions. These missing\npredictions are crucial when, e.g., a radiologist is unsure of their diagnosis\nor when a driver is inattentive in a self-driving car. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel approach and perspective to the problem of evaluating and\ncomparing abstaining classifiers by treating abstentions as missing data. Our\nevaluation approach is centered around defining the counterfactual score of an\nabstaining classifier, defined as the expected performance of the classifier\nhad it not been allowed to abstain. We specify the conditions under which the\ncounterfactual score is identifiable: if the abstentions are stochastic, and if\nthe evaluation data is independent of the training data (ensuring that the\npredictions are missing at random), then the score is identifiable. Note that,\nif abstentions are deterministic, then the score is unidentifiable because the\nclassifier can perform arbitrarily poorly on its abstentions. Leveraging tools\nfrom observational causal inference, we then develop nonparametric and doubly\nrobust methods to efficiently estimate this quantity under identification.

In core helium burning giants with masses below about 1.7 solar\nmasses, i.e. stars that have gone through a helium flash, the asymptotic period\nspacings take values of about 220 -350 s at frequency of maximum oscillation\npower of $\\sim$30-50 $\\mu$Hz.

Our result\ninterpolates between the criterion $b(G,P)\\leq t/4$ and the old and frequently\napplied theorem that if $\\Delta(G)\\leq t/2$ then an IT exists. Using the same\napproach, we also extend a theorem of Aharoni, Holzman, Howard and Spr\\\"ussel,\nby giving a stability version of the latter result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2023 22:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

To\ntransparently accelerate applications using POSIX socket interfaces without\nmodifications, we integrate TSoR with a container runtime that can intercept\nsystem calls for socket interfaces. To be compatible with orchestration systems\nlike Kubernetes, TSoR implements a container network following the Kubernetes\nnetwork model and satisfies all requirements of the model.

In this\npaper, we propose a new paradigm of enhancing LMs by finetuning them with world\nmodels, to gain diverse embodied knowledge while retaining their general\nlanguage capabilities. Our approach deploys an embodied agent in a world model,\nparticularly a simulator of the physical world (VirtualHome), and acquires a\ndiverse set of embodied experiences through both goal-oriented planning and\nrandom exploration. These experiences are then used to finetune LMs to teach\ndiverse abilities of reasoning and acting in the physical world, e.g., planning\nand completing goals, object permanence and tracking, etc. Moreover, it is\ndesirable to preserve the generality of LMs during finetuning, which\nfacilitates generalizing the embodied knowledge across tasks rather than being\ntied to specific simulations.

However,\nthe terahertz band offers a wide bandwidth resource, which has great advantages\nin high longitudinal resolution detection, high-capacity communication,\nspectral imaging and so on. Here, we propose and demonstrate an ultrawideband\nterahertz phase shifting mechanism that utilizes an optical conductivity\ntuneable interface combined with a non-resonant metasurface operating in the\ntotal internal reflection geometry. This approach effectively modulates the\nphase of the reflected terahertz signal in an ultrawideband. To implement this\nmechanism, we designed a structure consisting of graphene-loaded non-resonant\nperiodic metal microslits arranged in the total internal reflection geometry.\nBy controlling the gate voltage of the graphene within a range of 5 V, an\naveraged ~120{\\deg} continuous phase shift in the frequency range of 0.4 to 1.2\nTHz was achieved. Notably, in the frequency range of 1 to 1.2 THz, the phase\nmodulation exhibited a linear relationship with the driving voltage. Our device\ndemonstrated minimal fluctuations in the reflected amplitude, with a deviation\nof less than 1 dB and an insertion loss of less than 10 dB. Additionally, the\nmodulation speed of this solid-state device reached the kHz level. Remarkably,\nthe phase modulation bandwidth ({\\Delta}f/f) achieved approximately 100% of the\narithmetic centre frequency at 0.8 THz, surpassing the definition of\nultrawideband, which typically encompasses 20% of the centre frequency. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first and most wideband phase shifter\ndeveloped for the terahertz regime to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 01:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Note that\nsuch a key issue is not identified by existing deep learning-based shadow\nremoval methods. To address this problem, we propose to handle these two tasks\nseparately and leverage the identical mapping results to guide the shadow\nrestoration in an iterative manner. Specifically, our method consists of three\ncomponents: an identical mapping branch (IMB) for non-shadow regions\nprocessing, an iterative de-shadow branch (IDB) for shadow regions restoration\nbased on identical results, and a smart aggregation block (SAB). The IMB aims\nto reconstruct an image that is identical to the input one, which can benefit\nthe restoration of the non-shadow regions without explicitly distinguishing\nbetween shadow and non-shadow regions. Utilizing the multi-scale features\nextracted by the IMB, the IDB can effectively transfer information from\nnon-shadow regions to shadow regions progressively, facilitating the process of\nshadow removal. The SAB is designed to adaptive integrate features from both\nIMB and IDB. Moreover, it generates a finely tuned soft shadow mask that guides\nthe process of removing shadows.

In this paper, we introduce DeepEdit, a deep learning-based method\nfor volumetric medical image annotation, that allows automatic and\nsemi-automatic segmentation, and click-based refinement. DeepEdit combines the\npower of two methods: a non-interactive (i.e. automatic segmentation using\nnnU-Net, UNET or UNETR) and an interactive segmentation method (i.e. DeepGrow),\ninto a single deep learning model. It allows easy integration of\nuncertainty-based ranking strategies (i.e. aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty\ncomputation) and active learning. We propose and implement a method for\ntraining DeepEdit by using standard training combined with user interaction\nsimulation. Once trained, DeepEdit allows clinicians to quickly segment their\ndatasets by using the algorithm in auto segmentation mode or by providing\nclicks via a user interface (i.e. 3D Slicer, OHIF). We show the value of\nDeepEdit through evaluation on the PROSTATEx dataset for prostate/prostatic\nlesions and the Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault (BTCV) dataset\nfor abdominal CT segmentation, using state-of-the-art network architectures as\nbaseline for comparison.

However, the iterative denoising process is expensive in\ncomputations at inference time, making diffusion models less practical for\nlow-latency and scalable real-world applications. Post-training quantization of\ndiffusion models can significantly reduce the model size and accelerate the\nsampling process without requiring any re-training. Nonetheless, applying\nexisting post-training quantization methods directly to low-bit diffusion\nmodels can significantly impair the quality of generated samples. Specifically,\nfor each denoising step, quantization noise leads to deviations in the\nestimated mean and mismatches with the predetermined variance schedule.\nMoreover, as the sampling process proceeds, the quantization noise may\naccumulate, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in late denoising\nsteps. To address these challenges, we propose a unified formulation for the\nquantization noise and diffusion perturbed noise in the quantized denoising\nprocess. We first disentangle the quantization noise into its correlated and\nresidual uncorrelated parts regarding its full-precision counterpart. The\ncorrelated part can be easily corrected by estimating the correlation\ncoefficient. For the uncorrelated part, we calibrate the denoising variance\nschedule to absorb the excess variance resulting from quantization. Moreover,\nwe propose a mixed-precision scheme to choose the optimal bitwidth for each\ndenoising step, which prefers low bits to accelerate the early denoising steps\nwhile high bits maintain the high SNR for the late steps. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms previous post-training quantized\ndiffusion models in generating high-quality samples, with only a 0.06 increase\nin FID score compared to full-precision LDM-4 on ImageNet 256x256, while saving\n19.9x bit operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 02:28:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2023 02:21:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2023 01:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

The intensities of the pressure and the acoustic\nmodes of density and temperature attain the maximum values near the wall, while\nthose of the entropy and the entropic modes of density and temperature achieve\ntheir primary peaks near the edge of boundary layer. In the near-wall region,\nthe pressure and the acoustic modes of density and temperature are\nsignificantly enhanced when the wall is strongly cooled, which can be\nattributed to the appearance of the travelling-wave-like alternating positive\nand negative structures. Moreover, the intensities of the entropy and the\nentropic modes of density and temperature become stronger near the wall as the\nwall temperature decreases, due to the appearance of the streaky entropic\nstructures. The streaky entropic structures are mainly caused by the advection\neffect of the strong positive wall-normal gradient of the mean temperature\nassociated with ejection and sweep events. {It is also found that the profiles\nof the intensities of the entropy, density and temperature are similar to each\nother far from the wall, which are mainly due to the reason that the entropic\nmodes are dominant in the fluctuating density and temperature in the far-wall\nregion.

Application of this technique to the high-Tc cuprate\nsuperconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\\delta} revealed a high-fidelity local lattice\ndistortion of the BiO lattice as large as 2%. In addition, analysis of local\nbreaking of rotational symmetry associated with the bond lengths reveals\nmodulations around four-unit-cell periodicity in both B1 and E representations\nin the C4v group of the lattice, which coincides with the uni-directional\nd-symmetry CDW (dCDW) previously identified within the CuO2 planes, thus\nproviding direct evidence of electron-lattice coupling in the pseudogap state\nand a link between the X-ray scattering and STM measurements. Overall, our\nresults suggest that the periodic lattice displacements in E representations\ncorrespond to a locally-frozen version of the soft phonons identified by the\nX-ray scattering measurements, and a fluctuation of the bond length is\nreflected by the fluctuation of the dCDW formation near the quantum critical\npoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 04:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

To reduce their gaps, one can directly distill knowledge from\na well-designed teacher GNN to a student MLP, which is termed as GNN-to-MLP\ndistillation. However, the process of distillation usually entails a loss of\ninformation, and ``which knowledge patterns of GNNs are more likely to be left\nand distilled into MLPs?\" becomes an important question. In this paper, we\nfirst factorize the knowledge learned by GNNs into low- and high-frequency\ncomponents in the spectral domain and then derive their correspondence in the\nspatial domain. Furthermore, we identified a potential information drowning\nproblem for existing GNN-to-MLP distillation, i.e., the high-frequency\nknowledge of the pre-trained GNNs may be overwhelmed by the low-frequency\nknowledge during distillation; we have described in detail what it represents,\nhow it arises, what impact it has, and how to deal with it.

Next, a novel Multi-Spectral Class Center Network (MSCCNet) is\nproposed for face manipulation detection and localization.

Applying multi-spectral class-level representations\nsuppresses the semantic information of the visual concepts, which is\ninsensitive to manipulations. Furthermore, we propose a Multi-level Features\nAggregation (MFA) module to employ more low-level forgery artifacts and\nstructure textures.

We aimed to reconstruct the spin states and shapes\nof asteroids from this dataset. We computed the viewing and illumination\ngeometry for each individual observation and used the light curve inversion\nmethod to find the best-fit asteroid model, which was parameterized by the\nsidereal rotation period, the spin axis direction, and a low-resolution convex\nshape. To find the best-fit model, we ran the inversion for tens of thousands\nof trial periods on interval 2-10,000 h, with tens of initial pole directions.\nTo find the correct rotation period, we also used a triaxial ellipsoid model\nfor the shape approximation. In most cases the number of data points was\ninsufficient to uniquely determine the rotation period.

The\ndistribution of spins confirms previous findings that (i) small asteroids have\npoles clustered toward ecliptic poles, likely because of the YORP-induced spin\nevolution, (ii) asteroid migration due to the Yarkovsky effect depends on the\nspin orientation, and (iii) members of asteroid families have the sense of\nrotation correlated with their proper semimajor axis: over the age of the\nfamily, orbits of prograde rotators evolved, due to the Yarkovsky effect, to\nlarger semimajor axes, while those of retrograde rotators drifted in the\nopposite direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 08:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Integrating these data sets can be a way to solidify\nfindings and even to make new discoveries. However, integrating multi-omics\ndata sets is challenging. Typically, data sets are integrated by performing an\nall-vs-all correlation analysis, where each feature of the first data set is\ncorrelated to each feature of the second data set. However, all-vs-all\nassociation testing produces unstructured results that are hard to interpret,\nand involves potentially unnecessary hypothesis testing that reduces\nstatistical power due to false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment.\n  Implementation: Here, we present the anansi framework, and accompanying R\npackage, as a way to improve upon all-vs-all association analysis. We take a\nknowledge-based approach where external databases like KEGG are used to\nconstrain the all-vs-all association hypothesis space, only considering\npairwise associations that are a priori known to occur. This produces\nstructured results that are easier to interpret, and increases statistical\npower by skipping unnecessary hypothesis tests. In this paper, we present the\nanansi framework and demonstrate its application to learn metabolite-function\ninteractions in the context of host-microbe interactions. We further extend our\nframework beyond pairwise association testing to differential association\ntesting, and show how anansi can be used to identify associations that differ\nin strength or degree based on sample covariates such as case/control status.\n  Availability: https://github.com/thomazbastiaanssen/anansi\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 09:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

The\nkey idea of GNN-based recommender system is to recursively perform the message\npassing along the user-item interaction edge for refining the encoded\nembeddings, relying on sufficient and high-quality training data. Since user\nbehavior data in practical recommendation scenarios is often noisy and exhibits\nskewed distribution, some recommendation approaches, e.g., SGL and SimGCL,\nleverage self-supervised learning to improve user representations against the\nabove issues. Despite their effectiveness, however, they conduct\nself-supervised learning through creating contrastvie views, depending on the\nexploration of data augmentations with the problem of tedious trial-and-error\nselection of augmentation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive\nGraph Contrastive Learning (AdaptiveGCL) framework which conducts graph\ncontrastive learning with two adaptive contrastive view generators to better\nempower CF paradigm. Specifically, we use two trainable view generators, which\nare a graph generative model and a graph denoising model respectively, to\ncreate contrastive views. Two generators are able to create adaptive\ncontrastive views, addressing the problem of model collapse and achieving\nadaptive contrastive learning. With two adaptive contrasive views, more\nadditionally high-quality training signals will be introduced into the CF\nparadigm and help to alleviate the data sparsity and noise issues. Extensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our\nmodel over various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.

Both conduction and injection mechanisms for charge generation are\nconsidered. In this work, we focused on the intensity of the cross-flow and\nstudied the EHD flows without a cross-flow, with a weak cross-flow and with a\nstrong cross-flow. (1)In the case without a cross-flow, we investigated its\nnonlinear flow structures and linear dynamics. We found that the flow in the\nconduction regime is steady, whereas the flow in the injection regime is\noscillatory, which can be explained by a global stability analysis. (2)The EHD\nflow with a weak cross-flow is closely related to the flow phenomena in\nelectrostatic precipitator (ESP). Our analyses indicate that increasing the\ncross-flow intensity or the electric Reynolds number leads to a less stable\nflow. Based on these results, we infer that one should adopt a relatively low\nvoltage and weak cross-flow in the wire-plate EHD flow to avoid flow\ninstability, which may hold practical implications for ESP. (3)The case of\nstrong cross-flow is examined to study the EHD effect on the wake flow. By\ncomparing the conventional cylindrical wake with the EHD wake in linear and\nnonlinear regimes, we found that the EHD effect brings forward the vortex\nshedding in wake flows. Besides, the EHD effect reduces the drag coefficient\nwhen the cross-flow is weak, but increases it when it is strong.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 10:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

From a security\nperspective, it poses a critical risk for modern vision systems, e.g., the\npopular Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS) frameworks. For protecting\noff-the-shelf deep models while not modifying them, current algorithms\ntypically detect adversarial patterns through discriminative decomposition of\nnatural-artificial data. However, these decompositions are biased towards\nfrequency or spatial discriminability, thus failing to capture subtle\nadversarial patterns comprehensively. More seriously, they are typically\ninvertible, meaning successful defense-aware (secondary) adversarial attack\n(i.e., evading the detector as well as fooling the model) is practical under\nthe assumption that the adversary is fully aware of the detector (i.e., the\nKerckhoffs's principle). Motivated by such facts, we propose an accurate and\nsecure adversarial example detector, relying on a spatial-frequency\ndiscriminative decomposition with secret keys. It expands the above works on\ntwo aspects: 1) the introduced Krawtchouk basis provides better\nspatial-frequency discriminability and thereby is more suitable for capturing\nadversarial patterns than the common trigonometric or wavelet basis; 2) the\nextensive parameters for decomposition are generated by a pseudo-random\nfunction with secret keys, hence blocking the defense-aware adversarial attack.\nTheoretical and numerical analysis demonstrates the increased accuracy and\nsecurity of our detector w.r.t. a number of state-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 10:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Instead of\nmulti-prompt ensembling, we propose to design auxiliary tasks with enlightened\nprompt learning for the IDRR task. Although an auxiliary task is not used to\ndirectly output final prediction, we argue that during the joint training some\nof its learned features can be useful to boost the main task. In light of such\nmotivations, we propose a task enlightenment prompt learning model, called\nTEPrompt, to fuse learned features from three related tasks for IDRR. In\nparticular, the TEPrompt contains three tasks, viz., Discourse Relation\nRecognition (DRR), Sense Semantics Classification (SSC) and Annotated\nConnective Prediction (ACP), each with a unique prompt template and an answer\nspace. In the training phase, we jointly train three prompt learning tasks with\nshared argument representation. In the testing phase, we only take the DRR\noutput with fused features as the final IDRR decision. Experiments with the\nsame conditions have shown that the proposed TEPrompt outperforms the\nConnPrompt.

This task faces a severe semantic-aliasing\nissue between base and novel classes due to data imbalance, which makes\nsegmentation results unsatisfactory. To alleviate this issue, we propose the\nSemantic-guided Relation Alignment and Adaptation (SRAA) method that fully\nconsiders the guidance of prior semantic information. Specifically, we first\nconduct Semantic Relation Alignment (SRA) in the base step, so as to\nsemantically align base class representations to their semantics. As a result,\nthe embeddings of base classes are constrained to have relatively low semantic\ncorrelations to categories that are different from them.

This effect serves as the basis for numerous\nferroelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric phenomena. In nearly all polar\nmaterials, including multilayered van der Waals stacks that were recently found\nto exhibit interfacial polarization, inversion symmetry is broken by having two\nor more atomic species within the unit cell. Here, we show that even elemental\ncrystals, consisting of one type of atom, and composed of non-polar\ncentrosymmetric layers, exhibit electric polarization if arranged in an\nappropriate three-dimensional architecture. This concept is demonstrated here\nfor inversion and mirror asymmetric mixed-stacking tetra-layer polytypes of\nnon-polar graphene sheets. Furthermore, we find that the room temperature\nout-of-plane electric polarization increases with external electrostatic\ndoping, rather than decreases owing to screening. Using first-principles\ncalculations, as well as tight-binding modeling, we unveil the origin of\npolytype-induced polarization and its dependence on doping. Extension of this\nidea to graphene multilayers suggests that solely by lateral shifts of\nconstituent monolayers one can obtain multiple meta-stable interlayer stacking\nsequences that may allow for even larger electrical polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 11:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

However, good teachers in\nreal life always simplify complex material before teaching it to students.\nInspired by this fact, we propose student-friendly knowledge distillation (SKD)\nto simplify teacher output into new knowledge representations, which makes the\nlearning of the student model easier and more effective. SKD contains a\nsoftening processing and a learning simplifier. First, the softening processing\nuses the temperature hyperparameter to soften the output logits of the teacher\nmodel, which simplifies the output to some extent and makes it easier for the\nlearning simplifier to process. The learning simplifier utilizes the attention\nmechanism to further simplify the knowledge of the teacher model and is jointly\ntrained with the student model using the distillation loss, which means that\nthe process of simplification is correlated with the training objective of the\nstudent model and ensures that the simplified new teacher knowledge\nrepresentation is more suitable for the specific student model. Furthermore,\nsince SKD does not change the form of the distillation loss, it can be easily\ncombined with other distillation methods that are based on the logits or\nfeatures of intermediate layers to enhance its effectiveness. Therefore, SKD\nhas wide applicability.

Accurate fairness has been recently proposed to enforce\na harmonic balance between accuracy and individual fairness. It induces the\nnotion of fairness confusion matrix to categorize predictions as true fair,\ntrue biased, false fair, and false biased. This paper proposes a harmonic\nevaluation approach, RobustFair, for the accurate fairness of DNNs, using\nadversarial perturbations crafted through fairness confusion directed gradient\nsearch. By using Taylor expansions to approximate the ground truths of\nadversarial instances, RobustFair can particularly identify the robustness\ndefects entangled for spurious fairness, which are often elusive in robustness\nevaluation, and missing in individual fairness evaluation. RobustFair can boost\nrobustness and individual fairness evaluations by identifying robustness or\nfairness defects simultaneously. Empirical case studies on fairness benchmark\ndatasets show that, compared with the state-of-the-art white-box robustness and\nindividual fairness testing approaches, RobustFair detects significantly\n1.77-11.87 times adversarial perturbations, yielding 1.83-13.12 times biased\nand 1.53-8.22 times false instances. The adversarial instances can then be\neffectively exploited to improve the accurate fairness (and hence accuracy and\nindividual fairness) of the original deep neural network through retraining.\nThe empirical case studies further show that the adversarial instances\nidentified by RobustFair outperform those identified by the other testing\napproaches, in promoting 21% accurate fairness and 19% individual fairness on\nmultiple sensitive attributes, without losing accuracy at all or even promoting\nit by up to 4%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 12:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Most of the existing deep\nlearningbased pansharpening methods have poor generalization ability and the\ntraditional model-based pansharpening methods need careful manual exploration\nfor the image structure prior. To alleviate these issues, this paper proposes\nan unsupervised pansharpening method by combining the diffusion model with the\nlow-rank matrix factorization technique. Specifically, we assume that the HRMS\nimage is decomposed into the product of two low-rank tensors, i.e., the base\ntensor and the coefficient matrix.

Previous works on VR\nteleoperation for robot manipulators focus primarily on collaborative or\nresearch robot platforms (whose dynamics and constraints differ from industrial\nrobot arms), or only address tasks where the robot's dynamics are not as\nimportant (e.g: pick and place tasks). We investigate the usage of commercially\navailable VR interfaces for effectively teleoeprating industrial robot\nmanipulators in a variety of contact-rich manipulation tasks. We find that\napplying standard practices for VR control of robot arms is challenging for\nindustrial platforms because torque and velocity control is not exposed, and\nposition control is mediated through a black-box controller. To mitigate these\nproblems, we propose a simplified filtering approach to process command signals\nto enable operators to effectively teleoperate industrial robot arms with VR\ninterfaces in dexterous manipulation tasks.

There are two prominent\ntechniques employed for reducing the response latency: keep fully initialized\ncontainers alive (Warm Container) or reduce the new container startup (cold\nstart) latency.\n  This paper presents the 3rd container startup mode: Hibernate Container,\nwhich starts faster than the cold start container mode and consumes less memory\nthan the Warm Container mode. Hibernate Container is essentially a \"deflated\"\nWarm Container. Its application memory is swapped out to disk, the freed memory\nis reclaimed and file based mmap memory is cleaned-up. The Hibernate\nContainer's deflated memory is inflated in response to user requests. As\nHibernate Container's application is fully initialized, its response latency is\nless than the cold start mode; and as the application memory is deflated, its\nmemory consumption is less than the Warm Container mode. Additionally, when a\nHibernate Container is \"woken up\" to process a request, the Woken-up Container\nhas similar response latency to Warm Container but less memory consumption\nbecause not all the deflated memory needs to be inflated. We implemented the\nHibernate technique as part of the open source Quark secure container runtime\nproject and our test demonstrated that Hibernate Container consumes about 7\\%\nto 25\\% of the Warm Container memory.

Recent attempts to relate the radius and\ntidal deformability of a NS to the individual NMPs have been inconclusive.\nThese properties display strong correlations with the pressure of NS matter\nwhich depends on several NMPs. The knowledge of minimal NMPs that determine the\nNS properties will be necessary to address any connection between NS properties\n(e.g., tidal deformability) and that of finite nuclei.\n  Purpose: To identify the important NMPs required to describe the tidal\ndeformability of neutron star for astrophysically relevant range of their\ngravitational masses (1.2 -- 1.8 M$_\\odot$) as encountered in the binary\nneutron star merger events.\n  Method: We construct a large set of EoSs using four iso-scalar and five\niso-vector NMPs. These EOSs are employed to perform a systematic analysis to\nisolate the NMPs that predominantly determine the tidal deformability, over a\nwide range of NS mass. The tidal deformability is then directly mapped to these\nNMPs.\n  Results: The tidal deformability of the NS with mass 1.2-1.8 M$_\\odot$ can be\ndetermined within 10$\\%$ directly in terms of four nuclear matter parameters,\nnamely, the incompressibility $K_0$ and skewness $Q_0$ of symmetric nuclear\nmatter, and the slope $L_0$ and curvature parameter $K_{\\rm sym,0}$ of symmetry\nenergy.\n  Conclusion: A function that quickly estimates the value of tidal\ndeformability in terms of minimal nuclear matter parameters is developed.

Different\nfrom these works, we conduct research in this paper driven by the believe that\nproperly utilizing and controlling Hessian information associated with the\npolicy gradient can noticeably improve the performance of policy gradient\nalgorithms. One key Hessian information that attracted our attention is the\nHessian trace, which gives the divergence of the policy gradient vector field\nin the Euclidean policy parametric space. We set the goal to generalize this\nEuclidean policy parametric space into a general Riemmanian manifold by\nintroducing a metric tensor field $g_ab$ in the parametric space. This is\nachieved through newly developed mathematical tools, deep learning algorithms,\nand metric tensor deep neural networks (DNNs). Armed with these technical\ndevelopments, we propose a new policy gradient algorithm that learns to\nminimize the absolute divergence in the Riemannian manifold as an important\nregularization mechanism, allowing the Riemannian manifold to smoothen its\npolicy gradient vector field. The newly developed algorithm is experimentally\nstudied on several benchmark reinforcement learning problems. Our experiments\nclearly show that the new metric tensor regularized algorithm can significantly\noutperform its counterpart that does not use our regularization technique.\nAdditional experimental analysis further suggests that the trained metric\ntensor DNN and the corresponding metric tensor $g_{ab}$ can effectively reduce\nthe absolute divergence towards zero in the Riemannian manifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 14:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

Although\nsome learning-based methods have shown success in terms of average accuracy,\ntheir ability to handle regions with local large deformation (LLD) may\nsignificantly decrease compared to dealing with regions with minor deformation.\nThis motivates our research into this issue. Two main causes of LLDs are organ\nmotion and changes in tissue structure, with the latter often being a long-term\nprocess. In this paper, we propose a novel registration model called\nCascade-Dilation Inter-Layer Differential Network (CDIDN), which exhibits both\nhigh deformation impedance capability (DIC) and accuracy. CDIDN improves its\nresilience to LLDs in CT images by enhancing LLDs in the displacement field\n(DF). It uses a feature-based progressive decomposition of LLDs, blending\nfeature flows of different levels into a main flow in a top-down manner. It\nleverages Inter-Layer Differential Module (IDM) at each level to locally refine\nthe main flow and globally smooth the feature flow, and also integrates feature\nvelocity fields that can effectively handle feature deformations of various\ndegrees. We assess CDIDN using lungs as representative organs with large\ndeformation. Our findings show that IDM significantly enhances LLDs of the DF,\nby which improves the DIC and accuracy of the model. Compared with other\noutstanding learning-based methods, CDIDN exhibits the best DIC and excellent\naccuracy. Based on vessel enhancement and enhanced LLDs of the DF, we propose a\nnovel method to accurately track the appearance, disappearance, enlargement,\nand shrinkage of pulmonary lesions, which effectively addresses detection of\nearly lesions and peripheral lung lesions, issues of false enlargement, false\nshrinkage, and mutilation of lesions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 15:05:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 May 2023 12:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

However, previous studies have found\nthat dense retrieval is hard to generalize to unseen domains due to its weak\nmodeling of domain-invariant and interpretable feature (i.e., matching signal\nbetween two texts, which is the essence of information retrieval). In this\npaper, we propose a novel method to improve the generalization of dense\nretrieval via capturing matching signal called BERM. Fully fine-grained\nexpression and query-oriented saliency are two properties of the matching\nsignal. Thus, in BERM, a single passage is segmented into multiple units and\ntwo unit-level requirements are proposed for representation as the constraint\nin training to obtain the effective matching signal. One is semantic unit\nbalance and the other is essential matching unit extractability. Unit-level\nview and balanced semantics make representation express the text in a\nfine-grained manner. Essential matching unit extractability makes passage\nrepresentation sensitive to the given query to extract the pure matching\ninformation from the passage containing complex context. Experiments on BEIR\nshow that our method can be effectively combined with different dense retrieval\ntraining methods (vanilla, hard negatives mining and knowledge distillation) to\nimprove its generalization ability without any additional inference overhead\nand target domain data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 15:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

This is in contrast to all prior work on gap cycle\ncounting problems in adversarial partitions.

The combination of in\nsitu FMC observations with numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and\nsatellite retrievals has enabled the development of machine learning (ML)\nmodels to estimate dead FMC retrievals over the contiguous US (CONUS). In this\nstudy, ML models were trained using variables from the National Water Model and\nthe High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) NWP models, and static variables\ncharacterizing the surface properties, as well as surface reflectances and land\nsurface temperature (LST) retrievals from the VIIRS instrument on board the\nSuomi-NPP satellite system. Extensive hyper-parameter optimization yielded\nskillful FMC models compared to a daily climatography RMSE (+44\\%) and to an\nhourly climatography RMSE (+24\\%). Furthermore, VIIRS retrievals were important\npredictors for estimating FMC, contributing significantly as a group due to\ntheir high band-correlation. In contrast, individual predictors in the HRRR\ngroup had relatively high importance according to the explainability techniques\nused. When both HRRR and VIIRS retrievals were not used as model inputs, the\nperformance dropped significantly. If VIIRS retrievals were not used, the RMSE\nperformance was worse. This highlights the importance of VIIRS retrievals in\nmodeling FMC, which yielded better models compared to MODIS.

Selective query expansion is one such an approach, in which\nthe system decides automatically whether or not to expand the query, resulting\nin two possible system configurations.

Biological Organisms employ various locomotion modes,\nincluding coiling and uncoiling motions, asymmetric body twisting, and\nundulating movements that generate motion waves. The coiling-uncoiling motion\ndrives a seed awn to bury itself like a corkscrew, while sandfish skinks use\nundulatory swimming, which can be thought of as a 2D version of helical motion.\nStudying burrowing behavior aims to understand how animals navigate\nunderground, whether in their natural burrows or underground habitats, and to\nimplement this knowledge in solving geotechnical penetration problems.\nUnderground horizontal burrowing is challenging due to overcoming the\nresistance of interaction forces of granular media to move forward.

The robot's burrowing behavior is studied in a\nlaboratory setting. It is found that rotation and propulsive motion along the\naxis of the auger's helical shape significantly reduce granular media's\nresistance against horizontal penetration by breaking kinematic symmetry or\ngranular media boundary. Additional thrusting and dragging tests were performed\nto examine the propulsive and resistive forces and unify the observed burrowing\nbehaviors.

Moreover, we characterize the optimization\nperformance of Pre+TTN-VQC without the need for the Polyak-Lojasiewicz\ncondition, thereby enhancing the practicality of implementing quantum neural\nnetworks on NISQ devices. We conduct experiments on a handwritten digit\nclassification dataset to corroborate our proposed methods and theorems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 03:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-07"}
