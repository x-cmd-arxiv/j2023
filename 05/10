Using multiple types of\nimplicit user feedback for such target behavior prediction purposes is still an\nopen question. Existing studies that attempted to learn from multiple types of\nuser behavior often fail to: (i) learn universal and accurate user preferences\nfrom different behavioral data distributions, and (ii) overcome the noise and\nbias in observed implicit user feedback. To address the above problems, we\npropose multi-behavior alignment (MBA), a novel recommendation framework that\nlearns from implicit feedback by using multiple types of behavioral data. We\nconjecture that multiple types of behavior from the same user (e.g., clicks and\npurchases) should reflect similar preferences of that user. To this end, we\nregard the underlying universal user preferences as a latent variable.

In this paper, we demonstrate the effect of PLP by designing a\ncontroller architecture for a class of linear Markovian jump systems (MJS)\nwhere the aforementioned ``patterns'' correspond to finite-length sequences of\nmodes. In our analysis of recurrent patterns, we use martingale theory to\nderive closed-form solutions to quantities pertaining to the occurrence of\npatterns: 1) the expected minimum occurrence time of any pattern from some\npredefined collection, 2) the probability of a pattern being the first to occur\namong the collection.

However, due to the natural presence of private\ninformation in text data, different organizations are unwilling to share\nprivate data, such as addresses and phone numbers. Therefore, it becomes\nincreasingly important to design a privacy-preserving collaborative training\nframework for the Chinese text recognition task. In this paper, we introduce\npersonalized federated learning (pFL) into the Chinese text recognition task\nand propose the pFedCR algorithm, which significantly improves the model\nperformance of each client (organization) without sharing private data.\nSpecifically, based on CRNN, to handle the non-iid problem of client data, we\nadd several attention layers to the model and design a two-stage training\napproach for the client. In addition, we fine-tune the output layer of the\nmodel using a virtual dataset on the server, mitigating the problem of\ncharacter imbalance in Chinese documents. The proposed approach is validated on\npublic benchmarks and two self-built real-world industrial scenario datasets.\nThe experimental results show that the pFedCR algorithm can improve the\nperformance of local personalized models while also improving their\ngeneralization performance on other client data domains. Compared to local\ntraining within an organization, pFedCR improves model performance by about\n20%. Compared to other state-of-the-art personalized federated learning\nmethods, pFedCR improves performance by 6%~8%.

Further, we hypothesize that a fraction of the decay energy is\nneeded for cluster formation within the parent nucleus. The proposed formula\nopens a new paradigm to separately estimate the energy contributed during the\ncluster formation from its emission and thus shows that the contribution of the\nQ-value splits into three major parts accounting for the energy contributed\nduring the cluster preformation, its emission and recoil of the daughter\nnucleus. Moreover, the expression $P_0$ is adept at accommodating the theorized\nconcept of heavy particle radioactivity (HPR). The result reveals that, like\n$\\alpha$-decay, a proper estimation of the $P_0$ and $Q$-value in the cluster\nstudies are enriched with qualitative information about the nuclear structure.\nHowever, from the analysis, the Geiger-Nuttall law is not the best compromise\nin the clustering due to the non-linearity between $\\log_{10}T_{1/2}$ and\n$\\sqrt{Q}$, unlike in $\\alpha$-decay. We have demonstrated that with the\ninclusion of the proposed formula, the half-life predictions from both\nmicroscopic R3Y and phenomenological M3Y NN potentials closely agree with the\navailable experimental data and that the slight variation can be traced to\ntheir peculiar barrier characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 17:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

The magnitude of this thermodynamical effect\nis typically considered in accordance with a physical temperature, assumed to\nbe uniform across the resonator's physical span. However, in some\ncircumstances, e.g. quantum optomechanics or interferometric gravitational wave\ndetection, the temperature of the resonator may not be uniform, resulting in\nthe resonator being thermally linked to a spatially varying thermal bath. In\nthis case, the link of a mode of interest to its thermal environment is less\nstraightforward to understand. Here, we engineer a distributed bath on a\ngermane optomechanical platform -- a phononic crystal -- and utilize both\nhighly localized and extended resonator modes to probe the spatially varying\nbath in entirely different bath regimes. As a result, we observe striking\ndifferences in the modes' Brownian motion magnitude. From these measurements we\nare able to reconstruct the local temperature map across our resonator and\nmeasure nanoscale effects on thermal conductivity and radiative cooling. Our\nwork explains some thermal phenomena encountered in optomechanical experiments,\ne.g. mode-dependent heating due to light absorption. Moreover, our work\ngeneralizes the typical figure of merit quantifying the coupling of a resonator\nmode to its thermal environment from the mechanical dissipation to the overlap\nbetween the local dissipation and the local temperature throughout the\nresonator. This added understanding identifies design principles that can be\napplied to performance of micro-mechanical resonators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 17:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

A striking example is the\nthermal imaging organ of pit vipers. Single nerve fibers in the organ reliably\nrespond to mK temperature increases, a thousand times more sensitive than their\nmolecular sensors, thermo-TRP ion channels. Here, we propose a mechanism for\nthe integration of this molecular information. In our model, amplification\narises due to proximity to a dynamical bifurcation, separating a regime with\nfrequent and regular action potentials (APs), from a regime where APs are\nirregular and infrequent. Near the transition, AP frequency can have an\nextremely sharp dependence on temperature, naturally accounting for the\nthousand-fold amplification. Furthermore, close to the bifurcation, most of the\ninformation about temperature available in the TRP channels' kinetics can be\nread out from the timing of APs even in the presence of readout noise. While\nproximity to such bifurcation points typically requires fine-tuning of\nparameters, we propose that having feedback act from the order parameter (AP\nfrequency) onto the control parameter robustly maintains the system in the\nvicinity of the bifurcation. This robustness suggests that similar feedback\nmechanisms might be found in other sensory systems which also need to detect\ntiny signals in a varying environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 17:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-10"}

Finally, these KU-based expertise profiles are used to build\na code reviewer recommender (KUREC). In RQ1, we observe that KUREC performs as\nwell as the top-performing baseline recommender (RF). From a practical\nstandpoint, we highlight that KUREC's performance is more stable (lower\ninterquartile range) than that of RF, thus making it more consistent and\npotentially more trustworthy. Next, in RQ2 we design three new recommenders by\ncombining KUREC with our baseline recommenders. These new combined recommenders\noutperform both KUREC and the individual baselines.

Visual programs\nare usually written in domain-specific languages (DSLs). Finding \"good\"\nprograms, that only expose meaningful degrees of freedom, requires access to a\nDSL with a \"good\" library of functions, both of which are typically authored by\ndomain experts. We present ShapeCoder, the first system capable of taking a\ndataset of shapes, represented with unstructured primitives, and jointly\ndiscovering (i) useful abstraction functions and (ii) programs that use these\nabstractions to explain the input shapes. The discovered abstractions capture\ncommon patterns (both structural and parametric) across the dataset, so that\nprograms rewritten with these abstractions are more compact, and expose fewer\ndegrees of freedom. ShapeCoder improves upon previous abstraction discovery\nmethods, finding better abstractions, for more complex inputs, under less\nstringent input assumptions. This is principally made possible by two\nmethodological advancements: (a) a shape to program recognition network that\nlearns to solve sub-problems and (b) the use of e-graphs, augmented with a\nconditional rewrite scheme, to determine when abstractions with complex\nparametric expressions can be applied, in a tractable manner. We evaluate\nShapeCoder on multiple datasets of 3D shapes, where primitive decompositions\nare either parsed from manual annotations or produced by an unsupervised cuboid\nabstraction method.

In this study we report the first quantum simulation (on\nclassical hardware) of the real-time dynamics of CMWs in Schwinger model. Our\nquench protocol is the following: at $t=0$ we suddenly place an electric dipole\nat the middle of our lattice. Due to chiral anomaly, this dipole excites the\nCMW that propagates towards the edges of the lattice. In Schwinger model tuned\nto the conformal critical point (at $\\theta = \\pi$, $m/g \\simeq 0.2$), we find\na gapless linear CMW that propagates with the speed of light. For massless\nSchwinger model ($\\theta =0, m=0$), we find a gapped linear CMW, in accord with\nprevious analytical analyses. For massive Schwinger model (that is dual to\nstrongly interacting bosonic theory), we enter the new regime of nonlinear\nCMWs, where we find a surprise. Specifically, for $m/g > 1$, the frequency of\nelectric charge oscillations becomes much smaller than the frequency of the\noscillations of the chiral charge. For $m/g =4$, we find a solution\ncorresponding to a nearly static electric dipole with fast oscillations of the\nchiral charge confined within. We call this solution a \"thumper\" and study its\nproperties in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

It is widely accepted\nthat the magnetic field is responsible for the heating, but there are two\ncompeting mechanisms that could explain it: nanoflares or Alfv\\'en waves. To\ndate, neither can be directly observed. Nanoflares are, by definition,\nextremely small, but their aggregate energy release could represent a\nsubstantial heating mechanism, presuming they are sufficiently abundant. One\nway to test this presumption is via the flare frequency distribution, which\ndescribes how often flares of various energies occur. If the slope of the power\nlaw fitting the flare frequency distribution is above a critical threshold,\n$\\alpha=2$ as established in prior literature, then there should be a\nsufficient abundance of nanoflares to explain coronal heating. We performed\n$>$600 case studies of solar flares, made possible by an unprecedented number\nof data analysts via three semesters of an undergraduate physics laboratory\ncourse. This allowed us to include two crucial, but nontrivial, analysis\nmethods: pre-flare baseline subtraction and computation of the flare energy,\nwhich requires determining flare start and stop times.

Given that each source is expected (in the simplest scenario of\ncircular inspirals) to emit at a fixed frequency, the anisotropy will most\ngenerally vary from one frequency to another.

Despite this observational success, it is\nstill lacking a robust embedding into a UV complete theory. Previous efforts to\nderive Starobinsky inflation from string theory have been based on the\nderivation of higher derivative curvature terms from the low-energy limit of\nten-dimensional string theory. This approach is however known to fail due to\nthe difficulty to tame the effect of contributions proportional to the Ricci\nscalar to a power larger than two. In this paper we investigate an alternative\nattempt which exploits instead the ubiquitous presence of scalar fields in\nstring compactifications combined with the fact that Starobinsky inflation can\nbe recast as Einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field with a precise\npotential and conformal coupling to matter fermions. We focus in particular on\ntype IIB K\\\"ahler moduli since they have shown to lead to exponential\npotentials with a Starobinsky-like plateau. We consider three classes of moduli\nwith a different topological origin: the volume modulus, bulk fibre moduli, and\nblow-up modes. The only modulus with the correct coupling to matter is the\nvolume mode but its potential does not feature any plateau at large field\nvalues. Fibre moduli admit instead a potential very similar to Starobinsky\ninflation with a natural suppression of higher curvature corrections, but they\ncannot reproduce the correct conformal coupling to matter. Blow-up modes have\nboth a wrong potential and a wrong coupling. Our analysis implies therefore\nthat embedding Starobinsky inflation into string theory seems rather hard.\nFinally, it provides a detailed derivation of the coupling to matter of fibre\nmoduli which could be used as a way to discriminate Starobinsky from fibre\ninflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 18:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

The planar degeneracy leads to a\nparticularly simple parametrization of the vertex, reducing its kinematic\ndependence to essentially a single variable. Our analysis, carried out in the\nabsence of dynamical quarks, reveals that the planar degeneracy is particularly\naccurate for the description of the form factor associated with the classical\ntensor, for a wide array of arbitrary kinematic configurations. Instead, the\nremaining three form factors display considerable violations of this property.\nIn addition, and in close connection with the previous point, we demonstrate\nthe numerical dominance of the classical form factor over all others, except in\nthe vicinity of the soft-gluon kinematics.

Ideas like\nmulti-process fusion or switching involve combining different VPR techniques\ntogether, utilizing different strategies. One major aspect often common to many\nof these strategies is voting. Voting is widely used in many ensemble methods,\nso it is potentially a relevant subject to explore in terms of its application\nand significance for improving VPR performance. This paper attempts to looks\ninto detail and analyze a variety of voting schemes to evaluate which voting\ntechnique is optimal for an ensemble VPR set up. We take inspiration from a\nvariety of voting schemes that exist and are widely employed in other research\nfields such as politics and sociology.

Some of these voting schemes include Condorcet voting, Broda\nCount and Plurality voting. Voting employed in any aspect requires that a fair\nsystem be established, that outputs the best and most favourable results which\nin our case would involve improving VPR performance. We evaluate some of these\nvoting techniques in a standardized testing of different VPR techniques, using\na variety of VPR data sets. We aim to determine whether a single optimal voting\nscheme exists or, much like in other fields of research, the selection of a\nvoting technique is relative to its application and environment.

Extant routing protocols\noften underperform in minimally connected networks where holes are larger and\nmore frequent. Minimal density networks are common in practice due to\ndeployment cost constraints, mobility dynamics, and/or adversarial jamming.\nProtocols that use global search to determine optimal paths incur search\noverhead that limits scaling. Conversely, protocols that use local search tend\nto find approximately optimal paths at higher densities due to the existence of\ngeometrically direct routes but underperform as the connectivity lowers and\nregional (or global) information is required to address holes. Designing a\nrouting protocol to achieve high throughput-latency performance across network\ndensities, mobility, and interference dynamics remains challenging.\n  This paper shows that, in a probabilistic setting, bounded exploration can be\nleveraged to mitigate this challenge.

The velocity structure\nof each PDR changes with distance from $\\gamma$ Cas, consistent with driving by\nthe radiation. Based on previous FUV flux measurements of, and the known\ndistance to $\\gamma$ Cas along with the predictions of 3D distances to the\nclouds, we estimated the FUV radiation field strength (G0) at the clouds.\nAssuming negligible extinction between the star and clouds, we find their 3D\ndistances from $\\gamma$ Cas. For IC 63, our results are consistent with earlier\nestimates of distance from Andersson et al. (2013), locating the cloud at 2 pc\nfrom $\\gamma$ Cas, at an angle of 58 to the plane of the sky, behind the star.\nFor IC 59, we derive a distance of 4.5 pc at an angle of 70 in front of the\nstar. We do not detect any significant correlation between the orientation of\nthe magnetic field (Soam et al. 2017) and the velocity gradients of [C II] gas,\nindicating a moderate magnetic field strength. The kinetic energy in IC 63 is\nestimated to be order of ten higher than the magnetic energies. This suggests\nthat kinetic pressure in this nebula is dominant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 19:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

However, in the field\nof remote sensing, the scientific literature on the implementation of AGI\nremains relatively scant. Existing AI-related research primarily focuses on\nvisual understanding tasks while neglecting the semantic understanding of the\nobjects and their relationships. This is where vision-language models excel, as\nthey enable reasoning about images and their associated textual descriptions,\nallowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying semantics.\nVision-language models can go beyond recognizing the objects in an image and\ncan infer the relationships between them, as well as generate natural language\ndescriptions of the image.

This paper provides a\ncomprehensive review of the research on vision-language models in remote\nsensing, summarizing the latest progress, highlighting the current challenges,\nand identifying potential research opportunities. Specifically, we review the\napplication of vision-language models in several mainstream remote sensing\ntasks, including image captioning, text-based image generation, text-based\nimage retrieval, visual question answering, scene classification, semantic\nsegmentation, and object detection.

Here, a model was\ndeveloped using basic mathematical methods, and the carbon-alpha form is the\nsimplest form of protein representation. We aimed to reduce computational\nvolume and distinguish the native structure from the decoy structures. For this\npurpose, according to Anfinsens dogma, we assumed that the energy of each model\nstructure should be more favorable than the corresponding native type. In the\nsecond one, we thought that the energy difference between the native and decoy\nstructures changes linearly with the root-mean-square deviation of structures.\nThese knowledge-based potentials are expressed by the B-spline basis functions\nof the pairwise distances between Ca-Ca of inter-residues. The potential\nfunction parameters in the above two approaches were optimized using the linear\nprogramming algorithm on a massive collection of Titan-HRD and tested on the\nremainder.

We\ncomprehensively evaluate VSMask protection performance under different\nscenarios. The experimental results indicate that VSMask can effectively defend\nagainst 3 popular voice synthesis models. None of the synthetic voice could\ndeceive the speaker verification models or human ears with VSMask protection.\nIn a physical world experiment, we demonstrate that VSMask successfully\nsafeguards the real-time speech by injecting the perturbation over the air.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 19:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

However, such methods\nlack adaptability to distribution shifts and new task classification classes.\nAlso, they need to be rearchitected and retrained from scratch for each new\ndisease. Moreover, installing multiple ML models in an edge device consumes\nexcessive memory, drains the battery faster, and complicates the detection\nprocess. To address these challenges, we propose DOCTOR, a multi-disease\ndetection continual learning (CL) framework based on WMSs. It employs a\nmulti-headed deep neural network (DNN) and an exemplar-replay-style CL\nalgorithm. The CL algorithm enables the framework to continually learn new\nmissions where different data distributions, classification classes, and\ndisease detection tasks are introduced sequentially. It counteracts\ncatastrophic forgetting with a data preservation method and a synthetic data\ngeneration module. The data preservation method efficiently preserves the most\ninformative subset of training data from previous missions based on the average\ntraining loss of each data instance. The synthetic data generation module\nmodels the probability distribution of the real training data and then\ngenerates as much synthetic data as needed for replays while maintaining data\nprivacy. The multi-headed DNN enables DOCTOR to detect multiple diseases\nsimultaneously based on user WMS data. We demonstrate DOCTOR's efficacy in\nmaintaining high multi-disease classification accuracy with a single DNN model\nin various CL experiments. DOCTOR achieves very competitive performance across\nall CL scenarios relative to the ideal joint-training framework while\nmaintaining a small model size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 19:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

In this work, we investigate the\nwidely-used baseline hyper-parameter values of two policy gradient algorithms\n-- PPO and SAC -- across different cycle times. Using a benchmark task where\nthe baseline hyper-parameters of both algorithms were shown to work well, we\nreveal that when a cycle time different than the task default is chosen, PPO\nwith baseline hyper-parameters fails to learn.

A typical procedure for circumventing\noverfitting computes empirical risk on a holdout set and halts once (or flags\nthat/when) it begins to increase. Such practice often helps in outputting a\nwell-generalizing model, but justification for why it works is primarily\nheuristic.\n  We discuss the overfitting problem and explain why standard asymptotic and\nconcentration results do not hold for evaluation with training data.

During their thermonuclear\nrunaway, PISNe can produce up to several tens of solar masses of radioactive\nnickel, resulting in luminous transients similar to some superluminous\nsupernovae (SLSNe). Yet, no unambiguous PISN has been discovered so far.\nSN2018ibb is a H-poor SLSN at $z=0.166$ that evolves extremely slowly compared\nto the hundreds of known SLSNe. Between mid 2018 and early 2022, we monitored\nits photometric and spectroscopic evolution from the UV to the NIR with 2-10m\nclass telescopes. SN2018ibb radiated $>3\\times10^{51} \\rm erg$ during its\nevolution, and its bolometric light curve reached $>2\\times10^{44} \\rm\nerg\\,s^{-1}$ at peak. The long-lasting rise of $>93$ rest-frame days implies a\nlong diffusion time, which requires a very high total ejected mass. The PISN\nmechanism naturally provides both the energy source ($^{56}$Ni) and the long\ndiffusion time. Theoretical models of PISNe make clear predictions for their\nphotometric and spectroscopic properties. SN2018ibb complies with most tests on\nthe light curves, nebular spectra and host galaxy, potentially all tests with\nthe interpretation we propose. Both the light curve and the spectra require\n25-44 $M_\\odot$ of freshly nucleosynthesised $^{56}$Ni, pointing to the\nexplosion of a metal-poor star with a He-core mass of 120-130 $M_\\odot$ at the\ntime of death. This interpretation is also supported by the tentative detection\nof [Co II]$\\lambda$1.025$\\mu$m, which has never been observed in any other PISN\ncandidate or SLSN before. Powering by a central engine, such as a magnetar or a\nblack hole, can be excluded with high confidence.

Most existing methods rely on Class\nActivation Maps (CAM) to generate pixel-level pseudo labels for supervised\ntraining. However, it is well known that CAM often suffers from partial\nactivation -- activating the most discriminative part instead of the entire\nobject area, and false activation -- unnecessarily activating the background\naround the object. In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective approach\nto address these limitations by harnessing the recently released Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) to generate higher-quality pseudo labels with CAM. SAM is\na segmentation foundation model that demonstrates strong zero-shot ability in\npartitioning images into segments but lacks semantic labels for these regions.\nTo circumvent this, we employ pseudo labels for a specific class as the signal\nto select the most relevant masks and label them to generate the refined pseudo\nlabels for this class. The segments generated by SAM are highly precise,\nleading to substantial improvements in partial and false activation. Moreover,\nexisting post-processing modules for producing pseudo labels, such as\nAffinityNet, are often computationally heavy, with a significantly long\ntraining time. Surprisingly, we discovered that using the initial CAM with SAM\ncan achieve on-par performance as the post-processed pseudo label generated\nfrom these modules with much less computational cost. Our approach is highly\nversatile and capable of seamless integration into existing WSSS models without\nmodification to base networks or pipelines.

Stochastic\noptimization methodologies are used by different nuclear utilities and vendors\nto perform fuel cycle reload design. Nevertheless, hand-designed solutions\ncontinue to be the prevalent method in the industry. To improve the\nstate-of-the-art core reload patterns, we aim to create a method as scalable as\npossible, that agrees with the designer's goal of performance and safety. To\nhelp in this task Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), in particular, Proximal\nPolicy Optimization is leveraged. RL has recently experienced a strong impetus\nfrom its successes applied to games. This paper lays out the foundation of this\nmethod and proposes to study the behavior of several hyper-parameters that\ninfluence the RL algorithm via a multi-measure approach helped with statistical\ntests. The algorithm is highly dependent on multiple factors such as the shape\nof the objective function derived for the core design that behaves as a fudge\nfactor that affects the stability of the learning. But also an\nexploration/exploitation trade-off that manifests through different parameters\nsuch as the number of loading patterns seen by the agents per episode, the\nnumber of samples collected before a policy update, and an entropy factor that\nincreases the randomness of the policy trained. Experimental results also\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the method in finding high-quality solutions\nfrom scratch within a reasonable amount of time.

In this problem, fixed resources\nmust be allocated to serve customers over a finite horizon, while customers\narrive according to a stochastic process. The typical NRM model assumes that\ncustomer arrivals are independent over time. However, in this paper, we explore\na more general setting where customer arrivals over different periods can be\ncorrelated. We propose a new model that assumes the existence of a system\nstate, which determines customer arrivals for the current period. This system\nstate evolves over time according to a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain. Our\nmodel can be used to represent correlation in various settings and synthesizes\nprevious literature on correlation models.\n  To solve the NRM problem under our correlated model, we derive a new linear\nprogramming (LP) approximation of the optimal policy. Our approximation\nprovides a tighter upper bound on the total expected value collected by the\noptimal policy than existing upper bounds.

The corresponding\nequation of state and matter contents of dense stellar matter with and without\nreaching the cold-catalyzed ground state are presented, which are obtained\nusing the latest Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME 2020). Further observations are\nnecessary to unveil the actual matter contents in those white dwarfs via, e.g.,\nspectroscopy, asteroseismology, and discoveries of other ultra low-mass and\nsmall-radius white dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 02:41:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

At present, graph neural networks (GNNs) for\nsession-based recommendations normally can only recommend items existing in\nusers' historical sessions. As a result, these GNNs have difficulty\nrecommending items that users have never interacted with (new items), which\nleads to a phenomenon of information cocoon. Therefore, it is necessary to\nrecommend new items to users. As there is no interaction between new items and\nusers, we cannot include new items when building session graphs for GNN\nsession-based recommender systems. Thus, it is challenging to recommend new\nitems for users when using GNN-based methods. We regard this challenge as\n'\\textbf{G}NN \\textbf{S}ession-based \\textbf{N}ew \\textbf{I}tem\n\\textbf{R}ecommendation (GSNIR)'. To solve this problem, we propose a\ndual-intent enhanced graph neural network for it. Due to the fact that new\nitems are not tied to historical sessions, the users' intent is difficult to\npredict. We design a dual-intent network to learn user intent from an attention\nmechanism and the distribution of historical data respectively, which can\nsimulate users' decision-making process in interacting with a new item. To\nsolve the challenge that new items cannot be learned by GNNs, inspired by\nzero-shot learning (ZSL), we infer the new item representation in GNN space by\nusing their attributes. By outputting new item probabilities, which contain\nrecommendation scores of the corresponding items, the new items with higher\nscores are recommended to users. Experiments on two representative real-world\ndatasets show the superiority of our proposed method. The case study from the\nreal-world verifies interpretability benefits brought by the dual-intent module\nand the new item reasoning module.

The random masking strategy of MAEs is likely to\nresult in areas of lesions being overlooked by the model. At the same time,\ninconsistencies between the pre-training and fine-tuning phases impede the\nperformance and efficiency of MAE in medical image classification. To address\nthese issues, we propose a medical supervised masked autoencoder (MSMAE) in\nthis paper. In the pre-training phase, MSMAE precisely masks medical images via\nthe attention maps obtained from supervised training, contributing to the\nrepresentation learning of human tissue in the lesion area. During the\nfine-tuning phase, MSMAE is also driven by attention to the accurate masking of\nmedical images. This improves the computational efficiency of the MSMAE while\nincreasing the difficulty of fine-tuning, which indirectly improves the quality\nof MSMAE medical diagnosis.

However, previous methods are sensitive to\nparameter settings, resulting in poor results from point clouds with noise,\ndensity variations and complex geometries.

To address this issue, DFSQ conducts channel-wise\nnormalization of the activations and applies distribution-flexible subset\nquantization (SQ), wherein the quantization points are selected from a\nuniversal set consisting of multi-word additive log-scale values.

To address this issue, we present the\nHigh-definition Consistency Texture Model (HCTM), a novel method that can\ngenerate high-definition and consistent textures for 3D meshes according to the\ntext prompts. We achieve this by leveraging a pre-trained depth-to-image\ndiffusion model to generate single viewpoint results based on the text prompt\nand a depth map. We fine-tune the diffusion model with Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning to quickly learn the style of the generated result, and apply the\nmulti-diffusion strategy to produce high-resolution and consistent results from\ndifferent viewpoints. Furthermore, we propose a strategy that prevents the\nappearance of noise on the textures caused by backpropagation.

The interactive nature of these\napplications demand low job completion time (JCT) for model inference. Existing\nLLM serving systems use run-to-completion processing for inference jobs, which\nsuffers from head-of-line blocking and long JCT. We present FastServe, a\ndistributed inference serving system for LLMs. FastServe exploits the\nautoregressive pattern of LLM inference to enable preemption at the granularity\nof each output token. FastServe uses preemptive scheduling to minimize JCT with\na novel skip-join Multi-Level Feedback Queue scheduler. Based on the new semi\ninformation-agnostic setting of LLM inference, the scheduler leverages the\ninput length information to assign an appropriate initial queue for each\narrival job to join. The higher priority queues than the joined queue are\nskipped to reduce demotions. We design an efficient GPU memory management\nmechanism that proactively offloads and uploads intermediate states between GPU\nmemory and host memory for LLM inference. We build a system prototype of\nFastServe based on NVIDIA FasterTransformer.

By characterizing the physical and chemical structure\nof these cores we can establish the initial conditions for star and planet\nformation and determine to what degree the chemical composition of pre-stellar\ncores is inherited to the later stages. A 3D MHD model of a pre-stellar core\nembedded in a dynamic star-forming cloud is post-processed using sequentially\ncontinuum radiative transfer, a gas-grain chemical model, and a line-radiative\ntransfer model. Results are analyzed and compared to observations of CH$_3$OH\nand $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ in L1544. Nine different chemical models are compared to the\nobservations to determine which initial conditions are compatible with the\nobserved chemical segregation in the prototypical pre-stellar core L1544. The\nmodel is able to reproduce several aspects of the observed chemical\ndifferentiation in L1544. Extended methanol emission is shifted towards colder\nand more shielded regions of the core envelope while $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ emission\noverlaps with the dust continuum, consistent with the observed chemical\nstructure. Increasing the strength of the interstellar radiation field or the\ncosmic-ray ionization rate with respect to the typical values assumed in nearby\nstar-forming regions leads to synthetic maps that are inconsistent with the\nobserved chemical structure.

However, the deployment\nof FL in mobile networks can be compromised by exposure to interference from\nneighboring cells or jammers. Existing interference mitigation techniques\nrequire multi-cell cooperation or at least interference channel state\ninformation, which is expensive in practice. On the other hand, power control\nthat treats interference as noise may not be effective due to limited power\nbudgets, and also that this mechanism can trigger countermeasures by\ninterference sources. As a practical approach for protecting FL against\ninterference, we propose Spectrum Breathing, which cascades stochastic-gradient\npruning and spread spectrum to suppress interference without bandwidth\nexpansion. The cost is higher learning latency by exploiting the graceful\ndegradation of learning speed due to pruning. We synchronize the two operations\nsuch that their levels are controlled by the same parameter, Breathing Depth.\nTo optimally control the parameter, we develop a martingale-based approach to\nconvergence analysis of Over-the-Air FL with spectrum breathing, termed\nAirBreathing FL.

We\nthen constrain the LISA detection rate, $\\mathcal{R}$, in the mass-redshift\nspace by combining our Bayesian-inferred merger rate with LISA's sensitivity to\nspin-aligned, inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms. Using an\nastrophysically-informed formation model, we predict a 95$\\%$ upper limit on\nthe detection rate of $\\mathcal{R} < 134\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ for binaries with\ntotal masses in the range $10^7 - 10^8\\,$ M$_{\\odot}$. For higher masses, i.e.,\n$>10^8\\,$ M$_{\\odot}$, we find $\\mathcal{R} < 2\\,(1)\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ using\nan astrophysically-informed (agnostic) formation model, rising to\n$11\\,(6)\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ if the LISA sensitivity bandwidth extends down to\n$10^{-5}$ Hz. Forecasts of LISA science potential with PTA background\nmeasurements should improve as PTAs continue their search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 07:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

More specifically, two layers of fronthaul links rely on the mutually\northogonal subcarreir sets in the same THz band, while access links are\nimplemented over sub-6G band. The proposed scheme leads to a complicated\nmixed-integer nonconvex optimization problem incorporating access point (AP)\nclustering, device selection, the assignment of subcarrier sets between two\nfronthaul links and the resource allocation at both the central processing unit\n(CPU) and APs. In order to address the formulated problem, we first resort to\nthe low-complexity but efficient heuristic methods thereby relaxing the binary\nvariables. Then, the overall end-to-end rate is obtained by iteratively\noptimizing the assignment of subcarrier sets and the number of AP clusters.\nFurthermore, an advanced MDD frame structure consisting of three parallel data\nstreams is tailored for the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed dynamic AP clustering approach in dealing with\nthe varying sizes of networks. Moreover, benefiting from the well-designed\nframe structure, MDD is capable of outperforming TDD in the two-tier fronthaul\nnetworks. Additionally, the effect of the THz bandwidth on system performance\nis analyzed, and it is shown that with sufficient frequency resources, our\nproposed two-tier fully-wireless fronthaul scheme can achieve a comparable\nperformance to the fiber-optic based systems.

The proposed algorithm\nrelies on the relaxation of a semi-orthogonality constraint which is proved to\nbe tight at every iteration of the algorithm. The vanilla version of the\nproposed algorithm requires solving a semi-definite program (SDP) at every\niteration, which can be further simplified to a quadratic program by\nformulating the dual of the surrogate maximization problem.

Such an assumption is often\nuntenable beyond applications, especially when dealing with discrete-time event\nsequences in low-resolution; and typical discrete Hawkes processes mainly\nsuffer from identifiability issues raised by the instantaneous effect, i.e.,\nthe causal relationship that occurred simultaneously due to the low-resolution\ndata will not be captured by Granger causality.

Conventional methods, such as finite difference methods, are\nunable to solve high-dimensional PDEs due to the curse-of-dimensionality. A\nvariety of deep learning methods have been recently developed to try and solve\nhigh-dimensional PDEs by approximating the solution using a neural network. In\nthis paper, we prove global convergence for one of the commonly-used deep\nlearning algorithms for solving PDEs, the Deep Galerkin Method (DGM). DGM\ntrains a neural network approximator to solve the PDE using stochastic gradient\ndescent. We prove that, as the number of hidden units in the single-layer\nnetwork goes to infinity (i.e., in the ``wide network limit\"), the trained\nneural network converges to the solution of an infinite-dimensional linear\nordinary differential equation (ODE). The PDE residual of the limiting\napproximator converges to zero as the training time $\\rightarrow \\infty$. Under\nmild assumptions, this convergence also implies that the neural network\napproximator converges to the solution of the PDE. A closely related class of\ndeep learning methods for PDEs is Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).\nUsing the same mathematical techniques, we can prove a similar global\nconvergence result for the PINN neural network approximators. Both proofs\nrequire analyzing a kernel function in the limit ODE governing the evolution of\nthe limit neural network approximator. A key technical challenge is that the\nkernel function, which is a composition of the PDE operator and the neural\ntangent kernel (NTK) operator, lacks a spectral gap, therefore requiring a\ncareful analysis of its properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 09:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

To this end, we\nfirst develop an approach that accounts for the landmark uncertainties during\nrobot localization. Existing planning approaches assume that the landmark\nlocations are well known or are known with little uncertainty. However, this\nmight not be true in practice. Noisy sensors and imperfect motions compound to\nthe errors originating from the estimate of environment features. Moreover,\npossible occlusions and dynamic objects in the environment render imperfect\nlandmark estimation. Consequently, not considering this uncertainty can wrongly\nlocalize the robot, leading to inefficient plans. Our approach thus\nincorporates the landmark uncertainty within the Bayes filter estimation\nframework.

We formulate the collision probability process as a quadratic\nform in random variables. Under Gaussian distribution assumptions, an exact\nexpression for collision probability is thus obtained which is computable in\nreal-time.

However, practical feasibility is still limited by\nstochastic fluctuations of chemical reactions and long computation times in\nGRNs.

A\ncommon way to optically differentiate them is to detect the disparity in the\nabsorption of light by the two enantiomers, i.e. the absorption circular\ndichroism (CD). However, the CD of typical molecules is very small, limiting\nthe sensitivity of chiroptical analysis based on CD. Cavity ring-down\nspectroscopy (CRDS) is a well-known ultrasensitive absorption spectroscopic\nmethod for low-absorbing gas-phase samples because the multiple reflections of\nlight in the cavity greatly increase the absorption path. By inserting a prism\ninto the cavity, the optical mode undergoes total internal reflection (TIR) at\nthe prism surface and the evanescent wave (EW) enables the absorption detection\nof condensed-phase samples within a very thin layer near the prism surface,\ncalled EW-CRDS. Here, we propose an ultrasensitive chiral absorption\nspectroscopy platform using a dielectric metasurface-assisted EW-CRDS. We\ntheoretically show that, upon linearly polarized and oblique incidence, the\nmetasurface exhibits minimum scattering and absorption loss, introduces\nnegligible polarization change, and locally converts the linearly polarized\nlight into near fields with finite optical chirality, enabling CD detection\nwith EW-CRDS that only works with linearly polarized light. We evaluate the\nring-down time in the presence of chiral molecules and determine the\nsensitivity of the cavity as a function of total absorption from the molecules.\nThe findings open the avenue for an ultrasensitive thin film detection of the\nchiral molecules using the CRDS techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 09:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

Based on a monostable\nnonlinear system, this paper proposes a self-contained solution for\ntime-sharing orbit jump and energy harvesting. The joint dynamics of an\nelectromechanical assembly consisting of a nonlinear energy harvester and a\nswitch-mode piezoelectric interface circuit is studied for high-capability\nenergy harvesting. The proposed solution is carried out by utilizing a\ncutting-edge switch-mode bidirectional energy conversion circuit (BECC), which\nenables time-sharing dual functions of energy harvesting and vibration\nexciting. A theoretical model is established based on impedance analysis and\nmultiple time scales method to analyze the stability, frequency response, and\nphase evolution of the autonomous and nonautonomous nonlinear energy harvesting\nsystems. Particularly, the detailed dynamics for the orbit jumps with vibration\nexciting mode of BECC are studied. Experiments are performed to validate the\nfull-range orbit jumps with the monostable nonlinear energy harvester. The\nharvested power after orbit jumps yields a nine-fold increase, compensating for\nthe energy consumption under vibration exciting mode quickly. The proposed\nsolution also refrains the system from extra mechanical or electrical energy\nsources for orbit jumps, which leads to the first self-contained solution for\nsimultaneous energy harvesting and orbit jump in nonlinear piezoelectric energy\nharvesting.

For algebras which\nare $\\tau$-tilting finite, we use these descriptions to prove that the facial\nsemistable order is a semidistributive lattice. We then show that, over any\nabelian length category, the binuclear interval order can be partitioned into a\nset of completely semidistributive lattices, one of which is the original\nlattice of torsion classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 10:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

A fundamental\naspect of TES physics that has not been investigated is the sensitivity of TESs\nto strong DC electric fields (10 kV/m and above). Understanding the resilience\nof TESs to DC electric fields is essential when considering their use as\ncharged particle spectrometers, a field in which TESs could have an enormous\nimpact. Techniques such as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy produce a high\nnumber of low-energy electrons that are not of interest and can be screened\nfrom the detector using electrostatic deflection. The use of strong electric\nfields could also provide a mass-efficient route to prevent secondary electron\nmeasurements arising from cosmic radiation in space-based TES applications.\nIntegrating electron optics into the TES membrane provides an elegant and\ncompact means to control the interaction between charged particles and the\nsensor, whether by screening unwanted particles or enhancing the particle\nabsorption efficiency but implementing such techniques requires understanding\nthe sensitivity of the TES to the resulting electric fields. In this work, we\napplied a uniform DC electric field across a Mo/Au TES using a parallel pair of\nflat electrodes positioned above and below the TES. The electric field in the\nvicinity of the TES was enhanced by the presence of silicon backing plate\ndirectly beneath the TES. Using this arrangement, we were able to apply of\nelectric fields up to 90 kV/m across the TES. We observed no electric field\nsensitivity at any field strength demonstrating the capability to use TESs in\nenvironments of strong electric fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 10:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-29"}

Observations from Parker Solar Probe (PSP)\nhave shown that they are a prevalent feature of the near-Sun solar wind.\nHowever, observations of switchbacks at 1 au and beyond are less frequent,\nsuggesting that these structures evolve and potentially erode through yet-to-be\nidentified mechanisms as they propagate away from the Sun. We analyse magnetic\nfield and plasma data from the Magnetometer and Solar Wind Analyser instruments\naboard Solar Orbiter between 10 August and 30 August 2021. During this period,\nthe spacecraft was 0.6 to 0.7 au from the Sun. We identify three instances of\nreconnection occurring at the trailing edge of magnetic switchbacks, with\nproperties consistent with existing models describing reconnection in the solar\nwind. Using hodographs and Walen analysis methods, we test for rotational\ndiscontinuities (RDs) in the magnetic field and reconnection-associated\noutflows at the boundaries of the identified switchback structures. Based on\nthese observations, we propose a scenario through which reconnection can erode\na switchback and we estimate the timescales over which this occurs. For our\nevents, the erosion timescales are much shorter than the expansion timescale\nand thus, the complete erosion of all three observed switchbacks would occur\nwell before they reach 1 au. Furthermore, we find that the spatial scale of\nthese switchbacks would be considerably larger than is typically observed in\nthe inner heliosphere if the onset of reconnection occurs close to the Sun.\nHence, our results suggest that the onset of reconnection must occur during\ntransport in the solar wind in our cases. These results suggest that\nreconnection can contribute to the erosion of switchbacks and may explain the\nrelative rarity of switchback observations at 1 au.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 10:37:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 13:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

Several\nconceptual problems have raised concerns over several decades, mainly because\nno S-matrix formulation is yet found in QFTCS. We argue that the institutional\nthinking of fixing a spacetime geometry, observers, light-cones and then\nquantizing the fields in that \"intuitively\", or \"classically\", fixed spacetime\nis the origin of the problem.

We start by\nleveraging a high-quality UV dataset of facial reflectance (diffuse and\nspecular albedo and normals), which we render under varying illumination\nsettings to simulate natural RGB textures and, then, train an unconditional\ndiffusion model on concatenated pairs of rendered textures and reflectance\ncomponents.

By sampling from the diffusion model,\nwhile retaining the observed texture part intact, the model inpaints not only\nthe self-occluded areas but also the unknown reflectance components, in a\nsingle sequence of denoising steps. In contrast to existing methods, we\ndirectly acquire the observed texture from the input image, thus, resulting in\nmore faithful and consistent reflectance estimation.

As a\nconsequence, their emergent patterns in channel networks are out of reach of\navailable theories, and lack quantitative experiments. Here, we lay out the\nbasic laws of active hydraulics.

The calculation results show that for the\ntemperature ranges of interest to us, namely 5-50 keV for D-T and 100-500 keV\nfor p-B11, these non-Maxwellian distributions can enhance the fusion\nreactivities. In the case of the drift-ring-beam distribution, the enhancement\nfactors for both reactions are affected by the perpendicular ring beam\nvelocity, leading to decreased enhancement in low temperature range and\nincreased enhancement in high temperature range. However, this effect is\nfavorable for p-B11 fusion reaction and unfavorable for D-T fusion reaction. In\nthe slowing-down distribution, the birth speed plays a crucial role in both\nreactions, and increasing birth speed leads to a shift in the enhancement\nranges towards lower temperatures, which is beneficial for both reactions.\nFinally, the kappa super-thermal distribution results in a relatively large\nenhancement in the low temperature range with a small high energy power-law\nindex {\\kappa}.

Although they\nhave drawn attention from our community, to the best of our knowledge, the NFT\nrug pulls have not been systematically explored. To fill the void, this paper\npresents the first in-depth study of NFT rug pulls. Specifically, we first\ncompile a list of 253 known NFT rug pulls as our initial ground truth, based on\nwhich we perform a pilot study, highlighting the key symptoms of NFT rug pulls.\nThen, we enforce a strict rule-based method to flag more rug pulled NFT\nprojects in the wild, and have labelled 7,487 NFT rug pulls as our extended\nground truth. Atop it, we have investigated the art of NFT rug pulls, with\nkinds of tricks including explicit ones that are embedded with backdoors, and\nimplicit ones that manipulate the market. To release the expansion of the scam,\nwe further design a prediction model to proactively identify the potential rug\npull projects in an early stage ahead of the scam happens.

In terms of\nintra-video information, current sampling operations for input videos may omit\ncritical action information, reducing the utilization efficiency of video data.\nFor the inter-video information, the action misalignment among videos makes it\nchallenging to calculate precise relationships. Moreover, how to jointly\nconsider both inter- and intra-video information remains under-explored for\nfew-shot action recognition. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Video\nInformation Maximization (VIM), for few-shot video action recognition.

To begin\naddressing this evidence gap, this study presents a measurement approach that\nuses observed digital traces to infer the current status of algorithmic\namplification of low-trust content on Twitter. Using an original dataset of 2.7\nmillion posts on COVID-19 and climate change published on the platform in a\n14-day period in January 2023, this study identifies tweets sharing information\nfrom domains rated as low-trust by IffyNews (n=74,467), and for each tweet\nauthor, compares the impressions of tweets containing low-trust information\nagainst an impressions benchmark generated from the author's timeline. To\nminimise the influence of factors traditionally understood to influence\nimpressions, the data is grouped by tweet author, and the sample is stratified\ntwice, controlling for the effect of tweet-level sentiment and engagement.\nThrough this approach, it is possible to assess whether, for any given user,\nTwitter's recommender system amplifies the impressions - and as a consequence,\nthe visibility - of potentially misleading information regardless of critical\nconfounding factors. This analysis provides observational evidence on whether\nthe Twitter algorithm favours the visibility of low-trust content, with results\nindicating that tweets containing low-trust URL domains perform significantly\nbetter than tweets that do not across all sample stratifications. This suggests\nthat in its current form, Twitter's recommender system may be facilitating the\ndiffusion of false content, even when originating from notoriously low-trust\nsources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 13:16:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 02:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-12"}

GCD is similar\nto semi-supervised learning (SSL) but is more realistic and challenging, as SSL\nassumes all the unlabelled images are from the same classes as the labelled\nones. We also do not assume the class number in the unlabelled data is known\na-priori, making the GCD problem even harder. To tackle the problem of GCD\nwithout knowing the class number, we propose an EM-like framework that\nalternates between representation learning and class number estimation. We\npropose a semi-supervised variant of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with a\nstochastic splitting and merging mechanism to dynamically determine the\nprototypes by examining the cluster compactness and separability. With these\nprototypes, we leverage prototypical contrastive learning for representation\nlearning on the partially labelled data subject to the constraints imposed by\nthe labelled data. Our framework alternates between these two steps until\nconvergence. The cluster assignment for an unlabelled instance can then be\nretrieved by identifying its nearest prototype.

An amoebot is able to send information to its\nneighbors, and to move via expansions and contractions. Since amoebots and\ninformation can only travel node by node, most problems have a natural lower\nbound of $\\Omega(D)$ where $D$ denotes the diameter of the structure. Inspired\nby the nervous and muscular system, Feldmann et al. have proposed the\nreconfigurable circuit extension and the joint movement extension of the\namoebot model with the goal of breaking this lower bound.\n  In the joint movement extension, the way amoebots move is altered. Amoebots\nbecome able to push and pull other amoebots. Feldmann et al. demonstrated the\npower of joint movements by transforming a line of amoebots into a rhombus\nwithin $O(\\log n)$ rounds. However, they left the details of the extension\nopen. The goal of this paper is therefore to formalize and extend the joint\nmovement extension. In order to provide a proof of concept for the extension,\nwe consider two fundamental problems of modular robot systems: shape formation\nand locomotion.\n  We approach these problems by defining meta-modules of rhombical and\nhexagonal shape, respectively. The meta-modules are capable of movement\nprimitives like sliding, rotating, and tunneling. This allows us to simulate\nshape formation algorithms of various modular robot systems. Finally, we\nconstruct three amoebot structures capable of locomotion by rolling, crawling,\nand walking, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 13:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

Convex\napproaches have been proven statistically optimal but suffer from high\ncomputational costs, especially since the robust loss functions are usually\nnon-smooth. More recently, computationally fast non-convex approaches via\nsub-gradient descent are proposed, which, unfortunately, fail to deliver a\nstatistically consistent estimator even under sub-Gaussian noise. In this\npaper, we introduce a projected sub-gradient descent algorithm for both the\nsparse linear regression and low-rank linear regression problems. The algorithm\nis not only computationally efficient with linear convergence but also\nstatistically optimal, be the noise Gaussian or heavy-tailed with a finite 1 +\nepsilon moment. The convergence theory is established for a general framework\nand its specific applications to absolute loss, Huber loss and quantile loss\nare investigated. Compared with existing non-convex methods, ours reveals a\nsurprising phenomenon of two-phase convergence. In phase one, the algorithm\nbehaves as in typical non-smooth optimization that requires gradually decaying\nstepsizes. However, phase one only delivers a statistically sub-optimal\nestimator, which is already observed in the existing literature. Interestingly,\nduring phase two, the algorithm converges linearly as if minimizing a smooth\nand strongly convex objective function, and thus a constant stepsize suffices.\nUnderlying the phase-two convergence is the smoothing effect of random noise to\nthe non-smooth robust losses in an area close but not too close to the truth.\nNumerical simulations confirm our theoretical discovery and showcase the\nsuperiority of our algorithm over prior methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 14:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

In\nhealthcare settings, data sharing restrictions often make it impossible to\ndirectly fit conventional risk-adjustment models on patient-level data, and\nexisting privacy-preserving approaches cannot adequately adjust for both\nobserved and unobserved cluster-level confounding factors.

These behaviors have been extensively\nstudied, notably to predict, and arguably deviate, dead-end trajectories.\nBehind the apparent complexity of such interaction networks, systems analysts\nhave identified a small group of repeated patterns in all systems, called\narchetypes. For instance, the archetype of escalation is made of two positive\nfeedback loops fueling one another and is prevalent when competition arises, as\nin arms race for instance. Interestingly, none of the known archetypes provide\nsustainability: they all trigger endless amplification. In parallel, in systems\nbiology, there has been considerable advances on incoherent loops in molecular\nnetworks in the past 20 years. Such patterns in biological networks produce\nstability and a form on intrinsic autonomy for all functions, from circadian\nrhythm to immunity.

Existing datasets and evaluations,\nexcept a few notable cases, suffer from unclear streaming task scopes,\nunderspecified benchmarks, and errors in the data. To address these issues, we\nfirstly systematize the different RDF data streaming tasks in a clear taxonomy\nand outline practical requirements for benchmark datasets.

Nevertheless, individual accumulated rewards\ncould not fully reflect how others perceive them, resulting in selfish\nbehaviors that undermine global performance. The externality theory, defined as\n``the activities of one economic actor affect the activities of another in ways\nthat are not reflected in market transactions,'' is applicable to analyze the\nsocial dilemmas in MARL. One of its most profound non-market solutions,\n``Pigovian Tax'', which internalizes externalities by taxing those who create\nnegative externalities and subsidizing those who create positive externalities,\ncould aid in developing a mechanism to resolve MARL's social dilemmas. The\npurpose of this paper is to apply externality theory to analyze social dilemmas\nin MARL. To internalize the externalities in MARL, the \\textbf{L}earning\n\\textbf{O}ptimal \\textbf{P}igovian \\textbf{T}ax method (LOPT), is proposed,\nwhere an additional agent is introduced to learn the tax/allowance allocation\npolicy so as to approximate the optimal ``Pigovian Tax'' which accurately\nreflects the externalities for all agents. Furthermore, a reward shaping\nmechanism based on the approximated optimal ``Pigovian Tax'' is applied to\nreduce the social cost of each agent and tries to alleviate the social\ndilemmas. Compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed LOPT\nleads to higher collective social welfare in both the Escape Room and the\nCleanup environments, which shows the superiority of our method in solving\nsocial dilemmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 15:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

This extension of the concept of phase\ntransitions can be brought into contact with another, namely that of\ntopological phase transitions in which the phase transition is marked by a\nchange in a topological invariant. Following a quantum quench dynamical quantum\nphase transitions can happen in topological matter, a fact which has already\nbeen explored in one dimensional topological insulators and in two dimensional\nChern insulators. Additionally in one dimensional systems a dynamical bulk\nboundary correspondence has been seen, related to the periodic appearance of\nzero modes of the Loschmidt echo itself. Here we extend both of these concepts\nto two dimensional higher order topological matter, in which the topologically\nprotected boundary modes are corner modes. We consider a minimal model which\nencompasses all possible forms of higher order topology in two dimensional\ntopological band structures. We find that DQPTs can still occur, and can occur\nfor quenches which cross both bulk and boundary gap closings. Furthermore a\ndynamical bulk boundary correspondence is also found, which takes a different\nform to that in one dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 15:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

Under such a\nparadigm, the encoder does not have access to the intended behavior of the ego\nagent, leaving the burden of finding out safety-critical regions from the\nmassive receptive field and inferring about future situations to the decoder.\nEven worse, the decoder is usually composed of several simple multi-layer\nperceptrons (MLP) or GRUs while the encoder is delicately designed (e.g., a\ncombination of heavy ResNets or Transformer). Such an imbalanced resource-task\ndivision hampers the learning process.\n  In this work, we aim to alleviate the aforementioned problem by two\nprinciples: (1) fully utilizing the capacity of the encoder; (2) increasing the\ncapacity of the decoder. Concretely, we first predict a coarse-grained future\nposition and action based on the encoder features. Then, conditioned on the\nposition and action, the future scene is imagined to check the ramification if\nwe drive accordingly. We also retrieve the encoder features around the\npredicted coordinate to obtain fine-grained information about the\nsafety-critical region. Finally, based on the predicted future and the\nretrieved salient feature, we refine the coarse-grained position and action by\npredicting its offset from ground-truth. The above refinement module could be\nstacked in a cascaded fashion, which extends the capacity of the decoder with\nspatial-temporal prior knowledge about the conditioned future. We conduct\nexperiments on the CARLA simulator and achieve state-of-the-art performance in\nclosed-loop benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the\neffectiveness of each proposed module.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 15:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

However, such\ncross-silo collaborations between platforms are restricted by increasingly\nstringent privacy protection regulations, thus data cannot be aggregated for\ntraining. Federated learning (FL) is a practical solution to deal with the data\nsilo problem in recommendation scenarios. Existing cross-silo FL methods\ntransmit model information to collaboratively build a global model by\nleveraging the data of overlapped users. However, in reality, the number of\noverlapped users is often very small, thus largely limiting the performance of\nsuch approaches. Moreover, transmitting model information during training\nrequires high communication costs and may cause serious privacy leakage. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving double distillation framework\nnamed FedPDD for cross-silo federated recommendation, which efficiently\ntransfers knowledge when overlapped users are limited. Specifically, our double\ndistillation strategy enables local models to learn not only explicit knowledge\nfrom the other party but also implicit knowledge from its past predictions.\nMoreover, to ensure privacy and high efficiency, we employ an offline training\nscheme to reduce communication needs and privacy leakage risk. In addition, we\nadopt differential privacy to further protect the transmitted information. The\nexperiments on two real-world recommendation datasets, HetRec-MovieLens and\nCriteo, demonstrate the effectiveness of FedPDD compared to the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2023 16:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-11"}

Past research also shows that\nDualism emerges, in part, via learning (e.g., Barlev & Shtulman, 2021). But\nwhether learning is sufficient to give rise to Dualism is unknown.The evidence\nfrom human learners does address this question because humans are endowed not\nonly with general learning capacities but also with core knowledge capacities.\nAnd recent results suggest that core knowledge begets Dualism (Berent, Theodore\n& Valencia, 2021; Berent, 2023). To evaluate the role of learning, here, we\nprobe for a mind-body divide in Davinci--a large language model (LLM) that is\ndevoid of any innate core knowledge. We show that Davinci still leans towards\nDualism, and that this bias increases systematically with the learner's\ninductive potential. Thus, davinci (a GPT-3 model) exhibits mild Dualist\ntendencies, whereas its descendent, text-davinci-003 (a GPT-3.5 model), shows a\nfull-blown bias. It selectively considers thoughts (epistemic states) as\ndisembodied--as unlikely to show up in the body (in the brain), but not in its\nabsence (after death). While Davinci's performance is constrained by its\nsyntactic limitations, and it differs from humans, its Dualist bias is robust.\nThese results demonstrate that the mind-body divide is partly learnable from\nexperience.They also show how, as LLM's are exposed to human narratives, they\ninduce not only human knowledge but also human biases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2023 12:28:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 21:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

This problem is societally important because it has the\npotential to improve healthcare quality and patient outcomes. However, it is\nchallenging due to the high patient-doctor ratio, the potential long medical\nhistories, the urgency of treatment for some medical conditions, and patient\nvariability. The current system provides a longitudinal view of patient medical\nhistory, which is time-consuming to browse, and doctors often need to engage\nnurses, residents, and others for initial analysis. To overcome this\nlimitation, our vision, Atlas EHR, is an alternative spatial representation of\npatients' histories (e.g., electronic health records (EHRs)) and other\nbiomedical data. Just like Google Maps allows a global, national, regional, and\nlocal view, the Atlas-EHR may start with the overview of the patient's anatomy\nand history before drilling down to spatially anatomical sub-systems, their\nindividual components, or sub-components. It will also use thoughtful\ncartography (e.g., urgency color, disease icons, and symbols) to highlight\ncritical information for improving task efficiency and decision quality,\nanalogous to how it is used in designing task-specific maps. Atlas-EHR presents\na compelling opportunity for spatial computing since health is almost a fifth\nof the US economy. However, the traditional spatial computing designed for\ngeographic use cases (e.g., navigation, land survey, mapping) faces many\nhurdles in the biomedical domain, presenting several research questions.

However, its excellent ability of fitting complex functions also\nmakes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Specifically, a backdoor can remain\nhidden indefinitely until activated by a sample with a specific trigger, which\nis hugely concealed. Nevertheless, existing backdoor attacks operate backdoors\nin spatial domain, i.e., the poisoned images are generated by adding additional\nperturbations to the original images, which are easy to detect. To bring the\npotential of backdoor attacks into full play, we propose low-pass attack, a\nnovel attack scheme that utilizes low-pass filter to inject backdoor in\nfrequency domain. Unlike traditional poisoned image generation methods, our\napproach reduces high-frequency components and preserve original images'\nsemantic information instead of adding additional perturbations, improving the\ncapability of evading current defenses. Besides, we introduce \"precision mode\"\nto make our backdoor triggered at a specified level of filtering, which further\nimproves stealthiness. We evaluate our low-pass attack on four datasets and\ndemonstrate that even under pollution rate of 0.01, we can perform stealthy\nattack without trading off attack performance.

Team communication quality with its facets\nclarity of objectives and information flow is a key coordination process to\nachieve high team performance and task satisfaction. Especially in\ninterdependent teams working in extreme environments with time-delayed\ncommunications, the team's success depends on effective communication. We\nhypothesized that communication quality affects two key team outcomes,\nperformance and task satisfaction, and that these effects can be explained by\nincreased workload (effort and frustration). Hypotheses were tested during the\nAMADEE-20 analog Mars mission of the Austrian Space Forum. The analog\nastronauts (AA) were supported by an On-Site-Support (OSS) team and a remote\nMission-Support-Centre (MSC) team. The MSC was the only contact for both AA and\nOSS, and the communication between them had a one-way delay of 10 minutes. Our\nstudy consisted of three runs in which members of each team had to exchange\ninformation to solve an interdependent task. We measured communication quality,\neffort and frustration, task satisfaction, and team performance. Results show\nthat clarity of objectives and information flow positively impacted multiteam\nsystem performance. Furthermore, clarity of objectives reduced experienced\neffort which in turn enhanced team performance. High levels of information flow\nreduced experienced frustration, in turn enhancing task satisfaction.
