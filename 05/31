The recently-developed dynamic discretization discovery\n(DDD) method allows many time-dependent problems to become more tractable by\niteratively solving instances of the problem on smaller networks where each\nnode has its own discrete set of departure times. However, in the current\nimplementation of DDD, all arcs departing a common node share the same set of\ndeparture times. This causes DDD to be ineffective for solving problems where\nall near-optimal solutions require many distinct departure times at the\nmajority of the high-degree nodes in the network.

However, RCTs are typically much smaller than observational studies\nbecause of financial and ethical considerations. Therefore it is of great\ninterest to be able to incorporate plentiful observational data into the\nanalysis of smaller RCTs. Previous estimators developed for this purpose rely\non unrealistic additional assumptions without which the added data can bias the\neffect estimate. Recent work proposed an alternative method (prognostic\nadjustment) that imposes no additional assumption and increases efficiency in\nthe analysis of RCTs. The idea is to use the observational data to learn a\nprognostic model: a regression of the outcome onto the covariates. The\npredictions from this model, generated from the RCT subjects' baseline\nvariables, are used as a covariate in a linear model. In this work, we extend\nthis framework to work when conducting inference with nonparametric efficient\nestimators in trial analysis. Using simulations, we find that this approach\nprovides greater power (i.e., smaller standard errors) than without prognostic\nadjustment, especially when the trial is small.

One main challenge in VLN is\nthe limited availability of photorealistic training environments, which makes\nit hard to generalize to new and unseen environments. To address this problem,\nwe propose PanoGen, a generation method that can potentially create an infinite\nnumber of diverse panoramic environments conditioned on text. Specifically, we\ncollect room descriptions by captioning the room images in existing\nMatterport3D environments, and leverage a state-of-the-art text-to-image\ndiffusion model to generate the new panoramic environments. We use recursive\noutpainting over the generated images to create consistent 360-degree panorama\nviews. Our new panoramic environments share similar semantic information with\nthe original environments by conditioning on text descriptions, which ensures\nthe co-occurrence of objects in the panorama follows human intuition, and\ncreates enough diversity in room appearance and layout with image outpainting.\nLastly, we explore two ways of utilizing PanoGen in VLN pre-training and\nfine-tuning. We generate instructions for paths in our PanoGen environments\nwith a speaker built on a pre-trained vision-and-language model for VLN\npre-training, and augment the visual observation with our panoramic\nenvironments during agents' fine-tuning to avoid overfitting to seen\nenvironments. Empirically, learning with our PanoGen environments achieves the\nnew state-of-the-art on the Room-to-Room, Room-for-Room, and CVDN datasets.\nPre-training with our PanoGen speaker data is especially effective for CVDN,\nwhich has under-specified instructions and needs commonsense knowledge. Lastly,\nwe show that the agent can benefit from training with more generated panoramic\nenvironments, suggesting promising results for scaling up the PanoGen\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 16:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Often, they are used for equality saturation, a\nprocess of deriving consequences through repeatedly applying universally\nquantified equality formulas via term rewriting. They handle equality reasoning\nover a large spaces of terms, but are severely limited in their handling of\ncase splitting and other types of logical cuts, especially when compared to\nother reasoning techniques such as sequent calculi and resolution. The main\ndifficulty is when equality reasoning requires multiple inconsistent\nassumptions to reach a single conclusion. Ad-hoc solutions, such as duplicating\nthe e-graph for each assumption, are available, but they are notably\nresource-intensive.\n  We introduce a key observation is that each duplicate e-graph (with an added\nassumption) corresponds to coarsened congruence relation. Based on that, we\npresent an extension to e-graphs, called Colored E-Graphs, as a way to\nrepresent all of the coarsened congruence relations in a single structure. A\ncolored e-graph is a memory-efficient equivalent of multiple copies of an\ne-graph, with a much lower overhead. This is attained by sharing as much as\npossible between different cases, while carefully tracking which conclusion is\ntrue under which assumption. Support for multiple relations can be thought of\nas adding multiple \"color-coded\" layers on top of the original e-graph\nstructure, leading to a large degree of sharing.\n  In our implementation, we introduce optimizations to rebuilding and\ne-matching.

The core issue for learning feature matching is to how to learn (1)\ndiscriminative representations for feature points (or regions) within each\nintra-image and (2) consensus representations for feature points across\ninter-images. Recently, self- and cross-attention models have been exploited to\naddress this issue. However, in many scenes, features are coming with\nlarge-scale, redundant and outliers contaminated. Previous\nself-/cross-attention models generally conduct message passing on all primal\nfeatures which thus lead to redundant learning and high computational cost. To\nmitigate limitations, inspired by recent seed matching methods, in this paper,\nwe propose a novel efficient Anchor Matching Transformer (AMatFormer) for the\nfeature matching problem. AMatFormer has two main aspects: First, it mainly\nconducts self-/cross-attention on some anchor features and leverages these\nanchor features as message bottleneck to learn the representations for all\nprimal features. Thus, it can be implemented efficiently and compactly. Second,\nAMatFormer adopts a shared FFN module to further embed the features of two\nimages into the common domain and thus learn the consensus feature\nrepresentations for the matching problem. Experiments on several benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed AMatFormer\nmatching approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 16:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-31"}

Further, we take the exponential\ntime hypothesis (ETH) into consideration and establish lower bounds of bounded\ntreewidth algorithms for PMC, yielding asymptotically tight runtime bounds of\nour algorithm. While the algorithm above serves as a first theoretical upper\nbound and although it might be quite appealing for small values of k,\nunsurprisingly a naive implementation adhering to this runtime bound suffers\nalready from instances of relatively small width. Therefore, we turn our\nattention to several measures in order to resolve this issue towards exploiting\ntreewidth in practice: We present a technique called nested dynamic\nprogramming, where different levels of abstractions of the primal graph are\nused to (recursively) compute and refine tree decompositions of a given\ninstance. Finally, we provide a nested dynamic programming algorithm and an\nimplementation that relies on database technology for PMC and a prominent\nspecial case of PMC, namely model counting (#Sat). Experiments indicate that\nthe advancements are promising, allowing us to solve instances of treewidth\nupper bounds beyond 200.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 17:02:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 00:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

The addition of Ag leads to the in-situ formation of AgSbTe$_2$\nsecondary phase nanoaggregates in the Sb$_2$Te$_3$ matrix during the growth\nresulting in a large Seebeck coefficient and reduction of the thermal\nconductivity. A series of samples with different amounts of minor AgSbTe$_2$\nphases are prepared to optimize the TE performance of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ thin films.\nBased on the experimental and theoretical evidence, it is concluded that a\nsmall concentration of Ag promotes the band flattening and induces a sharp\nresonate-like state deep inside the valence band of Sb$_2$Te$_3$, concurrently\nmodifying the density of states (DOS) of the composite sample. In addition, the\nelectrical potential barrier introduced by the band offset between the host TE\nmatrix and the secondary phases promotes strong energy-dependent carrier\nscattering in the composite sample, which is also responsible for enhanced TE\nperformance. A contemporary approach based on scanning thermal microscopy is\nperformed to experimentally obtain thermal conductivity values of both the\nin-plane and cross-plane directions, showing a reduced in-plane thermal\nconductivity value by ~ 58% upon incorporating the AgSbTe$_2$ phase in the\nSb$_2$Te$_3$ matrix.

In this work, we focus on the distinction\nbetween \\textit{internal} and \\textit{external} domination in the respective\nmaximization problem. In particular, a dominator can dominate its entire\nneighborhood in a graph, internally dominating itself, while those of its\nneighbors which are not dominators themselves are externally dominated. We\nstudy the problem of maximizing the external domination that a given number of\ndominators can yield and we present a 0.5307-approximation algorithm for this\nproblem. Moreover, our methods provide a framework for approximating a number\nof problems that can be cast in terms of external domination.

Make-A-Voice offers notable benefits as a unified voice\nsynthesis framework: 1) Data scalability: the major backbone (i.e., acoustic\nand generation stage) does not require any annotations, and thus the training\ndata could be scaled up. 2) Controllability and conditioning flexibility: we\ninvestigate different conditioning mechanisms and effectively handle three\nvoice synthesis applications, including text-to-speech (TTS), voice conversion\n(VC), and singing voice synthesis (SVS) by re-synthesizing the discrete voice\nrepresentations with prompt guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that\nMake-A-Voice exhibits superior audio quality and style similarity compared with\ncompetitive baseline models.

However, when continually\ntrained with new classes, VLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of\nformer knowledge. Applying VLMs to CIL poses two major challenges: 1) how to\nadapt the model without forgetting; and 2) how to make full use of the\nmulti-modal information. To this end, we propose PROjectiOn Fusion (PROOF) that\nenables VLMs to learn without forgetting. To handle the first challenge, we\npropose training task-specific projections based on the frozen image/text\nencoders.

For the\nsecond challenge, we propose the fusion module to better utilize the\ncross-modality information.

Multi-scale signatures, which refer to hydrological\nsignatures computed at different temporal and/or spatial scales, and\ndistributed flood modeling, which accounts for spatial variability in input\nvariables and model parameters, are important concepts in hydrological\nmodeling. In this study, the potential of using multi-scale signatures is\nexplored to enhance multi-criteria calibration methods for spatially\ndistributed flood modeling, which remains considerable challenges.

AM CVn binaries, that is, systems in which a white dwarf accretes\nmatter from a helium-rich (semi-)degenerate object, are potential progenitors\nof thermonuclear supernovae and strong sources of persistent gravitational wave\nradiation. For a long time, it has been believed that these systems cannot\ndescend from cataclysmic variables (CVs), at least not in large numbers,\nbecause the initial conditions need to be fine-tuned and, even worse, the\nresulting surface hydrogen abundance would be high enough to be detected which\ncontradicts a defining feature of AM CVn binaries.\n  Aims. Here we show that both claimed weaknesses of the CV formation channel\nfor AM CVn binaries are model-dependent and rely on poorly constrained\nassumptions for magnetic braking.\n  Methods.

We found that AM CVn binaries with extremely-low surface hydrogen\nabundances are one natural outcome of CV evolution if the donor star has\ndeveloped a non-negligible helium core prior to the onset of mass transfer. In\nthis case, after hydrogen envelope exhaustion during CV evolution, the donor\nbecomes degenerate and its surface hydrogen abundance substantially drops and\nbecomes undetectable.

However, due to the lack of reliable stellar distances, the structure and\nkinematics of the bulge/bar beyond the Galactic center have remained largely\nunexplored.

We apply this method to data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing\nExperiment (OGLE) to measure distances to $190,302$ stars in the Galactic bulge\nand beyond out to 20 kpc. Using this sample we measure a distance to the\nGalactic center of $R_0$ = $8108\\pm106_{\\rm stat}\\pm93_{\\rm sys}$ pc,\nconsistent with astrometric monitoring of stars orbiting Sgr A*.

Methods: The trade-offs are studied through end-to-end simulations of a\ntypical high-contrast imaging instrument, analytical considerations, and\natmospheric retrievals. The results are then validated with archival\nVLT/SINFONI data of the planet beta Pictoris b. Results: We show that molecular\nabsorption spectra generally have decreasing power towards higher spectral\nresolution and that molecule mapping is already powerful for moderate\nresolutions (R>300). When choosing between wavelength coverage and spectral\nresolution for a given number of spectral bins, it is best to first increase\nthe spectral resolution until R~2,000 and then maximise the bandwidth within an\nobserving band. We find that T-type companions are most easily detected in the\nJ/H band through methane and water features, while L-type companions are best\nobserved in the H/K band through water and CO features. Such an instrument does\nnot need to have a large FOV, as most of the gain in contrast is obtained in\nthe speckle-limited regime close to the star. We show that the same conclusions\nare valid for the constraints on atmospheric parameters such as the C/O ratio,\nmetallicity, surface gravity, and temperature, while higher spectral resolution\n(R~10,000) is required to constrain the radial velocity and spin of the planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 18:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

In\nthis paper, we extend high order fast sweeping methods to unstructured\ntriangular meshes by applying fixed-point iterative sweeping techniques to a\nfifth-order finite volume unstructured WENO scheme, for solving steady state\nsolutions of hyperbolic conservation laws. An advantage of fixed-point fast\nsweeping methods which distinguishes them from other fast sweeping methods is\nthat they are explicit and do not require inverse operation of nonlinear local\nsystems. As in the first order fast sweeping methods on triangular meshes, we\nintroduce multiple reference points to determine alternating sweeping\ndirections on unstructured meshes. All the cells on the mesh are ordered\naccording to their centroids' distances to those reference points, and the\nresulted orderings provide sweeping directions for iterations. To make the\nresidue of the fast sweeping iterations converge to machine zero / round off\nerrors, we follow the approach in our early work of developing the absolutely\nconvergent fixed-point fast sweeping WENO methods on rectangular meshes, and\nadopt high order WENO scheme with unequal-sized sub-stencils for spatial\ndiscretization. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to show the\naccuracy, computational efficiency, and absolute convergence of the presented\nfifth-order fast sweeping scheme on triangular meshes. Furthermore, the\nproposed method is compared with the forward Euler method and the popular third\norder total variation diminishing Rung-Kutta method for steady state\ncomputations. Numerical examples show that the developed fixed-point fast\nsweeping WENO method is the most efficient scheme among them, and especially it\ncan save up to 70% CPU time costs than TVD-RK3 to converge to steady state\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 19:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

This study investigated the plausibility of this approach and the\nmechanical advantages of the technique using finite element models. Methods:\nThe patient underwent a standard femoral endarterectomy. Prior to patch\nangioplasty, a 4.2 mm coronary vascular punch was used to created proximal and\ndistal circular arteriotomies. The idealized artery was modeled as a 9 mm\ncylinder with a central slit. The vertices of the slit were modeled as: a sharp\nV consistent with traditional linear arteriotomy, circular punched hole, and\nbeveled punched hole. The artery was pressurized to achieve displacement\nconsistent with the size of a common femoral artery prior to patch angioplasty.\nMaximum von Mises stress, area-averaged stress, and stress concentration\nfactors were evaluated for all three models. Results: Maximum von Mises stress\nwas 0.098 MPa with 5 mm of displacement and increased to 0.26 MPa with 10 mm of\ndisplacement. Maximum stress in the uniform circular model was 0.019 MPa and\n0.018 with a beveled notch. Average stress was lowest in the circular punch\nmodel at 0.006 MP and highest in the linear V notch arteriotomy at 0.010 MPa.\nStress concentration factor was significantly lower in both circular models\ncompared with the V notch. Conclusions: Femoral endarterectomy modified with\nthe creation of circular arteriotomies is a safe and effective surgical\ntechnique.

We previously reported light-flyers that\nlevitated by utilizing differences in thermal accommodation coefficient (TAC)\nbetween the top and bottom of a thin film, made possible by coating their lower\nsurfaces with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Such designs, though successful, were\nlimited due to their high thermal emissivity (>0.5), which prevented them from\nachieving high temperatures and resulted in their transferring relatively low\namounts of momentum to the surrounding gas. To address this issue, we have\ndeveloped light-flyers with undoped germanium layers that selectively absorb\nnearly 80% of visible light but are mostly transparent in the thermal infrared,\nwith an average thermal emissivity of <0.1. Our experiments show that\ngermanium-coated light-flyers could levitate at up to 43% lower light\nirradiances than mylar-CNT disks with identical sizes.

Good quadrature\nmeasurements require a high-amplitude LO and two high-efficiency photodiodes\nwhose signals are subtracted and normalized. By changing the LO phase, it is\nthen possible to infer the optical state in the mode matching the LO. For\nquantum information processing, the states of interest are in well-separated\nmodes, corresponding to a pulsed configuration with one relevant LO mode per\nmeasurement. We theoretically investigate what can be learned about the unknown\noptical state by counting photons in one or both outgoing paths after the BS,\nkeeping the LO mode fixed but choosing its phase and magnitude. We consider\nmeasurement configurations where the BS acts differently on different sets of\nmatching modes. When the BS acts identically on all matching modes it is\npossible to determine the content of the unknown optical state in the mode\nmatching the LO conditional on each number of photons in the orthogonal modes\non the same path. In particular, if both the phase and the intensity of the LO\ncan be varied, then the statistics of just one of the counters is enough to\ninfer these parameters, while in the case of an LO with fixed intensity both\ndetectors are needed to accomplish this. Our results are derived by\ndemonstrating a bijection, or lack thereof, between the probability\ndistributions over the space of outcomes of the counter(s) and certain\nparameters of the unknown state for different measurement configuration.

This paper focuses on the\ntrial site selection task and proposes FRAMM, a deep reinforcement learning\nframework for fair trial site selection. We focus on addressing two real-world\nchallenges that affect fair trial sites selection: the data modalities are\noften not complete for many potential trial sites, and the site selection needs\nto simultaneously optimize for both enrollment and diversity since the problem\nis necessarily a trade-off between the two with the only possible way to\nincrease diversity post-selection being through limiting enrollment via caps.\nTo address the missing data challenge, FRAMM has a modality encoder with a\nmasked cross-attention mechanism for handling missing data, bypassing data\nimputation and the need for complete data in training. To handle the need for\nmaking efficient trade-offs, FRAMM uses deep reinforcement learning with a\nspecifically designed reward function that simultaneously optimizes for both\nenrollment and fairness.\n  We evaluate FRAMM using 4,392 real-world clinical trials ranging from 2016 to\n2021 and show that FRAMM outperforms the leading baseline in enrollment-only\nsettings while also achieving large gains in diversity. Specifically, it is\nable to produce a 9% improvement in diversity with similar enrollment levels\nover the leading baselines. That improved diversity is further manifested in\nachieving up to a 14% increase in Hispanic enrollment, 27% increase in Black\nenrollment, and 60% increase in Asian enrollment compared to selecting sites\nwith an enrollment-only model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 20:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

While Transformers have led\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various fields with ever-larger models\nand labeled data, small-kernel ConvNets are considered more suitable for\nresource-limited applications due to the efficient convolution operation and\ncompact weight sharing. KD is widely used to boost the performance of\nsmall-kernel ConvNets. However, previous research shows that it is not quite\neffective to distill knowledge (e.g., global information) from Transformers to\nsmall-kernel ConvNets, presumably due to their disparate architectures. We\nhereby carry out a first-of-its-kind study unveiling that modern large-kernel\nConvNets, a compelling competitor to Vision Transformers, are remarkably more\neffective teachers for small-kernel ConvNets, due to more similar\narchitectures.

Resistance is often caused by genetic\nalterations such as point mutation, which refers to the modification of a\nsingle genomic base pair, or gene amplification, which refers to the\nduplication of a region of DNA that contains a gene. Here we investigate the\ndependence of tumor recurrence dynamics on these mechanisms of resistance,\nusing stochastic multi-type branching process models. We derive tumor\nextinction probabilities and deterministic estimates for the tumor recurrence\ntime, defined as the time when an initially drug sensitive tumor surpasses its\noriginal size after developing resistance. For models of amplification-driven\nand mutation-driven resistance, we prove law of large numbers results regarding\nthe convergence of the stochastic recurrence times to their mean. Additionally,\nwe prove sufficient and necessary conditions for a tumor to escape extinction\nunder the gene amplification model, discuss behavior under biologically\nrelevant parameters, and compare the recurrence time and tumor composition in\nthe mutation and amplification models both analytically and using simulations.\nIn comparing these mechanisms, we find that the ratio between recurrence times\ndriven by amplification vs. mutation depends linearly on the number of\namplification events required to acquire the same degree of resistance as a\nmutation event, and we find that the relative frequency of amplification and\nmutation events plays a key role in determining the mechanism under which\nrecurrence is more rapid. In the amplification-driven resistance model, we also\nobserve that increasing drug concentration leads to a stronger initial\nreduction in tumor burden, but that the eventual recurrent tumor population is\nless heterogeneous, more aggressive, and harbors higher levels of\ndrug-resistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 21:29:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 14:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Assuming the immense number of devices\nexchanging data in support of Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC)\napplications, the capability of the cellular infrastructure to handle a large\nnumber of real-time transmissions may be inadequate.

To\nquantify the extent to which voting rules can optimize over the cardinal\npreferences given access only to the ordinal ones, prior work has used the\ndistortion measure, i.e., the worst-case approximation ratio between a voting\nrule's performance and the best performance achievable given the cardinal\npreferences.\n  The work on the distortion of voting rules has been largely divided into two\nworlds: utilitarian distortion and metric distortion.

Dynamic sparse training (DST), as a leading sparse training\napproach, can train deep neural networks at high sparsity from scratch to match\nthe performance of their dense counterparts. However, most if not all DST prior\narts demonstrate their effectiveness on unstructured sparsity with highly\nirregular sparse patterns, which receives limited support in common hardware.\nThis limitation hinders the usage of DST in practice. In this paper, we propose\nChannel-aware dynamic sparse (Chase), which for the first time seamlessly\ntranslates the promise of unstructured dynamic sparsity to GPU-friendly\nchannel-level sparsity (not fine-grained N:M or group sparsity) during one\nend-to-end training process, without any ad-hoc operations.

By progressively identifying and removing these\nchannels during training, our approach translates unstructured sparsity to\nchannel-wise sparsity.

However, in a nonequilibrium steady state of\ndeterministic dynamics, the phase space distribution is unknown, making the\ndissipation function difficult to evaluate without extra information. As such,\nsteady state FTs for deterministic systems to date have required either that\nthe trajectory segment of interest is relatively long, or that information is\navailable about the entire trajectory surrounding that segment. In this work,\nit is shown that a simple machine learning model trained to predict whether a\ngiven steady state trajectory segment is being played forward or backward in\ntime calculates a function that satisfies an FT and relies solely on\ninformation within the segment of interest. The FT is satisfied even for very\nshort trajectory segments where the approximate relation derived from theory\nbreaks down, for systems far from equilibrium, and for various nonequilibrium\ndynamics. It is further demonstrated that any function that is a\nwell-calibrated predictor of time's arrow must satisfy a fluctuation theorem,\nand that a local FT can be derived which depends only on local dissipation and\nits correlations with the surrounding non-local dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2023 23:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

Positional encoding (PE) has been identified\nas a major factor influencing length generalization, but the exact impact of\ndifferent PE schemes on extrapolation in downstream tasks remains unclear. In\nthis paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study comparing the length\ngeneralization performance of decoder-only Transformers with five different\nposition encoding approaches including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's\nRelative PE, ALiBi, and Rotary, in addition to Transformers without positional\nencoding (NoPE). Our evaluation encompasses a battery of reasoning and\nmathematical tasks. Our findings reveal that the most commonly used positional\nencoding methods, such as ALiBi, Rotary, and APE, are not well suited for\nlength generalization in downstream tasks. More importantly, NoPE outperforms\nother explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional\ncomputation. We theoretically demonstrate that NoPE can represent both absolute\nand relative PEs, but when trained with SGD, it mostly resembles T5's relative\nPE attention patterns. Finally, we find that scratchpad is not always helpful\nto solve length generalization and its format highly impacts the model's\nperformance.

We propose an MRI-to-CT transformer-based\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model (MC-DDPM) to transform MRI into\nhigh-quality sCT to facilitate radiation treatment planning. MC-DDPM implements\ndiffusion processes with a shifted-window transformer network to generate sCT\nfrom MRI. The proposed model consists of two processes: a forward process which\nadds Gaussian noise to real CT scans, and a reverse process in which a\nshifted-window transformer V-net (Swin-Vnet) denoises the noisy CT scans\nconditioned on the MRI from the same patient to produce noise-free CT scans.\nWith an optimally trained Swin-Vnet, the reverse diffusion process was used to\ngenerate sCT scans matching MRI anatomy. We evaluated the proposed method by\ngenerating sCT from MRI on a brain dataset and a prostate dataset. Qualitative\nevaluation was performed using the mean absolute error (MAE) of Hounsfield unit\n(HU), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), multi-scale Structure Similarity index\n(MS-SSIM) and normalized cross correlation (NCC) indexes between ground truth\nCTs and sCTs.

This leaves the\nunderstanding of the relations between different fairness notions as an\nimportant open problem in fair clustering. In this paper, we take the first\nstep in this direction. Specifically, we consider the two most prominent\ndemographic representation fairness notions in clustering: (1) Group Fairness\n(GF), where the different demographic groups are supposed to have close to\npopulation-level representation in each cluster and (2) Diversity in Center\nSelection (DS), where the selected centers are supposed to have close to\npopulation-level representation of each group. We show that given a constant\napproximation algorithm for one constraint (GF or DS only) we can obtain a\nconstant approximation solution that satisfies both constraints simultaneously.\nInterestingly, we prove that any given solution that satisfies the GF\nconstraint can always be post-processed at a bounded degradation to the\nclustering cost to additionally satisfy the DS constraint while the reverse is\nnot true. Furthermore, we show that both GF and DS are incompatible (having an\nempty feasibility set in the worst case) with a collection of other\ndistance-based fairness notions. Finally, we carry experiments to validate our\ntheoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 01:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

While it has been effective for an unsupervised setup, it\ntends to struggle in a supervised setup with a task reward, where an agent\nprefers to visit high-value states to exploit the task reward. Such a\npreference can cause an imbalance between the distributions of high-value\nstates and low-value states, which biases exploration towards low-value state\nregions as a result of the state entropy increasing when the distribution\nbecomes more uniform. This issue is exacerbated when high-value states are\nnarrowly distributed within the state space, making it difficult for the agent\nto complete the tasks. In this paper, we present a novel exploration technique\nthat maximizes the value-conditional state entropy, which separately estimates\nthe state entropies that are conditioned on the value estimates of each state,\nthen maximizes their average. By only considering the visited states with\nsimilar value estimates for computing the intrinsic bonus, our method prevents\nthe distribution of low-value states from affecting exploration around\nhigh-value states, and vice versa. We demonstrate that the proposed alternative\nto the state entropy baseline significantly accelerates various reinforcement\nlearning algorithms across a variety of tasks within MiniGrid, DeepMind Control\nSuite, and Meta-World benchmarks.

Arguably the\nmost realistic and coincidentally challenging type of label noise is the\ninstance-dependent noise (IDN), where the labelling errors are caused by the\nambivalent information present in the images. The most successful label noise\nlearning techniques to address IDN problems usually contain a noisy-label\nsample selection stage to separate clean and noisy-label samples during\ntraining. Such sample selection depends on a criterion, such as loss or\ngradient, and on a curriculum to define the proportion of training samples to\nbe classified as clean at each training epoch.\n  Even though the estimated noise rate from the training set appears to be a\nnatural signal to be used in the definition of this curriculum, previous\napproaches generally rely on arbitrary thresholds or pre-defined selection\nfunctions to the best of our knowledge.

Attack path analysis helps organizations to identify\nnew/unknown chains of attack vectors that reach critical assets within the\nnetwork, as opposed to individual attack vectors in signature-based attack\nanalysis. Timely identification of attack paths enables proactive mitigation of\nthreats. Nevertheless, manual analysis of complex network configurations,\nvulnerabilities, and security events to identify attack paths is rarely\nfeasible. This work proposes a novel transferable graph neural network-based\nmodel for shortest path identification. The proposed shortest path detection\napproach, integrated with a novel holistic and comprehensive model for\nidentifying potential network vulnerabilities interactions, is then utilized to\ndetect network attack paths. Our framework automates the risk assessment of\nattack paths indicating the propensity of the paths to enable the compromise of\nhighly-critical assets (e.g., databases) given the network configuration,\nassets' criticality, and the severity of the vulnerabilities in-path to the\nasset.

In CVSNet, blocks\ndiffers from each other and visual information flows through three independent\npathways and five different blocks. Thus CVSNet is completely different from\nthe design of all previous models, in which basic blocks are repeated to build\nmodel and information between channels is mixed at the outset. In ablation\nexperiment, we show the information extracted by blocks in CVSNet and compare\nwith previous networks, proving effectiveness and rationality of blocks in\nCVSNet from experiment side. And in the experiment of object recognition,\nCVSNet achieves comparable results to ConvNets, Vision Transformers and MLPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 02:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

Most DSR models use merely\nthe target sequences as supervision without considering other related\nsequences, leading to over-confidence in their predictions. The DSR models\ntrained with label smoothing regularize labels by equally and independently\nsmoothing each token, reallocating a small value to other tokens for mitigating\noverconfidence. However, they do not consider tokens/sequences correlations\nthat may provide more effective information to regularize training and thus\nlead to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we find tokens/sequences with\nhigh perception and semantic correlations with the target ones contain more\ncorrelated and effective information and thus facilitate more effective\nregularization. To this end, we propose a Perception and Semantic aware\nSequence Regularization framework, which explore perceptively and semantically\ncorrelated tokens/sequences as regularization.

An open-source design\ntoolbox SPADA (Soft Pneumatic Actuator Design frAmework) is also developed to\nfacilitate the use of the proposed design framework, including FEM simulation,\nshape-matching optimisation based on surrogate modelling, and automatic\ngeneration of the ready-to-print CAD file. Experimental results show an\naveraged root-mean-square error of 2.74 mm, validating the accuracy of the\nkinematics model. To demonstrate the proposed design framework, actuators are\ndesigned to match the predefined shapes in 2D and 3D space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 02:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

To alleviate this\nproblem, we develop a new posterior sampling method that is based on modeling\nthe prior and likelihood in the space of the Fourier transform of the image.\nOne advantage of Fourier-based methods is that many spatially correlated\nprocesses in image space can be represented via independent processes over\nFourier space.

In this paper, we hypothesize that the\nemergence of this phenomenon may be attributed to the susceptibility of the\nembedding layer to overfitting, which can stem from the high-dimensional\nsparsity of data. To maintain feature sparsity while simultaneously avoiding\noverfitting of embeddings, we propose a novel Multi-Epoch learning with Data\nAugmentation (MEDA), which can be directly applied to most deep CTR models.\nMEDA achieves data augmentation by reinitializing the embedding layer in each\nepoch, thereby avoiding embedding overfitting and simultaneously improving\nconvergence.

Although much progress has been made in terms of\nvisual quality, lip synchronization, and facial motion of the talking face,\ncurrent works still struggle to overcome issues of crude and asynchronous lip\nmovement, which can result in puppetry-like animation. We identify that the\nprior works commonly correlate lip movement with audio at the phone level.\nHowever, due to co-articulation, where an isolated phone is influenced by the\npreceding or following phones, the articulation of a phone varies upon the\nphonetic context. Therefore, modeling lip motion with the phonetic context can\ngenerate more spatio-temporally aligned and stable lip movement. In this\nrespect, we investigate the phonetic context in lip motion for authentic\ntalking face generation. We propose a Context-Aware Lip-Sync framework (CALS),\nwhich leverages phonetic context to generate more spatio-temporally aligned and\nstable lip movement. The CALS comprises an Audio-to-Lip module and a\nLip-to-Face module. The former explicitly maps each phone to a contextualized\nlip motion unit, which guides the latter in synthesizing a target identity with\ncontext-aware lip motion. In addition, we introduce a discriminative sync\ncritic that enforces accurate lip displacements within the phonetic context\nthrough audio-visual sync loss and visual discriminative sync loss. From\nextensive experiments on LRW, LRS2, and HDTF datasets, we demonstrate that the\nproposed CALS effectively enhances spatio-temporal alignment, greatly improving\nupon the state-of-the-art on visual quality, lip-sync quality, and realness.\nFinally, we show the authenticity of the generated video through a lip\nreadability test and achieve 97.7% of relative word prediction accuracy to real\nvideos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 04:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

To tackle the challenge of extreme domain\nshift scenarios where only healthy data is available in the target domain, this\npaper proposes two novel domain knowledge-informed data synthesis methods\nutilizing the health data map (HDMap). The two proposed approaches are referred\nto as scaled CutPaste and FaultPaste.

In addition to generating realistic faults, the proposed\nmethods introduce scaling of fault signatures for controlled synthesis of\nfaults with various severity levels. A case study is conducted on a planetary\ngearbox testbed to evaluate the proposed approaches.

In light of the power of the\nclosed-form solution to OICA corresponding to the One-Latent-Component\nstructure, we formulate a way to estimate the mixing matrix using the\nhigher-order cumulants, and further propose the testable One-Latent-Component\ncondition to identify the latent variables and determine causal orders. By\niteratively removing the share identified latent components, we successfully\nextend the results on the One-Latent-Component structure to the\nMulti-Latent-Component structure and finally provide a practical and\nasymptotically correct algorithm to learn the causal structure with latent\nvariables. Experimental results illustrate the asymptotic correctness and\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 05:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

This partial two-tower architecture bridges the gap between a Dual\nEncoder's ability to pre-compute representations for segments and a fully\nself-attentive Transformer's capacity to model cross-segment attention.

We utilize a\nsoftware supply chain attack dataset known as ClaMP and develop two distinct\nmodels for QNN and NN, employing Pennylane for quantum implementations and\nTensorFlow and Keras for traditional implementations.

In this paper,\nwe propose FineRewards to improve the alignment between text and images in\ntext-to-image diffusion models by introducing two new fine-grained semantic\nrewards: the caption reward and the Semantic Segment Anything (SAM) reward.\nFrom the global semantic view, the caption reward generates a corresponding\ndetailed caption that depicts all important contents in the synthetic image via\na BLIP-2 model and then calculates the reward score by measuring the similarity\nbetween the generated caption and the given prompt. From the local semantic\nview, the SAM reward segments the generated images into local parts with\ncategory labels, and scores the segmented parts by measuring the likelihood of\neach category appearing in the prompted scene via a large language model, i.e.,\nVicuna-7B. Additionally, we adopt an assemble reward-ranked learning strategy\nto enable the integration of multiple reward functions to jointly guide the\nmodel training. Adapting results of text-to-image models on the MS-COCO\nbenchmark show that the proposed semantic reward outperforms other baseline\nreward functions with a considerable margin on both visual quality and semantic\nsimilarity with the input prompt.

In practice, there can often be\nsubstantial heterogeneity (e.g., class imbalance) across the local data\ndistributions observed by each of these clients. Under such non-iid data\ndistributions across clients, FL suffers from the 'client-drift' problem where\nevery client converges to its own local optimum. This results in slower\nconvergence and poor performance of the aggregated model. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel regularization technique based on adaptive\nself-distillation (ASD) for training models on the client side. Our\nregularization scheme adaptively adjusts to the client's training data based\non: (1) the closeness of the local model's predictions with that of the global\nmodel and (2) the client's label distribution.

To tackle this problem, we propose a modified framework called\nCompatible Performance Control (CPC), which integrates the Prescribed\nPerformance Control (PPC) scheme with a contradiction detection and alleviation\nstrategy. Firstly, by introducing the Zeroing Barrier Function (ZBF) concept,\nwe propose a detection strategy to yield judgment on the compatibility between\nthe angular velocity constraint and the performance envelope constraint.\nSubsequently, we propose a projection operator-governed dynamical system with a\nvarying upper bound to generate an appropriate bounded performance\nenvelope-modification signal if a contradiction exists, thereby alleviating the\ncontradiction and promoting compatibility within the system. Next, a dynamical\nfilter technique is introduced to construct a bounded reference velocity signal\nto address the angular velocity limitation. Furthermore, we employ a\ntime-varying gain technique to address the challenge posed by time-varying\nparameter uncertainties, further developing an adaptive strategy that exhibits\nrobustness on disturbance rejection. By utilizing the proposed CPC scheme and\ntime-varying gain adaptive strategy, we construct an adaptive CPC controller,\nwhich guarantees the ultimate boundedness of the system, and all constraints\nare satisfied simultaneously during the whole control process.

We measure their halo occupation functions and fit the\nHOD parameters to study their evolution over cosmic time. The TNG300 galaxy\npopulation strongly depends on the baryonic physics implemented in the\nsimulation. In contrast, the galaxy population predicted by a basic SHAM model\nwithout scatter is a direct result of the cosmology of the dark matter\nsimulation.

The rule picks an\narbitrary candidate for whom a certain candidate-specific bipartite graph\ncontains a perfect matching, and thus, it is not neutral (i.e, symmetric with\nrespect to candidates). Subsequently, a much simpler rule called Plurality Veto\nwas shown to achieve distortion 3 as well. This rule only constructs such a\nmatching implicitly but the winner depends on the order that voters are\nprocessed, and thus, it is not anonymous (i.e., symmetric with respect to\nvoters).\n  We provide an intuitive interpretation of this matching by generalizing the\nclassical notion of the (proportional) veto core in social choice theory. This\ninterpretation opens up a number of immediate consequences. Previous methods\nfor electing a candidate from the veto core can be interpreted simply as\nmatching algorithms. Different election methods realize different matchings, in\nturn leading to different sets of candidates as winners. For a broad\ngeneralization of the veto core, we show that the generalized veto core is\nequal to the set of candidates who can emerge as winners under a natural class\nof matching algorithms reminiscent of Serial Dictatorship.\n  Extending these matching algorithms into continuous time, we obtain a highly\npractical voting rule with optimal distortion 3, which is also intuitive and\neasy to explain: Each candidate starts off with public support equal to his\nplurality score. From time 0 to 1, every voter continuously brings down, at\nrate 1, the support of her bottom choice among not-yet-eliminated candidates. A\ncandidate is eliminated if he is opposed by a voter after his support reaches\n0. On top of being anonymous and neutral, this rule satisfies many other axioms\ndesirable in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 07:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

When truncation is a\nresult of data collection in a restricted time period, the truncation age is\nequivalent to the date of birth. The independence assumption is then at odds\nwith any demographic progress when life expectancy increases with time, with\nevidence e.g. on human demography in western civilisations. We model dependence\nwith a Gumbel copula. Marginally, it is assumed that the duration of interest\nis exponentially distributed, and that births stem from a homogeneous Poisson\nprocess. The log-likelihood of the data, considered as truncated sample, is\nderived from standard results for point processes. Testing for positive\ndependence must include that the hypothetical independence is associated with\nthe boundary of the parameter space. By non-standard theory, the maximum\nlikelihood estimator of the exponential and the Gumbel parameter is distributed\nas a mixture of a two- and a one-dimensional normal distribution. For the\nproof, the third parameter, the unobserved sample size, is profiled out.\nFurthermore, verifying identification is simplified by noting that the score of\nthe profile model for the truncated sample is equal to the score for a simple\nsample from the truncated population.

These two \"phases\" are separated by the change in stability of\nthe central fixed-point, with the resulting window of instability being\nresponsible for the diversity of the generated samples. Using both theoretical\nand empirical evidence, we show that an accurate simulation of the early\ndynamics does not significantly contribute to the final generation, since early\nfluctuations are reverted to the central fixed point. To leverage this insight,\nwe propose a Gaussian late initialization scheme, which significantly improves\nmodel performance, achieving up to 3x FID improvements on fast samplers, while\nalso increasing sample diversity (e.g., racial composition of generated CelebA\nimages). Our work offers a new way to understand the generative dynamics of\ndiffusion models that has the potential to bring about higher performance and\nless biased fast-samplers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 09:36:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2023 04:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

Hence, HTL is highly beneficial\nfor real-world applications relying on big data. The analysis of such a method\nfrom a theoretical perspective faces multiple challenges, particularly in\nclassification tasks. This paper deals with this problem by studying the\nlearning theory of HTL through algorithmic stability, an attractive theoretical\nframework for machine learning algorithms analysis. In particular, we are\ninterested in the statistical behaviour of the regularized empirical risk\nminimizers in the case of binary classification. Our stability analysis\nprovides learning guarantees under mild assumptions. Consequently, we derive\nseveral complexity-free generalization bounds for essential statistical\nquantities like the training error, the excess risk and cross-validation\nestimates. These refined bounds allow understanding the benefits of transfer\nlearning and comparing the behaviour of standard losses in different scenarios,\nleading to valuable insights for practitioners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 09:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

The inverse optimization process of FWI is based\non forward and backward solutions of the (elastic or acoustic) eave equation.\nIn a previous paper [1], we explored opportunities of using the finite cell\nmethod (FCM) as the wave field solver to incorporate highly complex geometric\nmodels. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the identification of the model's\ndensity outperforms that of the velocity -- particularly in cases where unknown\nvoids characterized by homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions need to be\ndetected. The paper at hand extends this previous study: The isogeometric\nfinite cell analysis (IGA-FCM) -- a combination of isogeometric analysis (IGA)\nand FCM -- is applied for the wave field solver, with the advantage that the\npolynomial degree and subsequently also the sampling frequency of the wave\nfield can be increased quite easily.

After a recent update of the\nexperimental analysis, in which the full Run 2 data collected at 13 TeV has\nbeen included and an improved experimental calibration has been applied, the\nlocal significance of the excess amounts to $2.9\\sigma$. The presence of this\ndiphoton excess is especially interesting in view of a further excess observed\nby CMS in ditau final states at a comparable mass and similar local\nsignificance. Moreover, an excess of events with about $2\\sigma$ local\nsignificance and consistent with a mass of 95 GeV was observed in LEP searches\nfor a Higgs boson decaying to pairs of bottom quarks.

It is well known that image deblurring is mathematically modeled as\nan ill-posed inverse problem and its solution is difficult to approximate when\nnoise affects the data. Really, one limitation of neural networks for\ndeblurring is their sensitivity to noise and other perturbations, which can\nlead to instability and produce poor reconstructions. In addition, networks do\nnot necessarily take into account the numerical formulation of the underlying\nimaging problem, when trained end-to-end. In this paper, we propose some\nstrategies to improve stability without losing to much accuracy to deblur\nimages with deep-learning based methods. First, we suggest a very small neural\narchitecture, which reduces the execution time for training, satisfying a green\nAI need, and does not extremely amplify noise in the computed image. Second, we\nintroduce a unified framework where a pre-processing step balances the lack of\nstability of the following, neural network-based, step. Two different\npre-processors are presented: the former implements a strong parameter-free\ndenoiser, and the latter is a variational model-based regularized formulation\nof the latent imaging problem. This framework is also formally characterized by\nmathematical analysis. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the\naccuracy and stability of the proposed approaches for image deblurring when\nunknown or not-quantified noise is present; the results confirm that they\nimprove the network stability with respect to noise. In particular, the\nmodel-based framework represents the most reliable trade-off between visual\nprecision and robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 12:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

To this\nend, we consider optimizing for different production requirements from the\nviewpoint of a framework for system flexibility that allows us to study the\nability of an algorithm to transfer solutions from previous optimization tasks,\nwhich also relates to dynamic evolutionary optimization.

Existing\nsupervised and unsupervised methods both suffer from the large variance of\nobject sizes and the difficulty in scale selection, which often result in poor\nsegmentation accuracies. To address the above challenges, we propose a deep\nlearning-based region-merging method (DeepMerge) to handle the segmentation in\nlarge VHR images by integrating a Transformer with a multi-level embedding\nmodule, a segment-based feature embedding module and a region-adjacency graph\nmodel. In addition, we propose a modified binary tree sampling method to\ngenerate multi-level inputs from initial segmentation results, serving as\ninputs for the DeepMerge model. To our best knowledge, the proposed method is\nthe first to use deep learning to learn the similarity between adjacent\nsegments for region-merging. The proposed DeepMerge method is validated using a\nremote sensing image of 0.55m resolution covering an area of 5,660 km^2\nacquired from Google Earth. The experimental results show that the proposed\nDeepMerge with the highest F value (0.9446) and the lowest TE (0.0962) and ED2\n(0.8989) is able to correctly segment objects of different sizes and\noutperforms all selected competing segmentation methods from both quantitative\nand qualitative assessments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 12:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

Beyond its\nfundamental theoretical interest, designing a photonic AXI offers the potential\nto enable the development of magnetically-tunable photonic switch devices\nthrough the manipulation of the axionic modes and their chiral propagation\nusing external magnetic fields. Motivated by these facts, in this work, we\npropose a novel approach to induce axionic band topology in gyrotropic 3D Weyl\nphotonic crystals gapped by supercell modulation.

They are composed of an active polymer matrix and\na liquid solvent. Their contraction kinetics is governed by two dynamic\nphenomena: mechanotransduction (molecular motor activation), and solvent\ndiffusion. In this paper, we solve the transient problem for the simple case of\na thin gel slab in uniaxial contraction under two extreme conditions:\nmotor-limited or slow motor activation (SM) regime, and diffusion-limited or\nfast motor activation (FM) regime. The former occurs when diffusion is much\nfaster than mechanotransduction, while the latter occurs in the opposite case.\nWe observe that in the SM regime, the contraction time scales as t/t_0 ~\n(l/l_0)^(-3), with t_0 the nominal contraction time, and l and l_0 are the\nfinal and initial stretches of the slab. t_0 is proportional to 1/w, where w is\nthe average mechanical power generated by the molecular motors per unit\nreference (dry polymer) volume. In the FM regime, the contraction time scales\nas t/t_1 ~ (1-l/l_0)^2, with t_1 the nominal contraction time, here\nproportional to the ratio L^2/D, where L is the reference (dry polymer)\nthickness, and D is the diffusivity of the solvent in the gel. The transition\nbetween the SM and FM regimes is defined by a characteristic power density w^*,\nwhere w << w^* gives the SM regime and w >> w^* gives the FM regime.\nIntuitively, w^* is proportional to D/L^2, where, at a given power density w, a\nthinner gel slab (smaller L) or including smaller solvent molecules (higher D)\nis more likely to be in the SM regime given that solvent diffusion will occur\nfaster than motor activation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 13:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

Due to the recent experimental\nrealization of atomic arrays at sub-wavelength spacings, collective interaction\neffects such as superradiance have regained substantial interest. Their\nanalytical and numerical treatment is however quite challenging. Here we\ndevelop a semiclassical approach to this problem that allows to describe the\ncoherent and dissipative many-body dynamics of interacting spins while taking\ninto account lowest-order quantum fluctuations. For this purpose we extend the\ndiscrete truncated Wigner approximation, originally developed for unitarily\ncoupled spins, to include collective, dissipative spin processes by means of\ntruncated correspondence rules. This maps the dynamics of the atomic ensemble\nonto a set of semiclassical, numerically inexpensive stochastic differential\nequations. We benchmark our method with exact results for the case of Dicke\ndecay, which shows excellent agreement. We then study superradiance in a\nspatially extended three-dimensional, coherently driven gas and study the\ndynamics of atomic arrays coupled to the quantized radiation field. For small\narrays we compare to exact simulations, again showing good agreement at early\ntimes and at moderate to strong driving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 13:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

We validate three state-of-the-art PLMs across encoder-,\ndecoder-, and encoder-decoder-based models.

SNNs also replace weight multiplications in\nANNs with additions, which are more energy-efficient and less computationally\nintensive. However, it remains a challenge to train deep SNNs due to the\ndiscrete spike function. A popular approach to circumvent this challenge is\nANN-to-SNN conversion. However, due to the quantization error and accumulating\nerror, it often requires lots of time steps (high inference latency) to achieve\nhigh performance, which negates SNN's advantages. To this end, this paper\nproposes Fast-SNN that achieves high performance with low latency. We\ndemonstrate the equivalent mapping between temporal quantization in SNNs and\nspatial quantization in ANNs, based on which the minimization of the\nquantization error is transferred to quantized ANN training. With the\nminimization of the quantization error, we show that the sequential error is\nthe primary cause of the accumulating error, which is addressed by introducing\na signed IF neuron model and a layer-wise fine-tuning mechanism.

A potential solution lies in the combination\nof datasets from various language communities. Nevertheless, the main challenge\nstems from the complexity of integrating diverse syntax and semantics,\nlanguage-specific medical terminology, and culture-specific implicit knowledge.\nTherefore, one crucial aspect to consider is the presence of community bias\ncaused by different languages. This paper presents a novel framework named\nUnifying Cross-Lingual Medical Vision-Language Pre-Training (Med-UniC),\ndesigned to integrate multimodal medical data from the two most prevalent\nlanguages, English and Spanish. Specifically, we propose Cross-lingual Text\nAlignment Regularization (CTR) to explicitly unify cross-lingual semantic\nrepresentations of medical reports originating from diverse language\ncommunities.

Furthermore, it ensures that the\ncross-lingual representation is not biased toward any specific language\ncommunity.

In this work, we for the first time propose\na challenging argument quadruplet extraction task (AQE), which can provide an\nall-in-one extraction of four argumentative components, i.e., claims, evidence,\nevidence types, and stances. To support this task, we construct a large-scale\nand challenging dataset. However, there is no existing method that can solve\nthe argument quadruplet extraction.

Biopsy of small prostate cancers is improved with image-guided\nbiopsy. MRI-ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy is sensitive to smaller tumors but\nis underutilized due to the high cost of MRI and fusion equipment.\nMicro-ultrasound (micro-US), a novel high-resolution ultrasound technology,\nprovides a cost-effective alternative to MRI while delivering comparable\ndiagnostic accuracy. However, the interpretation of micro-US is challenging due\nto subtle gray scale changes indicating cancer vs normal tissue. This challenge\ncan be addressed by training urologists with a large dataset of micro-US images\ncontaining the ground truth cancer outlines. Such a dataset can be mapped from\nsurgical specimens (histopathology) onto micro-US images via image\nregistration. In this paper, we present a semi-automated pipeline for\nregistering in vivo micro-US images with ex vivo whole-mount histopathology\nimages. Our pipeline begins with the reconstruction of pseudo-whole-mount\nhistopathology images and a 3D micro-US volume. Each pseudo-whole-mount\nhistopathology image is then registered with the corresponding axial micro-US\nslice using a two-stage approach that estimates an affine transformation\nfollowed by a deformable transformation. We evaluated our registration pipeline\nusing micro-US and histopathology images from 18 patients who underwent radical\nprostatectomy. The results showed a Dice coefficient of 0.94 and a landmark\nerror of 2.7 mm, indicating the accuracy of our registration pipeline. This\nproof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately aligning\nmicro-US and histopathology images. To promote transparency and collaboration\nin research, we will make our code and dataset publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 15:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

We combine LOFAR and uGMRT observations at 144 and 400 MHz\nto study the flux density and spectral index profiles of the radio tails of 7\ngalaxies in Abell 2255, and use the model to reproduce the flux density and\nspectral index profiles, and infer the stripped radio plasma velocity. For 5\nout of 7 galaxies we observe monotonic decrease in both flux density and\nspectral index up to $~30$ kpc from their stellar disk.

This result represents the first indirect measure of the\nstripped, nonthermal interstellar medium velocity. The observed spectral index\ntrends indicate that the synchrotron cooling is faster than the adiabatic\nexpansion losses, thus suggesting that the stripped radio plasma can survive\nfor a few tens of Myr outside of the stellar disk. This provides a lower limit\nfor the lifetime of the stripped ISM outside of the disk.

Methods: We focus on the\nstructure of $^{11}$Be and $^{17}$C with two core+valence models: Nilsson and a\nsemi-microscopic particle-rotor model using Antisymmetrized Molecular Dinamic\ncalculations of the cores. These models are later used to study\n$^{16}$C(d,p)$^{17}$C and $^{11}$Be(p,d)$^{10}$Be transfer reactions within the\nAdiabatic Distorted Wave Approximation.

This paper proposes\na deep learning approach for automated, fast, and accurate prostate\nsegmentation on micro-US images. Prostate segmentation on micro-US is\nchallenging due to artifacts and indistinct borders between the prostate,\nbladder, and urethra in the midline. We introduce MicroSegNet, a multi-scale\nannotation-guided Transformer UNet model to address this challenge. During the\ntraining process, MicroSegNet focuses more on regions that are hard to segment\n(challenging regions), where expert and non-expert annotations show\ndiscrepancies. We achieve this by proposing an annotation-guided cross entropy\nloss that assigns larger weight to pixels in hard regions and lower weight to\npixels in easy regions. We trained our model using micro-US images from 55\npatients, followed by evaluation on 20 patients. Our MicroSegNet model achieved\na Dice coefficient of 0.942 and a Hausdorff distance of 2.11 mm, outperforming\nseveral state-of-the-art segmentation methods, as well as three human\nannotators with different experience levels.

Dealing with the relationship between the\ntwo sub-tasks plays a pivotal role in designing effective spotters. Although\nTransformer-based methods eliminate the heuristic post-processing, they still\nsuffer from the synergy issue between the sub-tasks and low training\nefficiency. In this paper, we present DeepSolo, a simple DETR-like baseline\nthat lets a single decoder with explicit points solo for text detection and\nrecognition simultaneously and efficiently. Technically, for each text\ninstance, we represent the character sequence as ordered points and model them\nwith learnable explicit point queries. After passing a single decoder, the\npoint queries have encoded requisite text semantics and locations. Furthermore,\nwe show the surprisingly good extensibility of our method, in terms of\ncharacter class, language type, and task. On the one hand, DeepSolo not only\nperforms well in English scenes but also masters the Chinese transcription with\ncomplex font structure and a thousand-level character classes. On the other\nhand, based on the extensibility of DeepSolo, we launch DeepSolo++ for\nmultilingual text spotting, making a further step to let Transformer decoder\nwith explicit points solo for multilingual text detection, recognition, and\nscript identification all at once. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our simple approach achieves better training efficiency\ncompared with Transformer-based models and outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art.

To see the spatial and temporal occurrence of such ice\npatches, optical images should be searched for and checked. Previously a manual\nimage analysis was conducted on 110 images from the southern hemisphere,\ncaptured by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera\nonboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter space mission. Out of these, 37 images\nwere identified with smaller ice patches, which were distinguishable by their\nbrightness, colour and strong connection to local topographic shading.

Synthetic datasets have\nemerged as a solution, even though current synthesis methods present other\ndrawbacks such as limited intra-class variations, lack of realism, and unfair\nrepresentation of demographic groups. This study introduces GANDiffFace, a\nnovel framework for the generation of synthetic datasets for face recognition\nthat combines the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion\nmodels to overcome the limitations of existing synthetic datasets. In\nGANDiffFace, we first propose the use of GANs to synthesize highly realistic\nidentities and meet target demographic distributions.

We generate multiple synthetic datasets by changing\nGANDiffFace settings, and compare their mated and non-mated score distributions\nwith the distributions provided by popular real-world datasets for face\nrecognition, i.e. VGG2 and IJB-C. Our results show the feasibility of the\nproposed GANDiffFace, in particular the use of Diffusion models to enhance the\n(limited) intra-class variations provided by GANs towards the level of\nreal-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 15:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-01"}

Heart disease is one of the common diseases\nthat can be considered a significant cause of mortality worldwide. Early\ndetection of heart disease significantly helps in reducing the risk of heart\nfailure. Consequently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nconducts a health-related telephone survey yearly from over 400,000\nparticipants. However, several concerns arise regarding the reliability of the\ndata in predicting heart disease and whether all of the survey questions are\nstrongly related. This study aims to utilize several machine learning\ntechniques, such as support vector machines and logistic regression, to\ninvestigate the accuracy of the CDC's heart disease survey in the United\nStates. Furthermore, we use various feature selection methods to identify the\nmost relevant subset of questions that can be utilized to forecast heart\nconditions. To reach a robust conclusion, we perform stability analysis by\nrandomly sampling the data 300 times. The experimental results show that the\nsurvey data can be useful up to 80% in terms of predicting heart disease, which\nsignificantly improves the diagnostic process before bloodwork and tests.

Compared to DRO, the\nnew formulation -- minimax excess risk optimization (MERO) has the advantage of\nsuppressing the effect of heterogeneous noise in different distributions.\nHowever, the choice of excess risk leads to a very challenging minimax\noptimization problem, and currently there exists only an inefficient algorithm\nfor empirical MERO. In this paper, we develop efficient stochastic\napproximation approaches which directly target MERO. Specifically, we leverage\ntechniques from stochastic convex optimization to estimate the minimal risk of\nevery distribution, and solve MERO as a stochastic convex-concave optimization\n(SCCO) problem with biased gradients. The presence of bias makes existing\ntheoretical guarantees of SCCO inapplicable, and fortunately, we demonstrate\nthat the bias, caused by the estimation error of the minimal risk, is\nunder-control. Thus, MERO can still be optimized with a nearly optimal\nconvergence rate. Moreover, we investigate a practical scenario where the\nquantity of samples drawn from each distribution may differ, and propose a\nstochastic approach that delivers distribution-dependent convergence rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 02:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-02"}

The most\ncelebrated radiative shift is the Lamb shift between the $2S_{1/2}$ and the\n$2P_{1/2}$ levels of the hydrogen atom.~The measurement of this shift in 1947\nby Willis Lamb Jr. proved that the prediction by Dirac theory that the energy\nlevels were degenerate was incorrect. Hans~Bethe's calculation of the shift\ndemonstrated the renormalization process required to deal with the divergences\nplaguing the existing theories and led to the understanding that it was\nessential for theory to include interactions with the zero-point quantum vacuum\nfield. This was the birth of modern quantum electrodynamics (QED). Other\ncalculations of the Lamb shift followed by Welton and Power in an effort to\nclarify the physical mechanisms leading to the shift. We have done a\ncalculation of the shift using a group theoretical approach which gives the\nshift as an integral over frequency of a function, which we call the spectral\ndensity of the shift. The spectral density reveals how different frequencies\ncontribute to the total energy shift. We find, for example, that half the\nradiative shift for the ground state 1S level in H comes from photon energies\nbelow 9700 eV, and that the expressions by Power and Welton do not have the\ncorrect low frequency behavior, although they do give approximately the correct\nvalue for the total shift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2023 01:45:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-05"}

It was first introduced in the context of viral marketing,\nwhere a company pays a few influencers to promote the product. However, apart\nfrom the cost factor, the capacity of individuals to consume content poses\nchallenges for implementing IM in real-world scenarios. For example, players on\nonline gaming platforms can only interact with a limited number of friends. In\naddition, we observe that in these scenarios, (i) the initial adopters of\npromotion are likely to be the friends of influencers rather than the\ninfluencers themselves, and (ii) existing IM solutions produce sub-par results\nwith high computational demands. Motivated by these observations, we propose a\nnew IM variant called capacity constrained influence maximization (CIM), which\naims to select a limited number of influential friends for each initial adopter\nsuch that the promotion can reach more users. To solve CIM effectively, we\ndesign two greedy algorithms, MG-Greedy and RR-Greedy, ensuring the\n$1/2$-approximation ratio. To improve the efficiency, we devise the scalable\nimplementation named RR-OPIM+ with $(1/2-\\epsilon)$-approximation and\nnear-linear running time. We extensively evaluate the performance of 9\napproaches on 6 real-world networks, and our solutions outperform all\ncompetitors in terms of result quality and running time.

The Ferris\nFMR also expanded the resonance linewidth such that the sensitivity to spin\ncurrents was enhanced as well. Eventually, the spin Hall angle ({\\theta}_SH)\nwas measurable even in wafer-level measurements that require low current\ndensities to reduce the Joule heating. Despite the various advantages, analysis\nof the Ferris FMR response is limited to numerical modeling where the linewidth\ndepends on multiple factors such as the field modulation profile and the\nmagnetization saturation.

However, in the presence of\nintricate constraints, e.g., users' quality-of-service (QoS) constraints,\nguaranteeing constraint satisfaction becomes a fundamental challenge. In this\npaper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework to solve the\nclassical power control problem in a multi-user interference channel, where the\nobjective is to maximize the network sumrate under users' minimum data rate or\nQoS requirements and power budget constraints. Utilizing a differentiable\nprojection function, two novel deep learning (DL) solutions are pursued. The\nfirst is called Deep Implicit Projection Network (DIPNet), and the second is\ncalled Deep Explicit Projection Network (DEPNet). DIPNet utilizes a\ndifferentiable convex optimization layer to implicitly define a projection\nfunction. On the other hand, DEPNet uses an explicitly-defined projection\nfunction, which has an iterative nature and relies on a differentiable\ncorrection process. DIPNet requires convex constraints; whereas, the DEPNet\ndoes not require convexity and has a reduced computational complexity. To\nenhance the sum-rate performance of the proposed models even further,\nFrank-Wolfe algorithm (FW) has been applied to the output of the proposed\nmodels.
