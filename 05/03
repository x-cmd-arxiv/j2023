Our method extends\nthe state-of-the-art text-to-motion synthesis model TEMOS, and incorporates a\ncontrastive loss to better structure the cross-modal latent space. We show that\nmaintaining the motion generation loss, along with the contrastive training, is\ncrucial to obtain good performance. We introduce a benchmark for evaluation and\nprovide an in-depth analysis by reporting results on several protocols. Our\nextensive experiments on the KIT-ML and HumanML3D datasets show that TMR\noutperforms the prior work by a significant margin, for example reducing the\nmedian rank from 54 to 19.

Most of\nexisting EA methods usually explore the correlation between entities and\nrelations through neighbor nodes, structural information and external\nresources. However, the complex intrinsic interactions among triple elements\nand role information are rarely modeled in these methods, which may lead to the\ninadequate illustration for triple. In addition, external resources are usually\nunavailable in some scenarios especially cross-lingual and cross-domain\napplications, which reflects the little scalability of these methods. To tackle\nthe above insufficiency, a novel universal EA framework (OTIEA) based on\nontology pair and role enhancement mechanism via triple-aware attention is\nproposed in this paper without introducing external resources. Specifically, an\nontology-enhanced triple encoder is designed via mining intrinsic correlations\nand ontology pair information instead of independent elements. In addition, the\nEA-oriented representations can be obtained in triple-aware entity decoder by\nfusing role diversity. Finally, a bidirectional iterative alignment strategy is\ndeployed to expand seed entity pairs. The experimental results on three\nreal-world datasets show that our framework achieves a competitive performance\ncompared with baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 16:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

The interactions between the\nparticles and the time-averaged (steady streaming) flow lead to the formation\nof either one-particle-thick chains or multiple-particle-wide bands, depending\non the oscillatory conditions. Both the chains and the bands are oriented\nperpendicular to the direction of oscillation with a regular spacing between\nthem. For all our experiments, this spacing is only a function of the relative\nparticle-fluid excursion length normalized by the particle diameter, $A_r/D$,\nimplying that it is an intrinsic quantity that is established only by the\nhydrodynamics. In contrast, the width of the bands depends on both $A_r/D$ and\nthe confinement, characterized by the particle coverage fraction $\\phi$. Using\nthe relation for the chain spacing, we accurately predict the transition from\none-particle-thick chains to wider bands as a function of $\\phi$ and $A_r/D$.\nOur experimental results are complemented with numerical simulations in which\nthe flow around the particles is fully resolved. These simulations show that\nthe regular chain spacing arises from the balance between long-range attractive\nand short-range repulsive hydrodynamic interactions, caused by the vortices in\nthe steady streaming flow. We further show that these vortices induce an\nadditional attractive interaction at very short range when $A_r/D\\gtrsim0.7$,\nwhich stabilizes the multiple-particle-wide bands.

Like\nQUMOND, these GQUMOND theories require solving only the linear Poisson equation\n(twice). Unlike QUMOND, their Lagrangian depends on higher derivatives of the\nNewtonian potential. They thus dictate different ``phantom'' densities as\nvirtual sources in the Poisson equation for the MOND potential. These theories\nmight open new avenues to more fundamental theories, and have much heuristic\nvalue. I use them to demonstrate that even within limited classes of\nmodified-gravity formulations of MOND, theories can differ substantially on\nlower-tier MOND predictions. Such GQUMOND theories force, generically, the\nintroduction of dimensioned constants other than the MOND acceleration, $a_0$,\nsuch as a length, a frequency, etc. As a result, some of these theories reduce\nto QUMOND itself only, e.g., on length scales (or, in other versions, dynamical\ntimes) larger than some critical value. But in smaller systems (or,\nalternatively, in ones with shorter dynamical times), MOND effects are\nscreened, even if their internal accelerations are smaller than $a_0$. In such\ntheories it is possible that MOND (expressed as QUMOND) applies on galactic\nscales, but its departures from Newtonian dynamics are substantially suppressed\nin some subgalactic systems -- such as binary stars, and open, or globular star\nclusters. The same holds for the effect of the galactic field on dynamics in\nthe inner solar system, which can be greatly suppressed compared with what\nQUMOND predicts. Tidal effects of a galaxy on smaller subsystems are the same\nas in QUMOND, for the examples I consider.

However, true reciprocity\nonly exists in time division duplex (TDD). In this paper, we propose a novel\ntracking method that exploits implicit reciprocity in FDD line-of-sight (LOS)\nchannels as in low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom). This\nchannel reciprocity, dubbed pseudo-reciprocity, is crucial for applying\nmultiple-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) to SatCom, which\nrequires CSIT. We consider an LEO SatCom system where multiple satellites\ncommunicate with a multi-antenna land terminal (LT). In this innovative method,\nthe LT can track the downlink channel changes and use them to estimate the\nuplink channels. The proposed method achieves precoding performance that is\ncomparable to precoding with full CSIT knowledge. Furthermore, the use of\npseudo reciprocity typically requires only initial CSIT feedback when the\nsatellite rises. Over very long periods of time, pseudo reciprocity can fail as\na result of phase ambiguity, which is referred to as cycle slip. We thus also\npresent a closed-form approximation for the expected time until cycle slip,\nwhich indicates that in normal operating conditions, these cycle slips are\nextremely rare.

Existing methods to reduce uncertainty typically\nfocus on iteratively improving specificity in the overall task instruction.\nHowever, uncertainty can arise from multiple sources, such as ambiguity of the\nitem being judged due to limited context, or disagreements among the\nparticipants due to different perspectives and an under-specified task. A\none-size-fits-all intervention may be ineffective if it is not targeted to the\nright source of uncertainty. In this paper we introduce a new workflow,\nJudgment Sieve, to reduce uncertainty in tasks involving group judgment in a\ntargeted manner. By utilizing measurements that separate different sources of\nuncertainty during an initial round of judgment elicitation, we can then select\na targeted intervention adding context or deliberation to most effectively\nreduce uncertainty on each item being judged. We test our approach on two\ntasks: rating word pair similarity and toxicity of online comments, showing\nthat targeted interventions reduced uncertainty for the most uncertain cases.\nIn the top 10% of cases, we saw an ambiguity reduction of 21.4% and 25.7%, and\na disagreement reduction of 22.2% and 11.2% for the two tasks respectively.

Perfusion\navoids overfitting by introducing a new mechanism that \"locks\" new concepts'\ncross-attention Keys to their superordinate category. Additionally, we develop\na gated rank-1 approach that enables us to control the influence of a learned\nconcept during inference time and to combine multiple concepts. This allows\nruntime-efficient balancing of visual-fidelity and textual-alignment with a\nsingle 100KB trained model, which is five orders of magnitude smaller than the\ncurrent state of the art. Moreover, it can span different operating points\nacross the Pareto front without additional training. Finally, we show that\nPerfusion outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative\nterms. Importantly, key-locking leads to novel results compared to traditional\napproaches, allowing to portray personalized object interactions in\nunprecedented ways, even in one-shot settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 17:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-03"}

In recent years, quantum\ncomputing has shown promise for speeding up Monte Carlo integration, and\nseveral quantum algorithms have been proposed to achieve this goal. In this\npaper, we present an application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Grover's\namplification algorithm to build a new tool for estimating Monte Carlo\nintegrals. Our method, which we call Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude\nEstimation (QFIAE), decomposes the target function into its Fourier series\nusing a Parametrized Quantum Circuit (PQC), specifically a Quantum Neural\nNetwork (QNN), and then integrates each trigonometric component using Iterative\nQuantum Amplitude Estimation (IQAE). This approach builds on Fourier Quantum\nMonte Carlo Integration (FQMCI) method, which also decomposes the target\nfunction into its Fourier series, but QFIAE avoids the need for numerical\nintegration of Fourier coefficients. This approach reduces the computational\nload while maintaining the quadratic speedup achieved by IQAE. To evaluate the\nperformance of QFIAE, we apply it to a test function that corresponds with a\nparticle physics scattering process and compare its accuracy with other quantum\nintegration methods and the analytic result. Our results show that QFIAE\nachieves comparable accuracy while being suitable for execution on real\nhardware. We also demonstrate how the accuracy of QFIAE improves by increasing\nthe number of terms in the Fourier series. In conclusion, QFIAE is a promising\nend-to-end quantum algorithm for Monte Carlo integrals that combines the power\nof PQC with Fourier analysis and IQAE to offer a new approach for efficiently\napproximating integrals with high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

By\nVizing's celebrated theorem, any graph of maximum degree $\\Delta$ needs at\nleast $\\Delta$ and at most $(\\Delta + 1)$ colors to be properly edge colored.\nIn this paper, we study edge colorings in the streaming setting. The edges\narrive one by one in an arbitrary order. The algorithm takes a single pass over\nthe input and must output a solution using a much smaller space than the input\nsize. Since the output of edge coloring is as large as its input, the assigned\ncolors should also be reported in a streaming fashion.\n  The streaming edge coloring problem has been studied in a series of works\nover the past few years. The main challenge is that the algorithm cannot\n\"remember\" all the color assignments that it returns. To ensure the validity of\nthe solution, existing algorithms use many more colors than Vizing's bound.\nNamely, in $n$-vertex graphs, the state-of-the-art algorithm with\n$\\widetilde{O}(n s)$ space requires $O(\\Delta^2/s + \\Delta)$ colors. Note, in\nparticular, that for an asymptotically optimal $O(\\Delta)$ coloring, this\nalgorithm requires $\\Omega(n\\Delta)$ space which is as large as the input.\nWhether such a coloring can be achieved with sublinear space has been left\nopen.\n  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative. We present a\nrandomized algorithm that returns an asymptotically optimal $O(\\Delta)$ edge\ncoloring using $\\widetilde{O}(n \\sqrt{\\Delta})$ space. More generally, our\nalgorithm returns a proper $O(\\Delta^{1.5}/s + \\Delta)$ edge coloring with\n$\\widetilde{O}(n s)$ space, improving prior algorithms for the whole range of\n$s$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 18:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Part II then evaluates cell dose\nenhancement factors across macroscopic length scales. Methods: Different\nmethods of modeling gold within cells are compared: a contiguous volume of\neither pure gold or gold-tissue mixture or discrete GNPs. MC simulations with\nEGSnrc are performed to calculate n,cDEF for a cell considering 10 to 370 keV\nincident photons, gold concentrations from 4 to 24~mg of gold per gram, and\nthree different GNP configurations: GNPs distributed around the surface of the\nnucleus or packed into one or four endosomes. Results: n,cDEFs are sensitive to\nthe model of gold in the cell, with differences of up to 17% observed between\nmodels.

Results: Intrinsic variations in n,cDEFs can be substantial with\nchanges in GNP uptake and cell/nucleus radii. In HetMS models of tumors,\nsub-unity n,cDEFs (dose decreases) can occur for low energies and high gold\nconcentrations due to attenuation of primary photons through the gold. In HetMS\nsimulations of tumors with spatially-uniform gold concentrations, n,cDEFs\ndecrease with depth into the tumor as photons are attenuated, with relative\ndifferences between GNP models remaining approximately constant with depth in\nthe tumor. Similar initial n,cDEF decreases with radius are seen in tumors with\nspatially-varying gold concentrations, but n,cDEFs for all configurations\nconverge to a single value for each energy as gold concentration reaches zero.\nConclusions: These results demonstrate that cellular doses are highly sensitive\nto cell/nucleus size, GNP intracellular distribution, gold concentration, and\ncell position in the tumor. This work demonstrates the importance of proper\nchoice of computational model when simulating GNPT scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 19:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Population heterogeneities in underlying\n(pre-vaccination) susceptibility and vaccine response can cause measured\nvaccine effectiveness (mVE) to change over time even in the absence of pathogen\nevolution and any actual waning of immune responses. We use a multi-scale\nagent-based models parameterized using epidemiological and immunological data,\nto investigate the effect of these heterogeneities on mVE as measured by the\nhazard ratio. Based on our previous work, we consider waning of antibodies\naccording to a power law and link it to protection in two ways: 1) motivated by\ncorrelates of risk data and 2) using a within-host model of stochastic viral\nextinction. The effect of the heterogeneities is given by concise and\nunderstandable formulas, one of which is essentially a generalization of\nFisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection to include higher\nderivatives. Heterogeneity in underlying susceptibility accelerates apparent\nwaning, whereas heterogeneity in vaccine response slows down apparent waning.\nOur models suggest that heterogeneity in underlying susceptibility is likely to\ndominate. However, heterogeneity in vaccine response offsets <10% to >100%\n(median of 29%) of this effect in our simulations. Our methodology and results\nmay be helpful in understanding competing heterogeneities and waning of\nimmunity and vaccine-induced protection.

From modeling actual microscopic (and smaller) robots, to\nmodeling software processes on a network, many important problems have been\nstudied in this context. Gathering is one such fundamental problem in this\narea. The problem of gathering $k$ robots, initially arbitrarily placed on the\nnodes of an $n$-node graph, asks that these robots coordinate and communicate\nin a local manner, as opposed to global, to move around the graph, find each\nother, and settle down on a single node as fast as possible. A more difficult\nproblem to solve is gathering with detection, where once the robots gather,\nthey must subsequently realize that gathering has occurred and then terminate.\n  In this paper, we propose a deterministic approach to solve gathering with\ndetection for any arbitrary connected graph that is faster than existing\ndeterministic solutions for even just gathering (without the requirement of\ndetection) for arbitrary graphs. In contrast to earlier work on gathering, it\nleverages the fact that there are more robots present in the system to achieve\ngathering with detection faster than those previous papers that focused on just\ngathering. The state of the art solution for deterministic gathering~[Ta-Shma\nand Zwick, TALG, 2014] takes $\\Tilde{O}$$(n^5 \\log \\ell)$ rounds, where $\\ell$\nis the smallest label among robots and $\\Tilde{O}$ hides a polylog factor. We\ndesign a deterministic algorithm for gathering with detection with the\nfollowing trade-offs depending on how many robots are present: (i) when $k \\geq\n\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor + 1$, the algorithm takes $O(n^3)$ rounds, (ii) when $k\n\\geq \\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor + 1$, the algorithm takes $O(n^4 \\log n)$ rounds, and\n(iii) otherwise, the algorithm takes $\\Tilde{O}$$(n^5)$ rounds. The algorithm\nis not required to know $k$, but only $n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 19:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Antibiograms\nhelp clinicians to understand regional resistance rates and select appropriate\nantibiotics in prescriptions. In practice, significant combinations of\nantibiotic resistance may appear in different antibiograms, forming antibiogram\npatterns. Such patterns may imply the prevalence of some infectious diseases in\ncertain regions. Thus it is of crucial importance to monitor antibiotic\nresistance trends and track the spread of multi-drug resistant organisms. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel problem of antibiogram pattern prediction that\naims to predict which patterns will appear in the future. Despite its\nimportance, tackling this problem encounters a series of challenges and has not\nyet been explored in the literature. First of all, antibiogram patterns are not\ni.i.d as they may have strong relations with each other due to genomic\nsimilarities of the underlying organisms. Second, antibiogram patterns are\noften temporally dependent on the ones that are previously detected.\nFurthermore, the spread of antibiotic resistance can be significantly\ninfluenced by nearby or similar regions. To address the above challenges, we\npropose a novel Spatial-Temporal Antibiogram Pattern Prediction framework,\nSTAPP, that can effectively leverage the pattern correlations and exploit the\ntemporal and spatial information.

Due to the nonpharmaceutical\nintervention (NPI) imposed in the COVID-19 outbreak, the seasonal transmission\npattern of RSV has been discontinued in 2020 and then shifted months ahead in\n2021 in the northern hemisphere. It is critical to understand how COVID-19\nimpacts RSV and build predictive algorithms to forecast the timing and\nintensity of RSV reemergence in post-COVID-19 seasons. In this paper, we\npropose a deep coupled tensor factorization machine, dubbed as DeCom, for post\nCOVID-19 RSV prediction. DeCom leverages tensor factorization and residual\nmodeling. It enables us to learn the disrupted RSV transmission reliably under\nCOVID-19 by taking both the regular seasonal RSV transmission pattern and the\nNPI into consideration. Experimental results on a real RSV dataset show that\nDeCom is more accurate than the state-of-the-art RSV prediction algorithms and\nachieves up to 46% lower root mean square error and 49% lower mean absolute\nerror for country-level prediction compared to the baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 20:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

While there has been much progress made for deterministic interacting\nsystems, modeling is much more challenging for stochastic systems in which one\nis interested in obtaining a predictive distribution over future trajectories.\nExisting methods are either computationally slow since they rely on Monte Carlo\nsampling or make simplifying assumptions such that the predictive distribution\nis unimodal. In this work, we present a deep state-space model which employs\ngraph neural networks in order to model the underlying interacting dynamical\nsystem. The predictive distribution is multimodal and has the form of a\nGaussian mixture model, where the moments of the Gaussian components can be\ncomputed via deterministic moment matching rules. Our moment matching scheme\ncan be exploited for sample-free inference, leading to more efficient and\nstable training compared to Monte Carlo alternatives. Furthermore, we propose\nstructured approximations to the covariance matrices of the Gaussian components\nin order to scale up to systems with many agents.

The proposed technique, Intrinsic\nLocal Polynomial Regression on IRMs (ILPR-IRMs), enables global data mapping\nbetween Riemannian manifolds while preserving underlying geometries. The ILPR\nmethod is generalized to handle multivariate covariates on any Riemannian\nmanifold and isometry. Specifically, for manifolds equipped with Euclidean\nPullback Metrics (EPMs), a closed analytical formula is derived for the\nmultivariate ILPR (ILPR-EPM). Asymptotic statistical properties of the ILPR-EPM\nfor the multivariate local linear case are established, including a formula for\nthe asymptotic bias, establishing estimator consistency. The paper showcases\npossible applications of the method by focusing on a group of Riemannian\nmetrics on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold, which arises in\nmachine learning and neuroscience. It is demonstrated that several metrics on\nthe SPD manifold are EPMs, resulting in a closed analytical expression for the\nmultivariate ILPR estimator on the SPD manifold. The paper evaluates the ILPR\nestimator's performance under two specific EPMs, Log-Cholesky and\nLog-Euclidean, on simulated data on the SPD manifold and compares it with\nextrinsic LPR using the Affine-Invariant when scaling the manifold and\ncovariate dimension. The results show that the ILPR using the Log-Cholesky\nmetric is computationally faster and provides a better trade-off between error\nand time than other metrics. Finally, the Log-Cholesky metric on the SPD\nmanifold is employed to implement an efficient and intrinsic version of Rie-SNE\nfor visualizing high-dimensional SPD data. The code for implementing ILPR-EPMs\nand other relevant calculations is available on the GitHub page.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2023 21:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

By analyzing the Fourier\nspectra of images drawn from different data distributions, we show how one can\nchain together two independent conditional diffusion models for use in domain\ntranslation. The resulting transformation is a diffusion bridge between a low\nresolution and a high resolution dataset and allows for new sample generation\nof high-resolution images given specific low resolution features. The ability\nto generate new samples allows for the computation of any statistic of\ninterest, without any additional calibration or training. Our unsupervised\nsetup is also designed to downscale images without access to paired training\ndata; this flexibility allows for the combination of multiple source and target\ndomains without additional training. We demonstrate that the method enhances\nresolution and corrects context-dependent biases in geophysical fluid\nsimulations, including in extreme events.

This involves analyzing\na vector of exposures rather than a single exposure, with the most significant\nexposure sets being unknown. Examining every possible interaction or effect\nmodification in a high-dimensional vector of candidates can be challenging or\neven impossible. To address this challenge, we propose a method for the\nautomatic identification and estimation of exposure sets in a mixture with\nexplanatory power, baseline covariates that modify the impact of an exposure\nand sets of exposures that have synergistic non-additive relationships. We\ndefine these parameters in a realistic nonparametric statistical model and use\nmachine learning methods to identify variables sets and estimate nuisance\nparameters for our target parameters to avoid model misspecification.

To address these issues,\nwe propose a framework called Imperceptible DocumEnt Manipulation (IDEM) to\nproduce adversarial documents that are less noticeable to both algorithms and\nhumans. IDEM instructs a well-established generative language model, such as\nBART, to generate connection sentences without introducing easy-to-detect\nerrors, and employs a separate position-wise merging strategy to balance\nrelevance and coherence of the perturbed text. Experimental results on the\npopular MS MARCO benchmark demonstrate that IDEM can outperform strong\nbaselines while preserving fluency and correctness of the target documents as\nevidenced by automatic and human evaluations.

To\neffectively walk the tight-rope between safety and performance, AVs need to be\nrisk-averse, but not entirely risk-avoidant. To facilitate safe-yet-performant\ndriving, in this paper, we develop a task-aware risk estimator that assesses\nthe risk a perception failure poses to the AV's motion plan. If the failure has\nno bearing on the safety of the AV's motion plan, then regardless of how\negregious the perception failure is, our task-aware risk estimator considers\nthe failure to have a low risk; on the other hand, if a seemingly benign\nperception failure severely impacts the motion plan, then our estimator\nconsiders it to have a high risk. In this paper, we propose a task-aware risk\nestimator to decide whether a safety maneuver needs to be triggered. To\nestimate the task-aware risk, first, we leverage the perception failure -\ndetected by a perception monitor - to synthesize an alternative plausible model\nfor the vehicle's surroundings. The risk due to the perception failure is then\nformalized as the \"relative\" risk to the AV's motion plan between the perceived\nand the alternative plausible scenario. We employ a statistical tool called\ncopula, which models tail dependencies between distributions, to estimate this\nrisk. The theoretical properties of the copula allow us to compute probably\napproximately correct (PAC) estimates of the risk. We evaluate our task-aware\nrisk estimator using NuPlan and compare it with established baselines, showing\nthat the proposed risk estimator achieves the best F1-score (doubling the score\nof the best baseline) and exhibits a good balance between recall and precision,\ni.e., a good balance of safety and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 03:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs)\nhave been widely used in text-based concept extraction (CE). However, PLMs tend\nto mine the co-occurrence associations from massive corpus as pre-trained\nknowledge rather than the real causal effect between tokens. As a result, the\npre-trained knowledge confounds PLMs to extract biased concepts based on\nspurious co-occurrence correlations, inevitably resulting in low precision. In\nthis paper, through the lens of a Structural Causal Model (SCM), we propose\nequipping the PLM-based extractor with a knowledge-guided prompt as an\nintervention to alleviate concept bias. The prompt adopts the topic of the\ngiven entity from the existing knowledge in KGs to mitigate the spurious\nco-occurrence correlations between entities and biased concepts.

Motivated by applications in\nDNA-nanotechnology, investigations in algorithmic tile-based self-assembly have\nblossomed into a mature theory with research leveraging tools from\ncomputability theory, complexity theory, information theory, and graph theory\nto develop a wide range of models and show that many are computationally\nuniversal, while also exposing powers and limitations of each. Beyond\ncomputational universality, the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) was shown\nto be intrinsically universal (IU), a strong notion of completeness where a\nsingle tile set is capable of simulating all systems within the model; however,\nthis result required non-deterministic tile attachments. This was later\nconfirmed necessary when it was shown that the class of directed aTAM systems\nis not IU. Building on these results to further investigate the impacts of\nother dynamics, Hader et al. examined several tile-assembly models which varied\nacross (1) the numbers of dimensions used, (2) restrictions based on diffusion\nof tiles through space, and (3) whether each system is directed, and showed\nwhich models are IU.

SiSeRO is a\nnovel on-chip charge detector output stage for charge-coupled device (CCD)\nimage sensors, developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. This technology uses a\np-MOSFET transistor with a depleted internal gate beneath the transistor\nchannel. The transistor source-drain current is modulated by the transfer of\ncharge into the internal gate. RNDR was realized by transferring the signal\ncharge non-destructively between the internal gate and the summing well (SW),\nwhich is the last serial register. The advantage of the non-destructive charge\ntransfer is that the signal charge for each pixel can be measured at the end of\neach transfer cycle and by averaging for a large number of measurements\n($\\mathrm{N_{cycle}}$), the total noise can be reduced by a factor of\n1/$\\mathrm{\\sqrt{N_{cycle}}}$.

Traditional\ninference methods for geostatistical modelling are notoriously computationally\nintensive, motivating the development of newer, approximate methods. The appeal\nof faster methods is particularly great as the size of the region and number of\nspatial locations being modelled increases.\n  Methods We present an applied comparison of four proposed `fast'\ngeostatistical modelling methods and the software provided to implement them --\nIntegrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), tree boosting with Gaussian\nprocesses and mixed effect models (GPBoost), Fixed Rank Kriging (FRK) and\nSpatial Random Forests (SpRF). We illustrate the four methods by estimating\nmalaria prevalence on two different spatial scales -- country and continent. We\ncompare the performance of the four methods on these data in terms of accuracy,\ncomputation time, and ease of implementation.\n  Results Two of these methods -- SpRF and GPBoost -- do not scale well as the\ndata size increases, and so are likely to be infeasible for larger-scale\nanalysis problems.

While the Radiative\nAlignment Torque (RAT) mechanism provides a theoretical framework to this\nphenomenon, some aspects of this alignment mechanism still need to be\nquantitatively tested. One such aspect is the possibility that the reference\nalignment direction changes from the magnetic field (\"B-RAT\") to the radiation\nfield k-vector (\"k-RAT\") in areas of strong radiation fields. We investigate\nthis transition toward the Orion Bar PDR, using multi-wavelength SOFIA HAWC+\ndust polarization observations. The polarization angle maps show that the\nradiation field direction is on average not the preferred grain alignment axis.\nWe constrain the grain sizes for which the transition from B-RAT to k-RAT occur\nin the Orion Bar (grains > 0.1 {\\mu}m toward the most irradiated locations),\nand explore the radiatively driven rotational disruption that may take place in\nthe high-radiation environment of the Bar for large grains. While the grains\nsusceptible to rotational disruption should be in supra-thermal rotation and\naligned with the magnetic field, k-RAT aligned grains would rotate at thermal\nvelocities. We find that the grain size at which the alignment shifts from\nB-RAT to k-RAT corresponds to grains too large to survive the rotational\ndisruption. Therefore, we expect a large fraction of grains to be aligned at\nsupra-thermal rotation with the magnetic field, and potentially be subject to\nrotational disruption depending on their tensile strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 05:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

This task requires a machine to describe the\ntransformation that occurred between every two adjacent states (i.e. images) in\na series. Unlike most existing visual reasoning tasks that focus on state\nreasoning, VTT emphasizes transformation reasoning. We collected 13,547 samples\nfrom two instructional video datasets, CrossTask and COIN, and extracted\ndesired states and transformation descriptions to create a suitable VTT\nbenchmark dataset. Humans can naturally reason from superficial states\ndifferences (e.g. ground wetness) to transformations descriptions (e.g.\nraining) according to their life experience but how to model this process to\nbridge this semantic gap is challenging. We designed TTNet on top of existing\nvisual storytelling models by enhancing the model's state-difference\nsensitivity and transformation-context awareness. TTNet significantly\noutperforms other baseline models adapted from similar tasks, such as visual\nstorytelling and dense video captioning, demonstrating the effectiveness of our\nmodeling on transformations.

Modern computer vision\nalgorithms relying on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have proven capable of\nundertaking this task even under resource-constrained and embedded execution\nscenarios, e.g., as is the case with fast, single-stage, anchor-based object\ndetectors.

A comprehensive understanding of\nthe response of urban and rural areas to HWs, considering the underlying cause\nof surface energy budget changes, remains elusive. This study attempts to\naddress this gap by investigating a 2020 HW event in the Greater Sydney Area\nusing the Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Findings\nindicate that the HW intensifies the nighttime surface UHI by approximately\n4{\\deg}C. An analysis of surface energy budgets reveals that urban areas store\nmore heat during the HW due to receiving more solar radiation and less\nevapotranspiration compared to rural areas. The maximum heat storage flux in\nurban during the HW can be around 200 W/m2 higher than that during post-HW. The\nstored heat is released at nightime, raising the air temperature in the urban\nareas. Forests and savannas have relatively lower storage heat fluxes due to\nhigh transpiration and albedo, and the maximum heat storage flux is only around\n50 W/m2 higher than that during post-HW. In contrast, a negative synergistic\neffect is detected between the 2-m UHI and HW. This may be because other\nmeteorological conditions including wind have substantial impacts on the air\ntemperature pattern. The strong hot and dry winds coming from the west and the\nproximity of tall buildings to the coast diminish the sea breeze coming from\nthe east, resulting in a higher air temperature in the western urban district.\nMeanwhile, the western forest area also experiences higher temperatures due to\nthe westward winds. In addition, changes in wind direction alter the\ntemperature distribution in the northern rural region. Based on the present\nstudy, urban climate simulation data and associated findings can be used to\ndevelop urban heat mitigation strategies for UHI during HW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 07:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

The modelling encompasses properties of the\ninput data used for training the models, the cognitive hypotheses and their\nalgorithmic implementations being tested, and the evaluation methodologies to\ncompare models to human data. Recent developments have enabled the use of more\nnaturalistic training data for computational models. This also motivates\ndevelopment of more naturalistic tests of model behaviour. A crucial step\ntowards such an aim is to develop representative speech datasets consisting of\nspeech heard by infants in their natural environments. However, a major\ndrawback of such recordings is that they are typically noisy, and it is\ncurrently unclear how the sound quality could affect analyses and modelling\nexperiments conducted on such data. In this paper, we explore this aspect for\nthe case of infant-directed speech (IDS) and adult-directed speech (ADS)\nanalysis. First, we manually and automatically annotated audio quality of\nutterances extracted from two corpora of child-centred long-form recordings (in\nEnglish and French). We then compared acoustic features of IDS and ADS in an\nin-lab dataset and across different audio quality subsets of naturalistic data.\nFinally, we assessed how the audio quality and recording environment may change\nthe conclusions of a modelling analysis using a recent self-supervised learning\nmodel. Our results show that the use of modest and high audio quality\nnaturalistic speech data result in largely similar conclusions on IDS and ADS\nin terms of acoustic analyses and modelling experiments. We also found that an\nautomatic sound quality assessment tool can be used to screen out useful parts\nof long-form recordings for a closer analysis with comparable results to that\nof manual quality annotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 08:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Species distribution models and maps from large-scale biodiversity data\nare necessary for conservation management. One current issue is that\nbiodiversity data are prone to taxonomic misclassifications. Methods to account\nfor these misclassifications in multispecies distribution models have assumed\nthat the classification probabilities are constant throughout the study. In\nreality, classification probabilities are likely to vary with several\ncovariates. Failure to account for such heterogeneity can lead to bias in\nparameter estimates. 2. Here we present a general multispecies distribution\nmodel that accounts for heterogeneity in the classification process. The\nproposed model assumes a multinomial generalised linear model for the\nclassification confusion matrix. We compare the performance of the\nheterogeneous classification model to that of the homogeneous classification\nmodel by assessing how well they estimate the parameters in the model and their\npredictive performance on hold-out samples. We applied the model to gull data\nfrom Norway, Denmark and Finland, obtained from GBIF. 3. Our simulation study\nshowed that accounting for heterogeneity in the classification process\nincreased precision by 30% and reduced accuracy and recall by 6%. Applying the\nmodel framework to the gull dataset did not improve the predictive performance\nbetween the homogeneous and heterogeneous models due to the smaller\nmisclassified sample sizes. However, when machine learning predictive scores\nare used as weights to inform the species distribution models about the\nclassification process, the precision increases by 70%. 4. We recommend\nmultiple multinomial regression to be used to model the variation in the\nclassification process when the data contains relatively larger misclassified\nsamples. Machine prediction scores should be used when the data contains\nrelatively smaller misclassified samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 09:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at\nlaboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are\nproduced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic\npositrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment\ndemonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary\nproduction, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the\npositron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross\nsection $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron\ndata. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ it is\nrequired to have $M=43$ TeV and $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s\nwhile for $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle = 3\\times\n10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate\ngamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites\nof the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation\ncross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper\nlimits derived with the non-detection of $\\gamma$ rays with HESS in the\ndirection of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of\ndwarf galaxies.

While onshore wind expansion faces public acceptance problems, for\noffshore wind the European Commission has introduced ambitious goals to\nincrease capacity from 15GW to 300GW in 2050. Incorporating more offshore wind\nelectricity into the power grid may offer a more widely accepted way to satisfy\nEurope's energy demand. In particular, the North Sea region has large potential\nfor offshore wind generation. However, to fully exploit the wind potential in\nthe North Sea, the grid integration of offshore wind and floating wind turbines\nare vital, especially when onshore wind capacity and onshore grid expansion are\nconstrained. For the grid integration, a meshed offshore grid can offer a\nviable alternative to the standard direct connection of offshore wind parks to\nthe nearest point on land combined with point-to-point HVDC connections. In\nthis paper, we investigate the benefits of having a meshed offshore grid in the\nNorth Sea and considering floating wind besides fixed-bottom wind\ninstallations.

This typically leads to\nsignificant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we\ncompute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed,\nthey themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a\nlower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence.

The idea is that many computational problems admit\n``natural'' guarantees bringing to algorithmic questions whether a better\nsolution (above the guarantee) could be obtained efficiently. The above\nguarantee paradigm has led to several exciting discoveries in the areas of\nparameterized algorithms and kernelization. We argue that this paradigm could\nbring forth fresh perspectives on well-studied problems in approximation\nalgorithms. Our example is the longest cycle problem. One of the oldest results\nin extremal combinatorics is the celebrated Dirac's theorem from 1952. Dirac's\ntheorem provides the following guarantee on the length of the longest cycle:\nfor every 2-connected n-vertex graph G with minimum degree \\delta(G)\\leq n/2,\nthe length of a longest cycle L is at least 2\\delta(G). Thus, the ``essential''\npart in finding the longest cycle is in approximating the ``offset'' k = L - 2\n\\delta(G). The main result of this paper is the above-guarantee approximation\ntheorem for k. Informally, the theorem says that approximating the offset k is\nnot harder than approximating the total length L of a cycle. In other words,\nfor any (reasonably well-behaved) function f, a polynomial time algorithm\nconstructing a cycle of length f(L) in an undirected graph with a cycle of\nlength L, yields a polynomial time algorithm constructing a cycle of length\n2\\delta(G)+\\Omega(f(k)).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 10:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the\nfirst use of deep learning for multiband signal fusion. The proposed network,\ncalled kR-Net, employs a hybrid, dual-domain complex-valued convolutional\nneural network (CV-CNN) to fuse multiband signals and impute the missing\nsamples in the frequency gaps between subbands. By exploiting the relationships\nin both the wavenumber domain and wavenumber spectral domain, the proposed\nframework overcomes the drawbacks of existing multiband imaging techniques for\nrealistic scenarios at a fraction of the computation time of existing multiband\nfusion algorithms. Our method achieves high-resolution imaging of intricate\ntargets previously impossible using conventional techniques and enables finer\nresolution capacity for concealed weapon detection and occluded object\nclassification using multiband signaling without requiring more advanced\nhardware. Furthermore, a fully integrated multiband imaging system is developed\nusing commercially available millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars for efficient\nmultiband imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 10:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

The proxy loss functions may or may\nnot align well with the original non-differentiable objective.

We\nshow that, after thermalization, the expectation values of both the (squared)\ncurrent and osmotic velocities approach the same stationary value, that is,\neach of the Bohmian kinetic and quantum potential energies approaches half of\nthe Orthodox kinetic energy.

Depending on the degree of polydispersity, there is\nan optimum value of M = M0 where we show that the mutual information of the\nsystem increases. However, surprisingly the correlation between a recently\nproposed SOP and the dynamics is highest for M = 1. This effect increases with\npolydispersity. We find that the SOP at M = 1 is coupled with the particle\nsize, {\\sigma}, and this coupling increases with polydispersity and decreases\nwith an increase in M . Careful analysis shows that at lower polydispersity the\nSOP is a good predictor of the dynamics. However, at higher polydispersity, the\ndynamics is strongly dependent on {\\sigma}. Since the coupling between the SOP\nand {\\sigma} is higher for M = 1 thus, it appears to be a better predictor of\nthe dynamics. We also study the Vibrality an order parameter independent of\nstructural information. Compared to SOP, at high polydispersity we find\nVibrality to be a marginally better predictor of the dynamics. However, this\nhigh predictive power of Vibrality, which is not there at lower polydispersity,\nappears to be due to its stronger coupling with {\\sigma}.

These\nexpressions allow one to estimate the rates taking into account simultaneously\nelastic (coherent) and inelastic (incoherent) channels of DM particle\ninteraction with nuclei. The nonzero nuclear excitation energies are used in\nthe calculation of the inelastic scattering contributions. A strong correlation\nbetween the excitation energy and the recoil energy of the excited nucleus\nlimits the possibility of the inelastic channel detection with a number of\nnuclei. Together with the standard model of the DM distribution in the Galaxy\nsome models are considered, which allow higher speeds of the DM particle. As\nthe nuclear recoil energy, TA, increases, the dominance of the elastic\ninteraction channel is smoothly replaced by the dominance of the inelastic one.\nTherefore, if a detector is set up to detect only elastic scattering events, it\nstarts to lose capability of seeing anything. The only way to notice the\ninteraction remains the gamma radiation from the deexcitation of the nucleus.\nIn the case of spin-independent DM interaction, as TA increases, the inelastic\ncontribution quickly dominates. If the DM particle interacts only\nspin-dependently, the detectors focused on registration of the elastic\nspin-dependent DM signal will see nothing, since the signal goes through the\ninelastic channel. It looks like the desired DM interaction could have a\nnoticeable intensity, but the DM detector is unable to detect it. Therefore, a\nsetup aimed at the direct DM detection should register two signals. The first\nis the nuclear recoil energy and the second is the gamma-quanta with a certain\nenergy from the target nucleus deexitation. The experiment will provide the\ncomplete information about the DM interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 11:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Specifically, near-field synthetic aperture\nradar (SAR) imaging, a method for generating high-resolution images by scanning\na radar across space to create a synthetic aperture, is of interest due to its\nhigh-fidelity spatial sensing capability, low cost devices, and large\napplication space.

Accurate and long-term monitoring of\nbirds to identify species of concern while measuring the success of\nconservation interventions is essential for ecologists. However, monitoring is\ntime consuming, costly and often difficult to manage over long durations and at\nmeaningfully large spatial scales. Technology such as camera traps, acoustic\nmonitors and drones provide methods for non-invasive monitoring. There are two\nmain problems with using camera traps for monitoring: a) cameras generate many\nimages, making it difficult to process and analyse the data in a timely manner;\nand b) the high proportion of false positives hinders the processing and\nanalysis for reporting. In this paper, we outline an approach for overcoming\nthese issues by utilising deep learning for real-time classi-fication of bird\nspecies and automated removal of false positives in camera trap data.

While the A\nbranch consists mostly of WDs with H-rich atmospheres, the B branch is not\ncompletely understood. Although invoked to be populated mainly by He-rich WDs,\nthe B branch overlaps a $\\sim 0.8M_\\odot$ evolutionary track with a pure He\nenvelope, fact that would imply an unexpected peak in the WD mass distribution.\nIn cold He-rich WDs, it is expected that the outer convective zone penetrates\ninto deep C-rich layers, thus leading to a slight C contamination in their\nsurfaces at $\\sim 10,000$K. Here we aim at studying the Gaia bifurcation as the\nnatural consequence of C dredge-up by convection in cold He-dominated WDs.\nRelying on accurate atmosphere models, we provide a new set of evolutionary\nmodels for He-rich WDs employing different prescriptions for the C enrichment.\nOn the basis of these models, we made a population synthesis study of the Gaia\n100pc WD sample to constrain the models that best fit the bifurcation. Our\nstudy shows that He-rich WD models with a slight C contamination below the\noptical detection limit can accurately reproduce the Gaia bifurcation. We refer\nto these stars as stealth DQ WDs because they do not exhibit detectable C\nsignatures in their optical spectra, but the presence of C in their atmosphere\nproduces a continuum absorption favouring the emission in bluer wavelengths,\nthereby creating the B branch of the bifurcation. Also, we show that the mass\ndistribution for He-rich WDs obtained when a stealth C contamination is\nconsidered is consistent with the mass distribution for H-rich WDs and with the\nstandard evolutionary channels for their formation. We conclude that stealth DQ\nWDs can account for the lower branch in the Gaia bifurcation.

These excitons can be fully localized within a single TMD layer, or\nthe electron- and the hole-component of the exciton can be charge-separated\nover multiple TMD layers. Such intra- or interlayer excitons have been\ncharacterized in detail using all-optical spectroscopies, and, more recently,\nphotoemission spectroscopy. In addition, there are so-called hybrid excitons\nwhose electron- and/or hole-component are delocalized over two or more TMD\nlayers, and therefore provide a promising pathway to mediate charge-transfer\nprocesses across the TMD interface. Hence, an in-situ characterization of their\nenergy landscape and dynamics is of vital interest. In this work, using\nfemtosecond momentum microscopy combined with many-particle modeling, we\nquantitatively compare the dynamics of momentum-indirect intralayer excitons in\nmonolayer WSe$_2$ with the dynamics of momentum-indirect hybrid excitons in\nheterobilayer WSe$_2$/MoS$_2$, and draw three key conclusions: First, we find\nthat the energy of hybrid excitons is reduced when compared to excitons with\npure intralayer character. Second, we show that the momentum-indirect\nintralayer and hybrid excitons are formed via exciton-phonon scattering from\noptically excited bright excitons. And third, we demonstrate that the\nefficiency for phonon absorption and emission processes in the mono- and the\nheterobilayer is strongly dependent on the energy alignment of the intralayer\nand hybrid excitons with respect to the optically excited bright exciton.\nOverall, our work provides microscopic insights into exciton dynamics in TMD\nmono- and bilayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 13:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

In that flow state, the vertically coherent\nvortices, which support HTE by Ekman pumping at smaller $Ra$, dissolve into\nvertically decorrelated structures in the bulk, such that the enhancing effect\nof Ekman pumping and the influence of the boundary layer ratio become small.\nAdditionally, more heat leaks out of the Ekman vortices as the fraction of\nthermal dissipation in the bulk increases. We find that the rotation induced\nshearing at the plates helps to increase the thermal dissipation in the bulk,\nand thus acts as a limiting factor for HTE at large $Ra$: beyond a certain\nratio of wall shear stress to vortex strength, the heat transport decreases\nirrespectively of the boundary layer ratio.

When a system of learning\nagents is not constrained to homogeneous policies, individual agents may\ndevelop diverse behaviors, resulting in emergent complementarity that benefits\nthe system. Despite this feat, there is a surprising lack of tools that measure\nbehavioral diversity in systems of learning agents. Such techniques would pave\nthe way towards understanding the impact of diversity in collective resilience\nand performance. In this paper, we introduce System Neural Diversity (SND): a\nmeasure of behavioral heterogeneity for multi-agent systems where agents have\nstochastic policies. %over a continuous state space. We discuss and prove its\ntheoretical properties, and compare it with alternate, state-of-the-art\nbehavioral diversity metrics used in cross-disciplinary domains. Through\nsimulations of a variety of multi-agent tasks, we show how our metric\nconstitutes an important diagnostic tool to analyze latent properties of\nbehavioral heterogeneity. By comparing SND with task reward in static tasks,\nwhere the problem does not change during training, we show that it is key to\nunderstanding the effectiveness of heterogeneous vs homogeneous agents. In\ndynamic tasks, where the problem is affected by repeated disturbances during\ntraining, we show that heterogeneous agents are first able to learn specialized\nroles that allow them to cope with the disturbance, and then retain these roles\nwhen the disturbance is removed. SND allows a direct measurement of this latent\nresilience, while other proxies such as task performance (reward) fail to.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 13:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

As these tensors are highly complex, most are not\nwell understood. Thus, the analysis and the visualization process form a highly\nchallenging task. In order to solve this problem a suitable tensor\ndecomposition for arbitrary tensors is desirable. Since many real-world\nexamples are described in the three-dimensional space, this paper will also\nfocus on this space. Tensors of order zero and one are well understood and for\nsecond order tensors the well-known spectral decomposition exists. However,\nthere is no standard decomposition for tensors of order higher than two. This\nwork will focus on summarizing facts about the deviatoric decomposition and on\nits calculation in a recursive way. It decomposes a tensor of arbitrary order\ninto a sum of orthogonal, irreducible parts. Thus, into parts that are\northogonal and invariant under rotation. These irreducible parts are based on\nso-called deviators. The calculations and results of the deviatoric\ndecomposition are not broadly understood in the engineering community. To\nchange this situation, information about this decomposition from a range of\nliterature sources was gathered and will be summarized and explained in this\nwork to make further analysis possible.

The study shows that the numerical instability and\nill-conditioning inherent in plane wave-based Trefftz methods can be\neffectively overcome with regularization techniques, provided there exist\naccurate approximations in the form of expansions with bounded coefficients.\nWhenever the target solution contains high Fourier modes, propagative plane\nwaves fail to yield stable approximations due to the exponential growth of the\nexpansion coefficients. Conversely, evanescent plane waves, whose modal content\ncovers high Fourier regimes, are able to provide both accurate and stable\nresults. The developed numerical approach, which involves constructing\nevanescent plane wave approximation sets by sampling the parametric domain\naccording to a probability density function, results in substantial\nimprovements when compared to conventional propagative plane wave schemes.

A recent work, called UGS, extended LTH to prune graph neural networks\n(GNNs) for effectively accelerating GNN inference. UGS simultaneously prunes\nthe graph adjacency matrix and the model weights using the same masking\nmechanism, but since the roles of the graph adjacency matrix and the weight\nmatrices are very different, we find that their sparsifications lead to\ndifferent performance characteristics. Specifically, we find that the\nperformance of a sparsified GNN degrades significantly when the graph sparsity\ngoes beyond a certain extent. Therefore, we propose two techniques to improve\nGNN performance when the graph sparsity is high. First, UGS prunes the\nadjacency matrix using a loss formulation which, however, does not properly\ninvolve all elements of the adjacency matrix; in contrast, we add a new\nauxiliary loss head to better guide the edge pruning by involving the entire\nadjacency matrix. Second, by regarding unfavorable graph sparsification as\nadversarial data perturbations, we formulate the pruning process as a min-max\noptimization problem to gain the robustness of lottery tickets when the graph\nsparsity is high. We further investigate the question: Can the \"retrainable\"\nwinning ticket of a GNN be also effective for graph transferring learning? We\ncall it the transferable graph lottery ticket (GLT) hypothesis.

If the inputs defining the submodular\nfunction are known, then existing algorithms can be used. In many applications,\nhowever, inputs have been observed to have social biases that reduce the\nutility of the output subset. Hence, interventions to improve the utility are\ndesired.

Without loss of accuracy, a reduction in\ncomputation cost can be achieved by integrating geometry representation and\nsolution approximation into a single framework using the Isogeometric Analysis\n(IGA) paradigm. In this study, we propose an IGA framework suitable for\nechocardiogram data of cardiac mechanics, where we show the advantageous\nproperties of smooth splines through the development of a multi-patch\nanatomical model.

The ratio of the total number of marked\nsimplices and the total number of bisected simplices is bounded from above.\nBinev, Dahmen and DeVore proved under a certain initial condition a bound that\ndepends only on the initial triangulation.

In this context, Structural Health\nMonitoring (SHM) arises as an especially interesting field to integrate and\ndevelop these new sensing capabilities, given the criticality of structural\napplication for human life and the elevated costs of manual monitoring. Due to\nthe scale of structural systems, one of the main challenges when designing a\nmodern monitoring system is the Optimal Sensor Placement (OSP) problem. The OSP\nproblem is combinatorial in nature, making its exact solution infeasible in\nmost practical cases, usually requiring the use of meta-heuristic optimization\ntechniques. While approaches such as genetic algorithms (GA) have been able to\nproduce significant results in many practical case studies, their ability to\nscale up to more complex structures is still an area of open research. This\nstudy proposes a novel quantum-based combinatorial optimization approach to\nsolve the OSP problem approximately, within the context of SHM. For this\npurpose, a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model formulation\nis developed, taking as a starting point the modal strain energy (MSE) of the\nstructure. The framework is tested using numerical simulations from two\nrelevant structures: a multi-story shear building and a Warren truss bridge.\nThe results obtained using the proposed framework are compared against\nexhaustive search approaches to verify their approximation ratios. More\nimportantly, a detailed discussion of the current limitations of the technology\nand the future paths of research in the area is presented to the reader.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 01:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-16"}

While such\nsystems may have some control over the internal dynamics that make up this\nprogression, a challenge for many is to regulate behaviour under what are often\nhighly variable external environments acting as system inputs. In this work, we\nstudy a simple analogue of this problem through a linear multicompartment model\nsubject to a stochastic input in the form of a mean-reverting\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process, a type of Gaussian process.

Semi-analytical results demonstrate that feedback and\nfeedforward loops can enhance system robustness, and simulation results probe\nthe intractable problem of the first passage time distribution, which has\nspecific relevance to eventual cell lysis in the viral replication cycle.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the smoothing seen in the process is a consequence\nof the discreteness of the system, and does not manifest in an equivalent\ncontinuum limit description.
